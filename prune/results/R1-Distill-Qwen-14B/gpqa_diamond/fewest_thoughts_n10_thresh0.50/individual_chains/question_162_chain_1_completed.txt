Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let me try to think through this.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric, right? It's expressed in terms of x and y, which are coordinates on some manifold. The question is about the area of a pseudosphere. I remember that pseudospheres are solutions to the Einstein field equations in certain cases, like when the energy-momentum tensor is zero—so vacuum solutions. But wait, area calculation... Oh right, in general relativity, the area of a sphere (or a hypersurface) can be found using the metric.

Wait, a pseudosphere is a type of solution in 2+1 dimensions, I think. Or maybe it's a surface in higher dimensions? I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering a 2-dimensional pseudosphere, but perhaps a 2-sphere in some metric.

Wait, the metric given is in two dimensions, because it's a function of x and y with dx² + dy². So maybe this is a 2-dimensional spacetime? Or perhaps it's a spatial metric embedded in a higher-dimensional space? Hmm, but the question is about the area, which is a volume in 2D. So maybe the metric is for a 2-sphere, and I need to compute its area.

Wait, the question says pseudosphere of radius r=2. So I'm trying to find the area. Area of a sphere in 2D is circumference, but wait, no. Wait, a sphere in 3D has surface area 4πr². But in 2D, a circle has circumference 2πr. But the term "pseudosphere" can be tricky. Wait, in 2+1 dimensions, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature, like a hyperbolic space.

But let's get back to the metric. The metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let me write this as ds² = [32/(4 - (x² + y²))] (dx² + dy²). So the denominator is 4 minus the square of the radius in 2D, right? So when x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, making the metric singular. So the coordinate x² + y² must be less than 4.

Wait, but the radius is given as r=2. So 4 is (2)^2, so maybe the radius of the sphere is related to this 4 in the denominator. Hmm. Wait, perhaps this metric is describing a 2-sphere of radius 2, but with some scaling.

Wait, the standard metric for a 2-sphere is usually written in spherical coordinates as ds² = R² (dθ² + sin²θ dφ²), where R is the radius. But here, the metric is expressed in terms of x and y, which suggests perhaps it's a coordinate system where x and y are like polar coordinates or something.

Wait, alternatively, maybe x and y are part of a 3D embedding, but the metric is only for a 2D surface. Hmm, perhaps this is a flat metric scaled by some function? Or maybe it's a conformally flat metric.

Wait, the given metric is conformally flat because it's a multiple of dx² + dy². So in 2D, the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal, g is the product of the coefficients of dx² and dy². So in this case, the coefficient is 32/(4 - x² - y²) for both dx² and dy². So the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))².

Wait, but the area element would be sqrt(g) dx dy, which in this case is sqrt( (32/(4 - r²))² ) dx dy, since x² + y² = r². So sqrt(g) = 32/(4 - r²), right? Because the square root of (something squared) is the absolute value, but since 4 - r² is positive (because r² <4), it's positive.

So the area element dA is [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy. But to compute the total area, I need to integrate this over the region where r² <4. Wait, but that's a problem because as r approaches 2, the denominator goes to zero, making the area element blow up. Hmm, but does it actually converge?

Wait, the integral would be in polar coordinates, right? So let's change variables to r and θ. So x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy = r dr dθ. So the area element becomes [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ. So the total area A would be the integral over θ from 0 to 2π, and r from 0 to 2.

So A = ∫ (0 to 2π) dθ ∫ (0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute the radial integral first. Let u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → (-du/2) = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [32/(u)] * (-du/2) → which is (32/2) ∫ (from 4 to 0) du/u. Wait, but flipping the limits, it's (16) ∫ (0 to 4) du/u = 16 [ln u] from 0 to4.

But ln u as u approaches 0 is negative infinity. So ln(4) - ln(0) → ln(4) - (-infty) → which is infinity. So the integral diverges. So the total area is infinite.

Wait, but wait a minute. The question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. So if the area is infinite, that would mean option D is the answer.

But why is the area infinite? The pseudosphere, which is a surface of constant negative curvature, does have infinite area. Or wait, no, maybe not. Wait, in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a disk of radius r grows exponentially with r, so for a pseudosphere (which is like a hyperbolic space), the area would be finite for a given r but if r approaches the boundary (like in the metric given, where r approaches 2), the area would go to infinity.

Wait, the metric given: denominator is (4 - x² - y²) = (4 - r²). So when r approaches 2, the metric blows up. So perhaps the metric describes a hyperbolic plane or something similar.

Wait, for a hyperbolic plane, the metric is usually written as ds² = dr² + (a² / cosh²(r/a)) dθ² or similar forms, but this metric is different. Alternatively, maybe it's conformally flat with a specific function.

Wait, but the key point is that when I computed the area integral, it diverges. So that would suggest that the area is infinite. Looking at the options, option D is +infty.

But wait, why is the pseudosphere considered here? Because perhaps in this metric, the coordinate range is such that the area is actually finite. Or perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the radius. Oh, the radius is given as r=2, but in the metric, the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²) = 4 - r². So when r=2, that denominator becomes zero. So perhaps the sphere is at r=2, but the metric is only defined up to r=2. So the area is the integral from 0 to 2, which, as I saw, diverges.

Wait, but in the case of a sphere in flat space, the area would be finite because the metric doesn't blow up except at the boundary. But if the metric blows up at r=2, maybe the sphere is at r=2, and the area is undefined or infinite.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is not representing a sphere but some other surface.

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. So perhaps the pseudosphere has infinite area. Therefore, the answer is D) +infty.


The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which is conformally flat in two dimensions. The task is to compute the area of a pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\). 

To calculate the area, the metric's determinant is used to find the area element. Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant \(g\) is the product of the coefficients of \(dx^2\) and \(dy^2\), which is 

\[
g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

The area element is then 

\[
dA = \sqrt{g} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\(x = r \cos\theta\), \(y = r \sin\theta\)), the area element becomes 

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area \(A\) is obtained by integrating over the region \(0 \leq r < 2\) and \(0 \leq \theta < 2\pi\):

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

The radial integral is evaluated using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), which transforms the integral into 

\[
\int_4^0 \frac{32}{u} \cdot \frac{-du}{2} = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral of \(1/u\) diverges as \(u \to 0\), leading to 

\[
A = \infty.
\]

This divergence indicates that the area of the pseudosphere is infinite. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
