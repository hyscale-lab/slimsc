Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's read through it again.

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, wait, the wavelengths at which they appear brightest would be their peak emission wavelengths, right? That's probably related to their temperatures via Wien's Law.

Wien's Law says that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, they must have the same temperature. Because λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both, their temperatures T are the same.

But wait, the question says they have the same wavelength at which they appear brightest. So same T? So T1 = T2.

Wait, but then the next part. The radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Oh, right, radial velocity is the speed at which the star is moving towards or away from us. But how does that affect the observed wavelength? Oh, that's the Doppler effect. So if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, and if moving away, redshifted.

But wait, the problem says they found the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So their emitted wavelengths (in rest frame) would be the same, but if one is moving, the observed wavelength would shift. But the question states that the observed wavelengths are the same. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no, let me re-read that part. "Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. But if the stars are moving, their rest frame λ_max would differ because of Doppler shift.

Wait, but if the observed λ_max is the same, that would imply that their rest frame λ_max is the same? Or maybe not. Because if Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, its observed λ_max would be shifted. But the observed λ_max is same as Star_1's, which has zero velocity. Star_1's observed
