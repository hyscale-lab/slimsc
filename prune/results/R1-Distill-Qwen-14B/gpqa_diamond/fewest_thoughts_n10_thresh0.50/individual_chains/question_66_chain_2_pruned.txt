Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that extends the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension, like dimension 6, 8, etc. But wait, I'm not 100% sure about the details.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. Let me think about each one.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I remember that in the Standard Model, all interactions respect Lorentz symmetry because the particles transform under the Lorentz group, like spinors for fermions and vectors for bosons. SMEFT is an effective theory built from the SM, so I think the operators must also respect Lorentz symmetry. Otherwise, the theory would be inconsistent in terms of how particles move and interact, right? So Lorentz symmetry is a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like shifting space and time). Wait, but the SMEFT is a field theory, which by definition respects Poincare symmetry because fields transform covariantly. But wait, the question is about the operators. So, when you write down the SMEFT Lagrangian, it's supposed to be invariant under Poincare transformations. So all operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are required.

Wait, but waitâ€”wait. Poincare is a bigger symmetry group that includes Lorentz and translations. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected, so both might be required. Or is it that if the theory already respects Poincare, then Lorentz is automatically okay? Hmm. I'm a bit confused here.

Let me think again. The SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory because, well, the SM is Lorentz-invariant and SMEFT is an extension. So all operators must be Lorentz scalars. But what about Poincare? Since the theory is a field theory, the Poincare symmetry is also part of the framework. So perhaps the operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare? Or is Poincare automatically satisfied if the theory is Lorentz-invariant and translation-invariant? Hmm, maybe I should think that all terms in the Lagrangian are required to be Poincare invariant, but each operator must be a Lorentz scalar. But wait, the Poincare group includes translations, so the Lagrangian is allowed to have terms that are divergence of something or other, but wait, the Lagrangian density itself must be a scalar under Lorentz and translation invariant. So each operator is a Lorentz scalar, and their combination in the Lagrangian is a Poincare invariant.

So for the operators themselves, they must be Lorentz scalars. So the operators must be invariant under Lorentz transformations. But the fact that the full Lagrangian respects Poincare symmetry is a separate thing. Wait, but does each operator individually need to respect Poincare? Or can they just be part of a larger expression that's Poincare invariant? I think each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, but not necessarily invariant
