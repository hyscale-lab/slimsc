Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible, so I don't need to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I'm supposed to find the minimum energy of this system in Joules, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, okay. So, I'm thinking this has to do with electric potential energy because all the charges are either at a point or constrained at a fixed distance. Since the system is isolated, the energy should be the electric potential energy between all these charges.

Wait, the 13th charge is at point P. The other 12 are each at 2 meters from P. So each of those 12 is 2 meters away from the 13th charge. But also, they're 2 meters from point P, but what about the distance between the 12 charges themselves? Oh, wait, if all 12 are constrained at the same point 2 meters from P, then the distance between any two of them would be... well, if they're all at the same point, their distance apart is zero? But that doesn't make sense because they can't occupy the same point. Maybe they're arranged in a sphere or something, all at 2 meters from P but not necessarily at the same point as each other. But wait, the problem says "constrained to stay at 2 m from P." So maybe each of the 12 is at 2 meters from P, but their exact positions relative to each other aren't specified.

But for the minimum energy, I think we need to arrange the charges in a way that minimizes the potential energy. But wait, actually, potential energy for like charges is minimized when they're as far apart as possible. But if they're constrained to a fixed distance from P, perhaps the configuration is a sphere around P with all 12 charges on the surface, each at 2 meters. But that's probably not necessary for the calculation since all that matters is their distance from P and the 13th charge.

Wait, but since the 12 charges are all at 2 meters from P, and the 13th is at P, each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the 13th. So each of these 12 charges contributes to the potential energy with the 13th.

But also, the 12 charges are next to each other. So the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges also contributes. So the total potential energy is the sum of all pairwise interactions.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Because electric potential energy is a state function; it depends only on the configuration, not on how you get there. So the minimum energy configuration would be the most stable one, which for like charges is when they're as far apart as possible. But in this case, they're constrained to 2 meters from P. So perhaps we need to arrange the 12 charges as far apart as possible on the surface of the sphere of radius 2 m
