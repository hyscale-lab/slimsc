Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics question, and I'm a bit new to the concepts, but I'll give it my best shot. The question is about which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences—like when calculations result in infinite values, which don't make physical sense. So, the idea is that regularization helps to make these infinities manageable so that you can subtract them away (renormalization), leading to finite, physical results.

Wait, but which theories actually need this regularization? Let me think about each option.

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). I recall that QED is a quantum field theory that deals with electrons and photons. It's a renormalizable theory, which means that even though it has divergences, they can be handled with regularization and renormalization. So QED does require regularization because of these divergences. So option C is out because the question asks which theory never requires it.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, dealing with quarks and gluons. I'm pretty sure that QCD also has issues with divergences, especially at high energies. Wait, but wait—QCD is asymptotically free, meaning that the coupling becomes weaker at high energies. But does that mean it requires regularization? I think so. Because even though the behavior is different than, say, electromagnetism at
