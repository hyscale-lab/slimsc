Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's read it carefully. The question says that astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/distance, but wait, actually, the formula I remember is that distance (in parsecs) is 1 divided by the parallax in arcseconds. So distance r = 1/plx, which means plx = 1/r.

So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Substituting plx with 1/r, that would make N proportional to 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that. 1 divided by (1/r)^5 is the same as (r^5). Because (1/r)^5 is r^-5, so 1 over that is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5?

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up the variables. The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. So, perhaps it's not just the number proportional to r^5, but how the number increases as you go to a unit change in r.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the density of stars as a function of distance. Because the number of stars you observe could depend on how many are present along the line of sight. So perhaps integrating over the volume? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Another approach: if the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and since plx is 1/r, substituting gives N ‚àù r^5. So as distance r increases, the number of stars increases as r^5. But that seems really high. Like, why would the number of stars increase so rapidly with distance? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the relation.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of stars per unit volume. Or maybe it's the number of stars observed in a given region as a function of distance. Wait, why would the number go up with distance? Normally, you'd expect that beyond a certain distance, there might be fewer stars observed because they are too faint, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering a specific region, so it's not about the
