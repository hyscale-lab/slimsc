Okay, I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem. Let's take it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay, which is given as c·S. 

So, first, I need to understand what each part of the operator is. The constant c is h/(4π). Then, S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). I think S looks like this:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

Wait, wait. Oh, wait, no, the first row is (0, -i), so row one is [0, -i], and row two is [i, 0]. So S is that matrix. 

Now, Ay is c multiplied by S. So, c is h/(4π), so Ay = (h/(4π)) * S. So, the matrix Ay would be:

Ay = h/(4π) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

But maybe it's easier to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors without factoring in c first. Let's see.

The problem states that Ay has the form c·S, and we're to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Since S is a 2x2 matrix, Ay is 2x2 as well.

Eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0.

So, let
