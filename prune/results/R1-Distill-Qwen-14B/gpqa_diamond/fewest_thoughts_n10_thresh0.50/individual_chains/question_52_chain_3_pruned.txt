Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The question gives me some data: the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, but when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. They're looking at the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2), and they notice that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Angstroms, which is in the near-ultraviolet range.

The question is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So, I need to find the ratio when there are no spots divided by the ratio when there are spots. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm. I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the distribution of atoms between different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which the problem states. The Boltzmann equation relates the populations of two energy levels as a function of temperature.

The Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E is the energy difference, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the problem is about the ratio n1/n2, right? Because the question says the ratio of level 1 to level 2 decreases when spots are present. So, when there are spots, n1/n2 is lower than when there are no spots. Or wait, no: if the ratio (n1/n2) decreases, that means n1/n2 is smaller when there are spots. So, when the star has spots, the ratio is lower than when it doesn't. So the ratio without spots is higher.

Wait the question says: when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So the ratio (n1/n2) with spots is lower than without. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = some number.

So, without spots, the ratio is higher, and with spots, it's lower.

But wait, the observed ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two levels is n1/n2. So when the star is spotted, n1/n2 decreases. So without spots, the ratio is higher.

But what affects this ratio? The temperature, because it's in LTE. So the ratio depends exponentially on the temperature.

Let me think. The ratio n1/n2 is inversely proportional to the Boltzmann factor. Because n2/n1 is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)), so n1/n2 is proportional to exp(ΔE/(kT)).

Wait, correct me: if I have n2/n1
