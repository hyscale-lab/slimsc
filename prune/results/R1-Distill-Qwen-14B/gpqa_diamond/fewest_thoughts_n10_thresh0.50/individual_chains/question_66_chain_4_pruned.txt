Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Hmm. I remember that in physics, symmetries are crucial because they dictate the form of the laws of nature. So, for a theory to be consistent, its operators must respect certain symmetries.

Wait, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetry? Oh right, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. But in SMEFT, which is a field theory, the operators are local, so they must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. Or is that not necessarily the case? Or maybe Poincare isn't a separate symmetry here because SMEFT is formulated in a way that already includes it?

Wait, SMEFT is an effective theory based on the Standard Model, which itself respects Lorentz symmetry. So all its operators should obey Lorentz symmetry. But what about Poincare? Well, because the theory includes translations (since it's a field theory in spacetime), Poincare symmetry is automatically included. So the operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. Or wait, maybe Poincare isn't a separate condition because it's already implied when you have a Lorentz-invariant theory with translations. So if the operators are Lorentz
