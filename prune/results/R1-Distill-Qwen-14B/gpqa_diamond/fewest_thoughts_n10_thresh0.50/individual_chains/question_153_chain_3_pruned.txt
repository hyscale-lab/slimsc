Okay, so I've got this question about the Michael addition reaction, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question describes three different Michael addition reactions and asks about the products. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one. 

Let me start by recalling what the Michael reaction is about. The Michael addition is a 1,4-addition of a nucleophile (like an enolate) to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The enolate acts as a nucleophile, attacking the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, leading to a new carbon-carbon bond formation. The product is a conjugate addition product, which is usually more substituted and more stable.

So, the three reactions are:

1. Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt and EtOH.
2. Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with MeOH and H3O+.
3. Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one with KOH and H2O to give 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, wait, the first line of the question says that when a nucleophile attacks the Î²-carbon and the attacking species is enolate, the reaction is the Michael reaction. So, the reactions given are all Michael additions.

Let me tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with Reaction A: dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

I remember that dimethyl malonate is a good enolate donor. Under basic conditions, like NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH, the malonate would deprotonate to form an enolate. The enolate would then attack the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (the acrylate in this case) in a conjugate addition.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure: the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the substituents are in the E configuration. Wait, no, wait: the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, and the substituents on either side of the double bond are a p-tolyl group and a methyl group (since it's 3-substituted). Alternatively, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be something like CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOR? No, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me draw it out mentally.

Wait, the correct structure for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, wait, the acrylate group is
