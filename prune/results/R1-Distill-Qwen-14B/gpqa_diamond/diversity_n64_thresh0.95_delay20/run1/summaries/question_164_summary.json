The ratio of the total masses is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{M_{\\text{total,1}}}{M_{\\text{total,2}}} = \\frac{1.5M_2}{1.6667M_2} = \\frac{1.5}{1.6667} \\approx 0.9\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Adjust for Orbital Periods\nUsing Kepler's third law, the orbital period relates to the total mass and the separation distance. The separation distance for each system can be derived from the radial velocity amplitudes:\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{vP}{2\\pi}\n\\]\n\nFor system_1:\n\\[\na_1 = \\frac{10 \\cdot 2}{2\\pi} = \\frac{10}{\\pi}, \\quad a_2 = \\frac{5 \\cdot 2}{2\\pi} = \\frac{5}{\\pi}, \\quad a_{\\text{system,1}} = a_1 + a_2 = \\frac{15}{\\pi}\n\\]\n\nFor system_2:\n\\[\na_1 = \\frac{15 \\cdot 1}{2\\pi} = \\frac{15}{2\\pi}, \\quad a_2 = \\frac{10 \\cdot 1}{2\\pi} = \\frac{10}{2\\pi} = \\frac{5}{\\pi}, \\quad a_{\\text{system,2}} = a_1 + a_2 = \\frac{25}{2\\pi}\n\\]\n\nThe ratio of separations is:\n\\[\n\\frac{a_{\\text{system,1}}}{a_{\\text{system,2}}} = \\frac{\\frac{15}{\\pi}}{\\frac{25}{2\\pi}} = \\frac{15 \\cdot 2}{25} = \\frac{30}{25} = 1.2\n\\]\n\nUsing the relationship:\n\\[\n\\frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2} = \\left(\\frac{a_{\\text{system,1}}}{a_{\\text{system,2}}}\\right)^3 \\cdot \\frac{M_{\\text{total,2}}}{M_{\\text{total,1}}}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( P_1 = 2 \\, \\text{years}, P_2 = 1 \\, \\text{year} \\), and \\( \\frac{a_{\\text{system,1}}}{a_{\\text{system,2}}} = 1.2 \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{2^2}{1^2} = (1.2)^3 \\cdot \\frac{M_{\\text{total,2}}}{M_{\\text{total,1}}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4 = 1.728 \\cdot \\frac{M_{\\text{total,2}}}{M_{\\text{total,1}}}\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\( \\frac{M_{\\text{total,1}}}{M_{\\text{total,2}}} \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{M_{\\text{total,1}}}{M_{\\text{total,2}}} = \\frac{4}{1.728} \\approx 2.3148\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nSystem_1 is approximately **0.43 times** as massive as system_2, meaning it is less massive. The closest option to this value is **A) ~0.4**.\n\nAnswer: A"
