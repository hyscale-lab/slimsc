As N becomes very large, the polygon approximates a circle with radius a. The diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is characterized by the zeros of the Bessel function J1. The first two zeros of J1 are at approximately 3.8317 and 7.0156. Using these values, the angles for the first and second minima are calculated as follows:\n\nFor the first minimum:\n\u03b81 = (3.8317 * \u03bb) / (2\u03c0a) \u2248 0.61 \u03bb/a.\n\nFor the second minimum:\n\u03b82 = (7.0156 * \u03bb) / (2\u03c0a) \u2248 1.116 \u03bb/a.\n\nThe angular distance between the first two minima is:\n\u0394\u03b8 = \u03b82 - \u03b81 \u2248 (1.116 - 0.61) \u03bb/a \u2248 0.506 \u03bb/a.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: D**"
