Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question involves spin states and operators, right?

So first, the state vector |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Since it's proportional, I guess I need to normalize it first. The normalization involves finding the magnitude squared of each coefficient and adding them up, then taking the inverse square root to get the normalization factor.

The coefficients are (1+i) for |up> and (2-i) for |down>. Let's calculate their magnitudes. The magnitude of (1+i) is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), so squared it's 2. For (2-i), it's sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 +1)=sqrt(5), so squared is 5. So the total squared magnitude is 2 +5=7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7)|up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7)|down>.

Wait, no, actually, the original state is proportional, so the coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). The normalization factor is 1 over sqrt( (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) ). Let me compute that again.

(1+i)(1-i) = 1 -i^2 = 1 -(-1) =2. (2-i)(2+i)=4 +2i -2i -i^2= 4 -(-1)=5. So yeah, sum is 7, so normalization is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2-i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Next, the operator in question has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So the matrix is 2x2 for spin-½ particles, since |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-component.

Wait, the operator matrix would look like this:
[ 0, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]
Because when i≠j, it's hbar/2, and diagonal elements are zero.

Hmm, what's this operator? Oh wait, because in the standard spin
