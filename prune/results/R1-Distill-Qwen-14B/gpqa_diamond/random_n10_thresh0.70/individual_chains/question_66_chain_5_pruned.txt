Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to think this through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), CP symmetry (3), and CPT symmetry (4). The choices given are combinations of these.

Wait, wait. First, I need to remember what each of these symmetries entails.

Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. So the laws of physics shouldn't change when you switch between different inertial reference frames. SMEFT is an effective theory, so I think it should still respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model. The Standard Model includes Lorentz symmetry, so SMEFT operators must respect that.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like shifting space and time). So that's the full symmetry of Minkowski spacetime. But wait, in effective field theories, aren't they typically formulated in a way that respects Poincare symmetry? Because EFTs are usually local, right? But wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory valid below the Planck scale, I think. So operators should respect Poincare symmetry as well.

Wait, but the question is about what "must" be respected by all operators. Oh, but wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translation symmetries. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected, not the other way around. So if an operator respects Poincare, it already includes Lorentz. But if the question is about which are required, then perhaps both are required.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. SMEFT is built by adding operators to the Standard Model, but these operators should form a theory that's consistent. So in terms of symmetries, I think that SMEFT must respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model. The Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry, Poincare, and CPT symmetry. Wait, but does it respect CP and C?

Wait, the Standard Model is known to not respect CP symmetry. Because of the CKM mechanism leading to CP violation. So CP isn't a symmetry of the Standard Model, so SMEFT wouldn't need to respect that either. But wait, wait.
