Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?

Hmm, the options are A to D, with energies in eV. I remember that the energy-time uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (ΔE) and the time uncertainty (Δt) is at least on the order of ħ (hbar), which is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s.

Wait, but time here is given as the lifetime of the states. So the uncertainty in time, Δt, is the lifetime of each state. Oh wait, but wait—both states have different lifetimes. Or is the question considering the time resolution required to distinguish them?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The energy-time uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. So if the states have lifetimes τ1 and τ2, then their energy uncertainties would be ΔE1 ≈ ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2. But wait, the problem is about resolving two energy levels, so perhaps we need the energy difference between them to be much larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or maybe just each of their uncertainties?

Wait, no, when you have two states with different energies, to resolve them, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than the combined energy uncertainty of both states. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't tell them apart.

Wait, no, perhaps each state has its own uncertainty. So the uncertainty in E1 is ħ/τ1, and the uncertainty in E2 is ħ/τ2. But to distinguish E1 and E2, the difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if |E2 - E1| is less than ΔE1 + ΔE2, then you can't resolve them.

So let me write that down. So, the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1 must satisfy ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, but no—actually, each state has its own lifetime and thus its own uncertainty. But when measuring, the measurement time would affect how accurately you can determine the energy. So perhaps the total uncertainty in the measurement is the sum of the uncertainties from each state? Or is it the maximum of the two?

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the uncertainty principle in another way. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that the product of the energy uncertainty and the time over which you observe must be greater than or equal to ħ/2. So, to measure the energy precisely, you need to have a long enough measurement time.

But in this problem, the lifetimes are given as τ1 and τ2. So maybe the uncertainty in each energy is ΔE = ħ/(τ), where τ is the lifetime.

So, for E1, ΔE1 = ħ/τ1, and for E2, ΔE2 = ħ/τ2.

So to distinguish E1 and E2, their energy difference must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties. So ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Let me compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

But wait, the values are given in seconds. Let me compute the energy uncertainties in eV. Because ħ is in J·s, I'll need to convert that to eV·s.

I know that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So, 1 J = 1/(1.602e-19) eV. So ħ is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s. Converting that to eV·s:

ħ ≈ 1.05e-34 J·s * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) ≈ (1.05e-34) / (1.602e-
