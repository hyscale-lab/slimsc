Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem gives a reaction scheme involving several compounds: A to E. I need to find out what compound E is. The options are four different ketones, I think. Let's go through each step.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form B. Hmmm, HCN is a nucleophile. So maybe A has a carbonyl group because HCN typically adds to carbonyls. For example, if A is a ketone, adding HCN would give a cyanohydrin. But wait, when a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin which is a secondary alcohol with a CN group adjacent. But I'm not sure yet.

2. Compound B is then reduced with H2 and Pd. That sounds like a hydrogenation reaction. So if B has a triple bond or a double bond, Pd/H2 would reduce it. Alternatively, if B has a nitrile group, maybe it gets reduced to an amine? Wait, but H2 with Pd as a catalystâ€”common reductions are of triple bonds to single (like alkynes to alkanes), or maybe ketones to secondary alcohols. Wait, but B comes from A + HCN. So if A is a ketone, B would be a cyanohydrin (a secondary alcohol with CN next to it). Then, when you reduce B with H2 and Pd, what happens? Well, the secondary alcohol (OH) could get reduced. Oh wait, but Pd is usually for hydrogenation. Wait, maybe B has a double bond. Let me think again. If A is a carbonyl, adding HCN would form a cyanohydrin, which has an -OH and a -CN group attached. Then, when B is hydrogenated, perhaps the double bond is hydrogenated. Wait, but wait, the cyanohydrin doesn't have a double bond. Oh, maybe I'm getting the steps wrong.

Wait, alternative approach: Let's track the IR data given. The problem mentions that the IR of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, so A is likely a ketone or maybe an aldehyde
