Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to find the minimum energy of a system involving charges. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand.

Alright, the setup is an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible, which probably means I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that—just focusing on electric potential energy.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed right at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system. The options are given, so I have to calculate it and pick the correct one.

Wait, so the 13th charge is at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. Since they're identical charges, all the interactions are between like charges, which means the potential energy will be repulsive and thus positive. But wait, the question is about the minimum energy. Wait, when do you get the minimum potential energy in such a system?

Oh, wait, no—usually, when you have charges arranged in a way that the potential energy is minimized, but in this case, the charges are fixed in position. Because the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So the system's configuration is fixed, which means the potential energy is fixed as well. So I don't need to think about minimizing the energy because they can't move closer or further apart. Hmm, but wait, the problem says "minimum energy." That's confusing me.

Wait, perhaps the 13
