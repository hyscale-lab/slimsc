Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with relativity yet. But let's take it step by step. The question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and we need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Alright, the problem states: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy.

Hmm, I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up like in classical mechanics. There's this formula for adding velocities. Oh right, the formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). Or wait, wait, which one is correct? Since they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference between their velocities. So, let me plug in the numbers.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Because v1 and v2 are in the same direction. So v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²) → (0.1c) / (1 - (0.3c²)/c²) → 0.1c/(1-0.3) → 0.1c/(0.7) → approximately 0.1428c. So that's about 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have this relative speed.

Now, the other part is the total energy of the system. Hmm, in relativity, the total energy isn't just the sum of the rest masses multiplied by c squared. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy. So the total energy E_total is gamma1 * m1 c² plus gamma2 * m2 c².

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me calculate gamma for each astronaut.

First astronaut: v = 0.6c. So v²/c² is (0.36c²)/c² = 0.36. So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64)=0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So his energy is gamma * m * c². But his mass is 2m. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: v=0.5c. v²/c²=0.25. 1 -0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75) is about 0.8660, but more accurately, sqrt(3/4) is (√3)/2 ≈ 0.8660. So gamma is 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

His mass is 3m. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464m c².

Adding them together: E_total = 2.5 m c² + 3.464 m c² = 5.964 m c². That approximates to 5.96 mc².

So looking at the options, option C says v_rel is 0.14c and E is 5.96 mc². Option D has E=5mc², which is lower, so probably not.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation. Did I compute the gamma factors correctly?

For the first astronaut: v =0.6c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2) ) = 1/sqrt(1-0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. Correct. So E1=1.25*(2m) c^2=2.5 mc². Correct.

Second astronaut: v=0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1-0.25)=1/sqrt(0.75)= approx 1.1547. So E2=1.1547 *3m c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964. So E=5.96 mc². So option C has this.

Wait, but option B says E=4.96 mc². How? Maybe I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me check again.

Wait, the problem says the astronauts have masses
