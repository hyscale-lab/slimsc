Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem states that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each giving a different energy value.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that the energy-time uncertainty principle is relevant here. The principle says that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least h-bar over 2π, which is a tiny number. Wait, more precisely, the formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ℏ/(2π), but sometimes people approximate it as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, depending on the exact formulation.

Wait, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, right? So ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But I'm not sure about the exact factors; sometimes I see it written as (ℏ/2π) for the uncertainty product. Oh wait, the energy-time uncertainty relation is often presented as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So that's the key.

So, the idea is that if the energy difference is too small, the two states won't be distinguishable because the uncertainty in the energy would be larger than the difference, making it impossible to tell them apart. 

In this problem, the lifetimes are given. Oh, wait, the lifetimes are the lifetimes of the states. So, each state has a certain lifetime, and the time uncertainty is related to that. I think for a state with a lifetime τ, the time uncertainty Δt is roughly on the order of τ. So for E1, Δt is about 1e-9 seconds; for E2, it's about 1e-8 seconds. But wait, which lifetime applies to the energy difference's lifetime?

Wait, the energy difference would persist for the duration of the measurement, but perhaps the time uncertainty here is the same as the lifetime of the state. Or perhaps the time uncertainty is the same as the time over which the energy is measured, which might be the same as the lifetime of either state. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference's lifetime is the difference between the two lifetimes? Not sure. Maybe I should think of the energy difference as being the transition between the two states, and the time associated with that would be the inverse of the frequency of the emitted photon, which ties into the energy difference.

Wait, but the question is about distinguishing the two energy levels. So maybe we need to find the minimum energy difference such that the uncertainty in energy is less than the energy difference. So for each state, we compute the uncertainty in energy given their lifetime, and then the energy difference should be larger than that uncertainty. Or perhaps it's the uncertainty from the longer lifetime that's the issue?

Wait, no. Let's think again. The energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 needs to be such that the measurement can distinguish them. For each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE ≥ ℏ/(Δt). So, for each state, the uncertainty is inversely proportional to their lifetime. 

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between the two states. How does the uncertainty come into play here? Hmm.
