Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question talks about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. The goal is to find the energy difference that would allow us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A through D.

Hmm, okay, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It says that there's a fundamental limit to how precisely certain pairs of physical properties can be known. One of the key applications is the energy-time uncertainty relation. The formula I recall is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

Wait, but I think in many contexts, people use ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt, ignoring the 1/2 factor because the exact value isn't critical for order-of-magnitude estimates. So the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime (which is the time uncertainty). That makes sense because a shorter lifetime means a less precise measurement of energy.

So the idea here is that for each energy level, the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime. If the energy difference between the two states is much larger than the uncertainties, then they can be distinguished. But if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the states might not be resolvable.

Let me think about each state. The first has a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds. Let's compute the uncertainty in energy for that. Similarly, the second has 10^-8 seconds.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between the two states. So, we need to ensure that the energy difference is larger than the combined uncertainties of both states? Or do we compare it to each individually?

No, wait, actually, each state's energy has its own uncertainty. The energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties, or perhaps each state's uncertainty contributes. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think again.

Suppose E1 has a lifetime τ1, so ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1. Similarly, E2 has τ2, so ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2. The energy difference ΔE = |E2 - E1|. For them to be distinguishable, ΔE must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties, I think. Or wait, maybe each state's ΔE is the uncertainty in its own energy, so the difference ΔE must be larger than each of these uncertainties. Or perhaps the combined uncertainty is the sum of the two.

Wait, maybe the key is that the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in each state's energy. Because if the difference is bigger than each individual uncertainty, then they are resolved. Because each energy level's uncertainty is about how accurately you can measure it. So if E2 is bigger than E1 by more than each of their individual uncertainties, you can tell them apart.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty associated with the measurement time. But I'm a bit confused about how the uncertainties add up here.

Let me try to approach this step by step.

First, calculate the energy uncertainty for each state.

The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But since the options are in eV, I should convert this into eV·s.

Wait, 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 joules. So ħ in eV·s would be ħ * (1 eV / 1.60218e-19 J) = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) * (1 eV / 1.60218e-19 J) ≈ (1.0545718e-34) / (1.60218e-19) eV·s. Let's compute that.

Dividing 1.05457e-34 by 1.60218e-19:

1e-34 / 1e-19 = 1e-15. So 1.05457 / 1.60218 ≈ 0.658. So approximately 0.658e-15 eV·s, which is 6.58e-16 eV·s.

So ħ ≈ 6.58e-16 eV·s.

So for each state, the energy uncertainty is ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.

For τ1 = 1e-9 seconds:

ΔE1 = 6.58e-16 eV·s / 1e-9 s = 6.58e-7 eV.

That's 6.58e-7 eV, which is about 0.658 microeV.

For τ2 = 1e-8 seconds:

ΔE2 = 6.58e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.58e-8 eV.

So, the uncertainty for the first is about 1e-6 eV (since 6.58e-7 is close to 1e-6), and the second is about 1e-8 eV.

Wait, so the two energy levels' uncertainties are ΔE1 ≈ 6.58e-7 eV and ΔE2 ≈ 6.58e-8 eV.

Now, the energy difference between E2 and E1 (assuming E2 > E1) must be larger than the sum of these uncertainties, perhaps?

Wait, no. Because the energy difference is between E2 and E1, and each has their own uncertainty. To resolve them, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties of each measurement, perhaps.

Wait, no. Because each energy has its own uncertainty. If the difference between E2 and E1 is much greater than each of their uncertainties, then it's clear. Alternatively, the difference should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties to ensure they are separate.

Hmm, let's think of it in terms of error bars on the energies. If E1 is measured with an uncertainty of ΔE1 and E2 with ΔE2, then the two levels can be distinguished if the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1 is greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2. Because then, the error ranges don't overlap.

So, for the energy difference to be clearly resolved, ΔE should be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

In our case, ΔE1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is about 6.58e-8 eV. So summing them gives approximately 6.58e-7 + 0.658e-7 = 7.24e-7 eV.

So, the energy difference should be larger than 7.24e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV → definitely smaller than 7.24e-7. So no.

Option B: 1e-11 eV → even smaller. No.

Option C: 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → which is much larger than 7.24e-7 eV (which is 0.724e-6 eV). So yes, this is much bigger.

Option D: 1e-8 eV → 0.01e-6 eV → still smaller than 7.24e-7 eV.

Wait, wait. 1e-8 is 0.01e-6, which is 0.01 microeV. 7.24e-7 is 0.724 microeV. So 0.01 is less than 0.724. So option C is 1e-4 eV which is 100 microeV, way bigger.

So the correct answer would be option C, because the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties, which is about 7.24e-7 eV. Only option C is larger than that.

Wait, but let me think again. The energy difference should be larger than the individual uncertainties. Because if it's larger than each, then it's definitely larger than the sum. Because, for example, the sum is 0.658e-7 + 0.0658e-7 = 0.723e-7. So, if the energy difference is larger than, say, 0.723e-7, then the energies can be distinguished.

Looking at the options, only C (1e-4 eV) is larger. So that's the correct option.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Because the numbers are a bit small.

Wait, let me re-calculate the uncertainties.

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = 6.58e-16 eV·s / 1e-9 s = 6.58e-7 eV.

ΔE2 = 6.58e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.58e-8 eV.

Sum: 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = (6.58 + 0.658) * 1e-7 = 7.238e-7 eV.

So about 7.24e-7 eV.

So the energy difference ΔE must be greater than 7.24e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 → 0.001e-6 → no.

B) 1e-11 → no.

C) 1e-4 → 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV → which is 1e-4 * 1e6 μeV = 100 μeV. Wait, wait, 1e-4 eV is 1e-4 * 1e6 μeV? No wait, 1 eV = 1e6 μeV, right? So 1e-4 eV is 0.1 μeV? No, wait:

Wait, 1 eV is 1,000,000 μeV (since μ is 1e-6). So 1e-4 eV is 1e-4 * 1e6 μeV = 100 μeV.

And 7.24e-7 eV is 0.724 μeV. So 100 μeV is way bigger, so option C is larger.

So the energy difference needs to be at least approximately 0.724e-6 eV (7.24e-7 eV) to be distinguishable. So the only option that is larger is C) 1e-4 eV.

So the correct answer is C.


To determine the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates energy and time as:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant. For order-of-magnitude estimates, we approximate:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t}.
\]

Here, \( \Delta t \) corresponds to the lifetime of each state. The lifetimes of the two states are \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). Using \( \hbar \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \), the energy uncertainties for the two states are:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{6.58 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{6.58 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.58 \times 10^{-7} + 6.58 \times 10^{-8} = 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, we compare this threshold with the given options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it cannot resolve the energy levels.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so it also cannot resolve the energy levels.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 100 \, \mu\text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). It satisfies the condition for resolving the energy levels.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it cannot resolve the energy levels.

The only option that satisfies the condition is **C**.
