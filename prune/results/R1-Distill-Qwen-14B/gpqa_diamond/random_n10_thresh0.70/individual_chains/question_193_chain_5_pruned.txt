Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, parallax is a measure of distance—larger parallax means closer stars, right? Because parallax is inversely proportional to distance.

Wait, the formula I remember is that distance (in parsecs) is 1 divided by parallax (in arcseconds). So, if parallax (plx) increases, the distance decreases. But in this problem, the number of stars is varying with parallax as 1/plx^5. So, the number of stars (N) is proportional to 1/(plx)^5.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So I need to relate this to distance (r). Since distance r is proportional to 1/plx, because r = 1/plx. So plx = 1/r.

Let me substitute that into the equation. If N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, substituting plx as 1/r gives N proportional to 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me calculate that. 1/( (1/r)^5 ) equals r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. Wait, but that would mean the number of stars increases rapidly with distance. That doesn't make sense because as you look further away, you should see more stars, but only up to a point. Wait, no, actually, wait: if you go to a larger distance, then each shell at distance r would have more stars. Hmm, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe I made a substitution error.

Wait, let's think again. N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/r, then 1/(plx) is r. So 1/(plx)^5 is (r)^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but wait. The question is about how the number of stars changes per unit range of distance. So, maybe it's about the number of stars per unit distance. Because if N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r would be something like proportional to r^5 * 4πr² dr (if considering volume), but wait, that varies. Hmm, maybe I need to think of it as the number per unit distance.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me restate: the
