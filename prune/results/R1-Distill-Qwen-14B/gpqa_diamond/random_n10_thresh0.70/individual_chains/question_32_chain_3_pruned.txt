Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is given as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium, right? So lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6, since the atomic number is 3 and the mass number is 3 + 3 = 6. So the nucleus is a lithium-6 nucleus.

The problem is asking for the total energy of the nucleus in the collider. I remember that in particle physics, when you're dealing with relativistic speeds, you have to use the relativistic energy equations. So the energy of a particle is given by the total energy, which is gamma times the rest mass energy.

Gamma (γ) is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity. The formula for gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since the speed v is 0.96c, I can plug that into the formula.

Let me calculate gamma first. So v is 0.96c. Plugging into gamma:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96c)^2/c^2 )
The c^2 terms cancel out, so inside the sqrt we have 1 - (0.96)^2.

0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 minus 0.9216 is 0.0784. Then sqrt of 0.0784 is 0.28. Wait, let me double-check that: 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me calculate that more accurately. 1/(0.28) is 3.57142857... So approximately 3.5714.

Now, the total energy is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. The rest mass energy is the rest mass of the nucleus multiplied by c squared. But since we're working in units where c is considered, perhaps the rest mass is given in terms of atomic mass units, and we'll convert that to GeV.

Wait, what's the rest mass of Li-6? Let me think. The atomic mass of Lithium-6 is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). Because each proton is about 1 u, each neutron also about 1 u. So 3 protons and 3 neutrons sum to 6 u. But wait, the exact mass of a nucleus is a bit less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons due to binding energy. But for this problem, perhaps we're to approximate it as 6 u. Or maybe the exact value is needed. Hmm, I think I should check the exact mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass in terms of the atomic mass unit converted to GeV. I know that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c², so 1 GeV is 1e3 MeV. So 1 u is
