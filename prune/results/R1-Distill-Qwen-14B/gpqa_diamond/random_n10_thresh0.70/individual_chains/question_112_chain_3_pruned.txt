Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The problem starts by describing the state of an electron as |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh wait, since it's proportional, I'll probably need to normalize it. Yeah, because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors should have a norm of 1. So my first thought is to calculate the normalization factor.

The eigenstates |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so they form an orthonormal basis. That means the inner product of |up> and |down> is zero, and each has a norm of 1. So to normalize |alpha>, I'll compute the inner product of the given vector with itself and then take the square root of that to find the normalization constant.

Let me write that out. The state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, so the inner product is (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i). Wait, no, actually, the inner product is the sum of the squares of the moduli of the coefficients. Because the basis vectors are orthogonal.

Wait, no, wait. The inner product of |alpha> with itself is (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i). Because |a|^2 + |b|^2, where a and b are the coefficients. Because the basis vectors are orthogonal, so cross terms vanish.

Calculating each term: (1+i)(1-i) = 1 - i^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2. Similarly, (2-i)(2+i) = 4 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) =5. So the total is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the actual state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Okay, that's the state. Now, the problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator whose matrix is Aij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise.

Wait, so the matrix A is 2x2 because the state is in a two-dimensional space. Let me write down matrix A:

For a 2x2 matrix, when i≠j, Aij = hbar/2. So:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
      [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, so it's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. Interesting. So what does this operator represent?

Hmm, this A looks like it's proportional to the Pauli X matrix. Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], and here A is (hbar/2) * X. So the operator A is (hbar/2) σ_x.

Wait, I think Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, so the eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of A as well. So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of σ_x. So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, where |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Or maybe it's the other way around; I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact definitions, but I know that σ_x's eigenstates are superpositions of the |up> and |down> states.

So the question is, what's the probability of measuring the eigenvalues of A when the state is |alpha>? Since the operator A has eigenvalues, say, λ_1 and λ_2, and we're to find the probabilities of measuring each.

Alternatively, since A is a Hermitian operator, its eigenstates form a basis. So the state |alpha> can be expressed as a linear combination of the eigenstates of A, and the coefficients squared give the probabilities.

So the plan is:

1. Find the eigenstates of A.
2. Express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates.
3. The square of the coefficients gives the probabilities.
4. Then, compute the average value of A, which is the expectation value <A>.

Alternatively, since A is (hbar/2) σ_x, perhaps I can compute the expectation value using the expectation value of σ_x for the state |alpha> and then multiply by hbar/2.

Wait, maybe that's easier. Let's think about the expectation value. The expectation value of A is <alpha| A |alpha>.

But perhaps it's easier to compute <σ_x> and then multiply by hbar/2.

So let's first compute <σ_x>. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the expectation value is <alpha| σ_x |alpha>.

Alternatively, since |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of σ_z, perhaps we can express σ_x in terms of |up> and |down> and compute the expectation value.

Alternatively, another approach is to express |alpha> in the σ_x basis (i.e., the eigenbasis of A), find the expansion coefficients, then the probabilities are the squares of the moduli, and the expectation value would be the weighted sum of the eigenvalues.

Either way, let's proceed.

First, let me find the eigenstates of A. Since A = (hbar/2) σ_x, the eigenstates are the same as σ_x's. So, the eigenstates are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, I'm not sure about the exact signs and normalization, but I think that's correct.

Wait, when you have σ_x, its eigenvalues are +1 and -1. So |+x> is the eigenvector with eigenvalue +1 and |-x> with -1.

So, the eigenvectors are:

For +1: |+x> = 1/sqrt(2) (|up> + |down> )
For -1: |-x> = 1/sqrt(2) (|up> - |down> )

Wait, wait, I might have that reversed. Let me check.

The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, when we multiply σ_x by |+x>, which is (1,1)/sqrt(2), we get (1,1)/sqrt(2) because σ_x swaps the basis vectors.

Wait, σ_x acting on |up> is |down>, and on |down> is |up>. So when you act on (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), you get (|down> + |up>)/sqrt(2) = same as the original. Hence, it's an eigenstate with eigenvalue +1.

Similarly, (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) will have eigenvalue -1, because σ_x acting on |up> is |down>, and on |down> is |up>. So σ_x (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) = (|down> - |up>)/sqrt(2) = (-1)(|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So eigenvalue is -1.

So yes, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of A, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Let me write |alpha> as:

|alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>

Then, the probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Alternatively, I can compute c_+ and c_- by taking the inner product of |alpha> with |+x> and |-x>.

So, let's compute c_+:

c_+ = < +x | alpha >

Similarly, c_- = < -x | alpha >

Given |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Let me compute < +x | alpha >.

< +x | is (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| )

So,

c_+ = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] |alpha>

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|up> + (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|down> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) <down|up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) <down|down> ]

But <up|down> = 0 and <down|up> = 0, and <up|up> = <down|down> =1.

So, c_+ = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

= (1/sqrt(2) * 1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ]

Simplify numerator:

(1 + 2) + (i -i) = 3 + 0i =3.

So c_+ = (3) / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) ) = 3 / sqrt(14).

Similarly, compute c_- = < -x | alpha >.

< -x | = (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| - <down| )

So,

c_- = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| alpha> - <down| alpha> ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|up> - (2 - i)/sqrt(7) <down|down> ]

= (1/sqrt(2) * 1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ]

Simplify numerator:

(1 - 2) + (i + i) ) = (-1) + (2i) = -1 + 2i.

So c_- = ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14).

Now, the probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Compute |c_+|^2:

|3/sqrt(14)|^2 = (9) /14 = 9/14 ≈0.642857.

Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 0.64, which is close to 9/14 (≈0.642857). Option D has 0.61, which is about 9/14. Wait, 9/14 is 0.642857, so option A says 0.64. Option D is 0.61. So perhaps option A is a candidate, but let me proceed.
