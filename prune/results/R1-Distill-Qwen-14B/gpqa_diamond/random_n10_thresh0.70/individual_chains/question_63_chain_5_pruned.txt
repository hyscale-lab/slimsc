Okay, so I've got this question about the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Hmm, I remember that this model considers both the rotation and vibration of diatomic molecules. The question is about a molecule in its fundamental state and what photon momentum is needed for it to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Let me break down what I know. The molecule is diatomic, made of elements X and Y. The masses are given: Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The options are all different momenta in N*s.

First, I need to figure out what the "fundamental state" is. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state. So the molecule is currently in the lowest possible energy state. When a photon is absorbed, the molecule moves to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I guess that means the first excited state.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, for rotation and vibration, the energy levels are quantized. For a diatomic molecule, the rotation and vibration are treated as separate modes. So the total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies.

The fundamental state would be the lowest state of both rotation and vibration. The next state could involve either a change in rotation or vibration, but I think the question is referring to the transition to the next energy level overall, which might be the next vibrational state or the next rotational state.

Wait, but in the non-rigid rotor model, perhaps the molecule's vibration and rotation are considered together. Or maybe it's the rigid rotor model, which is different. Wait, the question says non-rigid, so it's the more accurate model where the bond length can change, which affects the moment of inertia.

In any case, when a molecule absorbs a photon, it's usually a transition between energy levels. The photon's energy must match the energy difference between the initial and final states.

So the question is about the momentum of the photon. But wait, photons have energy E = hf, and momentum p = E/c. So knowing the energy change would let us find the momentum.

But what's the energy difference between the initial (fundamental) state and the next state? The initial state is the ground state for both rotation and vibration. The next state could be the next vibrational state or a higher rotational state. I think, for a diatomic molecule, the vibrational energy levels are quantized
