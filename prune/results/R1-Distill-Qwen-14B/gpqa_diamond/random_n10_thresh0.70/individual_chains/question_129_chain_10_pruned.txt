Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem is about a series of reactions starting from compound A and ending up with compound E. The question is to identify E based on the given reactions and hints. There are four options provided.

Let me break down the reactions one by one:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to give compound D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are two hints provided:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting ylides with aldehydes or ketones. So if A reacts with a ylide to form that product, A must be a carbonyl compound.

b) The IR spectra show that A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, which is typical for a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde). E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1, which is a bit lower but still in the carbonyl range. Maybe a ketone as well, but perhaps a cyclic ketone or something else that affects the carbonyl stretching frequency.

Now, let's think about each step.

First reaction: A + HCN → B. HCN adds to carbonyl groups. So if A is a ketone or aldehyde, B would be the cyanohydrin. Wait, but for a ketone, HCN adds to form a cyanohydrin, which would be a geminal diol with a CN group attached? Or wait, no, HCN adds to the carbonyl to form a compound where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced with an -OH and -CN group, but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, it could be that the carbonyl is converted into an alcohol and a nitrile group. Wait, no, isn't the addition of HCN to a ketone typically forming a cyanohydrin, which is a 1,2-diol structure where the carbonyl becomes a diol with a nitrile adjacent? Or wait, perhaps it's a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached. Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the reaction of a carbonyl with HCN: for a ketone R2C=O, adding HCN would give R2C(OH)CN. So the product would be a cyanohydrin, which is a secondary alcohol with the nitrile group attached. So B would be a secondary alcohol with a CN group adjacent to the OH? Or wait, no: the product is R2C(OH)CN. So the structure is R2C(OH)–CN. So it's a cyanohydrin, where the ketone becomes a 1,2
