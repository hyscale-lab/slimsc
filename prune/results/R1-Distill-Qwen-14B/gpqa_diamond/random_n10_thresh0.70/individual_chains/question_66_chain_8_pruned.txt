Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT, and the symmetries that operators in it must respect. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model (SM) plus higher-dimensional operators. These operators are added with coefficients that are dimensionful to make the theory valid up to some high energy scale.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. Let me think about each of these.

First, what's the deal with Lorentz symmetry? I remember that SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory. All the operators, whether they are the SM terms or the added higher-dimensional ones, must be scalars under the Lorentz group. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must. So option 1 is a yes.

Next up is Poincare symmetry. Wait, isn't Poincare symmetry just a combination of Lorentz and translation symmetries? Since the SM already respects Poincare, and SMEFT is an effective theory built from it, I think SMEFT must also respect Poincare. So option 2, Poincare symmetry, is also a symmetry that must be respected.

Now, what about CP symmetry? The SM doesn't respect CP in general. For example, the CKM matrix in quark mixing leads to CP violation. So SMEFT operators can potentially violate CP as well. Wait, but do all SMEFT operators have to respect CP? No, I think CP violation is allowed. So operators don't necessarily need to conserve CP. So option 3, CP symmetry, is not a required symmetry that must be respected by all operators.

Lastly, CPT symmetry. I remember that in quantum field theory, CPT is a fundamental symmetry. It combines charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. The SM respects CPT, and since SMEFT is an effective theory of the SM, all its operators must conserve CPT. So option 4, CPT symmetry, must be respected.

Putting it all together, the symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So the correct options are 1, 2, and 4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So the answer should be C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an effective theory that extends the Standard Model (SM) by including higher-dimensional
