Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium... Right, in a medium like glass, the speed isn't c. Oh right, the formula is v = c/n. So normally, if the glass isn't moving, the light's speed would be c/n. But here, the glass is moving. So how does that affect things?

I remember something about the velocity addition formula from special relativity, but wait, is that applicable here? Because the glass is moving at a constant velocity, which implies we're in an inertial frame. So maybe I should be using the velocity addition formula. But wait, the problem is about the speed of light, which is tricky because in relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame.

Wait, but that's in a vacuum. Here, the light is moving through a medium, the glass. So maybe relativity doesn't directly apply here. Or does it? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about it from the perspective of the medium. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving, and the light is moving through it. So the speed of light in the medium (glass) is c/n in the medium's rest frame. But how does that
