Okay, so I've got this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the parallax (plx) in arcseconds is inversely proportional to the distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax range. So I guess it's about how many stars you'd see for a given change in parallax. Since stars are uniformly distributed, they're spread out evenly in space, I suppose. So as you look further away (lower parallax because parallax decreases with distance), the volume you're looking at increases.

Wait, volume scales with distance cubed. Because volume is distance cubed, right? So if you have a sphere of radius d, the volume is (4/3)πd³. So the number of stars in a volume should be proportional to the volume. But how does that translate into parallax?

Parallax plx is 1/d, so d is 1/plx. So if I change plx by a unit, say from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding change in distance? Let's think about it. If plx is small, like near the star, then dplx is a small change. But for larger plx (closer stars), the distance is smaller, so a unit change in plx would mean a larger change in distance.

Wait, maybe I should model it. Let's say I have two parallax values, plx and pl
