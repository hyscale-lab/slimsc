Okay, I'm faced with this quantum mechanics question, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's take it step by step.

So the question is about the density matrix of a qubit. The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Hmm, I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Pure states are described by density matrices that are projectors (like |ψ><ψ|), but mixed states are statistical ensembles, so their density matrices are more complicated.

Wait, the given ρ looks like it's a mixture of |0> and |1>. So each term is a projector, and each has a coefficient of 1/2. Oh right, that means it's a classical mixture, like a 50-50 chance between the two basis states. So this state is a maximally mixed state for a qubit.

Now the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are vectors in 3D space, which probably relates to the Bloch sphere representation. Right, the Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. For a pure state |ψ>, the Bloch vector goes from the origin to a point on the unit sphere. But for a mixed state, like this density matrix, it's represented as a point inside the Bloch sphere.

So how do I get from the density matrix to the Bloch vector? I remember that the density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector components. Let me recall the formula. For a single qubit, the density matrix ρ can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (rx, ry, rz).

Let me write that out. The general form is:

ρ = (I + rx X + ry Y + rz Z) / 2,

where X, Y, Z are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given ρ, which is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, I need to see what this corresponds to in terms of the Pauli matrices.

Wait, let's compute |0><0| and |1><1| in terms of the Pauli matrices. The |0> state is (1, 0), and |1> is (0,1). So |0><0| is a diagonal matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So our ρ is (I)/2.

Wait, that's interesting. So ρ = I/2. So in the expression I gave earlier, that would mean that the terms with rx X, ry Y, and rz Z are all zero. Because I/2 is just the identity part. So I + r·σ = I, meaning r·σ must be zero. Therefore, r must be zero.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So that's the answer.

But wait, just to make sure, what's the significance of the zero vector in the Bloch sphere? Oh right, the origin in the Bloch sphere corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is the maximally uncertain state. Since each basis state is equally probable, it makes sense that this is the case.

So yeah, the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit, where the system is in a classical mixture of the two basis states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal probability \(1/2\). 

To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (X, Y, Z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), we note that \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\), meaning the terms involving \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are zero. This implies that \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to the origin in the Bloch sphere.

The origin in the Bloch sphere represents the maximally mixed state, which aligns with the given density matrix. Therefore, the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is \((0, 0, 0)\).

Answer: C
