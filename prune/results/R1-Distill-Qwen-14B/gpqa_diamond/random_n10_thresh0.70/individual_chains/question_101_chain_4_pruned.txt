Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and think about what's going on.

The question says that a student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to select the correct reagent A and catalyst B from the options given.

Hmm, let's break down what's happening. The starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine. Pyrrolidine is a five-membered amine ring, right? So 3-methyl would have a methyl group on the third carbon of the pyrrolidine ring.

The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. The cyclohexylidenemethyl part looks like a cyclohexene ring attached via a methylene group (–CH₂–), but wait, no. Wait, cyclohexylidene would be a cyclohexyl group where the substituent is attached to the ring via a double bond, right? So cyclohexylidenemethyl would be something like a vinyl group attached to the cyclohexane. Or maybe it's a cyclohexene ring, with the substituent attached to the ring via a double bond. Let me visualize this.

Wait, another way to think: the structure is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So, the pyrrolidine ring has a substituent at position 1. That substituent is cyclohexylidenemethyl. So CH₂–C(cyclohexyl)=CH₂? Or wait, maybe the substituent is a cyclohexene ring attached via a methylene group. Maybe it's cyclohexylmethylene: a cyclohexane ring connected by a CH₂ group that's part of a double bond. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, cyclohexylidene is an ene group. So, cyclohexylidenemethyl would be a cyclohexene ring with a methylene group attached. So the structure is a pyrrolidine ring with a substituent at position 1, which is a methylene group connected to a cyclohexene ring. So the substituent is -CH₂-Cyclohexene. But
