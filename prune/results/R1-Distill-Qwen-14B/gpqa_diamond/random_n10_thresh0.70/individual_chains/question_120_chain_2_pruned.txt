Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance in parsecs. So, a larger parallax means a closer star.

The question says the stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Wait, uniform distribution usually means that the number density is constant in space. So, if stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a certain volume should depend on the volume itself.

But parallax changes with distance. Let's think about how. Parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance. So, as distance increases, parallax decreases. So for a given range of parallax, like from plx to plx + dplx, how does the number of stars in that range depend on plx?

I'm trying to model this. Let's consider the distance corresponding to a parallax plx. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, a small change in parallax, say dplx, would correspond to a change in distance. Let me find how distance changes with parallax.

pl_x = 1/d => d = 1/pl_x. So, a small change in pl_x, dd = (d pl_x) would relate to d. Wait, no, pl_x is 1/d. So, if pl_x increases by d pl_x, then 1/d increases by d pl_x. Let's compute the change in d.

d pl_x = d(1/d) = -1/d² dd. Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's find the relationship between the change in parallax and the change in distance.

pl_x = 1/d. So, if pl_x increases by d pl_x, then d decreases. Let me express dd in terms of d pl_x.

We can write:

pl_x + d pl_x = 1/(d + dd)

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, since pl_x is inversely proportional to d, perhaps it's easier to express the volume in terms of pl_x.

Wait, the number of stars in a shell between distance d and d + dd would be proportional to the volume of that shell. The volume of a spherical shell is 4π r² dr. So, the number of stars in that shell is n * 4π r² dr, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume).

But since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number per unit volume is the same everywhere. So, if we think in terms of parallax, we can express r in terms of pl_x.

r = 1/(pl_x), so dr = -1/pl_x² d pl_x. Wait, let me see: pl_x = 1/r, so d pl_x = -1/r² dr → dr = - r² d pl_x. Since r is positive, the negative sign indicates that as pl_x increases, r decreases.

So, the volume element in terms of pl_x is 4π (1/pl_x)^2 * (d pl_x) * (r²). Wait, no, let me think again. The volume element when you change from r to pl_x.

Wait, the shell at distance r has a volume element of 4π r² dr. Since pl_x = 1/r, so r = 1/pl_x. So, substituting, the volume becomes
