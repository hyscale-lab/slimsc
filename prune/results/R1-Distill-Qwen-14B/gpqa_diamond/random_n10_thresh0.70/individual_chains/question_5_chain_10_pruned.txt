Okay, so I need to find the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So the operator P itself must be the vector sum of these components in the direction of n.

The direction vector n is in the x-z plane, so it's (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because any direction in x-z would have zero y-component. So, θ is the angle from the z-axis, I think. Or maybe from the x-axis? Wait, no, in standard spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the positive z-axis. So if n is in x-z plane, φ (azimuthal angle) would be 0 or π, but since it's arbitrary, maybe not. Wait, no, the direction is along an arbitrary line in x-z, so θ is some angle, and φ could be zero, but the eigenvector might not depend on φ because P is along n, which could be in any direction in x-z. Hmm, but the eigenvector should be determined by the direction.

The operator P is given by the vector P = (Px, Py, Pz), so the operator along direction n would be P·n, which is (n_x Px + n_y Py + n_z Pz). But since n is in x-z plane, n_y is zero, so P·n = n_x Px + n_z Pz.

But let me write down the matrices for each component.

Px is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
Py is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So the operator P·n would be (n_x * Px) + (n_z * Pz). Because n_y is zero.

Substituting the matrices:

n_x = sinθ (since n is in x-z, polar angle θ from z-axis), n_z = cosθ.

So P·n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute that matrix:

The (1,1) element is (ħ/2)(cosθ)
The (1,2) element is (ħ/2)(sinθ)
The (2,1) element is (ħ/2)(sinθ)
The (2,2) element is (ħ/2)(-cosθ)

So the matrix is:

[ [ (ħ/2) cosθ , (ħ/2) sinθ ],
  [ (ħ/2) sinθ , -(ħ/2) cosθ ] ]

We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is (P·n | ψ ) = (+ħ/2) |ψ>.

So, (P·n - (ħ/2) I) |ψ> = 0.

Let me write the matrix P·n - (ħ/2) I.

Subtracting (ħ/2) from the diagonal elements:

(ħ/2 cosθ - ħ/2) in top-left, ( - (ħ/2 cosθ) - (- ħ/2) ) in bottom-right?

Wait, no. Wait, the identity matrix I has 1s on the diagonal. So (P·n - λ I) would be P·n matrix minus λ times the identity matrix. So for each diagonal element:

(ħ/2 cosθ) - λ for (1,1)
( -(ħ/2 cosθ) ) - λ for (2,2)

Wait, no: the (2,2) element is - (ħ/2 cosθ), so when subtracting λ, it's - (ħ/2 cosθ) - λ.

Wait, let me compute each element.

The matrix P·n is:

Row 1: (ħ/2 cosθ, ħ/2 sinθ)
Row 2: (ħ/2 sinθ, -ħ/2 cosθ)

So when we subtract (ħ/2) I, which is [[ ħ/2, 0], [0, ħ/2 ]], we get:

Row 1:
(ħ/2 cosθ - ħ/2) , (ħ/2 sinθ)
Row 2:
(ħ/2 sinθ), ( - ħ/2 cosθ - ħ/2 )

Wait, no: for the second row, the original is -ħ/2 cosθ, subtracting λ= ħ/2 gives -ħ/2 cosθ - ħ/2.

So the matrix becomes:

[ [ (ħ/2)(cosθ -1), (ħ/2) sinθ ],
  [ (ħ/2) sinθ, (ħ/2)(-cosθ -1) ] ]

We can factor out (ħ/2) from each element, so it's (ħ/2) times:

[ [ cosθ -1 , sinθ ],
  [ sinθ , -cosθ -1 ] ]

For this matrix to have non-trivial solutions, the determinant must be zero.

But wait, since we're looking for eigenvectors, the matrix (P·n - λ I) must be singular, so determinant is zero.

But perhaps I should proceed to write the equations for the eigenvector.

Let the eigenvector be |ψ> = (a, b)^T.

Then, (P·n - (ħ/2) I ) |ψ> = 0.

So:

( (ħ/2)(cosθ -1) ) a + (ħ/2 sinθ) b = 0
(ħ/2 sinθ ) a + (ħ/2)(-cosθ -1 ) b = 0

We can factor out ħ/2 from each term:

[ (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0 ]
[ sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0 ]

Let's write these as two equations:

1) (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0
2) sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

We can take equation 1 and solve for a in terms of b.

From equation 1:

(cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b
=> a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

Hmm, a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b

But 1 - cosθ is 2 sin²(theta/2), and sin theta is 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So:

a = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) / ( 2 sin²(theta/2) ) ] b
= [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] b
= cot(theta/2) * b

So a = cot(theta/2) * b

Now, let's plug this into equation 2.

Equation 2: sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Substituting a = cot(theta/2) b,

sinθ * cot(theta/2) * b + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Let's compute sinθ * cot(theta/2):

We know that cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2)
And sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

So,

sinθ * cot(theta/2) = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] * [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ]
= 2 cos²(theta/2 )

So equation 2 becomes:

[2 cos²(theta/2) ] b + [ -cosθ -1 ] b = 0

Factor out b:

[ 2 cos²(theta/2) - cosθ -1 ] b = 0

But since b can't be zero (otherwise the eigenvector would be zero), the term in brackets must be zero.

So,

2 cos²(theta/2) - cosθ -1 = 0

Let me simplify this.

We know that cosθ = 2 cos²(theta/2) -1.

So substitute cosθ:

2 cos²(theta/2) - (
