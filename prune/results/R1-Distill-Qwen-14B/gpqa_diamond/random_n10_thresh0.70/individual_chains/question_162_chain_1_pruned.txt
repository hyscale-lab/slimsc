Okay, so I have this metric given and I need to find the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, wait, what's a pseudosphere again? Oh right, it's a surface of constant negative curvature, kind of like a saddle shape. But how does that relate to the metric?

The metric provided is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. So it's written in terms of x and y coordinates, which suggests it's in 2D. But how does this relate to the area of a pseudosphere?

Wait, pseudosphere is usually a 2-dimensional surface embedded in 3D, but maybe here we're considering it as a 2-manifold described by this metric. So the metric is on a 2D space, and the area would be the integral of the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor, integrated over the surface.

The metric tensor components are the coefficients for dx² and dy². So here, the metric is diagonal, with g_{xx} = g_{yy} = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant of the metric tensor is (32/(4 - x² - y²))².

The area A is the integral over the surface of sqrt(det g) dx dy. Since the metric is conformally flat (depends only on x² + y²), the integral might simplify.

Wait, but wait, the denominator is 4 - x² - y². So that means x² + y² <4. So the domain is a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane
