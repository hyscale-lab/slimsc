Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and quantum models. Hmm, I should probably start by understanding what the question is asking. 

The question is about a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. It says we're supposed to model this using the quantum rotation-vibration model, or the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the fundamental state... I think that refers to the lowest energy state. So the molecule is in its ground state, and we want it to go to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So that must involve a transition to the next energy level.

The problem gives me the masses of X and Y as 20 amu and 2 amu respectively. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The options are different momenta, so I need to calculate which one is correct.

I remember that in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels have contributions from both rotational and vibrational motion. But wait, the non-rigid rotor model is a bit different. Oh right, the rigid rotor model assumes the bond length is fixed, but the non-rigid considers bond vibrations, so maybe it's a more accurate model for real molecules.

So the energy levels for rotation and vibration are quantized. The photon absorption would cause a transition from one energy state to another. Since we're starting from the fundamental (ground) state, the next state would be the first excited state, which I think is the first energy level above the ground.

But I'm a bit confused about whether this transition is purely vibrational or involves rotation as well. In the quantum mechanical models, the energy is a sum of rotational and vibrational contributions. So the photon's energy should match the difference between two energy levels, considering both.

Wait, the photon's energy is given by E = h*f, where f is the frequency. Alternatively, since angular frequency is given, E = ħ * ω, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

But wait, the problem is about the momentum of the photon. Oh, right, because the photon has momentum p = E/c, since for a photon, E = pc (since their mass is zero). Wait, but I should confirm that. The momentum of a photon is p = E/c, yes. So E = pc. Alternatively, since E = ħω, then p = ħω/c.

Wait, but wait, is the energy difference just due to vibration or also rotation? Oh, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational energy state, but perhaps the rotational state is the lowest (like the ground rotational state). So the next state might involve a transition to the first vibrational excited state, or alternatively, the next rotational state. But the question says it's the next possible state with the lowest energy. Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous.

Wait, no. In the non-rigid rotor model, the overall energy is a combination of rotational and vibrational. But the energy levels are actually quantized for both. So each state is described by both vibrational and rotational quantum numbers.

The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be the ground state in both vibration and rotation. So the molecule is in the (v=0, J=0) state. The next lowest state would be the next state with the smallest
