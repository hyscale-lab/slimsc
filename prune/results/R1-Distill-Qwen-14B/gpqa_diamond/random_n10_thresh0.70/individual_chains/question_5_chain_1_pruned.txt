Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what it's asking.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. We are provided with the components of the operator P: Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvectors correspond to the possible states with definite values. The eigenvalues are the possible results of measuring that observable.

Wait, the operator in question is P, which I think is the momentum operator. But I'm not entirely sure, but I guess the specific operator isn't as important as knowing its components.

The direction n is along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. So, the direction can be represented by angles θ and φ, but since it's in the x-z plane, the angle φ (azimuthal angle) is zero, right? Because the y-component would be zero. So, φ is zero, meaning that the direction is in the x-z plane, making it a polar angle θ from the z-axis.

But wait, the eigenvector is along direction n. Oh, I think I need to find the eigenvector of the operator P in the direction n. Since P is a vector operator, the eigenvalue equation would involve the component of P along n.

Wait, maybe I should think about the operator along the direction n, which can be written as P·n̂, where n̂ is the unit vector in the direction n.

So, the operator P·n is equal to n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So, n is (n_x, 0, n_z), and since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

Alternatively, in spherical coordinates, since φ is zero, n_x = sinθ cosφ = sinθ (since φ=0), and n_z = cosθ. Wait, no, wait: in spherical coordinates, typically, x = sinθ cosφ, y = sinθ sinφ
