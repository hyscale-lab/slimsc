Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

Alright, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside this conductor, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and it's given that r is less than R. So, the cavity is entirely inside the conductor, right?

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity. Now, the question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and both l and L are greater than R. Also, the angle between l and s is theta.

The options are A to D, each giving a different expression for E.

Hmm, so I'm dealing with electrostatics, conductors, and cavities. I remember that conductors have some specific properties. Like, the electric field inside a conductor is zero when it's static. But wait, here the conductor is uncharged, and the charge q is inside the cavity. So how does that affect the fields?

I think about the concept of charge induction. When a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, it induces charges on the inner and outer surfaces. For an uncharged conductor, the total induced charge would be such that the inner surface has an induced charge equal and opposite to q, and the outer surface would have a net charge equal to whatever is on the conductor. But wait, the conductor itself was uncharged, so the outer surface's induced charge must exactly cancel the inner surface's charge? Or maybe I'm getting that mixed up.

Wait, the conductor is initially neutral. So when a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) will have an induced charge of -q. This leaves the outer surface with a charge of +q, because the total conductor must remain neutral (since it was initially uncharged). Wait, no: the conductor's initial charge is zero. The +q inside the cavity induces -q on the inner surface. So the total charge on the conductor must be zero, so the outer surface must have +q. Because the inner surface is -q, so the outer must be +q to balance.

But wait, the conductor is neutral, so the sum of all induced charges on it must be zero. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface must have +q to cancel that. Because the conductor's net charge is zero.

But wait, no, that's not right. The conductor is neutral, so the sum of the charges on the inner and outer surfaces must be zero. Because the conductor doesn't have any net charge. So if the inner surface has -q, then the outer surface must have +q. Because -q (inner) + +q (outer) = 0. Oh yeah, that makes sense.

So from the outside, the conductor behaves as if all the charge is concentrated at its center, because the outer surface's charge is distributed uniformly due to the spherical symmetry. Or wait, no, the charge on the outer surface would distribute itself uniformly if the conductor is a perfect sphere, but in this case, the cavity isn't at the center because it's separated by a distance s from the conductor's center. So does that affect the charge distribution on the outer surface?

Wait, no. Because the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface's charge will still be uniformly distributed, regardless of where the cavity is located. Because the conductor is a sphere, any internal charges would affect the inner surfaces, but the outer surface's distribution depends only on external influences. Since there's no external charge (the only charge is inside the cavity), the outer surface's charge would distribute uniformly. So the outer surface's charge would be +q, but wait, no, wait. Wait, the conductor was uncharged, so the outer surface must have +q because the inner surface has -q. So the total induced charge on the conductor is zero.

Wait, I might be getting confused. Let me think again. The conductor is neutral. The cavity contains +q. The inner surface of the cavity (inside the conductor) must have an induced charge of -q. So the conductor's remaining charge is zero. So the outer surface must have a charge of +q. Because the inner has -q, so the outer must have +q to make the total zero. So the conductor's outer surface has +q.

But wait, the conductor itself is neutral. So the total charge on the conductor is zero. The inner surface has -q, so the outer surface must have +q. That's correct.

Now, for the electric field outside the conductor. Since the outer surface is spherical and has a charge of +q, the electric field outside the conductor (at point P) would be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere. Because the charge on a conducting shell produces an electric field as if it were a point charge at the center.

Wait, but the conductor is a sphere, so yes, the field outside would be like a point charge. So the distance from the center of the conductor is L. So the electric field at point P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²). Because the outer surface's +q is what contributes to the field outside.

Wait, but point P is a distance L from the center of the spherical conductor, and the charge on the outer surface is +q. So E is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². That would be option B.

Hmm, but wait. Let me think again. What about the position of the cavity inside the conductor? If the cavity is not at the center, could that affect the distribution of the outer charge?

Wait, no. Because the outer surface's charge distribution depends on external fields. Since there are no external fields (assuming we're just considering the setup with the cavity charge and the conductor), the outer charge would arrange itself uniformly. Because any asymmetry in the cavity's position would affect the inner surface, but the outer surface remains symmetric if there's no external influence.

Wait, but in reality, the inner surface is not symmetric because the cavity is shifted. So the inner surface has -q, but distributed in a non-uniform way, perhaps. But the outer surface, being a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, must have a uniform charge distribution regardless of the inner configuration because any internal charges cannot influence the outer surface's distribution beyond their total charge. So the outer surface's charge is +q, uniformly distributed.

Therefore, the electric field outside the conductor (at point P) is the same as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor. So regardless of where the cavity is inside, the external field depends only on the total charge on the outer surface and the distance from the conductor's center.

So the electric field at point P should be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Looking at the options, that's option B.

But wait, let me make sure. The question says the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and the angle between l and s (the distance between centers) is theta. So in the problem statement, l and L are both greater than R.

Wait, but if the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q, then the field at any point outside, regardless of where it is relative to the cavity's position, should depend only on the total charge outside and the distance from the center. So for point P, which is outside the conductor, the field is just as if the +q were at the center.

So the correct answer should be option B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius \( R \), containing a small spherical cavity of radius \( r \) (where \( r < R \)). The center of the cavity is separated by a distance \( s \) from the center of the conductor. A small positive charge \( +q \) is placed inside the cavity. The task is to determine the electric field \( \vec{E} \) at a point \( P \) outside the conductor, located at a distance \( L \) from the center of the conductor. The distance from \( P \) to the center of the cavity is \( l \), and \( l, L > R \). The angle between \( l \) and \( s \) is \( \theta \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Induced Charges**:  
   Since the conductor is initially uncharged, the charge \( +q \) inside the cavity induces an equal and opposite charge \( -q \) on the inner surface of the conductor. To maintain charge neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of \( +q \).

2. **Outer Surface Charge Distribution**:  
   The outer surface of the conductor is a spherical shell with uniform charge distribution because the conductor is in electrostatic equilibrium and there are no external fields influencing it. The total charge on the outer surface is \( +q \).

3. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   The electric field outside a charged spherical shell is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge located at the center of the shell. Thus, the electric field at point \( P \), which is at a distance \( L \) from the center of the conductor, is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

4. **Relevance of \( l \) and \( \theta \)**:  
   The distance \( l \) and the angle \( \theta \) are irrelevant for determining the electric field outside the conductor. The field depends only on the total charge on the outer surface (\( +q \)) and the distance \( L \) from the center of the conductor.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The expression \( \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{(l - s \cos\theta)^2} \) does not describe the electric field outside the conductor, as the field depends only on \( L \), not \( l \) or \( \theta \).
- **Option B**: Correct. The expression \( \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2} \) correctly represents the electric field outside the conductor, based on the charge \( +q \) on the outer surface and the distance \( L \).
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The expression \( \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{(l + s \cos\theta)^2} \) is not relevant, as the field outside the conductor does not depend on \( l \) or \( \theta \).
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The expression \( \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{l^2} \) is incorrect because the field outside the conductor depends on \( L \), not \( l \).

### Final Answer:
The electric field at point \( P \) is \( E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
