Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what I've got here.

The question is about identifying the product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I'm given the IR and NMR data for Compound X, and four options to choose from.

First, I should probably analyze the IR and NMR data to figure out what Compound X is. Then, I can think about what reaction occurs when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Oh wait, red phosphorus and HI... that's usually a Hunsdiecker reaction or maybe something else. Hmm, wait, no, the Hunsdiecker reaction is when you have a bromo or chloro alkane reacted with it to form an acid. Alternatively, I think red phosphorus with HI is often used for elimination reactions or maybe for breaking certain functional groups.

Let me start by looking at the IR data. IR peaks can tell me about functional groups in the molecule. The IR data given are: 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, maybe O-H or N-H. But more likely O-H for an acid or an alcohol. Then 1720 cm-1, which is a strong peak, probably a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is usually very broad around 2500-3300. The 1720 could also be
