Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT.

Wait, wait. Let me remember the basics. SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates all possible operators compatible with the Standard Model symmetries. So the operators in SMEFT must respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model.

So what symmetries does the Standard Model have? Well, the Standard Model (SM) has Lorentz symmetry, which includes things like rotational and boost symmetries. Poincaré symmetry is a bit broader; it includes Lorentz and translation symmetries. Wait, Lorentz is a part of Poincaré. So if an operator respects Poincaré, it automatically respects Lorentz. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators.

Wait, the question is specifically about the SMEFT operators. SMEFT is built to maintain the same gauge symmetry as the SM, but what about other symmetries?

I think the SM respects Poincaré symmetry, meaning all operators in SMEFT must also respect that. Because if they don't, the theory wouldn't make sense in the same framework. So Poincaré (option 2) and Lorentz (option 1) would both have to be respected.

Then there's CP symmetry. Wait, the SM doesn't always respect CP. For example, CP violation is observed in the CKM matrix. So in the SM, not all operators respect CP. So in SMEFT, the operators can violate CP unless the operator is specifically CP-even. But the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So since some operators in SMEFT can violate CP, then CP symmetry (option 3) isn't a must. So the correct operators don't have to respect CP.

What about CPT symmetry? The SM respects CPT symmetry. So SMEFT operators must also respect CPT. Because CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories, including the SM. So any operator in SMEFT must preserve CPT.

Putting it together, which symmetries are required? So the operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincaré (2), and CPT (4), but not necessarily CP (3).

Wait, but wait. P
