Alright, I've got this organic chemistry problem to tackle. Let's see what it's about. The question involves identifying a compound based on its NMR data and predicting the product after a series of reactions. Hmm, okay, I'll need to think through this step by step.

First, let me read the problem again. The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and after reacting with certain reagents, I need to find the final product from the given options. The reagents are NaNO2 and HCl, followed by H2O, then aqueous KOH and heat.

Let me start by analyzing the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound.

The 1H NMR shows peaks at:
- 9.72 ppm (triplet, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (doublet, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (doublet, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (broad singlet, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (doublet, 2H)

Breaking it down:

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating to 1H. That's a high chemical shift, which suggests an aldehyde proton. The triplet indicates coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, but aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and appear as singlets because they have only one neighboring proton, but wait, no—the aldehyde is RCHO, so the aldehyde proton has no neighbors except maybe adjacent, but in some cases, like conjugation, maybe it's split. Hmm, maybe it's a conjugated aldehyde, like an enal. Wait, but triplet—maybe it's part of an enol structure? Or maybe it's adjacent to some other protons.

Looking at the other signals:

The 6.98 and 6.51 peaks are doublets each integrating to 2H. These are likely aromatic protons. The 6.98 could be para-substituted aromatic protons, perhaps in a benzene ring with substituents. The 6.51 might be another pair in a similar environment.

The peak at 6.27 is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests possible exchange—like -OH protons, but wait, -OH usually appears as a broad peak, but in this case, it's integrating to 2H. Maybe it's a pair of protons in an enol form or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with some substitution.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That's around the region for CH2 groups, possibly adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe it's a methylene (CH2) next to a carbonyl or an oxygen, like in an ether or ester.

Let me try to piece this together. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2= 10/2=5 degrees of unsaturation. That's a lot—probably two rings or a ring and a double bond, perhaps multiple double bonds or rings.

Looking at the NMR, the aromatic signals suggest perhaps two benzene rings. Let's think: if there are two benzene rings, that would account for 4 carbons (each ring has 6C, but maybe some substituents). Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me see—each benzene ring is 6C, but if the compound has two benzene substituents connected to a chain, maybe the rest is a chain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a single benzene ring with substituents.

Wait, let's think about the NMR. The 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets. Let's say each is a set of para-substituted protons on a benzene ring. So perhaps there are two benzene rings, each with substituents. Alternatively, perhaps it's a single benzene ring with substituents.

Wait, another approach: the 9.72 ppm peak is probably an aldehyde proton. So maybe the compound is an aromatic aldehyde with substituents.

Wait, but the substituents in the benzene rings would affect the NMR shifts. Let's say we have a structure where the aldehyde is attached to a benzene ring, but that might not account for all the signals. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diphenyl compound, like two benzene rings attached to a chain that includes the aldehyde.

Wait, the starting formula is C8H9NO. Let's count: C8. Benzene rings would take up 6 C each, but if it's two benzene rings, that would be 12 C, which is more than 8. So maybe it's a single benzene ring with substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a benzaldehyde derivative. Let's try to think of possible structures.

The 1H NMR shows an aldehyde proton at 9.72 ppm, which is a triplet. That's a bit unusual because typically aldehyde protons are deshielded and appear as singlets. Maybe it's in a conjugated system, like an enal (alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde). For example, in crotonaldehyde, the aldehyde proton is a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent CH2 group. So perhaps the structure is something like an enal.

Wait, that could make sense. The aldehyde is conjugated with a double bond. So, for example, R-CH2-CH2-CHO would not be conjugated, but R-CH2-CH=CHO would have the aldehyde proton conjugated with the double bond. Wait, but in that case, the protons on the double bond would be next to the aldehyde.

Alternatively, the structure could be a benzalacetophenone or something similar. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, considering the NMR, the triplet at 9.72 ppm (1H) suggests it's coupled to two other protons. So maybe it's adjacent to two equivalent protons. For example, if the aldehyde is at the end of a CH2-CH2 group, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps it's an allylic position, like in a conjugated system.

Wait, another idea: the aldehyde proton is part of an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde (en-al). In that case, the aldehyde proton would be adjacent to a double bond, which would cause coupling. So, for example, in but-2-enal (CH2=CHCH2CHO), the aldehyde proton would
