Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a mass in a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. The options are given, so maybe I can work through the problem step by step.

First, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed determined by the amplitude and the spring constant. The formula is something like v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), right? But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. Here, it's relativistic, so I can't use that directly.

Relativistic effects come into play when the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light. So I probably need to use the relativistic equations of motion or energy.

In a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential energy. Normally, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and the kinetic is (1/2)mv². But in relativistic terms, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. Oh right, the relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the total energy E is the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. Alternatively, in a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy equals the kinetic energy at certain points, but in the relativistic case, I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem states that the oscillator obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. So the
