Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The question gives me the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex and the formation constant, so I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions.

Wait, the problem says it's a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, stochiometric means the molar ratio is 1:1, so the formula is probably CaY²- where Y is EDTA. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M.

The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. I think the formation constant (K) for a complex like CaY²- is the equilibrium constant for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−. So K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in this solution, the complex is already formed. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, which is the [CaEDTA²−]. The problem is to find [Ca²+] in this solution.

Assuming that the solution is ideal, the pH is such that EDTA is in its proper form. I think that at the right pH, EDTA is deprotonated enough to bind Ca²+. So I don't need to worry about the protonation states; I can treat it as if EDTA is present as Y^4-.

Let me set up the variables. Let's let x be the concentration of free Ca²+ ions. Then, the concentration of EDTA^4- would be x as well, because each Ca²+ that dissociates from the complex would release one EDTA^4-.

Wait, no. Because the complex dissociates as CaEDTA²− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-. So if the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and some of it dissociates, releasing x M of Ca²+ and x M of EDTA^4-.

So the concentrations after dissociation:
[CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since K is so large, x will be very small compared to 0.02)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA
