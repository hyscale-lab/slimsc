Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let's see... Hmm. So the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity isn't at the same point as the conductor's center; it's offset by a distance s. So s is the separation between the two centers. The radius of the cavity is r, and it's smaller than R, which makes sense because it's inside.

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center. But wait, the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and both L and l are greater than R. Also, there's an angle theta between l and s. 

I remember that when dealing with conductors, charges reside on the surface. But in this case, the conductor is uncharged, so initially, there are no free charges. But when you put a charge inside the cavity, it will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor.

Wait, right. In a conductor, the charges redistribute. So the +q inside the cavity would cause the inner surface of the conductor to have an induced charge of -q, to cancel the field inside the conductor material. But wait, the conductor was initially neutral, so the total charge on the conductor must be zero. That means the outer surface must have a charge of +q, because the inner surface has -q, so the conductor's total is (-q) + something = 0. So the outer surface must be +q.

But how does this affect the electric field outside the conductor? Well, outside the conductor, the field should behave as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. But wait, is that the case here?

Wait, the conductor is a sphere, so when it's uncharged, if you place a charge inside the cavity, the outer surface will have an induced charge. So the field outside the conductor (radius R) would be due to the +q on the outer surface. So the electric field at any point outside the conductor should be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q / r²), where r is the distance from the center of the conductor.

But wait, the point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center. So the electric field should
