Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating it with excess KOH to form product 1, which is a light yellow solid. The 1H NMR of product 1 shows some specific peaks, and there's an IR peak at 1720 cm-1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by adding dimethyl sulfide, giving product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR, excluding those that exchange with the solvent.

Hmm. Let's break this down. I think I need to figure out each step of the reaction and what each product is.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, an elimination reaction occurs, typically forming an alkene via dehydrohalogenation. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines on adjacent carbons. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. Wait, but wait, in adamantane, the structure is a diamondoid, so each carbon is connected in a particular way. I think adamantane is a polycyclic structure, so 1 and 3 might not be adjacent. Wait, no, perhaps in the structure, 1 and 3 are in a position that's adjacent for elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a dihalide that can undergo elimination to form a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene.

Wait, but wait, the product's IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a high wavenumber, likely indicating an ester or a ketone, or maybe an aldehyde. Wait, but after elimination, if we form an alkene, perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution, but with KOH, which is a base, substitution would require a good leaving group and perhaps a better SN2 scenario, but for adamantane derivatives, substitution is less likely because of the structure's stability. More likely, elimination would form an alkene, but that wouldn't give an IR peak at 1720. Hmm, maybe I'm thinking wrong.

Wait, another possibility: When dibromides react with KOH, maybe they undergo a substitution to form a diol. Oh, right, if it's a vicinal dihalide, KOH can cause an elimination (like E2) to form an alkene, or maybe for some structures, a substitution could occur, but for vicinal dihalides, elimination is more common. Wait, but if KOH is in excess and conditions are heated, would it be a substitution? Alternatively, perhaps it's a double dehydrohalogenation, so maybe opening into some structure.

Wait, but the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests the presence of a carbonyl group. So maybe the product is an epoxide? No, epoxides have lower carbonyl peaks, around 1200-1300 cm-1. Wait, another thought: maybe it's a ketone. A carbonyl from oxidation, but how?

Wait, when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But then, why the IR peak at 1720? That suggests something else. Maybe the reaction is not elimination but some kind of substitution, but I'm not sure how that would form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction forms an epoxide, but I'm not recalling that. Another possibility is that the dihalide could form a carbonyl via some elimination with a base. Wait, wait, perhaps when vicinal dihalides are treated with a strong base, they might undergo a double elimination to form a
