Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. Oh right, parallax (p) is the reciprocal of distance (d) in parsecs. So p = 1/d.

The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. The options are various inverse powers of plx. Wait, so we need to find how N (number of stars) depends on 1/plx.

Wait, let's think about the distribution. If stars are uniformly distributed, that means their number density is uniform in space. Number density n is the number per unit volume. So in a small volume, the number of stars is n times that volume.

But how does this translate to parallax? Well, parallax p is inversely proportional to distance. So d = 1/p. So as p increases, the distance decreases. So more nearby stars have larger parallaxes.

Now, let's imagine a shell at a distance d with thickness dd. The volume of this shell is 4πd² dd. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the shell's volume is the difference between two spheres: 4π(d + dd/2)³ - 4π(d - dd/2)³. When dd is small, this approximates to 4πd² dd.

Since the number of stars in this shell is n * 4πd² dd. But wait, we're looking for the number per unit parallax. So we need to express this in terms of p, not d.

Since p = 1/d, then d = 1/p. So the volume becomes 4π (1/p)^2 * ( - dp ), because dd = - dp/(p²), since d = 1/p, so dd = - (1/p²) dp. Wait, maybe I should get that derivative right. Let me think, if p = 1/d, then dp/dd = -1/d². So dp = - (1/d²) dd → dd = -d² dp. Since d =1/p, d² is 1/p². So dd = - (1/p²) dp.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me express the volume in terms of p. The shell's volume is 4πd² dd. But since d = 1/p, then d² is 1/p², and dd is the change in d. But to express everything in terms of p, perhaps we can change variables. So:

The number of stars in a shell at distance d is N = n * 4πd² dd. To find the number per unit parallax, we need to find how many stars are there when plx changes by a small amount dplx. So we need to express this in terms of p.

Let me write d in terms of p: d = 1/p → dd = - (1/p²) dp.

So substituting into N,

N = n * 4π (1/p²) * ( - (1/p²) dp )

Wait, but the negative sign indicates that as p increases, d decreases. But for counting, we're interested in the magnitude. So the number of stars per unit parallax (dplx) would be N/(dplx) = n *4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) * (1
