Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. The product is a light yellow solid, product 1. The IR shows a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which usually indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. The ¹H NMR has peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). Hmm, what could this be?

So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromine atoms on the adamantane structure. Heating with KOH probably causes an elimination reaction. KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's dehydrohalogenation. Oh wait, but with two bromines, maybe it's a di-elimination. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so when you eliminate HBr from adjacent Br atoms, you might form an alkene. But wait, the IR shows a carbonyl. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a Dieckmann cyclization? No, that's for esters. Alternatively, could it be a Hoffman elimination? Wait, no, that's for amides. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation forming a ketone.

Wait, maybe it's more like a vicinal dihalide reacting with a base. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on positions 1 and 3. Heating with KOH could result in elimination, but in this case, perhaps forming an epoxide? No, wait, epoxide formation typically involves peracids. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation forming an alkene, but how does that give a carbonyl?

Wait, maybe it's a retro-aldol addition or something else. Alternatively, could it be a double elimination leading to a conjugated diene? But I'm not sure. Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Oh, wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, a four-fused cyclohexane rings. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on adjacent carbons perhaps? Or maybe not adjacent, but in positions that when eliminated, form a bridge.

But the NMR of product 1 has
