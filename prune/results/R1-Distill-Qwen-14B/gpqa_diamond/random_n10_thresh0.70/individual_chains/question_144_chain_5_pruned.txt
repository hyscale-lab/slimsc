Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about meson resonances. Let's see what it's asking. Hmm, the question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. They gave me some numbers: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Gamma_X is 320 MeV. The options are A to D with some scientific notation numbers.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance (or lifetime) of a particle is related to its lifetime via distance = velocity * lifetime. Oh right, because distance is velocity multiplied by time. But how do I find the lifetime?

I think the lifetime is connected to the particle's width through the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that the uncertainty in energy (which is Gamma, the width) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (which is the lifetime, tau) is about hbar over 2pi. Or wait, maybe it's just hbar. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think: the relation is Gamma * tau ≈ ħ. So tau ≈ ħ / Gamma. Oh wait, I think the exact formula is tau = ħ / (Gamma * c^2), but wait, no, I'm mixing units here. Let me get it right.

Wait, no, Gamma is the total decay width, which is energy (in GeV) units. The uncertainty principle in terms of energy and time is Delta E * Delta t ≈ ħ. So Delta t is the lifetime tau, and Delta E is Gamma (the total width). So tau ≈ ħ / Gamma. But wait, Gamma has units of energy, and ħ has units of energy times time. So when you divide ħ by Gamma (energy), the units work out to time, which is correct.

But wait, another thought: sometimes the formula is written as tau = ħ * c^5 / (m^2 * Gamma), but I'm not sure. Or maybe that's the formula for the mean decay length. Because decay length would be velocity times lifetime. Oh right, because the particle is moving, so even if it lives for a tiny time, how far does it go? So let's break it down.

The mean decay distance L is given by L = v * tau, where v is the velocity. So first, I need to find tau, then multiply by v.

To find tau, the lifetime, I use tau = ħ / Gamma. But wait, Gamma is given in MeV, and ħ is in units of GeV·s or something? Wait, let me think about the units. Let's make sure everything is in compatible units.

First, let's compute tau. Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Gamma = 0.32 GeV. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So tau = ħ / Gamma = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = approx 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, that seems right. So tau ≈ 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056e-24 s.

Now, velocity v. For a particle, v is approximately
