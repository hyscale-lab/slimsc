Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me think this through.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a 2D metric, right? So it's probably in two dimensions. Pseudosphere, so I remember that a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But wait, the options talk about area, so maybe I'm dealing with a 2D surface here.

Wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. But pseudospheres are like models of hyperbolic geometry, right? The standard pseudosphere has a certain curvature. The metric given here, though, I'm not immediately sure how it relates to the pseudosphere.

Wait, let me think about the metric. The denominator is 4 - x² - y². So 4 is like the radius squared, because 4 is (2)^2. So the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), which would be 4 - r^2 where r is the radial coordinate in flat 2D space. So that makes me think this metric is similar to the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic space.

In the Poincaré disk model, the metric is usually written as ds² = [4/(1 - r²)^2] (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate and θ is the angular coordinate. Wait, but in this problem, the
