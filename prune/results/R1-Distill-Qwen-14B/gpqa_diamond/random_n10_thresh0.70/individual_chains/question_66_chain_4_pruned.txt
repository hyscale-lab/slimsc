Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It's a framework that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with certain symmetries, right?

The question gives four options: 1. Lorentz Symmetry, 2. Poincare symmetry, 3. CP symmetry, 4. CPT symmetry. And the options are combinations of these.

Wait, I think Lorentz symmetry is definitely a big one. Because SMEFT is a field theory, and in relativity, Lorentz symmetry is fundamental. So all operators should respect Lorentz symmetry. That means option 1 is correct.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So if operators respect Poincare, they must also respect Lorentz. But does SMEFT require Poincare symmetry? I'm a bit confused. Wait, SMEFT is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant theory, but does it automatically respect Poincare? Or is Poincare a separate requirement?

Wait, the Poincare group includes Lorentz transformations and translations. If the theory is built in a way that's invariant under Lorentz, I think it's also invariant under Poincare because the effective theory is built in a way that's covariant under spacetime symmetries. But I'm not entirely sure if all operators must respect Poincare. Or is it that they only need to respect Lorentz? Because the SMEFT is usually considered in a fixed spacetime background, maybe without requiring translation invariance. Wait, but translation in
