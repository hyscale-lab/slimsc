Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.

So, the problem says that the operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and it's given by c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), right? And S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). Wait, so S is some matrix, and when we multiply it by c, we get Ay.

The task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. But the question isn't directly asking for the calculation; instead, it's asking which statement is correct during the calculation. So the options are A, B, C, D.

Let me think about the structure of S. The matrix S looks familiar. Oh, wait! It's the Pauli Y matrix, which is a component of the Pauli matrices used in quantum mechanics. The Pauli matrices are used in spin-1/2 systems, which makes sense here because the muon is a spin-1/2 particle.

The Pauli Y matrix is usually written as:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]
Which matches the S given here. So, S is the Pauli Y matrix, σy.

The operator Ay is then c times σy. So, Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

Eigenvalues of S (σy) are ±i because the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±i. Wait, wait. No! Wait a second. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, but when you have σy multiplied by some constants, the eigenvalues change accordingly.

Wait no, let me correct myself. Each Pauli matrix (σx, σy, σz) has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So, for σy, the eigenvalues are ±1, and when you multiply by a constant c, the eigenvalues become c*(±1).

So, the eigenvalues of Ay would be (h/(4π)) * (±1). So, the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because our eigenvalues are purely real or purely imaginary? Wait, let me think again.

Wait, no. The Pauli
