Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, and when heated, G releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Then there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with 2 oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

Hmm, I need to figure out what Substance X is. Let's break this down.

First, the reaction between X and Y. When X reacts, gas W is released. Since W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons, that likely means the molecule is something like CO2 or H2O? Wait, no. Because in CO2, each molecule has 2 oxygen atoms, but the problem says same number of protons and neutrons. Wait, no, the molecule as a whole? Or each atom within the molecule?

Wait, the question says "molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." So for the entire molecule, the sum of all protons equals the sum of all neutrons. Let me think: what gases are released in such reactions? Common reactions include acid-base reactions, like when metals react with acids to release H2 gas.

Wait, but H2 has 2 protons each. So each molecule's protons are 2 (from two H atoms). The neutrons would be zero each, so total neutrons would be 0. That doesn't fit. So maybe another gas.

Wait, another possibility: what if the gas is CO2? Let's see. CO2 has one C and two O atoms. C has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (since C-12 is most common). Each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So total protons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Total neutrons: (6) + 2*8 = 22. Oh! So CO2 fits because total protons equal total neutrons (22 each). So gas W is CO2.

But wait, another possibility is CH4. CH4 has 6 protons (C) + 4*(1) = 10 protons. Neutrons: C has 6, each H has 0, so total 6. Oh, that doesn't match. So not CH4.

So CO2 seems like a candidate. So if X and Y produce CO2, what might Y be? Liquid Y could be water or maybe an acid.

Wait, or another possibility: if gas W is H2O. Let's see: H2O has 2 H and 1 O. Protons: 2 + 8 = 10. Neutrons: (0 for H) + 8 =8. So 10 vs 8. Not equal. So not H2O.

Wait, if it's CO2, that works. So the reaction is producing CO2. So what reaction produces CO2? Maybe a carbonate reacting with something, or a metal reacting with a carbonate acid.

Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction between a carbonate and an
