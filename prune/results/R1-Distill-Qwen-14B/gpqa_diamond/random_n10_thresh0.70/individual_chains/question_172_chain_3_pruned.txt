Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of energy levels in atoms depends on the temperature. The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, I think the key here is the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann factor relates the population of different energy levels in a thermal distribution. The formula is something like the ratio of populations of two states being proportional to the exponential of -(E2-E1)/(k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference is given as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. Let me call the energy levels E1 and E2, where E2 is higher than E1. So for each star, the population ratio of E2 to E1 would be (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where g's are the statistical weights. But the question says the excitation is twice as much in star_1. I think that means the ratio n1(E2)/n1(E1) is twice n2(E2)/n2(E1).

Wait, no. Wait, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So maybe the number of atoms in the excited state is twice that in star_2 for the same level. Or maybe the ratio of excited to ground state is twice.

Assuming that the ground state is E1 and the excited is E2. So for star 1, the ratio is 2 times that of star 2. So:

n1(E2)/n1(E1) = 2 * [n2(E2)/n2(E1)]

But according to Boltzmann distribution, n(E2)/n(E1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, but if the energy levels have the same statistical weights for both stars, then the ratio would be proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So:

(n1(E2)/n1(E1)) / (n2(E2)/n2(E1)) ) = [ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, no, because when you divide the exponents, you subtract their exponents. So:

exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

But the problem says (n1(E2)/n1(E1)) = 2 * (n2(E2)/n2(E1)) )

So,

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = 2

Take natural log of both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the math. Let me denote the ratio (n1/n1') as 2 times (n2/n2'), where n1 is the excited state in star 1, n1' is the ground state in star 1, etc.

So:

(n1/n1') = 2 * (n2/n2')

But each (n_i/n_i') is (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T_i) )

Assuming for both stars, g2 and g1 are the same, because it's the same element and same energy levels. So (g2/g1) cancels out in the ratio.

So:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ) = 2

Which is exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) ) = 2

Taking ln on both sides:

(ΔE/(k)) (1/(
