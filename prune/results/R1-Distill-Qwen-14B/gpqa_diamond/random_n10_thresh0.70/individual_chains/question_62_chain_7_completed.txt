Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The goal is to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. That's a mouthful. Let me break down the target molecule. So, the main structure is a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which means there's a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group (an aldehyde) attached. But wait, the actual formula is more specific: it's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, maybe it's a cyclohexane ring where one of the carbons has a substituent that includes a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxyl group, and a methyl group attached. Or perhaps it's a cyclohexane ring with a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached, and an aldehyde group as well. I'm not entirely sure about the structure, but maybe I can figure it out as I go.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a carbon-carbon triple bond) attached. So it's cyclohexane with a HC≡C- group.

Now, I need to find the correct sequence of reagents to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of steps.

First, I should think about the possible reactions that can be done on ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynyl groups are sp-hybridized, so they can undergo various addition reactions. Common reactions include hydroboration, hydration (like acid-catalyzed), or other additions. But looking at the options, I see steps involving NaNH2, H2/Pd, etc. So maybe the starting point is to do some kind of deprotonation or functional group transformation.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. Methyl chloride (CH3Cl) is a methylating agent. So perhaps the first step is methylating something.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane has an alkyne group. When you deprotonate an alkyne with a strong base like NaNH2, you can get the acetylide ion. So maybe the first step is deprotonation to form the acetylide.

If the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (Cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH?), wait no, ethynyl would be -C≡CH. So, cyclohexyl-ethynyl maybe as CH2CH2... Wait, no, I think ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So it's cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. So, the molecule is cyclohexane with a substituent that's a triple bond—so it's a terminal alkyne.

So, when you deprotonate a terminal alkyne (like ethynylcyclohexane) with a strong base like NaNH2, you get the acetylide. So the first reagent in the options is NaNH2 and methyl chloride.

Wait, but methyl chloride is a methylating agent. So perhaps the first step is making the acetylide, then methylating something.

Wait, no, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) is a methylating agent. If you have an acetylide, which is a strong base, perhaps the methyl chloride would methylate another part of the molecule. Hmm, but cyclohexane doesn't have any acidic hydrogens except the alkyne's. So maybe the methyl chloride is used to methylate the acetylide?

Wait, no, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) is typically used as an alkylating agent, but with a strong base like NaNH2, perhaps the acetylide could react with CH3Cl. But wait, acetylides are nucleophilic and can attack methyl chloride. So deprotonating ethynylcyclohexane with NaNH2 gives cyclohexylacetylide. Then, adding methyl chloride would methylate the acetylide. Wait, but acetylide is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So, cyclohexylacetylide (like CH2C≡C-) reacting with CH3Cl would form CH2C≡C-CH3? No, wait, the cyclohexyl group is on the acetylide. So the acetylide would be something like cyclohexyl-C≡C^- Na^+. Reacting with CH3Cl would give cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3, but wait, that's just adding a methyl group to the triple bond. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is using NaNH2 and CH3Cl to methylate something else. Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane doesn't have any other acidic hydrogens except the alkyne. So after deprotonation, the acetylide would be the only species with a negative charge.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to make the acetylide, and then perform some alkylation. So the acetylide (cyclohexylacetylide) would attack a methyl chloride, giving cyclohexylacetylmethyl? Hmm, but I'm not entirely certain. Maybe I should think about the overall target.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me try to imagine the structure. The main ring is cyclohexane. Attached to position 1 (if 1 is the position where the substituent is) is a group that has a cyclohexyl, a hydroxyl, and a methyl group all attached to a central carbon. And there's an aldehyde group on the cyclohexane.

Wait, so the substituent is a methyl group attached to a carbon that also has a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. So, the substituent is a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. And the main ring also has an aldehyde group. So, the molecule is a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: one is an aldehyde (-CHO), and the other is a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group.

Hmm, how do I get from ethynylcyclohexane to this? Let me think about possible steps.

First, perhaps the alkyne needs to be converted into something else. Let's say we make the cyclohexylacetylide, then maybe perform some cyclopropanation or alkyne addition, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the alkyne can be used in a coupling reaction. Like, for instance, a Sonogashira coupling, but I don't think that's relevant here. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is used to form a diol via hydration, but I think that would require different reagents.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to deprotonate the alkyne to make the acetylide, then perform a substitution reaction to add a methyl group. So, if ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH2, it becomes the acetylide, which then reacts with methyl chloride to add a methyl group to the triple bond, making 1-methylcyclohexylacetylene? Not sure if that's the right idea.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is used in a cyclopropanation via a Simmons-Smith reaction, but that would require different reagents (like Zn and a dihalomethane), so probably not.

Wait, another thought. Ethynylcyclohexane could undergo a hydrogenation reaction. So, with H2 and a catalyst like Pd, the triple bond could become a single bond. But wait, that's not typical because hydrogenation of an alkyne usually stops at the alkene unless under high pressure. Alternatively, using a large excess of H2 and a catalyst might lead to full hydrogenation to an alkane.

Wait, but in the target molecule, we have an aldehyde group. So perhaps the aldehyde is introduced via oxidation of a primary alcohol. So maybe after some steps, we have a primary alcohol that is oxidized to the aldehyde.

Let me think: the target has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group and a substituent that has a cyclohexyl, hydroxyl, and methyl group. So perhaps the substituent comes from a Grignard or organometallic reagent addition to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a ketone or aldehyde through a series of reactions.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the possible reagents in the options. Let's look at the options one by one.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd; Ba(OH)2; H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Hmm, that's four steps. So, first make the acetylide, then hydrogenate, then Ba(OH)2, then some H2SO4 and HgSO4, with H2O.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe for elimination or epoxide opening. H2SO4 and HgSO4 in H2O could be for oxidation, like the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation? Or perhaps it's a Jones oxidation, which oxidizes alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; Li/LiNH3; O3/H2O; NH4OH.

So, first make the acetylide, then ethyl chloride. Wait, ethyl chloride is CH2CH3Cl. Li/LiNH3 is a strong base, used for deprotonating or for elimination reactions, like in the Birch reduction maybe. O3 is ozone, which is used for ozonolysis. NH4OH is ammonium hydroxide, used in workups, perhaps to break ozonides into carbonyl groups.

Hmm, perhaps O3 is used to cleave a double bond. So if step 2 is Li and liquid NH3, that's a reaction for elimination, maybe dehydrohalogenation. Then, if you have a dihalide, you might get an alkene.

Wait, perhaps the steps are: make acetylide (step 1), then quench with ethyl chloride to get an ethyl group added somewhere. Then, step 2 is Li in liquid NH3, which is a method for elimination, making a triple bond again? Wait, Li in NH3 is used for deprotonation and elimination. So maybe after alkylation, we eliminate to form a new triple bond or a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is forming a Grignard or organometallic reagent. No, Li is in NH3, which is a method for Birch reductions or for elimination. Maybe after alkylation, elimination of HCl forms a new triple bond or a double bond.

Then, step 3 is O3, which would cleave a double bond. So if step 2 creates a double bond, step 3 would break it into carbonyl groups. Then, step 4 is NH4OH, which would work up the ozonide, perhaps forming aldehydes or ketones.

Hmm, but I'm not sure how this builds the target molecule with the cyclohexyl group and the aldehyde.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; O3/(CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2.

So, step 1: acetylide formation. Step 2: hydrogenation with H2 and Pd-CaCO3. Maybe that's a catalyst for hydrogenation of a triple bond to a single bond, so ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexane with a CH2CH3 group? Wait, no, because hydrogenation of an alkyne would typically go to cis-alkene first, then to alkane. Or perhaps under certain conditions, it stops at the alkene.

Wait, step 2 is H2/Pd-CaCO3. That's a catalyst for hydrogenation. So, if you hydrogenate an alkyne, you get an alkane. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexane with a CH2CH3 group? Wait, no, the structure is ethynylcyclohexane which is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. So hydrogenating the triple bond would make CH2-CH2, which is just a single bond. So the product would be cyclohexane with a CH2-CH2 group, but that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps it's cyclohexane with a CH2CH2 group, but that's just a single bond. Wait, no, the hydrogenation would add two hydrogens across the triple bond, turning it into a single bond. So, the product after hydrogenation would be cyclohexane with a CH2CH2 group, which is just a single bond. But that's not possible. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene. So, the triple bond becomes a double bond. Then, in another step, maybe ozonolysis would cleave the double bond.

But let me think through the steps in option C. After step 1, you have the acetylide. Then step 2 is hydrogenation, which would convert the alkyne to an alkane, so adding two H's to each carbon. So the triple bond becomes a single bond, making the molecule something like cyclohexane with a CH2CH2 group. But that's just ethane, so maybe I'm not getting that right.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation in step 2 is for a different purpose. Maybe the acetylide is first treated with methyl chloride to alkylate it, then hydrogenated. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; Li/liq. NH3; O3/(CH3)2S; NH4OH.

So, first step is NaNH2 and methanol. Hmm, NaNH2 is a strong base, and methanol is a solvent. So maybe that's a deprotonation step. Alternatively, it could be for forming an acetylide, but then using methanol as the solvent. Then, step 2 is Li in liquid NH3, which is a strong base used for elimination reactions. Step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S, which is a milder reductive workup, perhaps. Then NH4OH for workup.

Hmm, but I'm not sure how this sequence leads to the target molecule.

I think I need to approach this differently. Let's outline what needs to happen to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target.

First, the target has an aldehyde group. To make an aldehyde, we probably need to oxidize a primary alcohol. So, perhaps one of the steps is introducing a hydroxyl group, then oxidizing it.

Another part of the target is a cyclohexyl group attached to a carbon that also has a hydroxyl and methyl group. So that substituent is a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)CH2 group maybe? Wait, the substituent is on the cyclohexane, so perhaps the substituent is a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)methyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent comes from a coupling reaction, like a Grignard addition. Let me think: if I have a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde), I can add a Grignard reagent to it. But I'm not sure where the cyclohexyl group would come from.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group through some reaction. For example, the alkyne could be converted to a ketone via ozonolysis, but that would require breaking the triple bond into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, another thought: perhaps a cyclopropane ring is formed via the alkyne, but I don't see how that would lead to the target structure.

Wait, let's think about the target's substituent: it's a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)methyl group on the cyclohexane. So, perhaps the cyclohexyl group is introduced via a coupling reaction, such as a Suzuki coupling or a Grignard reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is used in a propargyl alcohol formation. Propargyl alcohol can undergo various additions. For example, adding water across the triple bond to form a propargyl alcohol, then further reactions.

Wait, but the target doesn't have a propargyl group. Hmm.

Let me think about the possible steps again. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a cyclohexane ring with a -C≡CH group.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So, NaNH2 would deprotonate the alkyne to form the acetylide ion. Then, methyl chloride would methylate it. But wait, where would the methyl group go? The acetylide is on the cyclohexane, so adding a methyl to the sp-hybridized carbon would give (cyclohexyl)acetylmethyl? I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the acetylide is formed, and then it's quenched with methyl chloride. So, the reaction would be cyclohexylacetylide + CH3Cl → cyclohexylacetylmethyl? But that would make a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide attacks the methyl chloride, but I'm not certain about the product.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is a deprotonation followed by alkylation. So, after forming the acetylide, the methyl chloride would add a methyl group somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the acetylide is a strong base, and the methyl chloride is a methylating agent. So, the acetylide (cyclohexyl-C≡C-) would attack methyl chloride, giving cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. But that would be a longer alkyne. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to perform a Grignard reaction. But NaNH2 isn't a Grignard reagent, it's a base.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to form an alkene, but I'm not sure how that helps.

Wait, looking at the options, in option B, the second reagent is Li and liquid NH3. That's a strong base and a good environment for elimination. So, perhaps after alkylation, an elimination reaction forms a new double bond.

Hmm, another thought: if the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. But the target doesn't have two carbonyls, so maybe that's not the way.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is reduced to a carbonyl group. Wait, how? Oh, oxidation of alkynes can form ketones. For example, using a strong oxidizing agent like KMnO4 under acidic conditions can oxidize terminal alkynes to carboxylic acids. Or, under other conditions, maybe to ketones.

Wait, but in this case, the alkyne is attached to a cyclohexane ring. So, oxidizing would add oxygen. For example, if the alkyne is oxidized to a ketone, that would give cyclohexylacetone (cyclohexane with a ketone group).

Wait, if I can form a ketone from the alkyne, perhaps then I can perform a Grignard addition to introduce the substituent.

But the target has an aldehyde, so maybe I can oxidize a primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde.

Wait, another approach: the target has both an aldehyde and a cyclohexyl group attached to the same ring. So, perhaps the cyclohexyl group is introduced via a ring-opening or via a coupling reaction.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into an epoxide, but I don't see how that would fit with the reagents.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is used in a Diels-Alder reaction, but that would require a diene, which I don't see in the starting material.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about each option and see which sequence makes sense.

Looking at option D: the first step is NaNH2 and methanol. So forming the acetylide, then quenching with methanol. But what would that give? The acetylide would react with methanol to form the corresponding alcohol? But I thought that would require a proton source. Or perhaps it's an alkyne to alcohol reaction.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. When you deprotonate an alkyne with NaNH2, you get the acetylide. Then, adding methanol would provide a proton source. So the acetylide would pick up a proton and a methyl group from CH3OH? Wait, no, methanol is CH3OH. But if you have the acetylide, which is a strong base, and you add CH3OH, perhaps it would deprotonate the methanol, but that's unlikely. Or perhaps the acetylide would pick up a proton from the methanol, giving back the alkyne and releasing NH3. So that doesn't seem helpful.

Hmm, perhaps the first step in option D is not to make the acetylide but something else. Or maybe it's a Birch reduction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the first step in option D is to deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane with NaNH2 and then methylate using methanol. But methanol isn't a methylating agent, so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the NaNH2 and methanol is for some kind of elimination or other reaction.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of the target structure again.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the cyclohexane ring has two substituents: one is a CHO group (aldehyde), and the other is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)CH2 group? Or perhaps it's a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)methyl group attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the cyclohexane, and the aldehyde is on the same carbon? Or on an adjacent carbon?

Alternatively, perhaps the main ring is cyclohexane, and one of the carbons (say, carbon 1) has a substituent that's a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group, and another substituent is the aldehyde.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused about the structure. Let me try to draw it mentally.

Suppose the main ring is cyclohexane. Attached to carbon 1 is a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. Also attached to the same cyclohexane is a -CHO group (aldehyde). So, it's cyclohexane with two substituents: an aldehyde and a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group.

So, how can I get this from ethynylcyclohexane?

Perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl group, then used in a Grignard addition.

Wait, but how?

Another approach: let's think about the steps in option C.

Option C's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → make acetylide and methylate?

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane, making cyclohexane with a CH2CH2 group, which doesn't make sense. Or perhaps it's hydrogenated to an alkene.

Wait, no. Wait, the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene with H2 and Pd. So, the triple bond becomes a double bond. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexene with a double bond. Then, step 3 is O3/(CH3)2S.

Ozonolysis of a double bond would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. So, if the cyclohexane has a double bond adjacent to a ring, ozonolysis would break the ring, which I don't think is desired here.

Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation in step 2 is to fully hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making a cyclohexane with a CH2CH2 group, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps that's not the right approach.

Looking at option B: steps include Li and NH3 (liquid), which is a strong base. So, perhaps a deprotonation followed by elimination.

Wait, let's think of the steps in option B:

1. NaNH2 and ethyl chloride → form acetylide, then ethylate?

2. Li and NH3 → elimination, perhaps forming a new triple bond or a double bond.

3. O3 in H2O → cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → workup.

But I'm not sure how this would form the substituent with the cyclohexyl, hydroxyl, and methyl groups.

Another approach: perhaps the target molecule has a substituent where a cyclohexyl group is attached to a carbon that also has a hydroxyl and methyl group. So, perhaps this substituent is formed via a cross-coupling reaction, like a Suzuki or Heck, but I don't see those reagents in the options.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, which is then used in a Claisen or aldol condensation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is used to form a Grignard reagent, which is then added to a carbonyl compound.

Wait, but how?

Wait, in option D, the first step is NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe that's for deprotonating the alkyne, then quenching to form a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the NaNH2 and methanol are for a hydroamination reaction, but I'm not certain.

Another thought: perhaps the target has an aldehyde group and a secondary alcohol group. So, to get the aldehyde, you need to oxidize a primary alcohol. To get the secondary alcohol, you might need a reduction or a hydroxylation.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl via oxidation, and then a Grignard reagent is added to form the substituent.

Wait, for example, oxidizing the alkyne to a ketone, then adding a Grignard reagent that brings in the cyclohexyl group. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, maybe I should think about each option's reagents and see which sequence logically leads to the target.

Option C:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride → make acetylide, then perhaps alkylation to add a methyl group.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond, making CH2CH2, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's hydrogenated to a cis-alkene.

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis of the alkene would break it into carbonyl groups.

Step 4: Ba(OH)2 → Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe for elimination or epoxide ring opening.

But I'm not sure how this would form the substituent with the cyclohexyl, hydroxyl, and methyl groups.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → form acetylide, then quench with methanol. But I'm not sure what that does. Perhaps it forms the alkyne again, but not helpful.

Step 2: Li and liquid NH3 → strong base, perhaps for elimination.

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis.

Step 4: NH4OH → workup.

Hmm, not seeing the connection.

Option A:

Steps: NaNH2, methyl chloride → H2/Pd → Ba(OH)2 → H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

So, step 1: acetylide and methyl group added.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane. So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexane with a CH2CH3 group? How? Because the triple bond becomes a single bond.

But then, step 3: Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is used in the oxidation of alcohols, perhaps for epoxide openings, or for elimination. Alternatively, it's used in the Birch reduction. But I'm not sure.

Step 4: H2SO4 and HgSO4 in H2O. That's a Jones oxidation condition, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids or ketones to carboxylic acids.

Hmm, but the target has an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. So, maybe that's not the right path.

Option B:

Steps: NaNH2, ethyl chloride → Li and NH3 → O3, H2O → NH4OH.

So, step 1: form acetylide, then ethylate. So, perhaps the acetylide attacks ethyl chloride, adding an ethyl group to the triple bond, making ethylcyclohexylacetylene? Not sure.

Step 2: Li and NH3 is a strong base, maybe for elimination. So, perhaps after ethylation, the molecule has an ethyl group, and then elimination forms a new triple bond or a double bond.

Step 3: O3 → cleave the double bond into carbonyls, then step 4: NH4OH for workup.

But I'm not sure how this would lead to the target structure.

Another approach: perhaps the correct sequence involves forming a diol from the alkyne via hydration, then performing some oxidation to form the aldehyde.

Wait, but the target has a cyclohexyl group attached. So, perhaps the diol would have a cyclohexyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl via oxidation.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the target's structure again. The target has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group and a substituent that is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group.

So, perhaps the cyclohexyl group is formed via a ring-opening, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is formed via a conjugate addition. For example, adding a Grignard reagent to a carbonyl group.

Wait, but where would the cyclohexyl group come from? Maybe via a cyclization.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, then a Grignard reagent adds, introducing a hydroxyl group and a methyl group.

Wait, here's an idea: the alkyne is oxidized to a ketone, then a Grignard reagent (like cyclohexyl magnesium bromide) is added, forming a secondary alcohol. Then, that alcohol is oxidized to an aldehyde.

But wait, the Grignard would typically add twice to a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the correct steps are:

1. Oxidize the alkyne to a ketone → cyclohexanone with a ketone group.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. So, oxidizing the alkyne would add oxygen. For a terminal alkyne, oxidation with strong oxidizing agents like KMnO4 under acidic conditions would form a carboxylic acid. So, maybe the alkyne becomes a COOH group.

Wait, but the target has an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. So perhaps that's not the way.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is reduced to a carbonyl group. For example, using a hydrogenation with a catalyst that stops at the carbonyl stage, like using H2 and a poisoned catalyst. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then that alkene is epoxidized, and then opened to form a diol, which can then be oxidized.

But I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for the reagent sequences that could form the necessary functional groups.

The target includes an aldehyde, which is a carbonyl group, so perhaps one of the steps is an oxidation of a primary alcohol.

Option D's steps include O3 and (CH3)2S, which are used in ozonolysis followed by reductive workup to form carbonyl groups. Then, NH4OH is used, perhaps to break any ozonides into aldehydes/ketones.

So, perhaps in option D, after ozonolysis, an aldehyde is formed.

But how does the cyclohexyl group get attached?

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Form acetylide with NaNH2.

2. Alkylation with methyl chloride to add a methyl group.

3. Hydrogenate to form an alkene.

4. Ozonolysis to form two carbonyl groups.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

- Convert the alkyne to an alkene via hydrogenation.

- Then, perform ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

But in the target, there's a cyclohexyl group attached, so maybe that comes from a ring-opening or a coupling.

Another thought: perhaps the cyclohexane's alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl group, then a Grignard reagent adds a cyclohexyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol, then oxidized to a ketone, and then a Grignard reagent adds.

But this is getting too vague.

Wait, perhaps looking back at the target structure. The substituent is a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)methyl group attached to the cyclohexane. So, perhaps this substituent is formed via a hydroxyalkylation, where a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group are added to a carbonyl carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is formed via oxidation of a secondary alcohol, but that's not possible because oxidation of a secondary alcohol gives a ketone, not an aldehyde.

Wait, the aldehyde must come from a primary alcohol, which is then oxidized. So, perhaps one of the steps is introducing a primary alcohol, which is then oxidized.

Hmm, considering all this, perhaps option D's sequence is the right one.

Option D steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → make acetylide, then perhaps quench with methanol to give a ketone?

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. If you treat ethynylcyclohexane with NaNH2, you get the acetylide. Then, adding methanol would protonate it, giving ethynylcyclohexane again. That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps after the acetylide is formed, adding methanol doesn't do much. Maybe the first step is just deprotonation without alkylation.

Step 2: Li and liquid NH3 → strong base, perhaps for elimination. So, maybe the acetylide is treated with Li and NH3, leading to some elimination reaction, perhaps forming a new triple bond or a double bond.

But I'm not sure.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S → ozonolysis. So, any double bonds would be cleaved into carbonyl groups.

Step 4: NH4OH → workup, perhaps hydrolysis.

But I'm not seeing how this forms the cyclohexyl group in the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence involves:

- Forming the acetylide.

- Alkylation to add a methyl group.

- Hydrogenation to form a single bond.

- Ozonolysis to form carbonyls.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is the right one. Let's see:

Option C steps:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride → acetylide and methylate.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate the alkyne to a cis-alkene.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → cleave the double bond into carbonyls.

4. Ba(OH)2 → strong base, maybe for elimination.

But I'm not sure how this leads to the target.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps I should try to think of the correct reaction path.

The target has both an aldehyde and a cyclohexyl group attached. So, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl group, then a Grignard reagent adds a cyclohexyl group, forming a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, but oxidation of a secondary alcohol gives a ketone, not an aldehyde. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a primary alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is first reduced to a cis-alkene, then treated with a dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction to form a six-membered ring. But I don't see the dienophile in the reagents.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol ether, but I don't think that's relevant.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane with NaNH2 to form the acetylide.

2. Quench with methyl chloride to form (cyclohexyl)acetylmethyl.

Wait, but that would be CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to cyclohexane? Not sure.

3. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, giving cyclohexane with a CH2CH2 group. But that doesn't seem useful.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation to a cis-alkene.

Then, step 3 could be ozonolysis to break the double bond into two carbonyls.

But the target only has one aldehyde.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone via oxidation, then a Grignard reagent adds, forming a secondary alcohol, then oxidized to a ketone, which is then reduced to an aldehyde. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol, which is then used in a hydroxylation to form a diol, which can be oxidized.

But I'm not certain.

I think I'm stuck and should try to look for the correct answer by process of elimination.

Looking at the options, option C's reagents include O3/(CH3)2S, which is a milder ozonolysis followed by reductive workup. Then, Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, might be for elimination or for epoxide opening. But I'm not seeing how this leads to the target.

Option D's steps end with NH4OH, which is used in the workup after ozonolysis. So, perhaps after ozonolysis, the aldehyde is formed.

But I'm not seeing the complete picture.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Form the acetylide with NaNH2.

2. Quench with methyl chloride to add a methyl group.

3. Hydrogenate to form a single bond.

4. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

5. Workup to form aldehyde.

But I don't see all these steps in any option.

Looking back, perhaps the correct option is C.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2 and methyl chloride → H2/Pd → O3/(CH3)2S → Ba(OH)2.

Wait, step 4 is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination, maybe to form a double bond.

Wait, but if after ozonolysis, the molecule has carbonyl groups, then Ba(OH)2 could perform some kind of elimination, but I'm not sure.

Hmm. I'm not confident, but perhaps option C is the correct sequence. Alternatively, maybe option D.

Wait, another thought: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached, so perhaps the cyclohexane is part of a ring-opening, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option D: NaNH2 and methanol, Li and NH3, O3 and (CH3)2S, NH4OH.

But I'm not seeing how that would form the substituent.

Given all this, I'm going to make an educated guess. I think option C is correct.

Wait, no, I'm not so sure. Another thought: Ba(OH)2 is used in the oxidation of alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids. Or in the Birch reduction. Alternatively, it's used in the Hofmann elimination.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D.

Wait, I think I've spent too much time and need to make a decision. Based on the reagents, I think the correct option is C.

Wait, let me think one more time. The target has an aldehyde group, which is likely formed via oxidation of a primary alcohol. So, perhaps one of the steps is introducing a primary alcohol.

Looking at the options, option D's steps include O3 and (CH3)2S, which would form carbonyls, and then NH4OH, which is a mild acid for workup.

Hmm. I'm going to go with option D as the correct answer.


The problem involves synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule contains a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group and a substituent that includes a cyclohexyl, hydroxyl, and methyl group. The analysis of the options focuses on the sequence of reagents and their ability to transform ethynylcyclohexane into the target structure.

### Key Analysis of Options:

1. **Option A**:  
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride likely form the acetylide and methylate it.  
   - Step 2: H₂/Pd likely hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, resulting in a structure with a CH₂CH₃ group.  
   - Step 3: Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, possibly for elimination or epoxide opening.  
   - Step 4: H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O are Jones oxidation conditions, which oxidize alcohols to carboxylic acids. However, the target molecule has an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid, making this sequence unlikely.

2. **Option B**:  
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and ethyl chloride form the acetylide and ethylate it.  
   - Step 2: Li/liq. NH₃ is a strong base, possibly for elimination, forming a new double bond.  
   - Step 3: O₃/H₂O cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups via ozonolysis.  
   - Step 4: NH₄OH is a mild acid for workup. However, this sequence does not clearly explain how the cyclohexyl group is introduced or how the aldehyde is formed.

3. **Option C**:  
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride form the acetylide and methylate it.  
   - Step 2: H₂/Pd likely hydrogenates the alkyne to a cis-alkene.  
   - Step 3: O₃/(CH₃)₂S cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups via ozonolysis.  
   - Step 4: Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, possibly for elimination or ring-opening. However, the sequence does not clearly explain how the cyclohexyl group is incorporated or how the aldehyde is formed.

4. **Option D**:  
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methanol form the acetylide, but the role of methanol is unclear.  
   - Step 2: Li/liq. NH₃ is a strong base, possibly for elimination, forming a new double bond.  
   - Step 3: O₃/(CH₃)₂S cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups via ozonolysis.  
   - Step 4: NH₄OH is a mild acid for workup. This sequence is plausible for forming the aldehyde but does not clearly explain how the cyclohexyl group is introduced.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the options, none of the sequences fully explains the formation of the cyclohexyl group or the aldehyde in the target molecule. However, based on the reagents and their likely transformations, **Option D** appears to be the most plausible sequence for forming the aldehyde, even though the incorporation of the cyclohexyl group remains unclear.
