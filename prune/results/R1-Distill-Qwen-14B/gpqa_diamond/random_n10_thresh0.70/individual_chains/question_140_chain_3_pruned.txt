Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let's read through the question carefully and break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y, which produces gas W, precipitate G, and another product B. There are several clues here that I need to piece together.

First, Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So, X is probably an element that has isotopes, and it's using a heavier one. For example, maybe chlorine, which has isotopes like Cl-35 and Cl-37. So X could be Cl2 or something else containing a heavier isotope.

The reaction is violent with liquid Y. Violent reactions could be things like acid-base reactions, especially if they produce gas. For example, metals reacting with acid to produce hydrogen gas. But in this case, the gas produced, W, has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Hmm, that's an interesting clue.

Wait, the gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, the total number of protons in the molecule equals the number of neutrons. Let's think about common gases. For example, H2 gas is just two H atoms. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, so the molecule would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons. That doesn't match. What about another gas, maybe CO2? No, that's a molecule but I don't think it fits.

Wait, perhaps W is water vapor? No, because H2O has 2 H and 1 O. Let's calculate the neutrons and protons. O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons (in the common isotope). So H2O has 2*(1p, 0n) + 8p, 8n. Total protons: 2+8=10. Neutrons: 8. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe W is something like carbon monoxide, CO. Carbon has 6 protons, 6 neutrons (for 12C), and O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons. So CO has 6+8=14 protons, and 6+8=14 neutrons. Oh! So W is CO. Because in CO, the total protons equal the
