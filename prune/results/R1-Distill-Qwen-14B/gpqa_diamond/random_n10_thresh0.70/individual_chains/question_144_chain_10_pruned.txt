Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance, and I'm trying to figure out the mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember that particles like mesons can decay, and the mean decay distance is related to how long they live on average before decaying. But wait, how do I calculate that?

Let me think. I think the mean decay distance depends on the particle's lifetime. Oh right, because the distance is how far the particle travels before it decays, so it's velocity multiplied by the lifetime. So formula-wise, I think it's something like distance = velocity * lifetime.

But wait, how do I find the lifetime? Oh yeah, the lifetime is related to the decay width. The decay width Γ is connected to the lifetime τ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. I recall the formula τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Or wait, maybe it's Γ ≈ ħ / τ. Let me get that straight. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but for decay widths, I think Γ is the uncertainty in energy, and the lifetime τ is the uncertainty in time. So Γ * τ ≈ ħ, meaning τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Oh wait no, I think it's Γ = ħ / τ. Because if Γ is the width, which is an energy, then yes, Γ equals hbar divided by the lifetime. So τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, but I need to make sure about the units. Γ is given in MeV, and ħ has units of energy*time. So when I compute τ, I should get units of time.

So first, let me write down the given values. The production energy E_X is 8 GeV, but I don't think that's directly needed. The mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. Oh wait, but wait, in particle physics, the decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ. So Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, that's if Γ is the total decay width. So I think that's correct.

So, let's compute τ first. Then find the velocity of the meson, and multiply τ by velocity to get the mean distance.

So, to compute τ. Γ is 320 MeV. Let me convert that into GeV for consistency. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. 1 GeV
