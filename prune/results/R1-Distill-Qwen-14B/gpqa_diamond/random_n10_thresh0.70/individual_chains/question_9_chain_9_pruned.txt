Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about determining which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, wait, what's C3h symmetry again? Oh right, in molecular symmetry, the C3h point group consists of a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). So the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also be symmetric with respect to a horizontal mirror.

The options given are four different molecules. Let me list them out:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

I remember that triisopropyl borate is a borane with three isopropyl groups attached. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound, I think it's a cage compound with a bridge. The other two options have long names, probably involving fused rings and furan moieties.

Let's start with each option and analyze their symmetry.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. The structure is B with three isopropyl groups. Isopropyl groups are like two methyl groups attached to a central carbon. So the molecule would have three identical substituents attached to boron. Since all three are the same, maybe it has some symmetry. Boron is the central atom, so what's the geometry here? Boron usually has a trigonal planar geometry, right? So if each of the three isopropyl groups is attached in a trigonal planar fashion, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. Wait, but what symmetry does that give? If all three substituents are identical and arranged symmetrically, perhaps it has a C3 axis. But what about the mirror planes? If a molecule has a horizontal mirror plane, then when combined with a C3 axis, it would be C3h.

Wait, triisopropyl borane (I think the structure is [B(i-Pr)3]). So the molecule would have a trigonal planar structure. The central boron is in the center, with three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl is like a bulky substituent. The question is whether the molecule has C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps it doesn't. Because the isopropyl groups are themselves symmetric, but the arrangement around B might not have a horizontal mirror. Wait, in a trigonal planar structure, there's a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane. But for a horizontal mirror plane, the mirror would have to be in the same plane as the substituents. Hmm, maybe not. Maybe each isopropyl group is arranged symmetrically, so the molecule has a C3 axis, but does it have a σh plane?

Wait, maybe in the case of triisopropyl borane, the molecule is nonpolar and has symmetry. The molecule is symmetric upon 120-degree rotation, so that's the C3
