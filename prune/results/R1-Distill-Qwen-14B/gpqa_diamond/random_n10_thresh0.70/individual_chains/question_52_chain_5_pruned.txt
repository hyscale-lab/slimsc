Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

Alright, the problem is about a star whose surface is sometimes covered by dark spots. When the spots are present, covering 40% of the surface, the effective temperature (Teff) of the photosphere drops from 6000 K to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We’re supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes—so when the star has no spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, okay. I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the ratio of populations in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The equation is something like n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where n_i and n_j are the populations of the energy levels, g is the statistical weight (degeneracy), E the energies, k the Boltzmann constant, and T the temperature.

Wait, but the problem mentions that when the star has spots, the overall Teff decreases. So the spots make the star cooler, but how does that affect the Ti levels?

Let me think about the energy levels for Ti. The transition between levels 1 and 2 is at around 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet or maybe the far-ultraviolet? Either way, the wavelength corresponds to a photon with energy E = hc/λ. But maybe I don't need the exact energy right now.

The key here is that when the star's overall photospheric temperature decreases, the ratio of Ti atoms in these levels changes. The question says that when there are spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So without spots, what's the ratio compared to when there are spots?

Wait, the ratio observed is n1/n2. So when the star has spots, this ratio goes down. So when the star is cooler, n1 is lower relative to n2. But why is that?

In the Boltzmann equation, the ratio n_i/n_j depends on the temperatures and the energy difference between the levels. Let's denote ΔE = E2 - E1 (assuming E
