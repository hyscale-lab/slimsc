Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see what I remember about this. 

The question says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, which I think probably means that the EDTA is in its correct form, like deprotonated enough to complex with Ca²+ ions. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, so I guess activity coefficients aren't too much of a factor here. The given K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. 

Wait, what's the K here? Oh right, K is the formation constant, which tells us how stable the complex is. The higher the K, the more the complex forms. So in this case, K is pretty large, meaning almost all the Ca and EDTA will form the complex.

The problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution. So in the solution, we have Ca-EDTA complex, and we need to find [Ca²+]. 

I remember that the formation constant K is defined as [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Because the complex is formed in a 1:1 ratio. So the formula is K = [Complex]/([Metal][Ligand]).

Given that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, which is the total concentration of Ca in the form of the complex. Wait, but there might be some free Ca²+ and free EDTA, but because K is so large, the free [Ca²+] should be really low.

Let me think about it. Let's denote the concentration of the complex as C_total = 0.02 M. The total concentration of EDTA would be equal to that of the complex because each complex has one EDTA and one Ca²+.

Wait, but actually, the EDTA comes from the dissociation of the complex. So the total EDTA is the sum of free EDTA and the complex. But since K is so big, the complex is mostly formed, so the free EDTA is negligible compared to the complex. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the complex is 0.02 M, and if the EDTA is also in solution, but the formation is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2-.

Wait, the actual situation is that the solution is made
