Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me read the problem again.

Alright, the setup is that a light beam is propagating through a glass with an index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking, what is the speed of the light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab? And the options are given as A, B, C, D. 

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is usually given by c divided by n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. So normally, in the glass, the speed would be 1/n (since c is taken as 1 here) because c is 1. So the speed is v_glass = 1/n.

But wait, the glass is moving relative to the lab frame. So the question is about the speed of light in the glass from the lab's perspective. So this is a scenario involving relative motion. I think I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity because we're dealing with speeds that could be a significant fraction of c, but wait, the glass is moving at velocity v, which could be any value, but in reality, v is much less than c because it's a glass moving at some speed.

Wait, but in the problem, the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. Oh, so the light is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer as well. Wait, no, the glass is
