Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the photosphere is the visible part of a star, right? And the question is about iron atoms in two different stars. The key point is that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, and the energy difference between these levels is given as approximately 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, since the stars are in LTE, that stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, the Boltzmann distribution should apply here. I think the Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels to temperature. The formula is something like (n_i / n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Here, n_i is the number of atoms in energy level i, and n_j in level j. Since the energy difference is given, let's say E is the difference, E = E_i - E_j.

In this case, the excited state is probably the higher energy level. So for star_1, the population (n1) is twice that of star_2 (n2). So n1/n2 = 2. And E is the energy difference between the two levels. Oh wait, but wait the problem says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So star_1's energy level has twice the population of star_2's for the same energy level. Hmm, maybe I should think about each star's condition separately.

Wait, each star has its own temperature, T1 and T2
