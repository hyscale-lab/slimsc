Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. The choices are combinations of these.

First, I remember that SMEFT is an effective field theory that extends the Standard Model. Effective theories usually respect the same symmetries as the original theory but allow for higher-dimensional operators. So, the Standard Model respects certain symmetries, and SMEFT should as well, right?

Let me break down each symmetry:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: This is the symmetry of special relativity, meaning the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames. The Standard Model, and by extension SMEFT, must respect this because relativity is a fundamental part of our understanding of physics. So all operators in SMEFT should be Lorentz invariant. That makes sense.

2. Poincare Symmetry: This includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like shifting position in space or time). Poincare symmetry is a bigger symmetry group that includes Lorentz. So if a theory respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But does SMEFT require all operators to respect Poincare? Well, SMEFT is built in a way that it incorporates the Standard Model, which respects Poincare. So the operators in SMEFT would have to be Poincare invariant as well. But wait, in SMEFT, the operators are classified by their dimension and the symmetries. So I think SMEFT does respect Poincare symmetry, so all operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare. But wait, the question is about which must be respected by all operators. So both 1 and 2 would be correct. But let me think: Poincare includes translations. SMEFT includes terms that are higher-dimensional, but they should still transform covariantly under Poincare. So yes, operators must respect both.

3. CP symmetry: CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. The Standard Model doesn't fully respect CP symmetry, especially because of the CKM mechanism leading to CP violation. So SMEFT can have operators that violate CP. For example, operators with higher dimension might have terms that break CP. So not all operators need to respect CP symmetry.

4. CPT symmetry: This is a bigger symmetry combining C, P, and T. The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry, and SMEFT as an effective theory should as well. Because any term that violates CPT would lead to issues like non-unitary S-matrix, which is not acceptable. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

So looking back at the options:

Option 1: Lorentz Symmetry (must be respected)
Option 2: Poincare (must be respected)
Option3: CP (not necessarily)
Option4: CPT (must be respected)

The question asks which must be respected by all operators. So which of the four symmetries are required.

So which of the options include 1, 2, and 4?

Looking at the choices:

A) 1,2: So Lorentz and Poincare. Both required, but what about CPT?

B) 3,4: CP and CPT. Well, CP isn't necessarily, so B is wrong.

C) 1,2,4: So Lorentz, Poincare, CPT. That fits what I thought.

D)1,3,4: So Lorentz, CP, CPT. But since CP isn't necessarily, D is out.

So the correct answer should be option C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) extends the Standard Model while respecting certain fundamental symmetries. To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT, we analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This symmetry, which underpins special relativity, is fundamental to both the Standard Model and SMEFT. All operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: This symmetry group includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT respects the symmetries of the Standard Model, it must also respect Poincaré symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model does not fully respect CP symmetry, and SMEFT allows for operators that can violate CP. Thus, CP symmetry is not necessarily respected by all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: This symmetry is critical for maintaining unitarity in quantum field theory. The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry, and SMEFT, as an effective field theory, must also respect it. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry. Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**C) 1, 2, 4**

Answer: C
