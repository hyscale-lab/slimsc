Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? And resonance has to do with their unstable states. The question is asking about the mean decay distance of this meson X. Oh wait, mean decay distance... I think that's related to how far the meson travels before it decays. So like, the average path length before it breaks apart.

The given data includes production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. Wait, units are in GeV and MeV, but I'll need to convert them into SI units probably for calculations. But I'm not sure yet. Let me think about the formula I should use.

I remember that the mean lifetime (which relates to the decay width) is given by the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ΔE is the energy uncertainty and Δt is the time uncertainty. In particle physics, the width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. Oh, wait, but it's actually Γ = ħ * (1/τ). So τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, more precisely, the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. That makes sense. So once I have τ, I can find the mean decay distance by considering the particle's velocity and the lifetime.

But wait, what about the velocity? The mean decay distance L is given by L =
