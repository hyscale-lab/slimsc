Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember the radial velocity method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The shift in the spectral lines indicates the star's movement towards or away from us.

The question says that there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So the first thing I'm thinking is that since the stars are identical, their masses are the same. That probably means the Doppler shifts are only dependent on the planet's mass and orbital period or something like that.

Wait, the question gives the shift in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. So I guess the shift relates to the velocity of the star's movement. The bigger the shift, the higher the velocity. Oh right, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is what's measured. So K is the maximum velocity of the star towards or away from us.

The formula I remember for radial velocity semi-amplitude is K = ( (G * (M_p^3) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) ) / (2π * P^(1/3)) )

Wait, but since the planets are similar to Neptune and the stars are solar mass, M_p is much smaller than M_star. So M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, e is zero because the orbits are circular. So the formula simplifies a bit.

Wait, another approach. The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2π G) / (c * P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) )

But since M_p << M_star, (1 + M_p/M_star) ≈ 1, so K ≈ [ (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ] * (M_p / M_star^(2/3) )

But wait, since both stars have the same mass and the planets' masses are similar, M_p is same for both. So K is proportional
