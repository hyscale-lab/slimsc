Okay, so I'm trying to solve this crystallography problem. Hmm, the question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that interplanar distances relate to the unit cell parameters and the Miller indices of the plane.

Wait, rhombohedral crystals... I think they have all sides equal, but the angles between them are all the same and not 90 degrees. So in this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. Oh wait, no, wait. The question says each angle is 30 degrees. So it's a rhombohedral unit cell with a = b = c, and angles all 30 degrees.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, wait. Interatomic distance... So the atoms are at the corners of the unit cell? Like, the edge length 'a' is 10 Angstrom? Or is it something else? Because interatomic distance in a crystal is often the distance between adjacent atoms, which in a cubic structure would be the edge length. But in a rhombohedral structure, the atoms are at the corners, so the edge length 'a' would be the interatomic distance. So I think a = 10 Angstrom in this case.

The interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) is given by the formula 1/d^2 = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) - 2(hk + kl + lh)/(a^2) * cosθ, where θ is the angle between the axes. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formulas. Another formula I remember is using the reciprocal of the lattice parameters and the Miller indices.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + kl + hl) * cos α ), since all angles are the same in the rhombohedral case. But wait, no, I think the formula accounts for the angles. Alternatively, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c, and angles α, β, γ is given by:

1/d² = (h²/a²)(1/(sin²α * sin²β * sin²γ) ... Wait, maybe that's too complicated. Maybe I should think about the structure factor formula or use the Miller indices formula.

Wait, I think the more straightforward formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ )

But wait, since α = β = γ =30°, and a=b=c, perhaps this simplifies. So for the (111) plane, h = k = l =1.

So plugging in the values:

d = a / sqrt(1 + 1 + 1 - 2*(1*1 cos30) - 2*(1*1 cos30) - 2*(1*1 cos30) )

Wait, let me compute the numerator inside the sqrt. Let's break it down.

Sum of squares: 1 + 1 + 1 =3.

The sum of the products: 2*(hk + hl + kl) cosθ, where θ is 30°, and each product is 1*1. So that's 2*(1
