Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the solution. Let me read it again carefully.

So, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. They want to compute the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming black body radiation.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, the luminosity of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So, the luminosity depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power. Since both stars are black bodies, we can model their luminosities this way.

Now, the problem mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, wait, the peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's law: λ_max ≈ b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.9×10^-3 m·K). So if λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The peak wavelength occurs at a certain temperature. So if λ_max is the same, then T is the same. So both stars have the same temperature? If that's the case, then T1 = T2.

But wait, the problem says that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. Radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. So, for Star_1, its radial velocity is zero, meaning it's not moving towards or away from us along that axis. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. How does that affect their observed temperatures?

Wait a second, wait. When a star is moving towards us (or away), there's a Doppler shift. So the observed wavelength is shifted. But in the problem, they found the wavelengths at
