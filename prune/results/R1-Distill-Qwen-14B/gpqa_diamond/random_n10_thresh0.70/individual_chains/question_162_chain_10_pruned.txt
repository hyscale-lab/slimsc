Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the area of a pseudosphere given a specific metric. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on my general relativity, but let me think it through.

First, the metric is given as ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, pseudosphere usually refers to a 2D surface in 3D space, but here it's in 2D, maybe a 2-sphere? Or is it something else.

Wait, the metric looks like it's in 2D because it's only in terms of x and y. So perhaps it's a 2-dimensional surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space, but I'm not sure. But the question is about the area, so maybe I can compute the area of the surface defined by this metric.

Wait, the general formula for the area in a 2D metric. If the metric is ds² = g(x,y) (dx² + dy²), then the area element would be sqrt(g) dx dy, right? But wait, more accurately, the area element in 2D when the metric is diagonal (like this case) is just (1/sqrt(det g)) dx dy, but wait, isn't det g the determinant? Wait, no, wait: for the metric ds² = g_{xx} dx² + 2g_{xy} dx dy + g_{yy} dy², the determinant is g_{xx}g_{yy} - (g_{xy})². But in this case, the metric is diagonal, with g_{xy}=0. So the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2. Wait, no, wait: the metric here is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²), which can be written as ds² = g_{xx} dx² + g_{yy} dy², where g_{xx}=g_{yy}=32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))². But when calculating the area element, it's sqrt(det g) dx dy. Wait, no, wait: actually, the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy. Wait, because if the metric is diagonal, the area element is sqrt(g_{xx} g_{yy}) dx dy. Oh, wait, because in 2D, the area element is sqrt(g_{11}g_{22} - g_{12}^2) dx^1 dx^2. Since g_{
