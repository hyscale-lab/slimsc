Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure out each star's apparent magnitude because the spectrographs have different brightness limits.

Let me start by understanding the given information. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than V mag 16. So, any star with V mag <=17 can be seen by ESPRESSO, and for HIRES, V mag <=16.

Wait, the question is about which stars can be detected with both. So the star's apparent magnitude must be <=17 (since ESPRESSO is less sensitive, needing brighter stars) and also <=16 (since HIRES is more sensitive). Wait, no, wait. Actually, the brightness is higher when the magnitude is lower. So, if a star is brighter (lower magnitude), both can see it. But if a star is dimmer, only one might see it.

Wait, no. The question is which stars can be detected by both. So the star's apparent V magnitude must be bright enough for both. So the apparent mag must be less than or equal to 16 mag, because HIRES can't see brighter than 16, and ESPRESSO can see up to 17. So for a star to be seen by both, it must have V mag <=16.

Wait, but wait: no. Let me think again. The apparent magnitude is what's observed. So, if a star's apparent magnitude is 17, it can be observed by ESPRESSO but not by HIRES because HIRES only goes up to 16. So to be detected by both, the star's apparent V magnitude must be less than or equal to 16 mag.

Wait, no. Wait, the way the question is phrased: With ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 (so <=17) can be observed. For HIRES, brighter than 16 mag (so <=16). So, a star must have apparent V mag <=16 to be detected by both. Because if it's brighter than 16 (lower magnitude), both can see it. If it's 17, ESPRESSO can, HIRES can't. So, the stars that can be detected by both must have apparent V mag <=16.

So I need to find
