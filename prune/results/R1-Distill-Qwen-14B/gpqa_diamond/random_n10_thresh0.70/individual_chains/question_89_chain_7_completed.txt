Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's go through it step by step. So, the question involves several reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to visualize each step.

First, the initial compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating it with excess KOH at 240°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) react with strong bases like KOH, they undergo elimination reactions, forming alkenes via an E2 mechanism. So, I think this would dehydrohalogenate to form an alkene. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, the elimination would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, right? Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, 1,3-dibromo means the bromines are on two adjacent carbons? No, wait, no—adamantane is a diamondoid structure. Oh wait, no, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. But I might be getting confused here. Alternatively, maybe it's 1,3-dibromo meaning that the two adjacent carbons each have a bromine. Hmm, I'm not sure about the structure of adamantane, but I think when you have dihalides on adjacent carbons, elimination forms a double bond.

Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. KOH is a strong base, so elimination makes sense. The product after KOH would be 1,3-adamantadiene, but wait, that can't be right because heating di-bromo compounds with KOH usually gives alkenes. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane eliminating two HBr molecules would form an alkene. Wait, no, each elimination removes one HBr. Wait, each E2 reaction removes one HBr, so two eliminations from 1,3-dibromoadamantane would give a diene? Or maybe each bromine is on adjacent carbons, so one elimination forms a double bond between them. Oh wait, perhaps the structure is such that the two bromines are on adjacent carbons. So heating with KOH would eliminate two HBr to form a conjugated diene? Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a trans elimination, forming an alkene.

But let me think about the NMR data provided. The product 1 has an NMR with signals at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). Wait, that 4.79 ppm is a singlet integrating for 2H. That sounds like maybe an -OCH2- group, like an ether or an epoxide? Or perhaps an alkoxy group attached to two protons. Alternatively, that could be a methylene adjacent to an electronegative atom. Wait, but the IR spectrum has a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group (like an ester, ketone, or aldehyde). So product 1 has a carbonyl.

Hmm, so perhaps the reaction isn't an elimination. Wait, what else could KOH do? Maybe it's a substitution. If KOH is in excess, perhaps it's a double substitution. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane could undergo two SN2 reactions, but that would require a good leaving group and a suitable structure for inversion. But adamantane is a very rigid structure, so maybe the bromines are in positions that allow for such substitution. Wait, but the product's NMR doesn't show a lot of splitting, but the IR shows a carbonyl. So maybe it's a substitution where the bromide is replaced with something else.

Wait, maybe it's an elimination followed by a hydration? But I don't think that's the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a ring-opening or some kind of substitution that forms a carbonyl group.

Wait, another possibility: when dihalides (like 1,2-dihaloalkanes) react with strong bases, they can form epoxides. But wait, that's usually when you have vicinal dihalides and a base like NaOH. Wait no, epoxidation is usually done with other reagents, like mCPBA. Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing an elimination to form an alkene, and then some other reaction.

Wait, but the product's IR has a carbonyl, so maybe the initial product is an epoxide. Wait, but epoxides don't have a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps after elimination, another reaction occurs, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, let me think about the reaction again. The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating with KOH. Maybe each bromine is on adjacent carbon atoms. So, when KOH is added, it eliminates HBr from each, forming a double bond between those carbons. So, product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene? Wait, but I thought that would be a diene. But then the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 (2H), which could be a trans double bond's vinylic protons. Hmm, but 4.79 is more upfield than typical vinyl protons. Alternatively, maybe it's an allylic position.

Wait, but wait, the initial product after KOH is a light yellow solid. Maybe it's not elimination but substitution. Suppose each Br is replaced by an -OH group via SN2 mechanism. So, product would be 1,3-diol. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that can't be it. Alternatively, maybe KOH is causing elimination to form a double bond (an alkene), which then reacts with something else. But wait, I think the initial product is an epoxide? No, because for epoxide formation, you usually have a different setup, like using a peracid or a base in a specific way.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, and then something else happens. But if that's the case, the IR would show a peak around 1680 cm^-1 for a C=C, but the given IR is 1720 cm^-1, which is more like a carbonyl. So perhaps the initial step is not elimination but something else.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution where each Br is replaced by an O- group, like forming a diol. But then why the IR shows a carbonyl? Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone. Wait, how?

Wait, another thought: Maybe the dihalide undergoes a substitution with KOH to form a ketone. But that seems unlikely because substitution of Br with OH would give a diol, not a ketone. Unless there's a neighboring group participation or some kind of elimination followed by oxidation. But I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination, forming a carbonyl. Wait, but how? That would require losing two HBr and forming a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne? But that's usually done with metals like Na or Mg, not KOH.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the NMR of product 1. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a triplet or some other splitting. But what else? The 2.41-2.23 region (10H) suggests some equivalent protons, maybe in a ring structure, perhaps adjacent to a carbonyl. The 1.94 (2H) might be a methylene group attached to something else.

Wait, another approach: The IR peak at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group. So product 1 has a carbonyl. So perhaps the initial reaction forms a ketone or an ester. But how?

Wait, perhaps the dihalide is treated with KOH to form a diol, but then it undergoes some oxidation. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is treated with KOH to form a diol, which then dehydrates to form a carbonyl. Wait, but dehydration of a diol would typically form an alkene, not a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of the formation of a geminal diol, but then I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is treated with a strong base, leading to the formation of a carbonyl through elimination. Wait, maybe each Br is on adjacent carbons, and elimination leads to a carbonyl via a dehydrohalogenation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Hofmann elimination, but that's for amides. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is a substitution where each Br is replaced by an O- group, but then something else happens. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an epoxide, but I thought epoxides don't have a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product isn't an epoxide. Maybe the initial reaction forms an alkene, which then reacts with something else. But the question says that product 1 is formed by heating with KOH, with no other reagents mentioned. So perhaps the product is an alkene, but then the IR suggests a carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. How could that happen? If the dihalide undergoes a double elimination, perhaps losing two HBr molecules and forming a carbonyl group. For example, if two adjacent Br atoms are removed, and the two adjacent carbons form a double bond with each other, but that's elimination. Alternatively, if the two Brs are on the same carbon (geminal), elimination could form a carbonyl. Oh wait! If it's a gem-dibromide, then elimination would form a ketone. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane implies the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3. Are they on the same carbon? No, so that can't be. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a cyclic ketone. But I'm not sure how.

Wait, maybe the initial product is a diol, and then it's oxidized. But KOH isn't an oxidizer. Alternatively, perhaps the diol undergoes some kind of ring-opening, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible structure of product 1 based on the NMR. Let's see, 4.79 ppm (2H) – this could be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O. For example, -OCH2O- in an ether, but that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group next to a CH2. Wait, if it's a ketone, the adjacent CH2 would have protons around 2.2-2.4 ppm. Wait, but the 2.41-2.23 region is 10H. That's a lot of protons, perhaps in a ring structure.

Wait, the 10H in that region suggests equivalent protons, maybe in an adamantane-like structure where several CH2 groups are present. The 1.94 (2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl group. So putting this together, maybe product 1 is an adamantane ring with a carbonyl group and an adjacent CH2-O-CH2 group or something similar. But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, another approach: the IR peak at 1720 cm^-1 is indicative of a ketone or an ester. Let's consider that product 1 is a ketone. So the structure would have a carbonyl group. Then, perhaps in product 1, one of the bromines is replaced by a carbonyl group.

Wait, but how would that substitution occur? That seems tricky. Alternatively, maybe the initial reaction forms an epoxide, which then undergoes some ring-opening. But I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, maybe I should think about the next step. Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But the starting material here is product 1, which I'm not yet sure about.

Wait, product 1's NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. If that's an OCH2O group, like in a diether, then product 2 might undergo some reaction. Alternatively, if product 1 is an ester, perhaps the OCH2 would be part of an ester group.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone. For example, if the structure is something like adamantanone. Then, when treated with a Lewis acid like Al(i-Pr)3, it might undergo some kind of Friedel-Crafts acylation, but adamantane is an unreactive structure. Hmm.

Wait, maybe product 2 is formed via a Friedel-Crafts acylation. But since the starting material is a ketone, perhaps it's not. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an alcohol, and the Lewis acid is used to form an acylium ion or something else.

Alternatively, product 2 could be the result of a Diels-Alder reaction, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let's move to the next step. Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis is a reaction that cleaves double bonds. The conditions here are typical for ozonolysis followed by reductive workup (with dimethyl sulfide, which is a mild reductant).

So, if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl groups. The resulting product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

But wait, in the problem statement, the product after ozonolysis is product 3. The NMR of product 3 is what's being asked.

So, going back, product 2 must have a double bond. So product 1 must have undergone a reaction that introduced a double bond when treated with aluminum isopropoxide.

Wait, but product 1 is formed by heating with KOH, and then product 1 is treated with Al(i-Pr)3 to form product 2, which has a double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and when treated with a Lewis acid, it undergoes dehydration to form a diene. Oh wait, that makes sense. So, product 1 is a diol (1,3-adamantanediol), and then heating with a Lewis acid catalyst like Al(i-Pr)3 could cause elimination, forming a diene. But wait, the product 2 would then have a double bond.

But wait, the initial product 1's IR has a carbonyl, so that's conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ether, and then product 2 is a diene.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. Wait, but I thought epoxides don't have a carbonyl. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester. But that would require substitution of Br with an ester group, which I'm not sure about.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to summarize what I know:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → heated with KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid)
   - NMR: 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H)
   - IR: 1720 cm^-1 (carbonyl)

2. Product 1 → heated with excess Al(i-Pr)3 → product 2.

3. Product 2 → ozonolysis → product 3.

4. Product 3's 1H NMR is being analyzed. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H (excluding exchangeable).

So, perhaps product 1 is a diol (if KOH caused substitution of both Brs with OH groups), but that doesn't explain the carbonyl in IR. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the NMR data. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone.

Wait, another angle: What if product 1 is a diketone? But then the NMR would show carbonyl protons, which are usually around 2-3 ppm, but the 4.79 ppm is higher. Maybe not.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a carbonyl with an adjacent OCH2 group. For example, something like O=C-O-CH2-... Maybe as part of an ester or ether structure.

Wait, the 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps part of an ester group. So maybe product 1 is an ester, formed via substitution. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is formed via elimination of two HBr, resulting in a conjugated diene, but I'm not sure how that would give a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the KOH induces an elimination from each Br, leading to a conjugated diene, and then further reaction. But I don't see how that would form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone formed by some kind of elimination and rearrangement. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a substitution where each Br is replaced by an OH group, forming a diol, which then loses water under the reaction conditions to form a carbonyl. For example, if the diol undergoes elimination to form a ketone.

Wait, but that would require the diol to be in a position where elimination would form a carbonyl. For example, if the diol is on adjacent carbons, with a hydrogen on each, they could eliminate to form a double bond. But that would require two eliminations and would give a diene, not a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on this first step. Let me try to think of the possible structure of product 1. The NMR shows 4.79 ppm for 2H, which is a singlet. That suggests that these two protons are equivalent and not split by neighboring protons. Maybe they're part of a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2O or OCH2R. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) suggests a ring structure, perhaps an adamantane ring with some substituents. The 1.94 (2H) could be a CH2 next to a carbonyl.

If product 1 has a carbonyl group, perhaps it's a ketone. Let's imagine that product 1 is 1,3-adamantanone. Then, what would product 2 be?

Product 1: 1,3-adamantanone.

Heating with excess Al(i-Pr)3: This is a Lewis acid catalyst. Perhaps it's used in a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but adamantane is a polycyclic structure and not aromatic, so Friedel-Crafts might not apply. Alternatively, maybe it's used to form an enol.

Wait, when a ketone is treated with a Lewis acid like AlCl3, it can form an acylium ion, which can react in acylations. But I'm not sure about the application here.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ether, and the Lewis acid is causing some rearrangement. Or perhaps it's causing an elimination.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diol, and when treated with Al(i-Pr)3, it loses water to form a conjugated diene. So product 2 would be a diene.

Then, product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis, which would cleave the double bonds into carbonyl groups.

But let's tie this all together.

Assuming product 1 is a diol (1,3-adamantanediol), which upon treatment with Al(i-Pr)3, an acid catalyst, undergoes elimination to form a conjugated diene. So product 2 would have a structure with a conjugated diene somewhere in the adamantane framework.

Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would cleave each double bond into carbonyl groups. So if the diene is a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. For a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would typically form two carbonyl groups. For example, 1,3-pentadiene would form two aldehydes upon ozonolysis.

But in the case of adamantane, the structure is quite rigid. So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups.

Now, the NMR of product 3: the most deshielded hydrogen (excluding those that exchange) would be near these carbonyl groups. The coupling pattern would depend on the neighboring protons.

Wait, when a diene is ozonolyzed, each end produces carbonyl groups. If the diene is symmetric, the resulting product would have equivalent protons. But if the diene is part of a ring structure, the resulting product would have specific coupling patterns.

In adamantane, the diene might be part of a bridge structure. Ozonolysis would break the bridge, leading to ketones or other carbonyl groups.

But let's think about product 3. The most deshielded H is likely near a carbonyl group. In such a case, the H would be coupled to adjacent Hs.

Assuming that, perhaps each end of the ozonolyzed product has a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. So, the Hs on the CH2 would be next to each other and perhaps coupled to each other and to any other adjacent Hs.

Wait, maybe the structure after ozonolysis is something like two ketones with CH2 groups next to them. So, each CH2 would have two Hs. These Hs would couple with each other (as they are adjacent) and perhaps with any other neighboring Hs.

Wait, but let's model this. Suppose after ozonolysis, each CH2 group is next to a carbonyl.

In that case, each CH2 would have two Hs, and each H would be adjacent to another H on the same CH2 (so coupling as a triplet if coupled to two adjacent Hs) and perhaps coupled to Hs on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but if the ozonolysis breaks a conjugated diene into two carbonyls, each carbonyl would be at the end, and the adjacent carbon would have a CH2 group.

So, for example, if the diene was CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, ozonolysis would break into two CH2-O zones? No, ozonolysis of a diene would form two carbonyls. So, for a structure like CH2=CH-CH2-CH2, ozonolysis would give two aldehydes, perhaps. But in our case, the diene is part of an adamantane structure, which is more complex.

But the key point is that after ozonolysis, each end of the former diene becomes a carbonyl group. The adjacent carbons would have CH2 groups leading to these carbonyls.

In product 3, the Hs adjacent to the carbonyl would be on CH2 groups. Each of these Hs would be split by adjacent Hs.

So, for a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, each H would be coupled to the two Hs on the same CH2 (giving a triplet) and possibly coupled to Hs on adjacent carbons if any.

Wait, but in the case of a symmetric structure, each CH2 would have two Hs, each coupling to each other and perhaps to Hs on adjacent carbons.

But if the structure is such that each CH2 has only two Hs and is not adjacent to any other Hs, then each H would only see the two on the same CH2, giving a triplet.

Alternatively, if there are other Hs nearby, the coupling could be more complex.

Wait, another possibility: If the CH2 group is next to another CH2 group, each H would couple with the two Hs on its own CH2 and the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. That would result in a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the Hs are next to a CH group, the coupling might be different.

But given the NMR data of product 1, perhaps the structure is such that after ozonolysis, each H adjacent to the carbonyl is part of a CH2 group that's next to another CH2 group. So, each H would couple with two Hs from their own CH2 and two Hs from the adjacent CH2.

Wait, but that might lead to a triplet of triplets. Alternatively, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled to two Hs on the same carbon and one H on an adjacent carbon, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely certain. Let's try to think of an example.

Suppose the ozonolysis produces two carbonyl groups at each end of a former diene. Each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group. So, each CH2 is between the carbonyl and another part of the molecule.

In this case, each H on the CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 (so a triplet) and perhaps coupled to Hs on the next CH2 group. If the next group is another CH2, then each H would see two Hs from their own CH2 and two from the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the next group is a CH, then the coupling would be different.

Wait, but in product 3's NMR, the most deshielded H would be near the carbonyl, so perhaps it's on a CH group adjacent to the carbonyl. Or perhaps it's on a CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, in the initial product 1, the NMR shows 4.79 ppm (2H, singlet), which might be a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps as OCH2O. Then, when product 1 is treated with Al(i-Pr)3, perhaps it forms a carbocation or facilitates elimination, leading to a diene in product 2. Then, ozonolysis would break that diene into two carbonyls.

So, product 2 would have a diene structure. Ozonolysis would cleave each double bond into carbonyl groups. Thus, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups where the double bonds were.

But wait, ozonolysis of a diene would form two carbonyl groups. So, the resulting product 3 would have two such groups.

In product 3, the most deshielded Hs would be adjacent to these carbonyls. For example, each carbonyl might be next to a CH2 group, and the Hs on those CH2s would be deshielded.

Each H on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would couple with the two Hs on the same CH2 (so a triplet) and perhaps with Hs on adjacent groups. If the CH2 is next to another CH2, each H would see two Hs on their own CH2 and two on the adjacent, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but the question asks about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. So, perhaps each H is a triplet of triplets because it's coupled to two Hs on its own CH2 and two Hs on an adjacent CH2.

Alternatively, if the Hs are in a CH group next to the carbonyl, they might have a different coupling pattern.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think of another approach.

In ozonolysis, when a diene is cleaved, each end becomes a carbonyl. If the diene was part of a structure with CH2 groups adjacent to the double bonds, then ozonolysis would produce two carbonyl groups with adjacent CH2 groups.

So, for example, if the diene was part of a structure like CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 (but in a ring), ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups, each adjacent to CH2 groups.

In the resulting product, each H on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would be coupled to the two Hs on the same CH2 and perhaps to Hs on the next CH2 group.

Assuming each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, each H would have coupling to two Hs on its own CH2 (giving a triplet) and two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (giving another triplet). The combination would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if each H is coupled to two Hs on its own CH2 and one H on the adjacent CH2, it would be a triplet of doublets, but that's not one of the options. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

If the Hs are coupled to three other Hs (like two on their own CH2 and one on an adjacent group), that would be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, no. Let me think about splitting. Each H on a CH2 group would be split by the two Hs on the same CH2, giving a triplet. Additionally, if each H is also coupled to two Hs on an adjacent CH2 group, each would split into a triplet again. So the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if each H is coupled to two Hs on their own CH2 and two on another adjacent CH2, that would lead to a triplet of triplets because each coupling is to two Hs, each leading to a triplet.

So, in product 3, the most deshielded H (on the CH2 next to carbonyl) would have a coupling pattern of a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

But wait, looking at the options, option B is triplet of triplets. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs are only coupled to their own CH2 group, making a triplet. But that would be option A.

But considering that after ozonolysis, the structure may have two adjacent CH2 groups, each H would be coupled to two Hs on their own CH2 and two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So, the correct answer would be B) triplet of triplets.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH likely results in an elimination reaction, forming a product with a carbonyl group. The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl. The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H singlet; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests a structure with a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl and a rigid adamantane-like framework.

2. **Reaction with Al(i-Pr)₃**:  
   Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This step likely facilitates further elimination or rearrangement, forming product 2, which contains a double bond (diene). The rigid adamantane framework remains intact, with the double bond positioned for subsequent ozonolysis.

3. **Ozonolysis**:  
   Product 2 undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, cleaving the double bond into two carbonyl groups. This forms product 3, which retains the rigid adamantane framework but now has carbonyl groups at the sites of the former double bond.

4. **NMR Analysis of Product 3**:  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group and is coupled to two hydrogens on the same CH₂ (resulting in a triplet) and two hydrogens on an adjacent CH₂ group (also resulting in a triplet). The combined coupling pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet of triplets.

**Answer: B**
