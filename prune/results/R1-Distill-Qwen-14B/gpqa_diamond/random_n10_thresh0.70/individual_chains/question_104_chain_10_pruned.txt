Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, let me read the question again. So, there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected them, and the spectral line shifts are given for each. Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is, how many times longer is the orbital period of Planet #2 compared to Planet #1?

Wait, I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift in wavelength is related to the velocity of the star towards or away from us.

The formula I think is something like the velocity semi-amplitude K = (v) is given by (2πG)^(1/3) multiplied by (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) )^(1/ something). Wait, perhaps I should think more carefully.

Oh right, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (sin i) / ( (P * (1 day)^-1 )^(1/3) )

But wait, since both planets have masses similar to Neptune, and the stars are solar mass, M_p is much less than M_star. So M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, assuming circular orbits so e=0, so that term is 1. Also, sin i is approximately 1 because the inclination is close to 90 degrees (edge-on), which is usually the case when a planet is detected via RV method.

So simplifying, K ≈ (G * M_p )^(1/3) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) * (something). Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another approach. The formula for K is:

K = ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(
