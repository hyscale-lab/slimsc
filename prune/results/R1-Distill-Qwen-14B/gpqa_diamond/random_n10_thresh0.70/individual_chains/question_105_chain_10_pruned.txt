Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Hmm, let's read it again carefully. So, the question is about a star with certain characteristics and how it's being observed. The star has the same radius as the Sun, right? And one hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because of this, when the star rotates, the spots come into view and cause variations in brightness, which could mimic the presence of an exoplanet. The question is asking: if there were no spots, what size exoplanet would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as these spots?

Wait, so the star's brightness variation due to the spots is similar to that of an exoplanet transiting in front of the star. So, when the planet transits, it blocks some light, causing a dip in brightness, which is called the transit method for detecting exoplanets. Similarly, the spots on the star would cause a dip as they rotate into view. But wait, in this case, the spots are cooler, so they actually make the star appear slightly dimmer when they're facing us, right? So when the star rotates so that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the overall brightness would decrease because the spots are cooler and less bright.

So, the problem is to find the radius ratio (Rpl/Rstar) of a planet that would cause the same change in brightness amplitude as the spots do.

Wait, but how do these brightness variations work? For the exoplanet, when it transits the star, the amount
