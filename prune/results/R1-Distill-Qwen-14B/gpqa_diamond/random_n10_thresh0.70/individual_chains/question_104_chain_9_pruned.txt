Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet, or the closer it is to the star, right?

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. So, the mass of the stars isn't different, and the planet masses are the same—Neptune is less massive than Jupiter, but more than Earth. So the RV method's shift would depend on the planet's mass and the distance between the star and planet.

Wait, the RV method gives the velocity of the star towards and away from us. The formula I remember is something like v = (G * (M_planet) / (4π²))^(1/3) * (1 / (a * (M_star)^(1/3))) )? Or maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) = [ (G * (M_planet) sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (1 AU)^ (1/3) ) )... Wait, maybe that's getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, I think the formula is K = ( (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) ) / ( ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) ) ) * (1 / c ), where c is the speed of light? Or maybe I'm overcomplicating. 

Wait, I think a simpler approach might be to use the relation between the RV semi-amplitude (K) and the orbital period (P), given that the star's mass is similar to the sun and the planet's mass is the same for both.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by: 

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) ] * [ (1) / ( (1 AU) * (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3
