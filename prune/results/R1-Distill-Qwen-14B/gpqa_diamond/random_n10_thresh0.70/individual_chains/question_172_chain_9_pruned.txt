Okay, so I have this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when studying stars, the photosphere is the layer from which most of the light is emitted. And the question is about iron atoms in the photospheres of two stars. 

The problem says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to those in star_2. Oh right, the excitation of atoms depends on temperature. The energy levels are quantized, so higher temperatures lead to more excitation.

Wait, what's the concept here? Oh, it's probably about the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann factor tells us the population of different energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium. The formula I remember is something like n_i = n_0 * exp(- (E_i)/(k T)), where n_i is the number of atoms in state i, n_0 is the ground state population, E_i is the energy of state i, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference between the two energy levels is given as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. Let's denote the energy levels as E_2 and E_1, where E_2 is higher than E_1. The excitation refers to the number of atoms in the higher energy level. So, the ratio of the populations of the two levels is given by the Boltzmann factor.

Wait, the question says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. But wait, what's the exact wording? Oh, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, the number of excited atoms in star_1's photosphere is twice that of star_2's.

Wait no, in the context of Boltzmann distribution, the excitation is the ratio of atoms in a higher energy level relative to the lower. Or wait, maybe the problem is considering the ratio between the two stars for the same energy levels. Wait, the energy difference is the same for both stars, because it's the same transition for iron, so ΔE is the same for both.

So, for each star, the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the ground state is given by the Boltzmann factor. Let's denote the ratio as R = n_upper / n_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T)). 

Wait, or
