Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light propagating through glass that's moving. Hmm, let me think about it. I remember something about the index of refraction and how it affects the speed of light. Wait, the index of refraction n is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed in the medium, right? So the speed of light in the glass when it's stationary would be c/n, which is 1/n because c is given as 1 here.

But wait, the glass is moving. Oh right, this involves relative motion. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam and towards the observer. Wait, no—the way it's phrased, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, and toward the observer. Hmm, so if the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction, maybe that's adding some effect on the observed speed.

I remember that when you have objects moving in the same direction as light, you use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Oh, right! The formula that relates the velocities in different frames. I think it's (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c²), but wait, u is the velocity of the light in the glass's frame, and v is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab frame. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, wait. Let me get this straight. The light is moving through the glass. In the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is 1/n. So the speed u is 1/n, and the glass is moving at speed v in the lab frame. So from the lab frame, what would be the observed speed of the light?

Using the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. So yeah, the formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²). But since c is 1 here, it simplifies to (u + v)/(1 + u*v).

Substituting u = 1/n, so u' = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n)*v ). Hmm, that can be rewritten. Let's factor out 1/n from numerator and denominator.

Wait, let me compute that:

Numerator: (1 + n v)/n

Denominator: (n + v)/n

So the n's cancel out, leaving (1 + n v)/(n + v).

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v), which matches this. So that's the correct answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the frame of reference.

Wait, in the glass's frame, the light is moving at 1/n towards the observer. Because the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is going in the same direction. So when the glass moves towards the observer, the light's speed in the lab frame would be higher, right? Because the glass is bringing the light towards the observer faster.

Alternatively, another way to think: when the glass moves towards the observer, the light's speed as seen by the observer should remain c. Wait, that's confusing. Because in a vacuum, the speed is always c regardless of the frame. But here, the medium is moving. So maybe that approach doesn't directly apply.

Wait, no. Because the light is in the glass, which is a medium, so the speed is not c. But in the lab frame, the glass is moving. So the speed of the light in the lab frame is what we're calculating.

Wait, but according to the velocity addition formula, the speed is (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²) = (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n) v). As I calculated before, which gives (1 + n v)/(n + v). So that's option A.

Looking at the options:

A) (1 +n*v)/(n +v)

B) 1

C) (1 +n*v)/(n - v)

D) (1 -n*v)/(n +v)

So the correct answer is A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. In the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is \( u = \frac{1}{n} \), where \( n \) is the index of refraction. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam and toward the observer. 

The relativistic velocity addition formula is:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
\]

Since \( c = 1 \), this simplifies to:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + u v}
\]

Substituting \( u = \frac{1}{n} \), we get:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

To simplify further, multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n \):

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. The other options do not align with the relativistic velocity addition formula or the given conditions.

**Answer: A**
