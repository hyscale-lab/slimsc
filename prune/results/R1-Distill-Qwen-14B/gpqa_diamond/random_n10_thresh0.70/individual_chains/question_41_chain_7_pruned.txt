Alright, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to work through it. Okay, the question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I remember that when light travels through a medium like glass, its speed changes based on the refractive index. But wait, the glass itself is moving, so how does that affect the observed speed?

The setup says the glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam and towards the observer in the lab. So the observer is in the lab frame, and the glass is moving relative to that frame.

Wait, I think this is a problem involving reference frames and possibly the relativistic addition of velocities? Because when objects move, their velocities add according to special relativity, not classically. But wait, wait. Let me think. The speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, right? Because of Einstein's postulate.

So, the light is inside the glass, which has a refractive index n. The speed of light in the glass would be c/n in the rest frame of the glass. But in the lab frame, the glass is moving. So I need to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab.

Wait, but how do relative velocities work here. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n. But in the lab frame, the glass is moving, so we have to apply the velocity addition formula.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/cÂ²). Wait, but wait, no. Wait, in the glass's frame,
