Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about identifying a final product after a series of reactions. The starting compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO, and there are NMR data provided. The reagents used are first NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, and finally aqueous KOH with heat.

First, let's parse the NMR data. The 1H-NMR shows five signals:

- 9.72 ppm, triplet (t), 1H. That's a high ppm, which often suggests an aldehyde proton. But wait, the integration is 1H, so it's a single proton. Aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, sometimes it's an acidic proton like from a phenol, but phenol protons are around 5 ppm usually, unless they're exchanging. Oh wait, but here it's a triplet, which would imply coupling with two other protons. Aldehyde protons typically are deshielded and don't split much because they're next to carbonyl. Hmm, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, could it be an aldehyde? Or maybe an aromatic ring with some coupling? I'm a bit confused here.

Next, 6.98 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. That could be aromatic protons. Maybe part of a para-substituted benzene ring. For example, two protons adjacent to substituents. Like if there's a substituent on the ring, and the neighboring protons are two in number, each as a doublet.

6.51 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. Also aromatic. Possibly another set of protons that are adjacent to substituents. Maybe if there's a substituent on the benzene ring, and the protons are next to it, appearing as a doublet. For example, if the substituent is in the para position, the adjacent (ortho) protons would be split into a doublet.

6.27 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange or being in a position where splitting isn't clear. Two protons. Could this be an -OH group? But in the NMR, if it's a broad singlet integrating to 2H, perhaps it's more like a diol, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe it's protons adjacent to an oxygen, like in a di-substituted ring. Or wait, perhaps these are vinylic protons, like in an enol form. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents that cause the protons to be deshielded but as a singlet? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's something else, like a di-substituted benzene ring that's causing these protons to couple in a certain way.

3.66 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. That's a downfield shift. 3.6 is a bit upfield for CH2 groups attached to something. Maybe CH2 groups next to an oxygen? Like an OCH2 group, but in this case, the shift is 3.66, which is a bit lower than typical OCH2. Or it could be a CH2 adjacent to a
