Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. 

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh, right, and the particle is moving along the x-axis. From the problem, when measurements are taken, particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. That means the wave function must be zero outside this region, right? Or wait, no, the wave function isn't necessarily zero, but the probability of finding the particle is zero outside. Oh, right, because the wave function squared gives the probability density. So, the wave function must be non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But wait, looking at the wave function given, I don't see any exponential decay or boundary conditions applied. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. But wait, that seems a bit odd. Because the wave function in quantum mechanics should satisfy the normalization condition. Oh, that's probably the key here. Because the total probability must be 1. So I'll need to integrate the square of the absolute value of the wave function over the region where it's non-zero, which is from x=1 to x=3, and set that equal to 1.

So the wave function is ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1 + x)] - 0.5i. The absolute square of ψ is |ψ|^2 = ψ*ψ, where ψ* is the complex conjugate.

Let me compute that. The wave function is a real part plus an imaginary part. So ψ = (a/sqrt(1+x)) + (-0.5i). The conjugate ψ* would be (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, no, wait. The original is (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So ψ* would be (a/sqrt(1+x)) plus 0.5i. Hmm, let me think.

Wait, actually, the complex conjugate of ψ would flip the sign of the imaginary part. So if ψ is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, then ψ* is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) + 0.5i.

So when I multiply ψ and ψ*, the imaginary parts will cancel out? Let me compute |ψ|^2.

|ψ|^2 = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2. Because when you multiply out the terms, the cross terms (the parts with a/(sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by 0.5i and the conjugate) would involve imaginary terms, which when multiplied by each other (since one has +0.5i and the other -0.5i) would give real terms, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe it's easier to compute it as ψ times its conjugate.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of ψ as having real part Re = a/sqrt(1+x) and imaginary part Im = -0.5. Then |ψ|^2 = Re² + Im². Because when you multiply (Re + i Im)(Re -
