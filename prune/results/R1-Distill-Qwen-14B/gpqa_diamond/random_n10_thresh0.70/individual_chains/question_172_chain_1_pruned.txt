Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're told that the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can use the Boltzmann equation here.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium. The equation is something like (n_upper)/(n_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k_B T)). Right.

But wait, in this case, since the excitation is higher in star_1, the number of atoms in the excited state is more there. So for star_1 and star_2, we can set up two equations.

Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 = n_upper1 / n_lower1 = 2 (since it's twice as excited). For star_2, the ratio would be R2 = n_upper2 / n_lower2 = 1 (because it's half as excited? Or wait, no. Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited." So maybe the excitation level (the ratio) is twice as high. So R1 is 2, and R2 is 1? Or wait, maybe for star_2, the ratio is 1, and for star_1, it's 2.

Wait, no, no. The question states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So if the energy levels have a certain ΔE, the population ratio is higher in star_1. So R1 = 2 * R2? Or wait, perhaps more accurately, the excitation is higher, so the ratio is higher. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the excitation is the ratio itself. So in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. Let me clarify: the population in the higher energy level is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. But wait, the question says "twice as excited in a specific energy level". So I think it means the ratio n_upper/n_lower is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2
