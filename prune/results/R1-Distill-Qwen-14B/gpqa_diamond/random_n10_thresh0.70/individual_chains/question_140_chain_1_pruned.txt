Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read through it carefully.

So, the question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. A precipitate G forms, and when heated, G releases B. The melting point of B under normal conditions is close to 277 K. Then, there's another part about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with 2 oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog of it.

Hmm, I think I should start by breaking down each part.

First, the reaction between X and Y. The gas W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Well, that's interesting. Let's think about possible gases where each molecule has equal numbers of protons and neutrons. Water is H2O, but that doesn't fit. Maybe something like NH3? No, because NH3 has 1 N (7 protons, 7 neutrons if considering isotope), but wait, the molecule itself would have 1 N and 3 H. So protons = 7 + 3(1) = 10, and neutrons would be 7 (for N) and 3(0) for H? Wait, no, because the H is lightest isotope, so no neutrons. So the total neutrons would be 7. Oh, but protons are 10. So that doesn't match. Maybe CO2? No, CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons? Wait, carbon has 6 protons, oxygen 8. CO2 has 6 + 8*2 = 22 protons. Neutrons: carbon typically has 6 (if it's carbon-12), oxygen has 8 each, so total neutrons 6 + 8*2 = 22. So CO2 would have 22 protons and 22 neutrons. That matches. So W could be CO2.

Wait, but CO2 is a heavy gas. Another possibility: maybe it's H2O, but H2O has 2 H (each with 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So total protons: 2 + 8 =10. Neutrons: 8. Doesn't match. So not H2O.

Another option: maybe CH4? Let's see: C has 6 protons, each H has 1. So total protons:6+4=10. Neutrons: for C, 6 (if carbon-12), H has none. So total neutrons 6. Doesn't match. So back to CO2, which has 22 each.

So, W is CO2. But wait, another possibility: maybe a molecule with each atom having equal p and n. Or perhaps a molecule where the total p equals total n. So, say, CO: C has 6p and 6n (if it's 12C), O has 8p and 8n (16O). CO has 6+8=14p, 6+8=14n. So that's 14 each. So gas W could be CO. But CO
