Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The question is about identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. They've given me the IR and NMR data for Compound X, and four possible options. 

Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus with HI is a reagent used for the hydrolysis of esters, particularly the Hinsberg reaction. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, the Hinsberg reaction uses benzene sulfonyl chloride and then NaOH or HCl. But maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, I think red phosphorus and HI is used for the cleavage of ethers, but wait, no, that's the Fenton's reagent, maybe? Or maybe it's for the reduction of carbonyl groups. No, wait, another thought: when you have an ester and treat it with red phosphorus and HI, it might lead to the cleavage of the ester. Oh, right! That reaction is called the Clemmensen reduction. No, wait, Clemmensen is with Zn(Hg)/HCl. Oh, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Oh, wait, red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids. Or perhaps for elimination reactions.

Wait, actually, I think that when you have an ester, and treat it with HI and red phosphorus, it's a way to cleave the ester. Because I remember that esters can be cleaved under acidic conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's the hydrolysis to the carboxylic acid and the corresponding alcohol. Or perhaps it's something else. Alternatively, maybe the starting compound is a nitrile, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, wait: red phosphorus and HI is used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amides, but that's probably not relevant here. Alternatively, maybe it's the elimination of a carbonyl group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should first figure out what Compound X is from the IR and NMR data. Once I know that, I can predict the reaction.

Let me look at the IR data first. The IR shows strong peaks in the region 3400â€“2500 cm-1. That usually indicates O
