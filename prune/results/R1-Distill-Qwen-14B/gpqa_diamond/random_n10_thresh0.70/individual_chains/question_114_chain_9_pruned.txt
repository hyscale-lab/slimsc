Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem has two reactions and asks which reagents A and B are suitable. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different reagents.

First reaction: butan-2-one (which I think is methylacetone?) reacts with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile is treated with reagent B (which is H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, okay, so I need to figure out what reactions are happening here.

Starting with the first reaction. The starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. It's being treated with NaCN. Wait, sodium cyanide. Oh, I remember that when ketones react with HCN or its salts, it's a nucleophilic addition. So, the ketone will react with HCN to form a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is a compound where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by an -OH and a -CN group.

But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write the structure. 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no. Wait, butanenitrile is four carbons, so maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but with substitution.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, which is a source of CN- ions. So the reaction is (CH3)2CO + CN- â†’ (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Because the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, the oxygen becomes OH- which gets protonated.

But wait, the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons. Butanenitrile is four carbons. The product structure would be: CH2CH2(C-OH)(CN)... Hmm, maybe
