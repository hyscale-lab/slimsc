Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They mention that the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25 degrees Celsius. The formation constant, K_ca-edta, is 5x10^10. And there are four options to choose from.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The formation constant, K, tells us how strong the complex is. A higher K means a more stable complex.

Wait, the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. Stoichiometric usually means that the amounts are just enough to react completely. So, I think the Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- are present in a 1:1 ratio because the formula is probably CaEDTA^2−. So for every mole of CaEDTA^2−, there's one mole each of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- if they dissociate completely. But wait, no, actually, the complex is formed, so it doesn't dissociate completely unless the solution is in equilibrium.

Wait, no, wait. The complex is Ca-EDTA, which is a stable complex. The question is about the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. So the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. But some of that complex might dissociate into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4−.

Wait, no, no. Wait, the complex is CaEDTA^2−, which dissociates according to the equation:

Ca^2+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA^2−

The formation constant K is given by K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴−])

Wait, but wait. The given K is 5x10^10, which is a very large number, meaning the complex is very stable. So, the reverse reaction doesn't happen much, meaning the concentration of free Ca²+ and EDTA^4− would be low.

But in this problem, the solution has the complex at 0.02 M. So the initial assumption is that the complex is 0.02 M, and it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. But given that K is so large
