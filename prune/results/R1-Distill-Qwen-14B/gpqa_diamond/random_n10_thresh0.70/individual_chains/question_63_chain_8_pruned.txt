Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diatomic molecules and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would switch it to the next lowest energy state. The options are A to D with various momenta values.

Wait, the model here is the rotation-vibration model, which I think combines both rotational and vibrational energy states. Oh right, the non-rigid rotor model is used when the bond isn't perfectly rigid because in reality, bonds can stretch a bit. So the energy levels here would account for both rotation and vibration.

The fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So the next state would be the next higher energy level. Wait, but what's the order of these states? I remember that in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized based on the rotational quantum number, J. The energy is something like E_rot = B * J*(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. But when you include vibration, the total energy is a combination of rotational and vibrational parts.

Wait, but the problem mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model. So I think the energy levels are given by a combination of vibrational and rotational states. Oh, right, the energy levels for a diatomic molecule can be expressed as E = E_vib + E_rot, where E_vib is the vibrational energy and E_rot is the rotational energy.

The fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So if the molecule is in the fundamental state, it's at v=0 and J=0. Now, when it absorbs a photon, it can transition to a higher energy state. But which state is the next lowest? That's the key.

In the quantum mechanical model, the energy levels for a diatomic are quantized. The order of energy levels is typically such that the next higher state could be either the next vibrational level (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1) in the same vibrational level. But wait, which transition gives the lowest energy photon?

Oh, right! The allowed transitions depend on the selection rules. For rotational transitions, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1. For vibrational transitions, it's Δv = ±1. But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I need to find whether the next state is a rotational transition within
