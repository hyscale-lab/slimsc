Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that X is a meson resonance, and we need to find the mean decay distance. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, with various distances in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to how long the particle lives before decaying. The longer it lives, the further it can travel. So the lifetime would be a factor here. But how do I get from these given values to the distance?

I think the key is to first find the lifetime of the meson, and then use that to calculate the decay distance. Oh right, the mean lifetime (tau) is related to the total decay width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Specifically, Γ is the total width, and the uncertainty principle says ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So, Γ * tau ≈ ħ. So tau ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but wait. I think the relation is Γ = ħ / tau. Or is it the other way around? Hmm. Let me think carefully. The decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait no, no, I think the uncertainty principle says that Γ is the uncertainty in energy, and τ is the uncertainty in time. So Γ * τ ≈ ħ. So Γ * τ = ħ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me double-check. The decay width Γ is the total width of the resonance, which is related to the lifetime. The formula is Γ = ħ / τ. So if you have a wider width (larger Γ), the lifetime is shorter because Γ is in the denominator. That makes sense because a wider width means a shorter lifetime—more unstable.

So tau = ħ / Γ.

But wait, no, wait. Because I think the formula for the lifetime is tau = ħ / (Gamma_total). So that's correct.

But what about relativistic effects? Because the particle is moving at relativistic speeds, so the lifetime we calculated is the proper time (tau_0), but the observed lifetime is longer due to time dilation.

Oh right, because when the particle is moving at high speeds, its lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer. So the mean decay distance is not just c multiplied by tau_0; it's c multiplied by gamma (Lorentz factor) times tau_0.

So the total decay length L is L = c * gamma * tau_0.

So I need to find the Lorentz factor gamma for the meson.

But wait, what's the energy of the meson? The production energy is given as E_X =8 GeV. The mass is 1.2 GeV. So the energy is much higher than the rest mass. So the particle is moving relativistically.

The energy E is related to the rest mass m and momentum p by E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2.

Wait, but all the units are in GeV and MeV, and c is in m/s. Hmm, maybe it's easier to compute in natural units first
