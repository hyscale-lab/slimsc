Okay, so I have this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my exoplanet detection methods, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. So, they know their minimum masses and orbital periods. The planets have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Both orbits are circular.

The host stars of these planets are interesting. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Oh wait, Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, but their radii are the same. So, same size, but different masses. I remember that for stars, higher mass usually means larger radius, but maybe in this case, because Planet_2's star is evolved (like a subgiant or something), it might have started expanding but maybe hasn't yet? Or perhaps it's a bit cooler but larger, but the problem says the radii are the same. So, I'll just go with that.

The main goal is to find out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Because the researchers want to observe the one with higher probability to find it easier, I think.

So, the transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star, and the orbital configuration. I think the probability formula is something like (R_planet / R_star) squared, but I might be mixing that up. Wait, no, the geometric probability of a transit is more about the alignment. Oh right, the probability is roughly (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the orbital semi-major axis. But wait, that's more for the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view.

Wait, the formula I remember is P_transit â‰ˆ (R_star + R_p) / a. But actually, more accurately, the probability is approximately (R_*/ a), because R_p is much smaller than R_*. So it's proportional to R_*/a. Because R_p << R_*, so you can approximate it as R_* / a.

Wait, no, another thought. The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star's disk to the area of the orbit's disk. Wait, the actual transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star
