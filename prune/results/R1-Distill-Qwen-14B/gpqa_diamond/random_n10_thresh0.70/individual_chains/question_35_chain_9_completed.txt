Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. Hmm, okay, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through this.

The question is about the Y-component of the angular momentum operator, Ay. It's given that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and that it's equal to c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The S matrix has first row (0 -i) and second row (i 0). So I'll need to construct Ay first.

Wait, so c is h/(4π). So Ay = (h/(4π)) * S. Let me write down the S matrix:

S is:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

So multiplying each element by c, the Ay matrix becomes:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [0   -i ] = [ [0, -i*(h/(4π))], [i*(h/(4π)), 0 ] ]
             [ i   0 ]

Hmm, okay. Now, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. I remember that eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - aI) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

So let's compute the matrix (Ay - aI):

[ (-a)    (-i h/(4π)) ]
[ (i h/(4π))  (-a) ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) ] = a² - [ (-i)(i) (h/(4π))² ].

Wait, what's (-i)(i)? Let's compute that. (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So the determinant becomes a² - (1)(h²/(16 π²)).

So the equation is a² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0. Solving for a, we get a² = (h²)/(16 π²). Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4 π).

Wait, so the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). But wait, the eigenvalues for angular momentum operators like this usually involve spin. Oh wait, the muon is a spin-1/2 particle, right? So S is the spin operator, which for spin-1/2 has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. Wait, but in this case, c is h/(4π), and S is a Pauli matrix scaled by something.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So S here is similar to the Pauli Y matrix. So when you have S as a matrix, the eigenvalues of S are ±1. Then Ay is c multiplied by S, so the eigenvalues of Ay would be c*(±1) = ±c. Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are real numbers, not complex. So when the options talk about the imaginary parts, that's probably a clue. Let me look at the options.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). But wait, the eigenvalues we just found are real, so the imaginary parts should be zero. So Option A can't be correct.

Option B: Imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. But our eigenvalues are real, so this would require eigenvalues with non-zero imaginary parts. So probably not B either.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az. Wait, for angular momentum operators, the square A^2 commutes with all components, so eigenfunctions of Ay should also be eigenfunctions of A^2. But for different components like Az, they don't commute, so eigenfunctions of Ay are generally not eigenfunctions of Az. So C says this, which is correct. But we need to see if C is a correct statement during the calculation.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Not sure what that means. The eigenfunctions form a basis, but I'm not sure if that's what D is saying. Maybe it's correct in a trivial sense, but not necessarily the correct statement for the question.

Wait, the question is, during the calculation, which statement will you consider correct. So perhaps during the process of solving for eigenvectors, which properties hold?

But let's go back. The eigenvalues are real, so any option that says eigenvalues have non-zero imaginary parts is incorrect. So A and B are out. So between C and D.

Option C says eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2 but not of Az. Since A^2 is the square of the angular momentum, which for spin is s(s+1)ħ², and since the operator Ay is a component, the eigenfunctions of Ay will indeed be eigenfunctions of A^2 because [Ay, A^2] = 0.

But about Az: since Ay and Az don't commute, the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So C is correct. So during the calculation, I would consider that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A^2 but not of Az.

Alternatively, let's think about the eigenvectors. Let's find them. For a = h/(4π), the matrix (Ay - a I) becomes:

[ -a   -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)   -a ]

Which for a = h/(4π) is:

[ -h/(4π)   -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)   -h/(4π) ]

We can write this as:

[-a   -i a ]
[ i a   -a ]

Where a = h/(4π). So to find eigenvectors, we look for non-trivial solutions to (Ay - a I) φ = 0.

So the equations are:

- a φ1 - i a φ2 = 0
i a φ1 - a φ2 = 0

Let me simplify by dividing both equations by a (since a is not zero):

- φ1 - i φ2 = 0 → φ1 = -i φ2
i φ1 - φ2 = 0 → substitute φ1 from first equation: i (-i φ2) - φ2 = (-i²) φ2 - φ2 = (1) φ2 - φ2 = 0 → 0=0.

So the first equation gives φ1 = -i φ2. Let φ2 = 1, then φ1 = -i.

So the eigenvector is [ -i , 1 ]^T. But we can factor out a common factor, so it becomes proportional to [ -i, 1 ].

Wait, but eigenvectors can be complex. So this is a valid eigenvector.

Similarly, for a = -h/(4π), the same process gives eigenvectors proportional to [ i, 1 ]^T.

So the eigenfunctions are complex vectors. But that doesn't affect the statements.

So regarding option D: it says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, since it's a 2x2 matrix and it has two eigenvalues (each with multiplicity one), so the eigenvectors are a basis. So D is correct. But I thought C was correct too.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct?

Wait, let's read the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Well, the eigenfunctions are vectors in a two-dimensional space and form a basis. So D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis. So which options are correct?

Wait, the question is a multiple-choice, and the options are which statement is correct. So are both C and D correct? Or only one of them?

Wait, looking back, the problem statement says "which statement below will you consider to be correct?" So perhaps more than one could be correct, but I'm supposed to choose the correct one.

Alternatively, perhaps only C is correct. Let me think about each option.

Option A: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). But eigenvalues are real, so A is wrong.

Option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. Also wrong, since eigenvalues are real.

Option C: eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Since [Ay, Az] = i ħ A something (not sure, but they don't commute), so eigenfunctions of Ay can't be eigenfunctions of Az. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix. Well, the eigenvectors are a basis, yes. So D is correct as a statement.

Wait, but in the context of the calculation, which statement holds? For example, for any 2x2 matrix with two distinct eigenvalues, the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is a correct statement. But the question is which of the statements is correct during the calculation.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct in the context of the calculation for Ay. So perhaps both C and D are correct. But looking at the options, only one is the correct answer.

Wait, the options are labeled A to D. So maybe I need to pick the correct one among them.

Wait, perhaps option D is not correct because the basis functions are the eigenvectors, but it's not necessarily that all eigenfunctions are basis functions. Or wait, the eigenvectors are the basis for the vector space when the matrix is diagonalizable, which it is since it has two distinct eigenvalues (assuming h/(4π) is non-zero, which it is). So D is correct.

But wait, what about option C? It says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A^2 but not of Az. Since A^2 is the square of the angular momentum, which commutes with Ay, so any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A^2. That's correct. Because [Ay, A²] = 0.

But what about Az? Since [Ay, Az] = iħ AA_x (I think the commutator is iħ times another component), so they don't commute, so eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So C is correct.

Hmm, so both C and D are correct statements. But the options probably have only one correct answer. Let me look at the options again.

Wait, the question is about the multiple-choice options, so perhaps only one is correct. Let me read the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. That's correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. That is also correct, because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct statements. But looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, but the options are given as A, B, C, D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Alternatively, perhaps in the context of the problem, D is not correct. Because the eigenfunctions are the basis functions, but the matrix is 2x2, and the eigenvectors are 2D vectors, so they form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but I'm not sure if D is a correct statement. Wait, the eigenfunctions are the basis for the vector space, yes. So D is correct.

But the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct. But in the options, only C and D are possible.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

So both statements are correct. But the question gives four options, and only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C because the other options are incorrect. Let me think: the eigenvalues are real, so A and B are incorrect. So it's between C and D.

But perhaps the problem is about whether the eigenvectors are the basis functions. Well, the operator is 2x2 and has two distinct eigenvalues, so the eigenvectors are a basis. So D is correct.

But the question is about which statement you would consider correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but in the options, only one is correct.

Wait, let me think about the options again. The question says, "which statement will you consider to be correct?"

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is C because it's about the properties of the eigenfunctions in relation to other operators.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, no. Let me think about the problem again. The problem is about which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the operator Ay is given as a 2x2 matrix. The question is, during the calculation, which statement is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. Well, any set of eigenvectors of a diagonalizable matrix with distinct eigenvalues forms a basis. So D is correct.

But the problem is which of the options is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options only have one correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me think about option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm, the matrix operator is 2x2, and the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are vectors in a 2D space. So indeed, the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, so the statement is correct. So D is correct.

But then why is option C correct? Because C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

So both C and D might be correct, but the options are multiple-choice, so perhaps only one is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the question is about the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So when you calculate eigenvalues, you find they're real. When you calculate eigenvectors, you find they're complex. So during the calculation, which statement is correct.

So, for example, during the calculation, you might realize that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², as A² commutes with Ay. So option C is correct.

But D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions, which is also correct.

Wait, but perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the possible answers.

If the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are real, then the eigenfunctions are complex. So option D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis. So I think D is correct.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps in the calculation, you find that the eigenfunctions are not real, which is relevant for some options.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm, the basis functions of the matrix operator. Well, the matrix is 2x2, so the basis is the standard basis of 2D vectors. The eigenvectors form another basis, but perhaps the statement is that the eigenvectors are the basis functions.

Wait, perhaps D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis. So the statement is correct.

But the question is which option is correct. Since both C and D are correct, but the options don't allow that, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the matrix S.

Wait, S is given as a 2x2 matrix with first row (0 -i) and second row (i 0). That's the Pauli Y matrix, right? The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So S looks like σy multiplied by i. Because σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which matches S. So S is the Pauli Y matrix.

Wait, no. The Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is exactly S. So S is σy. Then c is h/(4π). So Ay = c σy.

The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So when multiplied by c, the eigenvalues of Ay are ±c, which is ±h/(4π). So that's correct.

So the eigenvalues are real, so options A and B are wrong. So C and D are possible.

So, during the calculation, you find that the eigenvalues are real, and the eigenvectors are complex. So which statements are correct.

Option C: eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Since A² commutes with Ay, yes, the eigenfunctions will also be eigenfunctions of A². But since [Ay, Az] = iħ A_x (or something like that), the eigenfunctions are not eigenfunctions of Az. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions. Well, the eigenvectors form a basis, so yes. So D is also correct.

Hmm, but the options are mutually exclusive. So perhaps only one is correct. Wait, looking back, the question says "which statement will you consider to be correct?" So maybe both C and D are correct, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C because, during the calculation, you realize that the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. So C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the square of the operator. The square of Ay is (c S)^2 = c² S². Since S is σy, which is a Pauli matrix, S² = I. So S^2 = identity matrix. So (Ay)^2 = c² I.

So any vector is an eigenfunction of (Ay)^2 with eigenvalue c². So the eigenfunctions of Ay are indeed eigenfunctions of A^2, because A^2 is the square of the angular momentum operator, which would be proportional to (S)^2, which is identity in this case (since S is spin-1/2, but maybe scaled).

Wait, no. Wait, the operator A is the angular momentum, which for spin-1/2 would have A^2 = (s(s+1)ħ^2), but in this case, since Ay is given as c S, where S is the Pauli matrices scaled in some way.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it. The point is that A^2 would be (c S)^2 = c² S^2. Since S^2 is the identity matrix for Pauli matrices, so A^2 would be c² I. So any vector is an eigenfunction of A^2 with eigenvalue c². Thus, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A^2. So option C is correct.

So, during the calculation, I would conclude that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. So option C is correct.

As for option D, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Well, the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, so that's correct too. So why isn't D correct?

Ah, perhaps because the matrix is 2x2, the standard basis is the computational basis, but the eigenvectors form another basis. So D is correct in that sense. So both C and D seem correct, but the options don't allow for multiple correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again.

In the problem statement, the operator Ay is given as a 2x2 matrix. The options are about what you would consider correct during the calculation.

If during the calculation, I find that the eigenvalues are real, which is the case, so options A and B are out. Then, looking at C and D.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the matrix is 2x2, the eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. Since A^2 and Ay commute, the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A^2. But Az and Ay don't commute, so C is correct.

So both C and D are correct. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps D is incorrect because the matrix operator's basis is not necessarily the same as the eigenvector basis. Wait, no. The eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space, which is the same as the basis for the operator's matrix representation. So D is correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. But given the options, I think the correct answer is C.


The problem involves analyzing the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), for a muon. The operator is represented as a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a given \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix with the form:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:
1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \). Substituting \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues are \( a = \pm c = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). These eigenvalues are real, so any option claiming complex eigenvalues (e.g., with non-zero imaginary parts) is incorrect.

2. **Option A and B:**
   - Option A claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \), and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real.
   - Option B claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \), and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

3. **Option C:**
   - This option states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator), but not of the Z-component \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \) (i.e., \( [A_y, A^2] = 0 \)), so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute (\( [A_y, A_z] \neq 0 \)), so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).

4. **Option D:**
   - This option states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). While it is true that the eigenfunctions form a basis for the vector space, the phrasing of this option is ambiguous. The eigenfunctions are not necessarily the "basis functions" of the operator itself, as the operator is represented in a fixed basis (likely the computational basis). Thus, this option is less precise than Option C.

### Conclusion:
Options A and B are incorrect because they misrepresent the eigenvalues. Option D is less precise, while Option C correctly captures the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \). Therefore, the most accurate and precise answer is:

**Answer: C**
