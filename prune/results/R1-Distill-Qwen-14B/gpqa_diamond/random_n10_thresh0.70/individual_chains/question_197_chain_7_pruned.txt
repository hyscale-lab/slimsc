Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus with HI is typically used for the hydrolysis of nitriles, but wait, no, wait. Oh right, maybe it's for the removal of a protecting group. Alternatively, red phosphorus is often used in the preparation of alcohols from nitriles, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact reaction.

First, I need to analyze the IR and NMR data provided for Compound X to figure out its structure.

Looking at the IR data: 3400â€“2500 cm-1. That broad region is likely due to an O-H stretch. But wait, the region is 3400-2500 which covers the range for both alcohols and maybe carboxylic acids. But the peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong indication. A carbonyl group, probably a ketone or an ester or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, carboxylic acids have O-H in IR, but their carbonyl is around 1700. But if it's a ketone, then maybe. But wait, the 3400-2500 region is broad, which might suggest an -OH group, maybe in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol.

Wait, but the presence of 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak for a carbonyl group. Could it be an ester, ketone, or maybe an acid. Let's think. If it's an acid, the O-H would be very broad around 2500-3000. But the IR given has a broad region from 3400-2500, which includes the O-H stretch for an acid. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But wait, another possibility: if it's an alcohol, the O-H would be a broad peak around 3200-3600. But the region given is 3400-2500, which is a bit lower. Hmm, maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde, but the carbonyl
