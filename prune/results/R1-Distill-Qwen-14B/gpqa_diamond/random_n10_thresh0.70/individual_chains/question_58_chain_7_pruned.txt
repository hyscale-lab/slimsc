Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, like infinite terms that pop up when you calculate certain things. So the idea is that you introduce a cutoff or some other method to make the calculations finite, and then you take the cutoff to infinity in a controlled way. But some theories don't need this because they don't have these divergences, or maybe they handle them differently.

Wait, but wait. Regularization isn't just about infinities. It's about making the theory finite and then renormalizing. So in some theories, maybe the divergences cancel out, so you don't need regularization. Or perhaps the theory is already finite, so no need for it.

Let me go through each option.

Option A: Superstring Theory. Oh right, string theory is a candidate for a theory of everything. I remember that in string theory, the concept of regularization isn't the same as in quantum field theory. Because strings are extended objects, their theory might not have the same kinds of divergences as point particles. Or maybe because of supersymmetry, which cancels some divergences. Wait, but I'm not sure. Do string theories require regularization? I think that at high energies, string theory's perturbative expansion (like the superstring perturbation theory) might not require the same kind of renormalization
