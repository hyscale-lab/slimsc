Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again and break it down.

Alright, the setup is an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that—just electric potential energy.

Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. So point P has a charge, and the other 12 are all at 2 meters from there. Hmm, but wait, since all the 12 are at 2 meters from P, and P has a charge, how does that affect things?

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system. Wait, energy in an electrostatic system usually refers to the electric potential energy. And for a system of point charges, the potential energy is the work required to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions.

But wait, point charges in space—so I need to calculate the total potential energy of the system. Since the system is isolated, the energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.

But let me think, the formula for the electric potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

Wait, but since all charges are identical, each pair contributes the same amount of potential energy. So perhaps I can calculate the potential energy for each pair and then multiply by the number of such pairs.

Wait, no. Wait, the system has 13 charges. But one is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each at a distance of 2 meters from P. So the 13th charge is at P, let's say it's charge Q. Each of the other 12 charges is at 2m distance from P, so they are all at 2m from Q.

Wait, but all 12 are each at 2m from P, but what about the distance between the 12 charges themselves? Are they all located on a sphere of radius 2m centered at P? So the distance between any two of the 12 charges would be determined by their arrangement on the sphere. But wait, the problem states
