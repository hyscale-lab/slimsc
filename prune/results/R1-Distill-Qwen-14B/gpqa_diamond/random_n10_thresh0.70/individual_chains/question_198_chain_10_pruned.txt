Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

The question is about the percentage of a specific cobalt complex in solution. So, the setup is that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The concentrations are given: the total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the different complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I'm supposed to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Wait, dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands. So, the complexes would be [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^(0), [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and [Co(SCN)_4]^(2-), I think. Because each SCN is -1, so adding four would give the complex a charge of -4 plus the Co(II), so -2? Wait, no. Co is +2, each SCN is -1. So for [Co(SCN)_n]^charge: charge = 2+ - n*(1-). So for n=1: 2+ -1 = +1. n=2: 2-2=0. n=3: 2-3= -1. n=4: 2-4= -2. So the complexes are [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2], [Co(SCN)_3]^-, and [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

The stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Stability constant, β, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from the ions. For example, for the first complex: Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ [CoSCN]^+, β1 = [ [CoSCN^+] ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-] ) =9.

But wait, sometimes stability constants are written for the formation of the complex stepwise or overall. I think in this case, it's the overall formation. So each β is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the nth complex from the (n-1)th. Hmm, no, wait. Wait, I think the stability constant for the nth complex is the overall formation from the metal ion and n ligands. Or is it the stepwise formation? Oh wait, sometimes β represents the logarithm or the actual value. But the question says the stability constants are β1, β2, etc. So for the first complex, β1 is the formation constant K for [Co(SCN)]^+.

So each βn is the overall constant for the complex with n SCN- ions. So [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) has βn as its stability constant.

The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would be two SCN- ions, so that's the [Co(SCN)_2] complex. But wait, the question mentions
