Okay, so I've got this question about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar atmospheres, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere relates to the temperature. The hotter the star, the more energy the atoms have, so higher excitation levels.

Wait, the energy difference between the levels is given as approximately 1.38e-23 J. I think I'll need that for calculating something with the Boltzmann factor.

Since the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), I can use the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann distribution tells us about the population of different energy levels in a system.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference between levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this problem, the ratio of the populations is given. For star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. Wait, does that mean n_upper for star_1 is twice that of star_2? Or is the excitation energy higher? Hmm.

Wait, the question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps the number in the excited state is twice as much as in star_2. So n1_upper / n1_lower = something, and n2_upper /n2_lower = something else. But I think the key here is the excitation relative to each other.

Wait, but the energy difference between the levels is given. So for each star, the Boltzmann factor applies. Let me denote the two energy levels as E1 and E2, with E2 higher than E1 by ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

So for each star,

n_upper /n_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T))

Assuming that the statistical weights (g) are the same for both stars (since it's the same element and same transition), the ratio of the populations would be inversely proportional to exp(ΔE/(k*T)).

So if star_1 has twice as many in the excited state compared to star_2, then:

(n_upper)_1 / (n_lower)_1 = 2 * [(n_upper)_2 / (n_lower)_2]

Because (n_upper)_1 is twice (n_upper)_2. But wait, actually, the ratio (n_upper /n_lower) for each star would be proportional to 1/(exp(ΔE/(kT))).

So for star_1, the ratio is R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1))
For star_2, R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Wait, no, wait. The Boltzmann factor is exp(-ΔE/(kT)), so for each star:

(n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So if the star_1's ratio is twice that of star_2's ratio, then:

R1 = 2 * R2

But R1 = (g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ), R2 = (g2) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) )

Assuming g1 and g2 are the same (same transition), then R1 = 2 R2 => exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) )

Wait, no. Wait, if star_1's ratio is twice as much as star_2's, that would mean R1 = 2 R2. So:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Wait, that's the equation we have. Let me rearrange this.

Take natural logs of both sides:

ln [ exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] = ln [ 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Which simplifies to:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + [ -ΔE/(k T2) ]

So, moving terms around:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Hmm, not sure if I'm on the right track. Let me think again.

Wait, no, perhaps I should write the ratio R1/R2.

R1 = 2 R2.

So, [exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ] = 2

Which is:

exp[ ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) ] = 2

Wait, because when you divide exponents, you subtract. Let me see:

exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b). So here, a is (-ΔE/(k T1)), and b is (-ΔE/(k T2)).

So a - b = (-ΔE/(k T1)) - (-ΔE/(k T2)) ) = (-ΔE/(k T1) ) + ΔE/(k T2) = ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ]

So:

exp[ ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) ] = 2

Take natural log of both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = ln(2)

Hmm, that's the equation I have. Let's write it as:

(ΔE)/(k) ( (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2)

But wait, I'm not sure if the ratio is R1 = 2 R2. Let me make sure.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So, perhaps the number of atoms in the excited state (n_upper) is twice that of star_2. But the ratio (n_upper / n_lower) is twice that of star_2's ratio.

Wait, no. The excitation level is a ratio. So maybe the excitation potential is higher in star_1, meaning more atoms are in the higher energy level. So the ratio (n_upper/n_lower) would be higher in star_1.

So if star_1's ratio is 2 times star_2's ratio, then R1 = 2 R2.

Which leads us to the equation I had before.

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the population ratio.

n_upper /n_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So for star_1: R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2: R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Given that R1 = 2 R2.

So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ), we get:

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ) = 2

Taking ln of both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = ln(2)

Wait, that's the same equation as before. Let me rearrange this.

Let me write 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2) * k / ΔE.

Wait, but let's think about the options. The options involve ln(2) being equal to some ratio involving T1 and T2.

So, let's rearrange the equation.

We have (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (k ln(2)) / ΔE.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me compute the equation again.

From before:

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ] = ln(2)

So,

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE

Hmm, but let's compute the right-hand side.

Wait, what's the value of k? Boltzmann's constant is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K.

Wait, ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. So:

k = 1.38e-23 J/K

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

So,

(k * ln(2)) / ΔE = (1.38e-23 * ln2 ) / (1.38e-23) ) = ln(2)

So,  [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE = ln(2) * (k/ΔE) = ln(2) * (1.38e-23 / 1.38e-23 ) ) = ln(2) * 1 = ln(2)

Wait, no. Wait:

(k * ln(2)) / ΔE = (1.38e-23 * ln2 ) / (1.38e-23 )

Because (approx) 1.38e-23 in numerator and denominator cancels, so it's ln(2) [since 1.38e-23 cancels, leaving (ln2 * 1) ]

So,

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) * (k / ΔE) ) = ln(2) * (1.38e-23 / 1.38e-23 ) ) = ln(2) * 1 = ln(2)

Wait, wait, wait: Let me re-calculate.

(k * ln(2)) / ΔE = [ (1.38e-23 J/K) * ln2 ) ] / (1.38e-23 J )

So the 1.38e-23 cancels out, leaving (ln2 ) / 1 (since J cancels with J in denominator?), but wait, let me see units: k is in J/K, ΔE is in J.

So (k/ΔE) is (J/K)/(J) ) = 1/K.

So,

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = [ (ln2) * k ] / ΔE = [ ln(2) * (1.38e-23) ] / (1.38e-23 ) ) = ln(2)

So,

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Wait, that can't be right because that would imply (1/T2 - 1/T1) is positive, meaning 1/T2 > 1/T1, which implies T2 < T1. But if R1 > R2, which is what we have, that would mean higher T1. Because the ratio R is higher when temperature is lower. Because exponential function.

Yes, because if T is higher, exp(-ΔE/(kT)) is smaller. So higher R implies lower temperature. Wait, wait, no: R is (n_upper/n_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), so when T is higher, the exponent is more negative, so R is smaller. So if R1 is larger than R2, T1 must be lower than T2.

Wait, no. Let me think: if T1 is higher than T2, then ΔE/(k T1) is smaller than ΔE/(k T2). So, -ΔE/(k T1) is a less negative number, so exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) is larger than exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

So, if R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) and R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)), then if T1 > T2, R1 > R2. So in our case, since R1 = 2 * R2, which is larger, that implies T1 > T2.

Wait, but according to our earlier equation, (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2), which is positive. So 1/T2 > 1/T1 → T2 < T1.

So, that's correct. So T1 is larger than T2.

But now, I'm trying to figure out which equation correctly relates T1 and T2. Let's see the options.

The options are:

A) ln(2) = T2/T1 → ln(2) = T2/T1.

B) ln(2) = (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2)

C) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)^2

D) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Wait, none of these match the equation I have, which is (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2).

Hmm, perhaps I can manipulate the equation:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Let's write 1/T2 as (T1)/(T1 T2)

Wait, 1/T2 = T1/(T1 T2), and 1/T1 = T2/(T1 T2).

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2)

So,

(T1 - T2) = ln(2) * (T1 T2)

Hmm, but looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1-T2)/(T1 T2). So that matches exactly.

Wait, because from the equation:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Which is equal to (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which is option D.

Wait, but wait, because in the equation:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Which is the same as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So,

(T1 - T2) = ln(2) * T1 T2

But none of the options present this directly. Let me see the options again.

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Yes, that's exactly what I have. So the equation is option D.

Therefore, the correct equation is option D.


The question involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars, \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \), based on the excitation levels of iron atoms in their photospheres. The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2, and the energy difference between the levels is \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). The photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann distribution applies.

The Boltzmann equation relates the population ratio of atoms in two energy levels:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_{\text{upper}} \) and \( g_{\text{lower}} \) are the statistical weights of the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the population ratios are:

\[
R_1 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad R_2 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Given that \( R_1 = 2 R_2 \), we can write:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Dividing through by \( \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right) \) gives:

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2) \cdot \frac{k}{\Delta E}.
\]

Substituting \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \) and \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), we find:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), the equation becomes:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the correct equation for the effective temperatures is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

**Answer: D**
