Okay, so I have this problem about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when we’re dealing with excitation in stars, we’re probably looking at something related to the Boltzmann distribution. Oh right, the Boltzmann factor tells us about the population of particles in different energy states.

So the problem says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And the photospheres are in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, so the usual statistical mechanics apply.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy states. The formula is (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Here, n_i and n_j are the number of particles in states i and j. g_i and g_j are the degeneracies. But the problem says the energy difference is given, so if E_i is the higher energy level, and E_j is lower, then the excitation is about moving from the lower to higher state.

In this case, the ratio is (n_upper / n_lower) for each star. For star_1, this ratio is twice that of star_2. Let me denote R1 as the ratio for star 1 and R2 for star 2. So R1 = 2 * R2.

But wait, the problem says iron atoms in star_1
