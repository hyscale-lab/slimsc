Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question gives me a density matrix rho, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. So, this rho must be a mixed state since it's a statistical mixture of |0> and |1>.

Wait, but what exactly is a density matrix's geometrical position? Oh right, when we talk about the position in the qubit space, it's usually referring to the Bloch sphere representation. Qubits can be represented as points on a Bloch sphere, right? The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize the state of a qubit.

The Bloch sphere is a unit sphere in three-dimensional space. Each point on the sphere corresponds to a pure state. For mixed states, the density matrix can't be represented as a single point on the Bloch sphere, but maybe in this case, since rho is a mixture of |0> and |1>, it's somewhere else.

Wait, let me think again. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector r. The general form is rho = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in 3D space with components (x, y, z), and it's a unit vector for pure states.

So if I can write the given rho in that form, I can find the components of r.

The given rho is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let's write out the matrix form. |0> is [1, 0] and |1> is [0, 1]. So |0><0| is [[1, 0], [0, 0]], and |1><1| is [[0, 0], [0, 1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So rho is (I)/2, because I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so rho is (I)/2.

Now, the general rho is (I + r·σ)/2. Let me expand r·σ. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So r·σ would be r_x σx + r
