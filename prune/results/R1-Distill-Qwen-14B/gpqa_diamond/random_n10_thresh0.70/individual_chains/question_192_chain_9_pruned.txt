Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to figure this out.

Alright, the setup is a bit tricky. There's a spherical conductor, uncharged, with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the conductor's center. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. So the cavity is entirely inside the conductor but not at the center.

Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. The point P is a distance L from the conductor's center, and l is its distance from the cavity's center. Also, l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is Î¸.

Hmm, I remember that in conductors, charges redistribute themselves. Since the conductor was initially uncharged, putting a charge inside the cavity should induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. But wait, how does that work again?

I think when you have a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge equal and opposite to the enclosed charge. So the inner surface would have -q. And since the conductor itself was neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance it out. Oh wait, no, wait. The conductor was uncharged, so the total charge is zero. So the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q. Because the conductor's total charge is the sum of inner and outer surface charges. So -q (inner) + outer = 0. So outer is +q.

But wait, the conductor is a conductor, so the charges can move freely. So the outer surface will have a charge of +q. So, for points outside the conductor, the electric field should be the same as if all the charge +q were concentrated at the center of the conductor. Because, from Gauss's law, the field outside a spherical charge distribution is the same as that of a point charge at the center.

Wait, but the point P is outside the conductor. So all I need to do is consider the charge on the outer surface, which is +q. So the field at P would be as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but the point P's distance is L from the conductor's center, and the
