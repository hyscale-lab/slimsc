Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a Ca-EDTA complex. Let's see what I remember about complexes and their dissociation.

Alright, the problem states that the solution has 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10. And we're told the pH is ideal, so I probably don't have to worry about other factors like hydrolysis of EDTA or anything like that. The temperature is 25°C, but I don't think that affects the K much since it's given.

Wait, what's the formula for the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex? I think the complex is formed like this: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. So the complex might dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait no, the complex is formed when Ca²+ reacts with EDTA^4- to form the stable CaEDTA^2- complex. So the reaction would be the reverse. So the dissociation would be CaEDTA^2- dissociating into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

So the dissociation equation is: CaEDTA^2− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−.

The formation constant, K, is given. Wait, formation constant usually refers to the formation of the complex from its ions. So Kf = [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). But since we're dealing with the dissociation, the K for the dissociation would be the inverse. So Kdissociation = 1/Kf = [Ca²+][EDTA^4−]/[CaEDTA^2−].

But wait, in the problem statement, it's given as KCa-EDTA = 5e10. I'm a bit confused. Is KCa-EDTA the formation constant or the dissociation constant? Because in most textbooks, Kf is the formation constant. So I think KCa-EDTA here is Kf. So for the dissociation, Kd would be 1/(5e10), which is a very small number.

But in this problem, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me model the dissociation.

Let me let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. So, the concentration of Ca²+ would be x, and the concentration of EDTA^4− would also be x, assuming that each complex that dissociates releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4−. The concentration of the complex would then be 0.02 - x. But since Kd is very small, x should be much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, the expression for Kd is (x)(x)/(0.02) = x²/(0.02) = Kd.

We know that Kd = 1/Kf = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

So plugging in, x²/(0.02) = 2e-11.

Multiplying both sides by 0.02: x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13.

Taking the square root: x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13, sqrt(4) is 2, and sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7.

Wait, wait. Let me calculate that again. 4e-13 is 4 x 10^-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and the square root of 10^-13 is 10^(-13/2) = 10^-6.5 ≈ 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7. So x is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So the concentration of calcium ions would be 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Because sometimes the formation constant is given as Kf, which is for the formation reaction. So the dissociation is opposite, and Kd is 1/Kf. I think that's correct.

So the setup is correct. The approximation that x is much smaller than 0.02 is valid because Kd is 2e-11, which is very small. So x is around 1e-6, which is much smaller than 0.02 (which is 0.02). So the approximation holds.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we start by considering the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant \( K_f \) is given as \( 5 \times 10^{10} \). For the dissociation equilibrium, the dissociation constant \( K_d \) is the inverse of \( K_f \), so:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) ions that dissociate from the complex. At equilibrium, the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \) will both be \( x \), and the concentration of the complex \( \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \) will be approximately \( 0.02 - x \). Since \( K_d \) is very small, \( x \) will be much smaller than 0.02, so we approximate \( 0.02 - x \approx 0.02 \).

The equilibrium expression for \( K_d \) is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Substituting \( K_d = 2 \times 10^{-11} \):

\[
\frac{x^2}{0.02} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = 0.02 \times 2 \times 10^{-11} = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions \( [\text{Ca}^{2+}] \) is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)**.
