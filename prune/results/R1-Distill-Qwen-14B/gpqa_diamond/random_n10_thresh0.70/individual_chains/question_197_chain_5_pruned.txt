Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Alright, the question involves identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product formed when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm.

Let me start by looking at the spectral data provided. The IR shows peaks at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates the presence of O-H or N-H groups. But wait, another strong peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching, so the compound probably has an aromatic ring.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data. The peaks are at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), which is a broad singlet. That's a strong indication of an aldehyde proton. Wait, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. Alternatively, maybe an acidic proton like from a carboxylic acid? Wait, but a carboxylic acid would be broad, but a peak at 10.5 might also be an aldehyde. But wait, looking at the IR, if there's a carbonyl, maybe it's an aldehyde. Hmm.

Wait, but the IR's 1720 cm-1... An aldehyde has a carbonyl around 1700 cm-1. So that fits. So maybe it's an aromatic aldehyde. Let me think about the other NMR signals. The 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) look like a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, the protons are split into two doublets each integrating to 2H. So that suggests a substituent on the benzene ring in the para position.

Then the other signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t,3H). These seem like they could come from an isobutyl group or a sec-butyl group. Let me think. 

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH2. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is likely a methyl adjacent to a CH. The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) and 1.7 ppm (2H) seem like a CH2-CH-CH2 group? Or maybe a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- structure?

Wait, let me try to piece this together. If the aromatic ring is para-substituted with an aldehyde group and another substituent, maybe a side chain. For example, p-ethylanisole? No, but wait, the aldehyde would be the substituent.

Wait, the structure I'm thinking is something like para-(something)benzaldehyde. The substituent on the benzene would be a group that has a CH2-CH(CH2CH3) or similar. Let me think about the NMR. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a methine (CH) adjacent to two CH2 groups. The 1.7 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 connected to that CH, and then another CH2 at 0.9 ppm as a triplet. So perhaps a structure like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something.

Putting it together, the substituent is a propyl group. Wait, no. The 0.9 ppm is a triplet, so maybe it's a CH2CH2CH3, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps a butyl group. Let me think: the 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) indicates a methyl group attached to a CH2. Then the 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is a methyl attached to a CH. And the 1.7 ppm (2
