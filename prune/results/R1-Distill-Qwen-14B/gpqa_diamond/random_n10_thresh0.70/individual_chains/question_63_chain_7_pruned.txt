Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

The given data are:
- Mass of X (Mx) = 20 amu
- Mass of Y (My) = 2 amu
- Bond length (R) = 2 angstroms
- Angular frequency (w) = 4e14 rad/s

The options are A to D, with various momentum values.

Hmm. So, the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think that for a diatomic molecule, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state. But wait, the model here is considering both rotation and vibration. So maybe the fundamental state refers to the lowest vibrational level, or the lowest rotational state.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, for diatomic molecules, the rotation and vibration are treated separately. The rotation is quantized as well. Oh right, the rigid rotor model is for rotation, and the vibration is a separate harmonic oscillator. But the question mentions the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, the non-rigid rotor accounts for bond length variation during vibration, so it's more accurate for molecules where the bond length isn't fixed.

But the problem is about the transition when a photon is absorbed. So the molecule is in its ground state, and a photon is absorbed to go to the next state with the lowest energy. I'm a bit confused about which state it's moving to. The next state could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state, or maybe a combination.

Wait, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions. The total energy is the sum of the vibrational and rotational energies. So the fundamental state is the lowest possible, which is the ground state of both vibration and rotation.

So, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next higher energy state. But what's the next state? It depends on whether the energy levels are quantized in such a way that the next state is rotationally higher, vibrationally higher, or both.

Wait, for a diatomic, the energy levels are given by the sum of the rotational energy and the vibrational energy. The vibrational energy levels are quantized as E
