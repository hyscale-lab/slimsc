Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the allowed decay modes of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV.

The Lagrangian given is L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y)(υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think this describes the interaction between the boson X and some fermion fields. So, the fermions involved are the ones that X can decay into, right?

Wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So, for X to decay into a pair of fermions, the sum of their rest masses must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because in particle physics, a particle can decay into particles whose combined rest mass is less than its own.

So I need to figure out which fermions have masses that are each less than 3 GeV because each fermion must have mass m, and 2m ≤ 6, so m ≤3 GeV.

Let me list the known fermion masses. Let's see:

Electron: about 0.0005 GeV, which is negligible, so definitely allowed.
Neutrinos: even lighter, so yes.
M uon: about 0.1 GeV, so yes.
Tau: around 1.78 GeV. 2*1.78 is ~3.56 GeV. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 3.56 GeV is more than 3 GeV. Because X is 6 GeV, so 2m = 3.56 GeV would be okay, because 3.56 is less than 6. Wait no, wait. Wait, each fermion is m, so 2m ≤6 GeV. So m ≤3 GeV. So tau is 1.78 GeV, so 2*1.78 is about 3.56 which is less than 6. So yes, tau can be produced.

But wait, wait. No, wait. Oh no, no, I think I made a mistake. Because the maximum possible mass for each fermion is 3 GeV. Because X can decay into two fermions, each of mass up to 3 GeV.

Wait, but let me think again. X has 6 GeV. So each fermion in the pair must have m ≤ 6/2 = 3 GeV. So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be produced.

Let me list all the quarks and leptons:

Quarks:
- Up (u): ~2 MeV (so much less than 3 GeV)
- Down (d): ~4-5 MeV
- Strange (s): ~100 MeV
- Charm (c): ~1.2-1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV
- Top (t): way too heavy at ~173 GeV, so no.

Leptons:
- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
