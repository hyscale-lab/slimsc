Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is asking about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. They've given the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. So, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions, like calcium. The complex here is Ca-EDTA. The formation constant, K, tells us how strong the complex is. A high K means the complex is stable.

The problem says the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Since EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, each Ca²+ ion binds with one EDTA^4- ion. So the formula would be CaEDTA^2- maybe? Or CaY²- where Y is EDTA.

I think the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- according to the equation: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The formation constant K is given by [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

Wait, no, the formation constant is written as K = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So the higher the K, the more the complex is formed.

But in this case, I'm given that the solution is 0.02 M of the complex. I need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions. So, the concentration of Ca²+ would be very low because the K is large, meaning the complex doesn't dissociate much.

Let me think about it. Let's denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Since the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, but the amount dissociated would be small, so the concentration of free EDTA^4- would be approximately x as well. But wait, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, so if x is the concentration that dissociates, then:

[CaEDTA²-] = 0.02
