Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvector of an operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think this through.

Alright, first, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables like momentum or angular momentum are represented by operators. The operator here is P, which has components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. Wait, so P must be a spin operator, probably for spin-1/2 particles like electrons or muons. Oh, right, the muon is mentioned here.

The problem states that the direction n is in the x-z plane. So any direction in the x-z plane can be represented with an angle θ from the z-axis. So, the direction vector n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero.

The operator P along an arbitrary direction n would be a linear combination of Px, Py, and Pz. The formula for the operator in the direction n is P = nx Px + ny Py + nz Pz. Since ny is zero here (because it's in the x-z plane), this simplifies to P = nx Px + nz Pz.

Wait, but the question says the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So, the eigenvector will depend on the angles θ and perhaps φ, but since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero, so maybe θ is the only relevant angle here.

Wait, but the operator is spin-1/2, so maybe the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. Oh right, the eigenvalue given is +ħ/2. So we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the +1 eigenvalue.

But wait, the operator P is given as a vector operator. So the components are each 2x2 matrices. Let me write down the matrices:

Px is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So the operator P in the direction n is (sinθ)(Px) + (cosθ)(Pz). Let me compute that.

So substituting:

P = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute the matrix:

Top-left element: (ħ/2) [ sinθ * 0 + cosθ * 1 ] = (ħ/2) cosθ
Top-right: (ħ/2) [ sinθ * 1 + cosθ * 0 ] = (ħ/2) sinθ
Bottom-left: (ħ/2) [ sinθ * 1 + cosθ * 0 ] = same as top-right, so (ħ/2) sinθ
Bottom-right: (ħ/2) [ sinθ * 0 + cosθ * (-1) ] = -(ħ/2) cosθ

So the matrix P is:

[ (ħ/2 cosθ)      (ħ/2 sinθ) ]
[ (ħ/2 sinθ)     -(ħ/2 cosθ) ]

We're looking for eigenvectors of this matrix with eigenvalue +ħ/2. Let's denote the eigenvalue as λ. So:

[ (ħ/2 cosθ)      (ħ/2 sinθ) ] [a]   = λ [a]
[ (ħ/2 sinθ)     -(ħ/2 cosθ) ] [b]     [b]

Here [a; b] is the eigenvector. Substitute λ = +ħ/2.

So each equation becomes:

(ħ/2 cosθ) a + (ħ/2 sinθ) b = (ħ/2) a
(ħ/2 sinθ) a - (ħ/2 cosθ) b = (ħ/2) b

We can divide both equations by ħ/2 to simplify:

1. cosθ a + sinθ b = a
2. sinθ a - cosθ b = b

Let's rearrange equation 1:

cosθ a + sinθ b - a = 0
a (cosθ -1) + sinθ b = 0
Equation 1: a (cosθ -1) = - sinθ b

Equation 2:

sinθ a - cosθ b - b =0
sinθ a = b (cosθ +1 )
Equation 2: sinθ a = b (cosθ +1 )

Hmm, so from equation 2, express a in terms of b:

a = [ (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ ] * b

Wait, but we can substitute a from equation 2 into equation 1.

From equation 2: a = [ (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ ] b
Substitute into equation 1:

(cosθ - 1 ) [ (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ ] b + sinθ b = 0

Multiply through:

[ (cosθ -1)(cosθ +1) / sinθ ] b + sinθ b = 0

Simplify numerator: (cos^2θ -1) = - sin^2θ

So,

[ (- sin^2θ ) / sinθ ] b + sinθ b = 0
=> (- sinθ ) b + sinθ b = 0
Which simplifies to 0 =0. So the two equations are dependent, and we only get one condition.

So the eigenvector is determined up to a scalar multiple. Let's use equation 2:

sinθ a = (cosθ +1 ) b
So,

a = ( (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ ) b

Let me write this as:

a = [ (1 + cosθ ) / sinθ ] b

Notice that (1 + cosθ) = 2 cos^2(theta/2)
And sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

So,

a = [ 2 cos^2(theta/2) ) / ( 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ) ] b
Simplify:

a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] b
a = cot(theta/2) * b

So, a = cot(theta/2) b.

Let me set b =1 (since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar factor), then a = cot(theta/2).

Wait, but if theta is zero (along z), then a would be undefined. Hmm, but let's proceed.

So the eigenvector can be written as:

[ a ; b ] = [ cot(theta/2) ; 1 ] multiplied by some scalar. But we can write it in terms of sin and cos.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to parameterize the eigenvector. Let me think in terms of spherical coordinates.

Wait, another approach: the eigenvectors for spin-1/2 in the direction theta, phi. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, phi is 0. So the eigenvectors are |+> and |->.

The general eigenstates for spin in direction n are given by:

|+> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T

|-> = [ -i sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ]^T

But since phi is zero here (as n lies in x-z plane, so phi=0), the |+> state becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but when phi is zero, does that change anything? Let me think.

The standard spin-up state along direction n with spherical angles theta and phi is:

|+> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]

So if phi is zero, this becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But wait, in our case, the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi=0. So the eigenvector should be something like [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but earlier calculation gave a = cot(theta/2), so the ratios a/b is cot(theta/2). Which would mean a = (cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)) b.

If I set b = sin(theta/2), then a = cos(theta/2). So the vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Hmm, that's the same as the standard spin-up state in the direction theta, phi=0. So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but let's check if this satisfies the eigenvalue equation.

Let me compute P acting on [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, the matrix P is the operator along direction n, which we've written as:

[ (ħ/2 cosθ)      (ħ/2 sinθ) ]
[ (ħ/2 sinθ)     -(ħ/2 cosθ) ]

So when we multiply P by the vector v = [ a, b ]^T, we get:

Top component: (ħ/2 cosθ) a + (ħ/2 sinθ) b
Bottom component: (ħ/2 sinθ) a - (ħ/2 cosθ) b

If v is an eigenvector with eigenvalue +ħ/2, then:

Top component: (ħ/2) a + (ħ/2 sinθ) b = (ħ/2) (a + sinθ b )
Bottom component: (ħ/2 sinθ a) - (ħ/2 cosθ b ) = (ħ/2)( sinθ a - cosθ b )

Wait, but if a = cos(theta/2), b = sin(theta/2), let's compute each component.

Top component:

(ħ/2 cosθ) * cos(theta/2) + (ħ/2 sinθ) sin(theta/2)

Factor out ħ/2:

(1/2) [ cosθ cos(theta/2) + sinθ sin(theta/2) ]

Hmm, using trig identities: cosθ cos(theta/2) + sinθ sin(theta/2) = cos(theta - theta/2) = cos(theta/2) )

So top component is (ħ/2) cos(theta/2 )

But the eigenvalue is (ħ/2), so for the top component, it should be (ħ/2) * (a) ?

Wait, wait, no. The eigenvalue equation is P v = λ v, so each component is λ times the corresponding component of v.

So for the top component, it should be (ħ/2) a.

So if v = [ a, b ]^T, then P v = [ (ħ/2) a, (ħ/2) b ]^T.

So let's compute the top component:

(ħ/2 cosθ) a + (ħ/2 sinθ) b = (ħ/2) [ cosθ a + sinθ b ]

We expect this to equal (ħ/2) a.

So:

cosθ a + sinθ b = a --> equation (1)

Similarly, the bottom component:

(ħ/2 sinθ) a - (ħ/2 cosθ) b = (ħ/2) [ sinθ a - cosθ b ] = (ħ/2) b

So,

sinθ a - cosθ b = b --> equation (2)

Now, putting v = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]:

Equation (1):

cosθ cos(theta/2) + sinθ sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2 )

Let me compute the left side:

cos(theta) cos(theta/2) + sin(theta) sin(theta/2)
= cos(theta - theta/2) ) [using cos(A-B) = cosA cosB + sinA sinB ]
= cos(theta/2)

Which equals the right side. So equation (1) holds.

Equation (2):

sinθ cos(theta/2) - cosθ sin(theta/2) = sin(theta/2 )

Left side:

sin theta cos(theta/2) - cos theta sin(theta/2 ) 
= sin(theta - theta/2) 
= sin(theta/2 )

Which equals the right side. So equation (2) holds.

So yes, the vector [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] is indeed an eigenvector with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

But wait, the problem is about a muon. So the eigenvector would be a two-component spinor. The options given are a bit confusing because some of them have sqrt(2/3) ħ and other factors.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what we derived. But wait, option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but they are just the components, and the eigenvector is normalized.

Wait, let me check the normalization of the vector [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

The norm squared is cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) = 1, so it's already normalized.

But looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is correct, but let me check the other options.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)) — but phi is zero, so it becomes (cos(theta), sin(theta)), which doesn't match our vector. Also, our vector has theta/2.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) ħ and other factors, but I don't see where those would come from. Unless I've made a mistake.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the operator.

Wait, the problem says "muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane." So the direction is (sinθ,0, cosθ), which is correct.

But wait, the operator P is given as a vector operator. So the components are for the spin-1/2 system, so the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So our analysis should be correct.

So then, the answer should be option C.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option C: ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

But wait, the eigenvector is a column vector with these components. So option C looks correct.

Wait, but looking back, the given options have some options with hbar multiplied. For example, option A has sqrt(2/3) hbar, etc. But our derived vector doesn't have any hbar terms because the eigenvector is a dimensionless vector, just a spinor. So options B and C don't have hbar, but options A and D do.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me think again.

Wait, the operator P is given with components that have ħ/2 multiplied by matrices. So the operator itself is ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices. So when we find the eigenvector, it's the spinor, which doesn't have any ħ in it. So the eigenvector components are just the angles, no ħ.

Looking back at the options:

Option C is correct, as it doesn't have ħ. And the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), which is what we found.

So the correct answer must be option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each given as $\hbar/2$ times a $2 \times 2$ matrix. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so it can be parameterized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle from the z-axis.

### Step 1: Construct the operator $\vec{P}$ in the direction $\vec{n}$
The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is given by:
\[
P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z
\]
Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, and using the given matrices for $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, we find:
\[
P = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left[ \sin\theta \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} + \cos\theta \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \right]
\]
Simplifying, the matrix representation of $P$ is:
\[
P = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 2: Solve for the eigenvector with eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
P \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}
\]
Substituting the matrix for $P$, we get two equations:
1. $\cos\theta \cdot a + \sin\theta \cdot b = a$
2. $\sin\theta \cdot a - \cos\theta \cdot b = b$

From these equations, we find that:
\[
a = \frac{\cos\theta + 1}{\sin\theta} b
\]
Using trigonometric identities, this simplifies to:
\[
a = \cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) b
\]
Choosing $b = \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)$ (to normalize the eigenvector), we find:
\[
a = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\]

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$  
  This does not match the derived eigenvector, as it introduces unnecessary factors of $\hbar$ and $\sqrt{2/3}$, $\sqrt{1/3}$, which are not present in the solution.

- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$  
  This is incorrect because the eigenvector depends on $\theta/2$, not $\theta$, and $\phi = 0$ (since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane).

- **Option C**: $(\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right))$  
  This matches the derived eigenvector exactly.

- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right))$  
  This is incorrect because it introduces unnecessary normalization factors involving $\hbar$ and $\sqrt{2/3}$, $\sqrt{1/3}$, which do not appear in the solution.

### Final Answer
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.

**Answer: C**
