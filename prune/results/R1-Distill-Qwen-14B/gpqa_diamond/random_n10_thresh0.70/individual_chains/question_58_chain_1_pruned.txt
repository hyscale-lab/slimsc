Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, right? Divergences are those infinite terms that pop up in calculations, which are unphysical. Regularization helps to make these calculations finite by introducing a cutoff or some other method.

So the question is asking which theory doesn't need regularization when the energy scales are high. Let me go through each option.

Option A is Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a bit different from the usual quantum field theories. Strings are one-dimensional objects, and they're supposed to replace point particles. I remember that string theories are finite, meaning they don't have the same kind of divergences that quantum field theories do. Wait, so maybe superstring theory doesn't require regularization because it's already finite at high energies. That would make sense because one of the selling points of string theory is that it's a theory that doesn't have the same problems with infinities.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to Quantum Yang-Mills. Wait, in QCD, the coupling constant becomes strong at high energies due to asymptotic freedom. But I'm not sure if it requires regularization. Wait, all quantum field theories need some form of regularization to handle loop divergences. But maybe because QCD is a non-abelian theory, it's more complex, but still, you'd need to regularize. Like, when calculating loop diagrams, you get divergences, so you need to regularize them. So QCD would require regularization.

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-known fact that QED has divergent loop diagrams, especially in higher-order processes. The renormalization procedure is used, which involves regularization as a step. So QED definitely requires regularization. Without regularization, you can't compute things like the Lamb shift or other effects accurately.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, classical theories don't have the same issues with divergences as quantum theories. In classical E&M, you have things like the fields of point charges, which have issues with self-energy and such. But those are more about the limitations of the classical theory, not requiring regularization. But regularization is a quantum field theory concept. So in classical theories, you don't use regularization techniques
