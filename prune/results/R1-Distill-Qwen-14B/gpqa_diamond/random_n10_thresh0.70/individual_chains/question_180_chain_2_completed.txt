Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts yet, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, let's read the question again. We've got an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, which probably means we can ignore kinetic energy considerations and focus on potential energy.

The setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. Oh, so the 13th is at the center, and the others are arranged in a circle of radius 2 meters around it? Or maybe they're just fixed at that distance; the arrangement might not matter for the potential energy calculation, but I'm not sure.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals. Minimum energy... Hmm. Oh, wait, potential energy in electric systems is related to the configuration of charges. To find the minimum energy, we probably need to calculate the potential energy of the system in its lowest energy state.

So, the formula for electric potential energy between point charges is something like U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant. But since there are multiple charges, we might have to sum all the pairwise interactions.

Wait, but wait a second. There are 13 charges. One is at point P, and the others are at 2m away. So the 13th charge is at the center, and the other 12 are each at 2m from it. So each of the 12 charges is at distance 2m from the 13th. But what about the interactions among the 12 charges themselves? Oh, right, because they are all identical and placed at the same distance from P, their mutual repulsion will contribute to potential energy as well.

So the total potential energy U is the sum of two parts: the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12 charges, plus the potential energy between each pair among the 12 charges.

Let me break that down.

First part: The 13th charge (q13) is at P, and each of the 12 charges (q1 to q12) are at 2m from it. So the potential energy between q13 and each qi is U_i = k*(q13 * qi) / r. Since all the 12 charges are identical, each contributes the same amount.

But wait, since q13 is at P, and each of the 12 is at 2m, the potential energy between each pair is the same. So for each of the 12 charges, the potential energy added is k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m). Wait, wait, no: q13 is fixed, and each of the other charges is 2e. No, wait, all 13 are identical, each with charge 2e. So q13 is 2e, and each qi is also 2e.

So the potential energy between q13 and each qi is U_i = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) because the distance r is 2m.

Since there are 12 such charges, the total contribution from this part is 12 * [k*(2e)^2/(2m)].

Second part: The potential energy between each pair among the 12 charges. Since each pair of charges among the 12 will contribute their own U. How many such pairs are there? Well, for n charges, the number of unique pairs is n*(n-1)/2. Here, n=12, so 12*11/2 = 66 pairs.

But wait, what's the distance between any two of the 12 charges? If all 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, their arrangement could matter. But if they're all on a sphere of radius 2m around P, the distance between any two would depend on their positions. To find the minimal energy, perhaps the charges arrange themselves as far away from each other as possible. But wait, no, because the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2m from P, so their positions are fixed at that radius. Wait, no, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, so their distance from P is fixed, but their arrangement on the sphere can vary. But to minimize the potential energy, the charges would arrange themselves to minimize repulsion, but since they're identical and repel each other, the minimal energy might correspond to maximum separation. Which, on a sphere, is when they are as far apart as possible. But wait, the problem is about the minimum energy of the system. Wait, but potential energy is a measure of the work done to assemble the charges. Since like charges repel, bringing them together increases potential energy. So the minimum potential energy would be when the charges are as far apart as possible, which would be when they are as spread out as possible on the sphere.

Wait, but in reality, the potential energy is the sum of all the pairwise potentials. Since each pair of charges contributes U = k*(2e)^2 / r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between the i-th and j-th charge. To minimize the potential energy (since it's positive, because same charges), we need to arrange the charges so that the sum of all these U's is as small as possible. But because r_ij is in the denominator, smaller r_ij would lead to larger U. So to minimize the sum, we need the r_ij's to be as large as possible. So arranging the 12 charges as far apart as possible would minimize the sum, leading to the minimal potential energy.

Wait, but if the 12 charges are on a sphere of radius 2 meters, the maximum possible distance between any two would be 4 meters (diametrically opposite points). But the actual average distance depends on the arrangement. However, calculating the exact potential energy might be complicated unless the arrangement is symmetric. Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't require knowing the exact arrangement. Maybe the potential energy between the 12 charges is calculated by assuming they're all at the same distance apart, but that's probably not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem simplifies by considering each of the 12 charges to be a distance 2m from each other, but that's not correct because, on a sphere of radius 2m, the distance between two points isn't 4m unless they are at opposite ends.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the minimum energy of the system. The system includes both the interactions between the 13th charge and each of the 12, and the interactions between each pair of the 12. So perhaps I should calculate each part separately.

Let's break it down:

Part 1: Potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12.

Each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P. So for each, the potential energy is U_i = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m). There are 12 such terms, so sum them up.

Part 2: Potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges. Since each pair is at some distance, but in reality, each pair is at a distance of 2 * 2m * sin(theta/2), where theta is the angle between them as seen from P. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to compute. But if the 12 charges are equally spaced on a circle (like the vertices of a regular icosagon), their mutual distances would vary, but perhaps the problem assumes that all mutual distances are the same. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to treat each pair as being at a fixed distance, which is 2 meters. But that can't be right because if all 12 are at 2m from P, their separation would be more than 2m if they're on a circle.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem ignores the potential energy between the 12 charges and only considers their potential energy with the central charge. That would be an oversimplification, but maybe the options suggest that. Let me see.

Wait, the options given are A) 5.645e-26, B) 2.822e-26, C) 7.056e-27, D) 122.330. These are all very small numbers except D. Since the charges are 2e, and considering Coulomb's constant is about 8.988e9 N m²/C², the potential energies would be on the order of 1e-25 J or so, so option D is much larger, probably not correct. So the correct answer is likely among A, B, or C.

But let's proceed. So, if I'm to compute the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 others, and also between the 12 others themselves, how would that be done?

First, compute the energy for the central charge.

Each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P. So each contributes k*(2e)^2 / (2m) to the potential energy.

Wait, wait: the potential energy U between two point charges is U = k*(q1 q2)/(r). So for each pair (central charge and one of the 12), it's (2e)(2e)/(2m) multiplied by k. Since there are 12 such pairs, the total energy from this part is 12 * (k*(4e²)/(2m)).

Wait, let me compute that:

U1 = 12 * [k*(2e)(2e)/(2m)] 
= 12 * [k*(4e²)/(2m)]
= 12 * [2 k e² / m]
= 24 k e² / (2m)

Wait, wait, let's re-calculate.

Wait, 4e² divided by 2m is (4/(2)) * e²/(m) = 2 e²/m.

So U1 = 12 * (k * 2 e² / m) = 24 (k e²) / m.

Wait, but m is meters, but wait, wait, no, the denominator is 2 meters, so the denominator is 2 m, where m is meters. Wait, the units might get confusing, but perhaps we can proceed numerically.

Now, the second part: the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

Assuming that each pair is at a distance r from each other, the potential energy between each pair is k*(2e)^2 / r. But what is r?

If all the 12 charges are on a circle of radius 2m around P, the distance between any two adjacent charges would be approximately the chord length. For a regular 12-gon (dodecagon) on a circle of radius R, the chord length between two adjacent points is 2R sin(π/12), because the central angle between two adjacent points is 30 degrees (360/12=30). So sin(15 degrees) is about 0.2588. So 2 * 2m * 0.2588 ≈ 1.035 meters. But this is only for adjacent pairs. The actual average distance would be larger, but perhaps the problem expects us to assume that all the 12 charges are at the same distance from each other, which is 2 meters. But that can't be right because two points on a sphere of radius 2m can't be at 2m apart unless they're at the same point, which isn't possible. So perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are placed in such a way that each is at 2m from P, but their mutual distances are not considered, which would mean that the mutual potential energy is ignored. But that would be incorrect, because the charges would repel each other, and their arrangement would affect the potential energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider only the potential energy between the central charge and the other 12, and not their mutual interactions. But that seems unlikely, as the mutual interactions would contribute a significant amount to the total potential energy.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Let me think differently. Maybe the minimum energy occurs when the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that the potential energy between them is minimized. Which, for identical repelling charges, would mean they are as far apart as possible. So perhaps the system's potential energy is minimized when each of the 12 charges is as far as possible from the others, which would correspond to a regular dodecahedral arrangement on the sphere. But without knowing the exact distances, it's hard to compute their mutual potential energies.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the central charge, and not their mutual interactions. Let's see what that would give.

Compute U1 = 12 * [k*(2e)^2/(2m)].

Compute U2 = 0 (assuming mutual interactions are ignored). But that might not be correct.

But looking at the options, let's see:

e is 1.602e-19 C.

k is 8.988e9 N m²/C².

So let's compute U1.

U1 = 12 * k * (2e)^2 / (2m).

Wait, let me plug in the numbers.

(2e)^2 = 4e².

So U1 = 12 * (8.988e9) * (4*(1.602e-19)^2) / (2 * 2m).

Wait, wait, no, the denominator is 2 meters. So m is 2.

So U1 = 12 * (8.988e9) * (4 * (1.602e-19)^2) / (2 * 2)

Wait, let's compute step by step.

First, compute each term:

(2e)^2 = 4 * (1.602e-19 C)^2 = 4 * (2.566e-38) = 1.0265e-37 C².

Then, (8.988e9 N m²/C²) * (1.0265e-37 C²) = 8.988e9 * 1.0265e-37 = approx 9.24e-28 N m².

Wait, wait, no: 8.988e9 * 1.0265e-37 = (8.988 * 1.0265) * 1e9 * 1e-37 = approximately 9.24 * 1e-28.

Wait, 8.988 * 1.0265 is about 9.24.

So that product is approximately 9.24e-28.

Now, multiply by 4 (from the 4e²)? Wait, wait, no, because the 4 is already included in the 2e squared. Oh, wait: wait no, the earlier step included 4e², which is 4*(1.602e-19)^2. So the 4 is part of the 1.0265e-37, so the product k*(2e)^2 is 8.988e9 * 1.0265e-37 = 9.24e-28.

Then, 9.24e-28 divided by 2 meters (since r is 2m) is 9.24e-28 / 2 = 4.62e-28 J.

Then, multiply by 12 (since 12 charges):

12 * 4.62e-28 = 55.44e-28 J = 5.544e-27 J.

But wait, that's only the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 others. But I'm probably missing the contribution from the mutual interactions between the 12 charges. Because if each of the 12 charges is 2e, then each pair contributes k*(2e)^2 / r_ij. But without knowing r_ij, it's hard to compute.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the mutual interactions between the 12 charges because they are constrained and the problem says 'minimum energy', implying that their mutual arrangement would be such that their potential energy is minimized, which would be when they're as far apart as possible, but without more data, perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge's contribution.

Wait, but let's think about it again. The problem is asking for the minimum energy of the system. So the system's potential energy would be the sum of all the interactions. So I can't ignore the mutual interactions between the 12 charges. So I need to include that.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed such that the 12 charges are at the vertices of a regular icosahedron around the central charge. But without knowing the exact distances, perhaps the problem is simplifying by considering that each of the 12 charges is a distance of 2m from each other as well. But that's not possible because in 3D space, placing 12 points all equidistant from each other is not possible. So perhaps the mutual distances are not all the same, but perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges can be considered as if each charge is at a distance of 2m from every other charge. But that's not correct because that would imply each pair is at 2m apart, which isn't the case if they're all at 2m from P. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering each of the 12 charges to be at a distance of 2m from each other, which is incorrect, but maybe it's an approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy can be found using the formula for a regular polygon arrangement. Wait, but even then, the average distance between the charges would need to be computed.

This is getting complicated, and perhaps I'm missing a simpler approach. Let me think about the problem again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energy is zero. But that doesn't make sense because like charges repel, so their potential energy would be positive.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the other 12, as the mutual interactions are negligible. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to consider only the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12, and not the mutual interactions. Let's compute that and see which option it matches.

Earlier calculation gave U1 = 5.544e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is higher than that. Option B is 2.822e-26, which is larger. So that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate U1.

U1 = 12 * [k*(2e)^2 / (2m)].

Compute each term:

k = 8.988e9 N m²/C².

(2e) = 2 * 1.602e-19 C = 3.204e-19 C.

(2e)^2 = (3.204e-19)^2 = approx 1.0265e-37 C².

So each term is k*(2e)^2/(2m) = (8.988e9) * (1.0265e-37) / (2 * 2).

Wait, wait, the denominator is 2 meters, so 2m = 2 m.

So:

(8.988e9) * (1.0265e-37) = let's compute 8.988e9 * 1.0265e-37.

8.988 * 1.0265 is approximately 9.24.

So 9.24e-28 (because 1e9 * 1e-37 = 1e-28).

Divided by 2 (since 2m), so 9.24e-28 / 2 = 4.62e-28 J per charge.

Multiply by 12: 4.62e-28 *12 = 5.544e-27 J.

Hmm, that's 5.544e-27 J.

But looking at the options, the closest is option C) 7.056e-27, which is a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the math.

Compute (2e)^2: (2 * 1.602e-19)^2 = 4 * (1.602e-19)^2.

(1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

Multiply by 4: 1.0264e-37.

Then, k * (2e)^2 = 8.988e9 * 1.0264e-37 = let's compute 8.988 * 1.0264 = approx 9.24.

So 9.24e-28 J*m.

Divide by 2 meters: 9.24e-28 / 2 = 4.62e-28 J.

Multiply by 12: 4.62e-28 * 12 = 5.544e-27 J.

Hmm, that's correct. So U1 is 5.544e-27 J.

But none of the options match this. Wait, the options are:

A) 5.645e-26
B) 2.822e-26
C) 7.056e-27
D) 122.330.

Wait, 5.544e-27 is about 5.54e-27, but option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 20% higher.

Hmm. Did I miss a factor of 2? Let me think. Wait, the potential energy for a pair is k q1 q2 / r. But when considering multiple pairs, each pair is counted once. So, for example, the energy between the 13th charge and the 12 others is 12 terms, each with U = k*(2e)^2/(2m). So that's correct.

But perhaps the problem includes the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges as well. So I need to calculate that part.

So let's calculate U2, the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

Number of pairs = 12 choose 2 = 66.

Each pair contributes U = k*(2e)^2 / r_ij.

But what is r_ij? Without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem is designed to assume that each pair is at a distance of 2√2 meters apart. Or perhaps the problem is using a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a regular icosahedron around the central charge, but I'm not sure about the distances.

Wait, another approach: perhaps each of the 12 charges is equally spaced on a circle of radius 2m around P, making a regular dodecagon. The distance between two adjacent charges on this circle would be 2 * R * sin(π/12), where R is 2m. So sin(15 degrees) is approximately 0.2588. So the distance between adjacent charges would be 2 * 2 * 0.2588 = 1.035 meters.

But then, the average distance between any two charges would be more than 2m, but it's hard to compute without knowing the exact distribution.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is negligible compared to the energy from the central charge. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects that only the central charge's contribution is considered, and the mutual interactions are ignored. In that case, U1 is 5.544e-27 J, which doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J. That's exactly twice what I calculated for U1.

Ah! Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of U1. Let me recheck.

Wait, U1 is 12 * [k*(2e)^2/(2m)].

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units. Let's compute everything step by step.

Compute 2e: 2 * 1.602e-19 C = 3.204e-19 C.

(2e)^2 = (3.204e-19)^2 = 1.026e-37 C².

k = 8.988e9 N m²/C².

So each term is 8.988e9 * 1.026e-37 / (2 * 2).

Wait, denominator is 2 meters. So:

8.988e9 * 1.026e-37 = let's compute 8.988e9 * 1.026e-37 = (8.988 * 1.026) * 1e9 * 1e-37.

8.988 * 1.026 ≈ 9.24.

So 9.24e-28.

Divide by 2 meters: 9.24e-28 / 2 = 4.62e-28 J per charge.

Multiply by 12: 4.62e-28 * 12 = 5.544e-27 J.

Wait, that's correct. So U1 is 5.544e-27 J.

So none of the options match, unless I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is also significant. Let's see, if each of the 66 pairs contributes k*(2e)^2 / r, and r is 2m, then U2 would be 66 * [k*(2e)^2/(2m)].

Wait, so U2 = 66 * [k*(2e)^2/(2 * 2)].

Wait, wait no, if r=2m, then U2 for each pair would be k*(2e)^2/(2m).

So U2 = 66 * (k*(2e)^2/(2m)).

Wait, that would be 66 * [k*(4e²)/(2m)].

Wait, but let's compute that.

(2e)^2 = 4e² = 4*(1.602e-19)^2 = 1.026e-37 C².

So each U_ij is (8.988e9) * (1.026e-37) / (2 * 2).

Wait, denominator is 2*2=4 meters?

Wait, no, the distance between two charges on the sphere would be more than 2m. Wait, but if I'm assuming that the mutual distance is 2m, which is incorrect, but perhaps the problem is making that assumption.

If I proceed with this, then each pair contributes (8.988e9) * (1.026e-37) / (2) meters (since r=2m), so:

(8.988e9) * (1.026e-37) = 9.24e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.62e-28 J.

Multiply by 66 pairs: 66 * 4.62e-28 = 3.0492e-26 J.

So U2 is 3.0492e-26 J.

Then, the total potential energy U_total = U1 + U2.

U1 is 5.544e-27 J.

U2 is 3.0492e-26 J.

So U_total = 5.544e-27 + 3.0492e-26 = 3.6036e-26 J.

But looking at the options, option A is 5.645e-26, which is higher than this. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distance is 4m. Let me think.

If the mutual distance r is 4m, then U_ij for each pair is k*(2e)^2/(4m).

So U2 = 66 * [k*(4e²)/(4m)].

Wait, 4e² is (2e)^2, and denominator is 4m.

So U_ij = (8.988e9) * (4e²) / 4m.

Wait, let's compute that.

(2e)^2 = 4e² = 1.026e-37 C².

So U_ij = (8.988e9) * (1.026e-37) / 4.

Which is (9.24e-28) /4 = 2.31e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 66: 66 * 2.31e-28 = 1.5246e-26 J.

Adding U1 (5.544e-27 J), total U = 1.5246e-26 + 5.544e-27 = 2.079e-26 J.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently. Perhaps the mutual potential energy is zero because the charges are arranged symmetrically, and their repulsive forces balance out. But that's not correct because potential energy is a scalar and the sum of all pairwise potentials would not cancel out.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy only between the 13th charge and the 12 others, and not their mutual interactions. In that case, the energy is 5.544e-27 J, which isn't an option. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, looking at option C: 7.056e-27 J.

Wait, 7.056e-27 is about twice 3.528e-27, which is close to my earlier U1 (5.544e-27), but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the number of terms. Wait, in the mutual interactions, each pair is counted once, so 66 pairs. But when considering the central charge, there are 12 terms.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the central charge and from each other. But that's not possible, as I thought earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is at a distance of 2m from the central charge, and the mutual distances are the same as 2m as well. But that's impossible because you can't have 12 points all at 2m from a center and all at 2m apart from each other. Because two points on a sphere of radius R can't be at distance R from each other unless R=0, which isn't possible.

Therefore, perhaps the mutual potential energy is not being considered in the problem, and the answer is just U1 = 5.544e-27 J. But that's not an option provided.

Wait, the options are:

A) 5.645 x 10^-26

B) 2.822 x 10^-26

C) 7.056 x 10^-27

D) 122.330

Hmm. 5.544e-27 is 5.544 x 10^-27, which is 0.5544e-26. Option C is 7.056e-27, which is 0.7056e-26. Close but not exact.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute U1 accurately.

Compute (2e)^2: (2 * 1.602e-19)^2 = 4 * (2.566e-38) = 1.0264e-37 C².

k = 8.988e9 N m²/C².

Each U_i = k*(2e)^2/(2m) = (8.988e9) * (1.0264e-37) / (2 * 2).

Wait, 2m is 2 meters, so denominator is 2.

Wait, 8.988e9 * 1.0264e-37 = let me compute that more accurately.

8.988e9 = 8.988 x 10^9.

1.0264e-37 = 1.0264 x 10^-37.

Multiplying them: 8.988 * 1.0264 ≈ 9.24.

So 9.24 x 10^(-28) J·m.

Divide by 2 meters: 9.24e-28 / 2 = 4.62e-28 J per charge.

Multiply by 12: 4.62e-28 * 12 = 5.544e-27 J.

Hmm. So that's correct. So the potential energy from the central charge is 5.544e-27 J.

But again, none of the options match this. So perhaps the problem is asking only for this part, and the correct option is not listed. But that can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. The potential energy between two point charges is U = (k q1 q2)/r. But when you have multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of all pairwise interactions.

Wait, but when you have a central charge and surrounding charges, the potential energy is the sum of each surrounding charge's potential energy due to the central charge, plus the potential energy between each pair of surrounding charges.

Wait, so if the 12 surrounding charges are each at 2m from the center, then the potential energy between each surrounding charge and the center is U1 = 12 * [k*(2e)^2/(2m)].

The potential energy between each pair of surrounding charges is U2 = sum over all i<j of [k*(2e)^2 / r_ij].

But without knowing r_ij, it's impossible to compute U2 exactly. So perhaps the problem is designed to ignore U2, considering it negligible, but that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the 12 charges arranged in such a way that their mutual distances are 2√2 meters, but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the others, which is U1 =5.544e-27 J. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy in a different way. Maybe it's considering the potential energy of the entire system relative to a reference point, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Let's think about the total potential energy as the sum for each of the 12 charges when brought from infinity to their positions.

The work done to bring each charge to its position is the potential at that position due to all the other charges that have already been placed.

Wait, that's the standard way to calculate potential energy for a system of charges. So perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the potential energy by this method.

So, the process is:

1. Bring the first charge (q1) to position 1. Since no other charges are present, the work done is zero. So U1 = 0.

2. Bring the second charge (q2) to position 2. The potential at position 2 due to q1 is k*(2e)/(2m). So the work done is U2 = k*(2e)^2/(2m).

3. Bring the third charge (q3) to position 3. The potential at position 3 due to q1 and q2 is k*(2e)/(2m) + k*(2e)/(r_12), where r_12 is the distance between positions 1 and 2. But if all surrounding charges are at the same distance from the center, the distance between any two surrounding charges is 2m * 2 * sin(theta/2), where theta is the angle between them as seen from the center. For 12 charges arranged regularly, theta = 360/12 = 30 degrees. So sin(15 degrees) ≈ 0.2588. So r_12 = 2m * 2 * 0.2588 = 1.035 m. So the potential at position 3 is due to q1 and q2, each at 2m and r_12 =1.035 m, respectively.

So the work done for q3 is (k*(2e)/(2m)) + (k*(2e)/(1.035 m)).

And so on for each subsequent charge.

This approach would give the correct total potential energy, but it's very tedious for 12 charges. Plus, without knowing the exact r_ij for each pair, it's time-consuming.

But perhaps the problem is designed to ignore the mutual interactions and only consider the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the central charge. In that case, the total potential energy is U1 =5.544e-27 J. But none of the options match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering all the charges, including the central one, in terms of their potential energy. Wait, no, because the central charge is fixed, so its potential energy isn't changing.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the system in terms of the potential energy of the 12 charges only, and the central charge is fixed, so the potential energy is the sum of the central charge's interactions and the mutual interactions.

But I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12 others, which is 5.544e-27 J, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of terms.

Wait, 12 charges, each with charge 2e, and the central charge also 2e. So each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy of k*(2e*(2e))/(2m). So 12 terms.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to multiply by 2e for each charge. Let me recheck.

No, the central charge is 2e, and each of the 12 charges is 2e. So the product is (2e)*(2e) = 4e².

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is asking for the total potential energy in a different unit, but the options are in J, so that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are being placed at 2m from P, which is where the 13th charge is. So the potential each charge experiences is due to the 13th charge and the other 11 surrounding charges. But without knowing the arrangement, it's impossible to compute accurately.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed to have the 12 charges arranged such that each is at a mutual distance of 2m from each other. But that's impossible in 3D space, as 12 points can't all be equidistant.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distance is 2√3 m, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is not being considered, and the problem is only about the energy between the 13th charge and the 12. But that doesn't match any option.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J. Let's see what that would correspond to.

Compute 7.056e-27 J.

If U1 is 5.544e-27 J, and perhaps the mutual interactions add another 1.5e-27 J, the total would be 7.044e-27, which is close to option C.

But why would the mutual interactions add that much? Let me see.

If U2 is 1.5e-27, then U_total = 5.544e-27 + 1.5e-27 ≈7.044e-27 J, which matches option C.

But how would U2 be 1.5e-27 J?

U2 = sum of all pairs among 12 charges.

Number of pairs is 66.

Assuming each pair contributes U_ij = k*(2e)^2/(r_ij), and r_ij is much larger than 2m, so perhaps each U_ij is about 1e-28 J.

66 * 1e-28 = 6.6e-27 J, which is larger than 1.5e-27. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are very large, making each U_ij small. But without knowing r_ij, it's hard to tell.

Wait, perhaps the mutual potential energy is zero because the charges are symmetrically arranged. But that's not correct because potential energy is a scalar sum, not a vector sum.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is zero because the system is in a state of equilibrium, but that doesn't mean the potential energy is zero.

I'm stuck. Let me think about the possible options again.

The options are:

A) 5.645e-26

B) 2.822e-26

C) 7.056e-27

D) 122.330.

The values are in J. The only one close to my U1 is option C, which is 7.056e-27. But U1 is 5.544e-27. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that each charge is 2e, so the product is 4e², but perhaps I should have considered each charge as 2e, so each term is (2e)^2=4e², but when considering the central charge, the product is 2e * 2e =4e².

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I should have multiplied by 12, but perhaps I should have multiplied by 24 or some other factor.

Wait, another way: the potential energy between two charges is U = k q1 q2 / r.

In our case, q1 is 2e, q2 is 2e, and r is 2m.

So U = k*(4e²)/(2m) = 2k e²/(m).

But wait, m is meters. So m =2.

So U = 2k e²/(2) = k e².

Wait, wait, no: m is 2 meters, so denominator is 2.

So U = (k *4e²)/(2m) = (4k e²)/(2m) = (2k e²)/m.

So for each of the 12 charges, the energy is (2k e²)/m.

So U1 = 12 * (2k e²)/m.

Wait, m=2, so it's 12*(2k e²)/2 = 12 k e².

Ah! So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculation by not considering that (2e)^2 is 4e², but when I divided by 2m, I should have m=2, which makes the denominator 4.

Wait, let me re-calculate.

Wait, each U_i = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m).

But m is 2 meters, so 2m =4.

So U_i = k*(4e²)/(4) = k e².

So each of the 12 charges contributes k e².

So U1 =12 * (k e²).

k=8.988e9 N m²/C².

e=1.602e-19 C.

So e²= (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38 C².

So U1=12 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 8.988 * 2.566 = approx 23.09 (exactly: 8.988 *2.566 ≈ 23).

So 23.09e-29.

Multiply by 12: 23.09e-29 *12 = 277.08e-29 = 2.7708e-27 J.

Hmm, that's about 2.77e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is 28.22e-27, which is about 10 times higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me compute 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 = 8.988 x1e9.

2.566e-38 = 2.566 x1e-38.

Multiply: 8.988 *2.566 ≈ 23.09.

Exponents: 1e9 *1e-38 = 1e-29.

So 23.09e-29 =2.309e-28.

Multiply by 12: 2.309e-28 *12 =2.7708e-27 J.

Yes, same as before.

So U1=2.7708e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.55 times higher. So perhaps the mutual potential energy is contributing.

Wait, perhaps the mutual potential energy is the same as U1, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute U1 as 12 * [k*(2e)^2/(2m)] plus U2 as 66 * [k*(2e)^2/(2m)], leading to a total.

So U1 =12 * [k*(4e²)/(2m)] =12 * [2k e²/m].

U2=66 * [k*(4e²)/(2m)] =66 * [2k e²/m].

So total U = (12 +66)*2k e²/m =78 * 2k e²/m =156 k e²/m.

Wait, but m=2.

So U=156 k e²/(2) =78 k e².

Wait, let's compute that.

k=8.988e9 N m²/C².

e²=2.566e-38 C².

So 78 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38.

Wait, 78 *8.988e9 = 7.056e11.

7.056e11 *2.566e-38 =7.056 *2.566 = approx 18.14.

So 18.14e-27 J.

Which is 1.814e-26 J.

Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distance is 4m, so U2 would be 66 * [k*(4e²)/(4m)] =66 * [k e²/m].

So U2=66 * [8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 / 2].

Wait, (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

So U2=66 * [8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 /2 ].

Compute denominator 2: 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 =2.309e-28.

Divide by 2: 1.1545e-28.

Multiply by 66: 66 *1.1545e-28=7.596e-27 J.

So U_total= U1 +U2=2.7708e-27 +7.596e-27=1.0367e-26 J.

Still not matching any option.

I'm really stuck here. Let me think about the possible options again.

Option C is 7.056e-27 J. Which is approximately the same as 7.056e-27 J.

Earlier, I computed U1 as 2.77e-27 J.

If I multiply that by 2.55, I get 7.05e-27 J.

But why would that be the case? Maybe the mutual potential energy is about 4.28e-27 J, leading to a total of about 7.05e-27 J.

But without knowing the exact mutual distances, I can't compute that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider only the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 others, and the correct option is not listed, but that can't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the number of pairs. Wait, 12 charges, each contributing to U1: 12 times. But for mutual pairs, it's 12 choose 2, which is 66.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate U1 correctly.

Wait, another approach: the potential energy of the system is the sum of all pairs.

Each pair involving the central charge contributes U = k*(2e)^2/(2m).

There are 12 such pairs, so U1=12 * k*(4e²)/(2m) =12 * 2k e²/m.

Each pair among the 12 contributes U= k*(2e)^2/r_ij.

But without knowing r_ij, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual distances are 2m, which is incorrect but perhaps intended.

In that case, U2=66 * k*(4e²)/(2m) =66 * 2k e²/m.

So total U=U1 + U2 = (12 +66)*2k e²/m =78*2k e²/m.

But m=2, so 78 *2k e²/(2) =78k e².

Compute 78 *8.988e9 =7.056e11.

7.056e11 * (1.602e-19)^2 =7.056e11 *2.566e-38 =1.814e-26 J.

Hmm, but this is 1.814e-26 J, which is not an option. The closest is option B)2.822e-26.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute.

Wait, 78k e²/m.

Wait, m=2, so 78k e²/2 =39k e².

Compute 39*8.988e9 =3.505e11.

3.505e11 *2.566e-38 =3.505 *2.566 = approx 8.982.

So 8.982e-27 J.

Hmm, that's 8.982e-27 J, which is close to option C)7.056e-27 J but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 others, which is 2.77e-27 J, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each charge is 2e, and the central charge is also 2e, so the potential energy between each pair is k*(2e)^2/(2m).

Number of such pairs is 12, so U1=12 * [k*(4e²)/(2m)] =12 * [2k e²/m].

With m=2, U1=12 * (2k e²)/2)=12 k e².

So 12 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 =8.988e9 *2.566e-38 =2.309e-28.

Multiply by 12: 2.7708e-27 J.

Again, same result.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 12 charges and the central charge, and the answer is 5.544e-27 J, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Another thought: perhaps the potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So for the 12 charges, each contributes to the potential energy of the others.

Wait, but that would double count, but in reality, each pair is counted once.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from the central charge, and the mutual distances are 4m. So each mutual pair contributes k*(2e)^2/(4m).

So U2=66 * [k*(4e²)/(4m)] =66 * [k e²/m].

With m=2, U2=66 * [k e²/(2)].

So 66 * (8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 /2).

Compute denominator 2:8.988e9 *2.566e-38=2.309e-28.

Divide by 2:1.1545e-28.

Multiply by 66:7.596e-27 J.

Then, U_total=U1 +U2=5.544e-27 +7.596e-27 =1.314e-26 J.

Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are 2√2 m, which is about 2.828 m.

So U_ij= k*(4e²)/(2√2 m).

Wait, m=2, so denominator is 2√2 *2 =4√2.

So U_ij= k*4e²/(4√2) =k e²/(√2).

So U2=66 * (k e² /√2).

Compute that:66 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 /√2.

√2≈1.414.

Compute 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 =2.309e-28.

Divide by 1.414: 2.309e-28 /1.414 ≈1.633e-28.

Multiply by 66:1.073e-26 J.

Then U_total=U1(5.544e-27) +1.073e-26=1.627e-26 J.

Still not matching any option.

I'm really stuck. Perhaps I should look for a pattern in the options.

Option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is twice the value I computed earlier for U1 when I thought U1 was 3.528e-27 J.

Wait, perhaps when I did the calculation earlier and thought U1 was 5.544e-27, I should have considered that each of the 12 charges contributes k*(2e)^2/(2m), but perhaps the central charge is also being considered as part of the mutual interactions, leading to a different count.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the central charge as the only contribution, and the minimum energy is 5.544e-27 J. But that's not an option.

Wait, looking at option C again:7.056e-27 J.

Wait, 7.056e-27 is exactly 2.56 times 2.75e-27.

Wait, perhaps the mutual potential energy is being considered as 4.31e-27 J, making the total 7.05e-27 J.

But without knowing the exact mutual distances, I can't compute this.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges as zero, which isn't correct but perhaps is the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge's contribution, and the correct answer is option C, but I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute U1 again.

Each U_i = k*(2e)^2/(2m).

2e is 3.204e-19 C.

So (2e)^2=1.026e-37 C².

k=8.988e9 N m²/C².

r=2 m.

So U_i= (8.988e9)*(1.026e-37)/(2*2) = (9.24e-28)/4 =2.31e-28 J.

Multiply by 12:2.31e-28 *12=2.772e-27 J.

Hmm, same result.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from the central charge and from each other. But as I thought earlier, that's impossible. So perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as considering the charges as being placed in a way that each is at 2m from the center and from each other, which would be a cube or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy in a different way, such as the potential energy of the 12 charges relative to the central charge, but that's what I've been calculating.

I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the potential energy due to the central charge is approximately 2.77e-27 J. But none of the options match this. The closest option is C)7.056e-27 J, which is approximately 2.55 times higher. Perhaps the mutual potential energy is contributing this amount, but without knowing the exact arrangement, I can't compute it accurately.

Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option C)7.056e-27 J.


To determine the minimum energy of the system, we analyze the potential energy contributions from the interactions between the charges. The system consists of 13 identical particles, each with charge \( 2e \), where \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \). The 13th charge is fixed at point \( P \), while the other 12 charges are constrained to stay at a distance of \( 2 \, \text{m} \) from \( P \). The total potential energy of the system is the sum of two contributions:

1. **Potential Energy Between the Central Charge and the 12 Surrounding Charges**  
   Each of the 12 charges interacts with the central charge. The potential energy between two charges is given by:  
   \[
   U = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r}
   \]  
   Here, \( q_1 = q_2 = 2e \), \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \), and \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \). Substituting:  
   \[
   U_{\text{central}} = 12 \cdot k \frac{(2e)^2}{2}
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   U_{\text{central}} = 12 \cdot k \frac{4e^2}{2} = 12 \cdot 2k e^2
   \]  
   Substituting \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \) and \( e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \):  
   \[
   U_{\text{central}} = 12 \cdot 2 \cdot (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (2.566 \times 10^{-38})
   \]  
   \[
   U_{\text{central}} \approx 2.77 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
   \]

2. **Potential Energy Between the 12 Surrounding Charges**  
   The 12 charges are identical and repel each other. The number of unique pairs among 12 charges is:  
   \[
   \text{Number of pairs} = \binom{12}{2} = 66
   \]  
   The potential energy between each pair depends on their mutual distance \( r_{ij} \). However, the problem does not specify the exact arrangement of the 12 charges, making it difficult to compute \( r_{ij} \) directly. Assuming the charges are evenly distributed on a sphere of radius \( 2 \, \text{m} \), the mutual distances are greater than \( 2 \, \text{m} \), and the mutual potential energy is positive but smaller than the energy due to the central charge.

   If the mutual potential energy is negligible compared to the energy from the central charge, the total potential energy of the system is dominated by \( U_{\text{central}} \). However, if the mutual interactions contribute significantly, the total energy would be higher.

3. **Comparison with Options**  
   The calculated energy due to the central charge is \( U_{\text{central}} \approx 2.77 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \). This does not match any of the provided options directly. However, option \( C \) (\( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)) is approximately 2.55 times larger than \( U_{\text{central}} \), suggesting that the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges might contribute significantly to the total energy. Without explicit details about the mutual distances, it is challenging to confirm this, but \( C \) is the closest match.

Given the analysis, the minimum energy of the system is most consistent with option \( C \).  

**Answer: C**
