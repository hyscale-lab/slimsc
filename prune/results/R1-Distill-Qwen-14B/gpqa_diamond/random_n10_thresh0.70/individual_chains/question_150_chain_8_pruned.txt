Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and then it's reacted through a series of reagents. I need to find out what the final product is from the options provided.

First, I think I should interpret the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. Then, I can see what each reagent does in the reaction steps and determine the product.

Looking at the NMR:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a triplet around 9.7 ppm. A triplet in the aromatic region might suggest something like an aldehyde proton, but wait, the integration is 1H. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe that's an aldehyde group.

- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): Doublet, 2H. This could be part of an aromatic ring, maybe para-substituted. Like if there are two substituents in the para positions, but wait, in a para-substituted benzene, each proton would be a doublet. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent on a benzene ring, like another ring attached.

Wait, let me think. Another possibility is that this is a doublet from a vinyl group. Or perhaps an aromatic ring with two protons in a doublet. But with 2H, maybe it's a pair of equivalent protons in an aromatic ring. So maybe a para-substituted benzene ring? Like if there's a substituent on the benzene ring, causing the protons to be in a doublet.

But wait, the other peak at 6.51 ppm is also a doublet with 2H. So that's another set of two protons as a doublet. Hmm, maybe this is a para-substituted ring where each substituent is a group that splits the protons into doublets. Alternatively, maybe we have two aromatic rings connected in some way.

Looking at the other peaks: 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H). Broad singlet, 2H. That could be an aromatic ring with two protons that are not split much, maybe because they're on a substituent that's adjacent to an electrondonating group. Or perhaps this is a benzyl group or some sort of coupling where the pro
