Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm, the question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between those levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, and the photospheres are in LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy states follows the Boltzmann distribution.

Right, the Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is n2/n1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Here, n2 is the population of the higher energy level, and n1 is the lower one. Since the energy difference ΔE is E2 - E1, the equation becomes n2/n1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ).

In this problem, for star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. Wait, what's the exact wording? Oh, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So I think that means the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or perhaps the ratio of the populations) is higher in star_1 than in star_2.

Wait, no, maybe I should clarify: the problem states that the excited level in star_1 is twice as excited as in star_2. So, for the same energy levels, the population in star_1’s higher level is twice that in star_2’s. So, n1_2/n1_1 = 2? Or is it n2_1/n2_2 = 2? Let me think.

Wait, let's get the variables right. Let's denote for star 1 and star 2:

For star 1: ratio is n1_upper / n1_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = x1.

For star 2: ratio is n2_upper / n2_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) = x2.

The problem states that in star_1, the excited level is twice as much as in star_2. Wait, the wording is a bit tricky. It says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as
