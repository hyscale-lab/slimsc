Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that harmonic oscillators are all about systems that return to their equilibrium position with a force proportional to the displacement. But wait, this one is relativistic, so I can't ignore special relativity effects. Oh right, because at high speeds, relativistic effects become significant.

The question is about finding the maximum speed, v_max, of the mass. The options are given, but I need to derive it myself. Let me think about what I know.

In a regular, non-relativistic harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², so the kinetic energy is also (1/2)kA². Then, using KE = (1/2)mv², solving for v gives v = sqrt(kA²/m). Oh, that's option C. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so I can't use that formula directly.

In relativity, the total energy of a particle includes its rest mass energy. The total energy E is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Also, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore; it's E = gamma mc², and the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc².

So for the oscillator, when the potential is maximum (at amplitude A), all the energy is potential, which in the relativistic case would be (1/2)kA²? Or is it different? Wait, in the relativistic scenario, the force is still F = -kx, like the problem says. So the potential energy is (1/2)k x², but when x is A, the potential energy would be (1/2)kA². However, the total energy of the oscillator would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic plus potential. But wait, in the equilibrium case, the potential is zero, so the total energy is all kinetic. But at maximum displacement, all the energy is potential. So equating the two, the total energy E should be equal to (1/2)kA².

Wait, but in the relativistic case, the total energy is gamma mc². So at maximum displacement, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², which should equal the total energy. So (1/2)kA² = gamma mc².

Wait, no. Because when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, all the energy is potential. So the total energy E is (1/2)kA². But E is also gamma mc². So:

(1/2)kA² = gamma mc².

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So solving for v would give the maximum speed.

Wait, but when the oscillator is at x=0, it's moving the fastest. So the maximum speed occurs when all the energy is kinetic. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the points. Let me think again.

In the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is maximum at x = A, and the kinetic energy is maximum at x = 0. So the total energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential. At x = A, the potential is maximum, so all the energy is potential. So E = (1/2)kA². At x = 0, all the energy is kinetic, so E = (gamma - 1)mc², which equals (1/2)kA².

Wait, that's a better approach. So E is the same in both cases. So E = (1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) mc².

So (1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) mc².

Rearranging, gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²).

Hmm, gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)).

So 1/(sqrt(1 - (v²/c²))) ) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me solve for v. Let me denote (kA²)/(2 m c²) as a variable for simplicity. Let’s say a = (kA^
