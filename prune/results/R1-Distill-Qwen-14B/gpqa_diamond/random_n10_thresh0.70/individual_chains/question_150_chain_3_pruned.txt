Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's interesting. The NMR data is provided, and there's a reaction sequence with three steps. I need to figure out what the final product is from the options given.

First, I'll look at the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. The 1H-NMR spectrum has peaks at: 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H).

Let me break down each peak:

- 9.72 ppm (triplet, 1H): That's a pretty high chemical shift, around the range for an aldehyde proton (around 9-10 ppm). So maybe there's an aldehyde group here. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, but wait, an aldehyde proton is usually a singlet because there's only one adjacent carbon with no protons. Hmm, maybe it's a different group. Or maybe it's something else, like an aromatic proton in a specific environment.

Wait, maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents. For example, an aromatic ring where the proton is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl group next to an electron-withdrawing group, like an aldehyde. Hmm.

Wait, looking at another peak: 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H). That looks like two doublets, each integrating to two protons. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring, perhaps. Because in para-substituted benzene, the protons are split into two doublets. For example, if there's a substituent on the ring that's electron-withdrawing, like nitro or something else.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. So plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2 = 5. So five degrees of unsaturation — that could be from a benzene ring (which is three), one double bond or ring, and another ring or double bond. So maybe a benzene ring and an aldehyde group, and perhaps another double bond or ring.

Looking at the NMR again. The 9.72 ppm peak is a triplet. Wait, maybe it's not an aldehyde. Aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and appear around 9-10, but they're typically singlets because there's no adjacent H except on the carbon next to the aldehyde. Wait, unless the aldehyde is adjacent to a CH2 group. Oh wait, but an aldehyde is RCHO. So the aldehyde proton is on the carbonyl, which is adjacent to the R group. So if R is CH2CH2..., it might not have protons adjacent. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, think of an aromatic aldehyde, like benzaldehyde. But in that case, the aldehyde proton would be a singlet. So why is this triplet?

Wait, another possibility: the 9.72 is an aromatic proton that's part of a conjugated system. Maybe it's a substituent on the benzene ring that's next to an electron-withdrawing group, making the proton deshielded and appear at a higher ppm. But I'm not sure.

Looking at the other peaks: 6.27 (bs, 2H). Broad singlet, integrating to two protons. Maybe these are protons on an oxygen-containing group, like an OCH2. Or perhaps they are part of a conjugated system, maybe adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group.

Wait, the 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) is a doublet integrating to two protons. That's probably a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group. The doublet suggests each proton is adjacent to one other proton — so a CH2 where each H is next to one H on the same carbon. So maybe it's an OCH2 group attached to something else.

Putting this together, perhaps there's a benzene ring with substituents. Let me try to imagine the structure.

The 6.98 and 6.51 doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. Let's say it's a substituent in the para position, maybe a nitro group or something else, but wait, the formula has an O, which could be from a hydroxyl group or an ether.

Wait, but the starting compound's molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count the atoms. 8 carbons. If the benzene ring is six carbons, then the substituent is two carbons? Or wait, maybe it's a benzene ring with two substituents, each with one carbon.

Hmm, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps it's a coumarin derivative or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the structure is a diphenyl compound. Like two benzene rings connected by a chain. Let me think: the molecular formula is C8H9NO. If each benzene ring is C6H5, but that's 12 carbons, which is too much. So maybe not two benzene rings. Alternatively, perhaps a benzene ring with a substituent that's a three-carbon chain with an oxygen.

Wait, perhaps the structure
