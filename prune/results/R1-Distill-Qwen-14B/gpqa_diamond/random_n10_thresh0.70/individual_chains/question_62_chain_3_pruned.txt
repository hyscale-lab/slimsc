Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about synthesizing a specific compound: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents from the given options.

First, I should probably sketch out the target molecule and the starting material to visualize what reactions are needed.

The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent attached. Let's break it down. It looks like there's a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which in turn is connected to a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main structure is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group (aldehyde) attached. Then, the substituent is at position 1: a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group. So that part is a CH2-OH group attached to a cyclohexyl ring. So, the substituent is a cyclohexyl group connected via a CH2-OH group.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (-C≡CH). So, it's a sp-hybridized carbon attached to the ring.

Hmm. So, I need to convert ethynylcyclohexane into that target molecule. Let's think about possible reactions.

I think the ethynyl group can be functionalized. Let's consider hydrogenation first. Ethynyl to ethenyl, or maybe all the way to ethyl. Or, perhaps using some kind of oxidation or other functional group transformations.

Wait, the target molecule has an aldehyde group. So, maybe the ethynyl group will be transformed into a carbonyl group. How can that happen?

One way to make a carbonyl is through oxidation. If I can get a CH2 group adjacent to the ring, then oxidizing it would give a ketone or aldehyde. But wait, the starting material is ethynyl, which is a triple bond. So, maybe adding a methyl group and then oxidizing?

Wait, let me think about the possible steps.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd; then Ba(OH)2; then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That seems a bit off. NaNH2 is a strong base, maybe used for deprotonation. Methyl chloride is a methylating agent. So, perhaps an alkylation step.

But wait, ethynylcyclohexane reacting with NaNH2 and methyl chloride. NaNH2 is a strong base, maybe deprotonating something. Methyl chloride as an alkylating agent. Oh, maybe it's a vinylation or alkyne alkylation. Wait, the alkyne is a good nucleophile, can undergo alkylation. So, ethynylcyclohexane treated with methyl chloride in presence of a base like NaNH2 would result in a substitution, adding a methyl group to the triple bond. So, ethynyl (C≡CH) becomes C≡CMe.

Wait, but that would give a propargyl methyl group? So, maybe the first step adds a methyl group to the triple bond, making an internal alkyne.

But then, the second step is H2/Pd. That's hydrogenation. Hydrogenating the triple bond would make a single bond. So, if we have C≡CMe, hydrogenation would give CH2CH2Me, but wait, no. Wait, hydrogenation of an alkyne would typically use H2 and a catalyst like Pd to add hydrogen. So, an internal alkyne (like CH2C≡CCH2-) would become CH2CH2CH2- after hydrogenation, but wait
