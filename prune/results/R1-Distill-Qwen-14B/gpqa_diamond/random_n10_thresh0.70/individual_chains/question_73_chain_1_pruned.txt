Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, the problem states that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m traveling at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question is about finding their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

First, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract the velocities like you would in classical mechanics. Instead, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, no, wait. Wait, when you're finding the relative speed of one object from another's frame, it's (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Because both are moving in the same direction, right? So v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So plugging in, (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

Wait, the numerator is 0.1c. The denominator: (0.3c²)/(c²) is 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So (0.1c)/(0.7) is approximately 0.142857c. So v_rel is about 0.14c. That's one part. Now looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.

Next, the total energy. I think I need to calculate the rest energy plus the kinetic energy, but wait, in relativity, the total energy of an object is gamma multiplied by its rest energy, which is mc². So for each astronaut, their total energy is gamma times their rest mass energy.

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c), gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So v=0.6c, so v²/c² is 0.36. 1 - 0.36 is 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So their energy is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me get this straight. The rest energy is m c², so for the astronaut with mass 2m, the rest energy is 2m c². So when moving, their total energy is gamma * 2m c².

So for the first astronaut: v=0.6c. So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, wait no. Wait, wait, 2m c² times 1.25 is 2.5 m c². Correct.

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. So gamma for this one: 1/sqrt(1 - (0.25)) = 1/sqrt(0.75). sqrt(0.75) is about 0.8660. 1/0.8660 is approximately 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So total energy E is E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². Hmm, looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², which matches this. And option C's relative speed is 0.14c, which is what I calculated earlier.

So the correct answer should be option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

Wait, but let me double-check the relative speed calculation. So the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c.

So v1 - v2 = 0.1c. denominator: 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) → 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So that's correct.

So the total energy is about 5.96 mc². So the answer is option C
