Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are different combinations of these.

Wait, first, I should remember what each symmetry entails. Lorentz symmetry is about how the laws of physics look the same in any inertial frame, right? It includes rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry in both space and time. So Poincare includes Lorentz. CP symmetry is charge conjugation (C) and parity (P) together. CPT is charge, parity, and time reversal symmetry.

Now, SMEFT is an effective theory, which means it's built by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model. These operators are organized by their dimension. The key point is that these operators must respect the underlying symmetries of the Standard Model, I think. Because the SMEFT is supposed to be valid at low energies compared to the Planck scale, but still maintain the same symmetry structure as the SM.

So, the SM respects Lorentz symmetry and Poincare symmetry. Therefore, any operator added in SMEFT must also respect these. Because if they didn't, that would break the symmetries the SM has, but SMEFT is supposed to include the SM as a subset. So, that suggests Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2) must be respected. Wait, but is Poincare the same as Lorentz in this context? Or are they separate?

Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz transformations plus translations. So, if an operator doesn't respect Lorentz, it doesn't respect Poincare either. But the question is about which must be respected. So, operators must respect Lorentz, but Poincare is automatically included because the theory includes translations (since it's a field theory, includes all space and time). Hmm, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars. So Lorentz symmetry (1) is definitely required.

What about the other symmetries: CP and CPT. The Standard Model is known to not respect CP symmetry (like in the CKM matrix with CP violation), but it does respect CPT. So,
