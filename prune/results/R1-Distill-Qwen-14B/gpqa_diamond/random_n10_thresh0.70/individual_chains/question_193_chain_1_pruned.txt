Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's asking.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, right, parallax is a measure of distance—closer stars have larger parallaxes, and more distant ones have smaller. So the number of stars is inversely proportional to plx^5. I need to find out how the number of stars changes with distance, especially per unit range of distance r.

Wait, so the number of stars (let's call it N) is proportional to 1/plx^5. But parallax (plx) is related to distance. I remember that parallax in parsecs (pc) is given by plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So if the distance is r (maybe using r as a unit here), then plx = 1/r. So if I substitute that into the equation, N is proportional to 1/( (1/r)^5 ).

Let me write that down. N ∝ 1/( (1/r)^5 ) → that's the same as N ∝ r^5. Hmm, wait, but wait a minute. Oh, no, wait—no, wait. Because (1/r)^5 is 1/(r^5), so 1 over that would be r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So does that mean the number of stars increases with r^5? But that seems a bit high. Let me think again
