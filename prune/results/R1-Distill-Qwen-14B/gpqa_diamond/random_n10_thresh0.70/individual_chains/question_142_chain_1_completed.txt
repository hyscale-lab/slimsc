Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, let's see what it's all about.

The question gives me a specific density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. So this ρ must be a mixed state, right?

Wait, what's the structure of a density matrix for a qubit? Oh right, for a single qubit, the density matrix is a 2x2 matrix. The general form is something like [[a, b], [c, d]], but I need to think about the properties it should have. Density matrices must be Hermitian, positive semi-definite, and have a trace of 1.

Let me write out ρ. Each term is an outer product. |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding those together gives [[1,0],[0,1]]. Then multiply by 1/2, so ρ becomes [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. Oh wait, that's the identity matrix scaled by 1/2. So ρ = (I)/2.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I'm a bit fuzzy on how the density matrix corresponds to a point in space. I think this has to do with the Bloch sphere representation, which is a way to visualize qubit states.

Wait, for a pure state, the density matrix is |ψ><ψ|, and it can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. But for mixed states, like this one, it's a statistical mixture. How does that translate geometrically?

The Bloch vector representation: any density matrix can be represented as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector and σ are the Pauli matrices. Oh right! So, the density matrix ρ can be written in terms of the Bloch vector r.

So, let's expand that. The Pauli matrices are σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Then, r·σ is r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz.

Our ρ is (1/2)(I). So, setting ρ equal to (I + r·σ)/2 gives (I/2) = (I + r·σ)/2. Multiply both sides by 2: I = I + r·σ. Subtract I from both sides: 0 = r·σ. That implies that r·σ must be zero matrix. So, each component of r must be zero.

Wait, because the only way r·σ equals zero is if r_x, r_y, r_z are all zero. Because if any component isn't zero, then the corresponding Pauli matrix term would contribute a non-zero value. So, the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0).

What does that mean geometrically? The Bloch sphere has all vectors with length ≤1. The origin is the completely mixed state. So, r being (0,0,0) would correspond to the maximally mixed state, which is what ρ is. Because ρ is (I/2), which is the maximally mixed state for a qubit.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which matches this conclusion. So the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state for a single qubit. To analyze its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch vector representation. Any density matrix can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector that determines the position of the density matrix in qubit space.

For the given \(\rho\), we observe that it simplifies to:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

Comparing this with the general form, we see that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\), which implies that all components of \(\mathbf{r}\) must be zero (\(r_x = 0\), \(r_y = 0\), \(r_z = 0\)). This means the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to the maximally mixed state.

In the Bloch sphere representation, the origin (\(r = (0, 0, 0)\)) represents the maximally mixed state. Since \(\rho\) is the maximally mixed state, its geometrical position in qubit space is at the origin.

From the given options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).**

Answer: C
