Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I need to find which statement is correct regarding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the question says that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), right? And S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So I guess S looks like this:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

So Ay = c * S. Let me compute c first. c is h/(4π), so Ay would be (h/(4π)) * S.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the spin matrices for spin-1/2 particles like electrons or muons are usually the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Oh wait, wait. Wait, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, each with elements. Let me recall, the Pauli matrices are:

σ_x = [[0, 1],
        [1, 0]]

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

σ_z = [[1, 0],
        [0, -1]]

Oh! So S looks exactly like σ_y. So S is the Pauli Y matrix. Therefore, Ay is c times σ_y. So, let me write that out:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * σ_y.

But wait, in angular momentum, the operator for S (like spin) is often (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. Because for spin-1/2 particles, the spin matrices are (σ/2) multiplied by ħ. So for example, S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y.

Wait, wait in this problem, the operator is Ay = c * S, and c is h/(4π). Let me compute c * S. Let's see:

If c = h/(4π), then Ay = (h/(4π)) * S. If S is σ_y, then Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

But wait, when I think about the spin matrices, S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y. So the eigenvalues of S_y would be ±ħ
