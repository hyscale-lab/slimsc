Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the pH at two different points during a titration. Hmm, I remember that titration involves neutralizing an acid with a base. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Oh right, diluting a solution changes its concentration. So first, I should calculate the new concentration after dilution.

Wait, I remember the dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So the initial concentration M1 is 0.05 M, and V1 is 20 cm³. The new volume V2 is 40 cm³ because we added another 20 cm³ of water. Oh wait, because 20 + 20 equals 40. So M2 would be (0.05 * 20) / 40. Let me calculate that. 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, we're titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. So I need to find these two pH values and match them with the options provided.

First, let's tackle the equivalence point. The equivalence point is where the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid initially present.

Wait, moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) in the diluted solution. The volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L) and concentration is 0.025 M. So moles are M * V = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles. So at equivalence, we need 0.001 moles of NaOH.

But NaOH's concentration is 0.1 M, so the volume needed would be moles / concentration. 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid
