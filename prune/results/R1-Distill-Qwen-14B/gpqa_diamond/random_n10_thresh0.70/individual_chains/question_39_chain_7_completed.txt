Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the setup is that there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Interesting. And when they measured the positions, none of the particles were found at x less than 1 or x greater than 3. So all the particles are between x=1 and x=3. The question is to find the value of 'a' from the options provided.

Hmm, so I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density of finding a particle at a particular position. So the probability density is |ψ(x)|². Since the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3, that means the wave function must be zero outside this interval, but wait, in this case, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So maybe the real part and the imaginary part are such that the modulus squared is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let me compute the modulus squared. The modulus squared is (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)². Because for any complex number, |a + ib|² = a² + b².

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, the wave function must be normalized. Because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1. So the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1.

But wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared is [ (a^2)/(1+x) ) + (0.5)^2 ].

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx should equal 1.

Let me set that up as an equation:

Integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Breaking this integral into two parts:

a² * ∫(1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3 + 0.25 * ∫ dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Compute each integral.

First integral: ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln|1+x|.

Evaluated from 1 to 3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the first term is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So the equation becomes:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5 from both sides:

a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Solve for a²:

a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2). I remember that ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a is the square root of that.

sqrt(0.7213) is approximately sqrt(0.72) which is around 0.8485. Let me compute more accurately.

0.7213^0.5:

Well, 0.85^2 is 0.7225. Oh, that's very close. Because 0.85 * 0.85 = 0.7225. So 0.7213 is just a little less than that. So a is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation just to be sure.

a² = 0.5 / ln(2) → 0.5 is 1/2. So 1/(2 * ln(2)).

ln(2) is about 0.693147, so 2 * ln(2) is about 1.386294.

So 1/1.386294 ≈ 0.721347.

So a is sqrt(0.721347) ≈ 0.8494. So approximately 0.85. Which matches option B.


To determine the value of \(a\), we start by analyzing the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i.
\]

The probability density is given by the modulus squared of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

Since the particle is only found between \(x=1\) and \(x=3\), the wave function must be normalized such that the total probability is 1. This requires:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

Substituting \(|\psi(x)|^2\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

Breaking this into two parts:

1. **First term**: \(\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx\),
2. **Second term**: \(\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx\).

For the first term, the integral of \(\frac{1}{1+x}\) is \(\ln|1+x|\). Evaluating from \(x=1\) to \(x=3\):

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2).
\]

Thus, the first term becomes:

\[
a^2 \cdot \ln(2).
\]

For the second term, \(\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5\).

Combining both terms, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \cdot \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \(a\) is approximately \(0.85\), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
