Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to think this through step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it my best shot.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using its spectroscopic data. The options given are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. Hmm, I'll need to match the spectroscopic data to the correct formula.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The FTIR shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. That broad peak usually indicates O-H stretching, right? Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Oh wait, but if it's a very broad peak, maybe it's an alcohol because carboxylic acids have a broad O-H too, but maybe they're a bit different. Or perhaps it's an amide, but amides have N-H, which is less likely here. So probably an O-H group, like an alcohol or a ketone? Wait, no, ketones don't have O-H. Wait, maybe it's an ester or something else. Wait, wait, another peak at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Those are high values. The 1700 is likely a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The 1650 could be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation or an amide. But given that, perhaps the compound has two carbonyl groups? Or maybe one is a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, but let me think again. If the 1700 is a carbonyl, like a ketone, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl, maybe an aromatic ester or something with conjugation. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide, but I don't see any N in the options, so probably not. So, perhaps the compound has two carbonyl groups, but that might complicate things. Wait, but wait, let me think: if it's an ester, for example, the carbonyl is around 1740-1700. So 1700 could be that. The 1650 might be an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in a benzene ring with substituents. Or maybe it's an acidic proton, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester. That could explain the 1650, perhaps.

Moving on to the 1H NMR spectrum. It says there are several peaks, including vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound must have a vinyl group, meaning a double bond. So the molecule has a CH₂=CH- or similar structure. So that suggests maybe an alkene is present.

The Mass Spectrometry (MS) data shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, what fragments give 45? Let me think. Common fragments with m/z 45 could be from certain functional groups. For example, a CH3CO+ ion has
