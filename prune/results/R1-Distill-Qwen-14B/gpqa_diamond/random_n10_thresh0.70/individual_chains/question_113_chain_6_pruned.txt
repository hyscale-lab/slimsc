Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might need to think carefully.

The question gives me data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options for the chemical formula are all C6H something O and O2. Let's break down each piece of data.

First, the FTIR. The very broad absorption around 3000 cm-1 probably indicates an -OH group. Broad peaks in that region are usually O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H stretch, maybe even a peak around 3000. But then there are other peaks at 1700 and 1650. Hmm, what do those signify?

1700 is a strong peak, which is often a carbonyl group (C=O). That could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, which might suggest something else. Maybe conjugated carbonyl groups, like in a ketone with adjacent double bonds, or perhaps an aromatic ring. Wait, 1650 is around where C=C (aromatic) might show up, but not always. Alternatively, maybe an ester or conjugated carbonyl.

Then the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl means =CH2, so perhaps the compound has a double bond, maybe in an ester or a ketone with an adjacent double bond. Or maybe it's a conjugated system, like an aromatic ring with substituents that have double bonds.

Looking at the mass spec data, the fragment peak is at m/z 45. Let me think about what fragment would give that. 45 could be a common fragment, maybe like (CH3CO)+, which is 43, but that's not matching. Or perhaps a CH2CO group? Alternatively, maybe a CH2O group, but I'm not too sure. Wait, 45 could be (CH2)2O, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe a methyl group (15) and something else... Hmm, perhaps it's a common fragment like the CH3CO+ ion (43?), but that's not
