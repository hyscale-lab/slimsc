Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the final product after a series of reactions. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the information given.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is 0 here, no halogens. So, (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2. Because N counts as one. Let me compute that: (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and an aldehyde or ketone (another 1?), wait no, maybe an aromatic ring, a conjugated system, and maybe a ring or a double bond and a carbonyl group.

Wait, looking at the NMR data. The peaks are:

9.72 (t, 1H) â€“ that's probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm as a triplet because they're often adjacent to a CH2 group. Wait, but it's a triplet. Hmm.

6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). Those look like two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That's typical for a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like two sets of doublets, each for two protons. So maybe the compound has two aromatic rings, or perhaps one with substituents.

Wait, but wait. The other peaks are 6.27 (bs, 2H) and 3.66 (d, 2H). The 3.66 doublet with 2H suggests maybe a CH2 group attached to something electronegative, like O. Maybe an OCH2 group. The 6.27 is broad singlet for 2H. Could that be a conjugated diene or maybe an enol or something with two protons near an oxygen, maybe on adjacent carbons.

Putting this together, the structure might be something like a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents. Wait, the aldehyde is at 9.72 ppm, which is a triplet. So adjacent to a CH2, which is split into a triplet. So
