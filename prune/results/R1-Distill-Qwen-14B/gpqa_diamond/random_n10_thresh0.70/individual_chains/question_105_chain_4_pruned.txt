Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. 

So, the scenario is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. When the star rotates, these spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. The problem is about how this situation can mimic an exoplanet's signal when observed through photometric time series. 

The question is asking: To get the same amplitude in the light curve as if a planet were causing the dip, what should be the radius of the planet relative to the star? The options are A to D.

Hmm. I remember that when a planet transits a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of this dip depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. For starspots, when they come into view, they make the star appear dimmer because they're cooler and emit less light. So the idea is to find the planet radius that would cause the same dip as the starspots do.

Wait, but the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, we first see more spots, then less. But since the spots are on one side, maybe their effect is more of a rotational modulation, causing a periodic change in brightness. The problem mentions that this can resemble a planet's transit.

Wait, but a planet's transit is a dip when the planet blocks the star's light. So the star's brightness goes down by a certain fraction. Similarly, the spots, being cooler, when they come into view, would lower the overall brightness. So the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots is similar to what a planet would do.

But the question seems to be, what would the planet's radius need to be so that its transit causes the same dip in brightness as the spots do. Wait, no, the other way around: if the star wasn't covered by spots, what planet radius would produce the same dip in the light curve as the spots do when they're present.

Wait, let me clarify. The observed star with spots produces a certain brightness variation. If instead, that variation were caused by a planet, what would the planet's size need to be?

So the problem is about comparing the effect of a planet's transit to the effect of the starspots as the
