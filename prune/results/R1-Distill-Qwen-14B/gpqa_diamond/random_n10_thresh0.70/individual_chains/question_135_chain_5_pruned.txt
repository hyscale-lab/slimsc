Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question gives me the Lagrangian for the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (ν + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse this correctly. Oh, probably it's something like L = -λ f ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y), but I'm not sure about the exact terms. But I think the key here is to figure out which fermions X can decay into.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So, I need to find all possible fermion pairs that X can decay into, considering their masses. Because in particle physics, a boson can decay into a pair of fermions if the combined mass of the fermions is less than the mass of the boson. That's the basic condition for a decay channel to be allowed kinematically.

First, let's note the fermions. The possible fermions are quarks and leptons. Quarks come in up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top, and possibly others, but I think in this context, top is too heavy. Leptons include electrons, muons, taus, and their neutrinos, but neutrinos are very light, so probably negligible. But since the interaction term involves ψ_f, which I think refers to fermion fields, perhaps including quarks and charged leptons.

Wait, the Lagrangian given has a term ψ_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that doesn't quite make sense. Maybe it's supposed to be something like ψ_f(y) X ψ_f(y), but perhaps I should focus on the interaction term.

But the key point is that the interaction allows X to couple to fermions. So the decay X → f fbar (where f is a fermion) would be possible if the mass of X is greater than twice the mass of f. So each fermion has a mass, and 2m_f must be less than 6 GeV.

So I need to list all the fermions where 2m_f < 6 GeV.

Let me list the masses of the known fermions:

- Up quark (u): around 2.2 MeV (but this is a bit tricky because quarks are confined, but for decay purposes, their masses are considered as constituent masses, perhaps around 3-4 GeV? Wait, wait, no, the current quark masses are much lighter. For example, the u quark is about 2.2 MeV, d is about 4.7 MeV, s is about 95 MeV, c is about 1.27 GeV, b is about 4.1 GeV, and top is about 173 GeV. But wait, in reality, when considering decay products, we use the rest mass of the particles. So for a boson to decay into a pair, each fermion must have a mass less than half the boson's mass.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me
