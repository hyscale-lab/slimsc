Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is a bit tricky for me because I'm still learning about astronomy, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means they're spread out evenly in all directions. The main point is how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each being a different power law.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. The formula I think is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is 1 parsec away, and a parallax of 0.5 parsecs would be twice as far.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So if I consider a small change in parallax, like from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars would be in that range?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, their number should depend on the volume of space they occupy. Because density is uniform, the number of stars in a region depends on the volume of that region.

I remember that volume in three dimensions is proportional to the cube of a linear dimension. So maybe this has to do with the volume as a function of distance.

Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so plx = 1/d. So distance d = 1/plx.

If I think about a shell between distances d and d + dr, the volume of this shell is 4πd² dr. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the shell's volume is the difference between two such volumes: (4/3)π(d+dr)^3 - (4/3)πd^3. For small dr, this approximates to 4πd² dr.

But wait, in this problem, we're dealing with a change in parallax, not distance. So if the parallax changes by dplx, how does that relate to the change in distance dr?

Parallax plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Taking the derivative of d with respect to plx: dr/dplx = -1/(plx^2). So dr = - dplx / (plx^2). The negative just indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but we're interested in the magnitude, so I can ignore the sign.

So the volume element in terms of plx would be 4π (d)^2 * dr. Substituting d = 1/plx and dr = dplx / (plx^2).

That gives Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx²) ) = 4π (dplx) / plx^4.

Wait, no. Let me double-check that substitution.

d = 1/plx → d^2 = 1/(plx)^2.

dr = (dplx) / plx^2.

So Volume = 4π * (1/plx²) * (dplx / plx²) ) = 4π dplx / plx^4.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 4π d² dr = 4π (1/plx²) (dplx / plx²) ) = 4π dplx / (plx^4). Hmm, but maybe I should
