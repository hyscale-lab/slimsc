Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator Ay. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem says that Ay is equal to c multiplied by S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π), right? And S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So, I should probably write down what S looks like.

Wait, S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

So then, Ay would be c multiplied by this matrix. So c is h/(4π), so Ay is (h/(4π)) * S. So each element of S is multiplied by h/(4π).

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Oh right, eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0.

Wait, but S is an anti-symmetric matrix. It looks familiar. Oh wait, wait! Oh, S actually is related to the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are sigma x, y, z. Let me think: the Pauli Y matrix is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Wait, that's exactly S! So S is the Pauli Y matrix, sigma_y. Oh, so S = sigma_y.

So, the eigenvalues of sigma_y are known. Wait, what are the eigenvalues of sigma_y? Because sigma matrices are Hermitian, so their eigenvalues are real. Wait, no, wait. Wait, sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z are Hermitian, so their eigenvalues should be real. But wait, sigma_y is Hermitian? Let me check. The conjugate transpose of sigma_y would be:

[0    i ]
[-i   0 ]

Which is the same as sigma_y because sigma_y is equal to its conjugate transpose? Wait, no, wait. Wait, sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Its conjugate transpose would swap the off-diagonal elements and make them positive i. So, the conjugate transpose is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is not the same as sigma_y. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, sigma_y is anti-Hermitian? Because if you take the conjugate transpose, you get negative sigma_y. Because let's compute sigma_y†:

The element (1,2) is -i, so its conjugate is i. So the (2,1) element is i, its conjugate is -i. So sigma_y† is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. Which is -sigma_y, because sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so negative sigma_y would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which matches sigma_y†. So sigma_y is anti-Hermitian: sigma_y† = -sigma_y. So that means that sigma_y is not Hermitian; its eigenvalues are purely imaginary, right?

Wait, but anti-Hermitian matrices have eigenvalues that are purely imaginary. Because if M is anti-Hermitian, then M† = -M. So if v is an eigenvector of M with eigenvalue λ, then Mv = λ v. Then M† v = λ* v. But M† = -M, so (-M) v = λ* v → - M v = λ* v → -λ v = λ* v. So, -λ = λ*, which implies that λ is purely imaginary. So the eigenvalues of sigma_y are imaginary.

So, the eigenvalues of sigma_y are ±i. Because sigma matrices have eigenvalues ±1 for each component. Wait, no, wait. No, wait: for sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z, each has eigenvalues ±1. Because these are Hermitian matrices (wait, no, sigma_y is anti-Hermitian as I found earlier, but wait, perhaps I'm mixing up signs). Wait, let me think again.

Wait, sigma matrices are Hermitian? Let me check their definitions. For sigma_x:
[ [0 1],
  [1 0] ]
