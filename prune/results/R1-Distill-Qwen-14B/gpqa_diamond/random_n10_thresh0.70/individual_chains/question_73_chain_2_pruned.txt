Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I'm supposed to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So, the first thing I need to find is the relative speed between them. Oh wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just subtracting the speeds like in classical mechanics, right? Because when you're dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Right, the formula for relative velocity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, but wait, wait. No, wait. Oh wait, both are moving in the same direction, so I think the formula should be (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)) but wait, actually, that's when you have one object moving at v1 and another at v2 relative to the same frame, and you're finding the speed of one relative to the other. So in this case, let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So in A's frame, what's B's speed?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and B is moving at 0.5c. So from the perspective of the lab frame, which I think is the frame where both are moving, but wait, no, no, the problem says they're moving in the same direction. So which frame are we considering? Oh, wait, the question asks for the relative speed between them. So probably, it's the speed of one as seen from the other.

So, let's take astronaut A's frame. In that frame, astronaut B is moving. So what's the velocity of B relative to A? Let's plug into the formula. So v_relative = (v_B - v_A)/(1 - (v_B v_A)/(c²)).

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, when you're in frame A, you need to calculate how fast B is moving relative to you. So in the lab frame, B is moving at 0.5c, and A is moving at 0.6c. So in A's frame, B's velocity is
