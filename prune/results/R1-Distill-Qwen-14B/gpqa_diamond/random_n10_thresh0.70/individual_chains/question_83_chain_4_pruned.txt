Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, and the Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on titration calculations, but I think I can work through it.

First, I need to find out what happens when the acetic acid is diluted. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Dilution affects the concentration, right?

Wait, the formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 would be M1*(V1/V2) = 0.05 * (20/40) = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, but wait a second. Or is it? Because when you dilute a solution, the number of moles remains the same, and the concentration decreases. So the initial moles of acetic acid are Molarity × Volume (in liters). Oh right, because volume units must be in liters for molarity.

So initial moles: 0.05 M * 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ of water, total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L), so concentration is moles / volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yes, that's correct. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M CH3COOH.

Now, the titration is with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Let me think about the two parts separately.

First, the equivalence point.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So moles of acetic acid initially is 0.001 moles (as calculated before). So at equivalence, we need 0.001 moles of NaOH.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume required would be moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

But wait, the question is about the pH at equivalence. So what's the solution
