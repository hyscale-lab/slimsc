Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Hmm, I remember RHIC collides heavy ions, like gold nuclei, but this question is about something else—Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So lithium-6 or something else? Let me think. Lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, the mass number is 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6. So that's lithium-6.

The question is about finding the energy of the RHIC when the speed of the nucleus X (which is lithium-6) is 0.96c. The options are given in GeV, so I need to calculate the relativistic energy.

Wait, relativistic energy. I remember the formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity. So gamma equals 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

The speed here is 0.96c. Let me plug that into the gamma formula. So v = 0.96c. Let me compute v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28, right? Because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714... Wait, let me calculate that accurately. 1/0.28 is 3.57142857... So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, I need the rest mass of the lithium nucleus. Lithium-6 has 3 protons, 3 neutrons. Each proton and neutron has a mass of approximately 1.007276 GeV/c² for protons and 1.008665 GeV/c² for neutrons. Wait, but wait—is that the rest mass energy? Yeah, because for each particle, m*c² is their rest mass energy.

Wait, wait, maybe I should look up the accurate mass of lithium-6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a mass of about 1 GeV/c².
