Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. Wait, so astronaut A is 2m mass moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is 3m moving at 0.5c. Both in the same direction.

First part is finding the relative speed between them. I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just subtract them normally because of the relativistic effects. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is a bit more involved. The formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). 

Wait, wait. Since they're moving in the same direction, v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c. So v1 - v2 is 0.1c. But I have to divide by (1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Let me compute that denominator. (v1 v2)/(c²) is (0.6c * 0.5c) / c² = (0.3 c²) / c² = 0.3. So the denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. 

So v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c. Hmm, approximately 0.14c. Let's keep that in mind.

Now the second part is the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has their own relativistic energy, which is gamma times their rest mass energy. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for astronaut A (2m moving at 0.6c): 

Gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy of A is gamma_A * m_A * c² = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait no, wait. Wait, the mass given is 2m, so m_A is 2m. So yeah, so 1.25 * 2m c² is 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B (3m moving at 0.5c):

Gamma_B = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2/c²) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So energy of B is gamma_B * m_B * c² = 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.4641 m c².

Adding both energies: 2.5 + 3.4641 ≈ 5.9641 m c². That's approximately 5.96 m c².

Wait, but the options have E as 5.96 mc² (option C) and another option D has 5 mc². So which is it?

Looking at the options:

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc^2.

Option B: v_rel=0.1c, E=4.96 mc^2.

Wait, but in my calculation for relative speed, I got approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So option C's relative speed matches that, and its energy is about 5.96 mc². That seems to fit.

Wait, but wait, let me recheck the calculation for the relative speed. Did I do that correctly? Because sometimes, when I'm getting relative speed, I might have mixed up the order.

Wait, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). So v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So yes, 0.1c divided by 0.7 is about 0.1428c. So that part is correct.

And for the energies: astronaut A is 2m at 0.6c, so gamma is 1.25, so 2m * 1.25 = 2.5 m. Astronaut B is 3m at 0.5c, gamma is about 1.1547, so 3 * 1.1547 is approximately 3.464 m. Adding 2.5 + 3.464 gives about 5.964 m. So 5.96 mc². Yes, so that's option C.

So looking at the options:

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc^2. So that's correct.

Other options: Option B's relative speed is 0.1c, which is the difference without considering relativity. So that's incorrect for the relative speed part. Option D's energy is 5 mc², which is less than what I calculated. So no. Option A's speed is more than c, which is impossible, so that's out.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For Astronaut A (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_A = \gamma_A (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For Astronaut B (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_B = \gamma_B (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.4641m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.4641m c^2 \approx 5.9641m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A:** \(v_{\text{rel}} = 1.1c\), \(E = mc^2\). This is incorrect because the relative speed cannot exceed \(c\), and the total energy is underestimated.
- **Option B:** \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.1c\), \(E = 4.96m c^2\). This is incorrect because the relative speed is calculated as \(0.14c\), not \(0.1c\), and the total energy is underestimated.
- **Option C:** \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\). This is correct as it matches both the relative speed and the total energy calculated.
- **Option D:** \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5m c^2\). This is incorrect because the total energy is underestimated.

### Final Answer
The correct option is:

**Answer: C**
