Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm. Let's try to break it down. I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, specifically bosons, and they can decay into other particles. The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X.

The given data is: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are all in meters, so I need to calculate the mean decay length and see which option matches.

Wait, mean decay distance... I think that's related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the mean decay length L is given by c multiplied by the lifetime τ, and then multiplied by the velocity β, so L = βγcτ. But wait, actually, I think another formula might be more direct here. Maybe using the uncertainty principle or something related to the particle's lifetime and energy.

Alternatively, I remember that the mean proper lifetime τ (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame) is related to the width Γ. The relation is τ = ħ / Γ. Oh wait, but Γ is the decay width, which is related to the lifetime. Since Γ is the total decay rate, Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But I have to be careful with the units here.

Wait, units are going to be a bit tricky. Let me jot down the constants:

ħ (h-bar) is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because ħ = h/(2π), and h is Planck's constant. That's a useful value because our energies are in GeV, so converting to seconds would make sense.

So, first, compute τ. Since Γ is given in MeV, I should convert that to GeV to match the units. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = let's calculate that. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait. Let me compute that more accurately. 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 seconds,
