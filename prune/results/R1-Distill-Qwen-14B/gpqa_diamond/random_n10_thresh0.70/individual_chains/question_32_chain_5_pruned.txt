Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a specific nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down.

The nucleus in question is called X, and it's defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So lithium typically has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Lithium-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

Now, I need to find the energy when the speed is 0.96c. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore because that's non-relativistic. At speeds close to the speed of light, we have to use the relativistic formulas.

The formula for relativistic energy is E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor. Oh right, γ equals 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus (v²/c²)). So I need to calculate γ first.

Let me plug in v = 0.96c into that. So v squared over c squared is (0.96c)^2 / c² which simplifies to (0.96)^2. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 minus 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... hmm, let's see. The square of 0.28 is 0.0784, so sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So γ is 1/0.28.

Wait, 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Maybe more accurately, 1/0.28 is exactly 3.57142857... So γ ≈ 3.5714.

Now, the mass m here is the rest mass of the Lithium-6 nucleus. I think the mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c². So for A=6, the mass would be 6 * 938 MeV/c². Let me calculate that.

6 * 938 =
