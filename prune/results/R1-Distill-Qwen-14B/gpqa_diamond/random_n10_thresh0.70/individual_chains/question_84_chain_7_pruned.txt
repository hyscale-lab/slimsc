Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about solving higher dimensional heat equations using finite difference approximations and parallel splitting. The question is about the key factor that converts a sequential algorithm into a parallel one, specifically when using matrix exponential functions approximated by fractional methods.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. The question mentions higher order finite differences and parallel splitting, which I remember is a way to make algorithms run faster by using multiple processors or threads. So, the key factor here must relate to how the algorithm's structure allows for parallel execution.

The options are A to D. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Stability analysis. I recall that stability is crucial in numerical methods to ensure the solutions don't blow up or become inaccurate. But stability analysis is more about whether the method works correctly over time, not so much about making it parallel. So maybe this isn't the right choice.

Option B: Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions. Nonlocal boundary conditions are tricky. They involve conditions that depend on values other than the boundaries, maybe like integral conditions. But how does that relate to parallelism? I'm not sure. It might affect the structure of the problem, but I don't see the direct link to parallel algorithms.

Option C: Complex roots of fractional approximation. Fractional approximation methods, like those using Pad√© approximants or similar, can have complex roots. Wait, complex roots imply oscillatory behavior, maybe. But how does that help in parallel splitting? Maybe if the approximation leads to a system that can be decomposed into parts that can be solved simultaneously, having complex roots could allow for that. Or perhaps the presence of complex roots allows for certain mathematical transformations that enable parallelism.

Option D: Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation. Partial fraction decomposition is a technique used to break down complex fractions into simpler parts. In the context of matrix exponentials, if you can decompose the matrix into parts that commute, you can compute their exponentials separately and then combine them. That sounds like it would help in parallel processing because each part could be handled by a different processor. So linear partial fractions might be the key here.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So the question is about converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one. How does each option contribute to that?

Stability (A) is about correctness, not parallelism. Nonlocal BCs (B) are about the problem setup but not directly about algorithm parallelism. 

C and D are more about the mathematical structure of the approximation. If the fractional approximation has complex roots, it might require certain techniques, but the main idea for parallelism is about decomposing the problem into parts that can be computed in parallel. 

Linear partial fractions (D) would allow you to split the matrix exponential into terms that can be exponentiated separately, which would be necessary for parallel processing. For example, if the matrix can be written as a sum of matrices that commute, their exponentials can be computed independently and then multiplied together. So the ability to do this decomposition would enable the parallel algorithm.

So option D seems more about the decomposition method that allows parallelism. Option C, about complex roots, might influence the nature of the approximation but I'm not sure it's the key factor for parallelism.

Another angle: when approximating the matrix exponential, certain methods allow for splitting the exponential into a sum of exponentials of simpler matrices
