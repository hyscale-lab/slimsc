Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

So the setup is that there's a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere of this star is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. So the spots are at 5000 K.

The question is about photometric observations. Because the star is rotating, the spots come into and out of view, causing variations in brightness. But the interesting part is that this situation can mimic the presence of an exoplanet. So the problem is asking: if the star wasn't spotted, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve? So we're comparing the brightness dip caused by a planet blocking the star's light to the dip caused by the spots.

Hmm, the key here is to calculate the relative change in brightness in both cases and set them equal, then solve for the planet's radius relative to the star's radius.

First, I need to compute the brightness variation caused by the spots. Since the spots are cooler, when they are on the visible hemisphere, the total brightness of the star observed will decrease compared to when they're not visible.

The star emits flux from its entire surface, and when part of it is covered by spots, the total flux decreases. The change in flux depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference relative to the rest of the star.

Wait, the flux from a part of the star's surface is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: flux = sigma * T^4, where sigma is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So the total flux from the star is the sum of the flux from the normal areas and the spots.

But wait, the star is being observed as it rotates. When the spots are on the side facing us, the star's apparent brightness decreases. The variation in brightness (delta F) would be the difference between the flux when the spots are visible and when they're not.

Alternatively, the amplitude of the variation is the difference between the maximum and minimum flux. Wait, but the star's spots are on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view, then go out of view. So the brightness variation is due to
