Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I've studied a bit about spin states and operators, but I'm a bit rusty, so I'll take it slow.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, meaning they're the standard basis states for spin-½ particles. I remember that in such cases, the spin matrices for the z-component are diagonal, with eigenvalues ±ħ/2.

Wait, but the question is about another operator whose matrix representation, Aij, is given. The matrix elements are A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that can't be right. Because for a 2x2 matrix, i and j go from 1 to 2. So if i≠j, then A12 and A21 are ħ/2, and the diagonals are zero. So the matrix would look like:
[ [0, ħ/2],
  [ħ/2, 0] ]
Is that the case? So this operator A is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 off-diagonal. That's a symmetric matrix, so it's Hermitian, which makes sense because observables are represented by Hermitian operators.

So the operator A acts on the spin states, and the question is to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of A. Also, find the average value of A.

First, I think I need to find the eigenstates of operator A because the measurement probabilities depend on how the state |alpha> is expressed in terms of these eigenstates.

Alternatively, since the operator A is given, perhaps it's easier to diagonalize it and find its eigenstates, then express |alpha> in that basis.

Let me start by finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A.

The matrix A is:

0   ħ/2
ħ/2 0

I can write this as ħ/2 times the Pauli X matrix, because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A = (ħ/2) σ_x.

Wait, right, because σ_x has elements 0,1,1,0. So A is (ħ/2) σ_x. So the eigenvalues of σ_x are ±1, so the eigenvalues of A would be (ħ/2)(±1), so ±ħ/2.

Wait, but that's the same as the eigenvalues of the spin-z operator, which is S_z. Hmm, but the operator here is A, which is σ_x scaled by ħ/2. So its eigenstates are the eigenstates of σ_x, which are the |+x> and |-x> states.

So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, where |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Because σ_x has eigenvalues ±1, so the eigenstates of A are these states.

So the measurement probabilities for A's eigenstates will be the squared magnitudes of the components of |alpha> in the |+
