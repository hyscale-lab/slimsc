Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully and think through it step by step.

The question is about identifying a final product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to figure out what Compound X is first based on the given IR and NMR data, and then determine the reaction outcome.

Let me start by looking at the spectral data provided.

First, the IR data: peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which probably indicates an O-H stretch, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. The peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be from a carboxylic acid, ester, ketone, or aldehyde. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be aromatic C=C stretching vibrations. So, Compound X likely has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group, possibly with an O-H group.

Now the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which is typical for an O-H proton, like in a carboxylic acid. So, this suggests a carboxylic acid group.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are two doublets that are likely from para-substituted aromatic protons. The upfield shift (7.2 ppm) might suggest electron-donating groups, while the downfield (8.0 ppm) could be ortho to an electron-withdrawing group. Wait, but if it's a para-substituted benzene, perhaps with two substituents? Or maybe a single substituent leading to a para pattern. Alternatively, maybe two substituents in para positions, one of which is a carbonyl group.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This is a multiplet, probably from a methylene or methine group adjacent to something electronegative, maybe next to a carbonyl. Or perhaps part of an isopropyl group.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, maybe more CH2 groups.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet, which is typical for a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH that's nearby, like in an isopropyl group.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, likely a terminal methyl group, as in CH2CH2CH3. So perhaps an ethyl group attached somewhere.

Putting this together: The aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene. The two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm suggest that there are two groups on the benzene ring in para positions. One possibility is a substituent with an electron-withdrawing group (like a carbonyl) and another with an electron-donating group, but that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, maybe there's a single substituent that creates two doublets, but that's usually in o- or m- substitution. Wait, for para substitution, the protons on the ring would typically give two doublets if there's a substituent in the para position, but that's if the substituent is such that the ring has symmetry. Wait, perhaps it's a substituent like a carbonyl (like a benzene ring with a COOH group). So, the benzene ring would have two substituents in the para positions, but wait, the ring has the substituents in para, but in the NMR, each set of two protons are in doublets. So for example, if the ring has a substituent in the para position, and another substituent, maybe a methyl group or something else, but that might complicate it. Alternatively, maybe it's a single substituent causing the coupling.

Wait, perhaps the ring is para-substituted with another group. For example, if the benzene has a carbonyl group, like a ketone or a carboxylic acid. Wait, the IR has a 1720 cm-1 peak, which could be a carbonyl. Let's see. The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad O-H, which is likely a carboxylic acid. So, the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

So, putting that together: the benzene ring has a substituent in the para position with a carboxylic acid group. Wait, but the NMR shows two doublets, each integrating to two protons. That suggests that the substituent is such that the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. For example, if the substituent is itself a group that's symmetrical. Wait, like if the substituent is a carbonyl group, but that's not enough. Let's think: if the substituent is something like a -COOH, then the ring would have three substituents? No, wait, perhaps the substituent is a group that's attached to the benzene and has its own structure.

Wait, let me think again. The aromatic protons are at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). So, each set of two protons is a doublet. In a para-substituted benzene with a single substituent, you would have two sets of equivalent protons. For example, if the substituent is a methyl group, but that's usually around 7 ppm, but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, like a nitro group, which would cause the adjacent protons to be downfield. Alternatively, if the substituent is a carbonyl group (like a COOH group), then the ring would have substituents that cause the ring protons to be in two doublets.

Wait, let me think of the structure. Suppose the benzene ring has a substituent that is a carbonyl group, say a benzoic acid. Then, the aromatic protons would be in two doublets. For example, the ring would have two sets of protons, ortho and para to the COOH group. Wait, no, in benzoic acid, the ring protons are typically a set of two doublets (like the ortho and para positions), but the substituent is only on one position. So, benzoic acid has a single substituent (the COOH group) in the para position relative to where? Wait, no, the COOH is attached to the benzene ring in the ortho, meta, or para position relative to other substituents. Wait, in this case, perhaps the benzene has two substituents: one is a COOH group and another is an alkyl chain in the para position.

Wait, looking at the NMR data, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. Let's consider the possibility of a para-substituted benzene with two groups: one is a COOH and the other is an isopropyl or ethyl group. Wait, but looking at the other NMR peaks, there's a 1.4 ppm doublet of 3H, which is likely a methyl group attached to a CH. That would fit an isopropyl group, perhaps.

So, if the benzene has a COOH group at one position and an isopropyl group at the para position, then the aromatic protons would be adjacent to these substituents.

Wait, let me think: the para-substituted benzene would have the substituents opposite each other. So, the substituents are in positions 1 and 3 if the ring is numbered in a certain way, but perhaps that's getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a para-substituted benzene with a COOH group and another group, say an isobutyl group, but that might not fit the NMR. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached in a certain way.

Wait, another thought: the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, in a structure like RCH2COOH, but that doesn't fit the aromatic data.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group and an ethyl group. For example, something like CH2CH2COOH attached to the benzene. But that's not matching the NMR data for the coupling.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propionyl group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a chain with a carbonyl group, such as a benzene with a propyl group attached, leading to the NMR signals.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ethyl propenoate, but that might complicate things.

Wait, let me consider the presence of a CH2CH(CH3) group. The 1.4 ppm doublet of 3H suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, which is in turn attached to another CH2 or similar.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a side chain like CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH, but that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a side chain that includes an isobutyl group.

Wait, let me think about the substituent. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a methine (CH) group. Then, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be CH2 groups. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl attached to a CH. So, putting that together: the substituent could be a CH2CH(CH3) group.

So, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3) group attached to the benzene. But then, where is the carbonyl?

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl. So, perhaps the substituent is a -CO-R group, where R is an alkyl chain.

Wait, the NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which is an O-H (from a carboxylic acid), so the structure must have a COOH group.

So, the structure is a benzene ring with a COOH group and another substituent. Let me consider the substituent.

In the NMR, the 1H data beyond the aromatic region shows:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): perhaps a CH adjacent to a carbonyl.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): two CH2 groups?
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl attached to a CH.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal methyl, so maybe a CH2CH2CH3 group.

So, putting it all together, perhaps the substituent is a chain like -CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3, but that seems a bit long.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a isobutyl group attached to the benzene, and then the COOH is in the para position. But wait, the substituent on the benzene would be a single group. Alternatively, the substituent is a propyl group with a branching.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)2CH(CH3) group.

Wait, let me map this out.

If the substituent is a propyl group where the middle CH is attached to a benzene, and the CH has a methyl group (like an isopropyl group), then the structure would be:

Benzene ring with a substituent like -CH2CH(CH3)-.

Wait, but where's the carbonyl? Oh, right! The IR suggests a carbonyl, so perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)2COOH group? Or maybe a -(CH2)COOH group.

Wait, let me think. The structure of Compound X would have a benzene ring, a COOH group, and another substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a side chain leading to the COOH.

Wait, another approach: the IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl. The broad peak at 10.5 ppm is an O-H, so it's probably a carboxylic acid. So, the structure has a -COOH group.

Now, considering the NMR:

The aromatic protons are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests that the substituent is such that the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. So, perhaps the substituent is at the para position, and the ring is symmetric. For example, if the substituent is both a COOH and another group in para positions, but that would complicate the structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group, but let me check. For example, if the substituent is a phenyl group attached to a carbonyl, but that would be a ketone, but that doesn't account for the O-H.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a benzyl group leading to a carbonyl, but that seems less likely.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a substituted benzoic acid. Let me think of 4-ethylbenzoic acid. Then, the aromatic protons would be at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH) and positions 3 and 5 (meta to COOH?), but wait, for benzoic acid, the ring protons are typically a triplet of doublets, but maybe not exactly. Alternatively, if it's 4-ethylbenzoic acid, the ethyl group would cause the ring protons to couple in a certain way.

Wait, but in the given NMR, the aromatic protons are two doublets each with 2H. Let me imagine the structure: if the substituent is a COOH group in the para position relative to another substituent, which is an isopropyl group or ethyl group.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is typical for a terminal methyl group (CH2CH2CH3). So, perhaps the substituent is an ethyl group, but connected in a way that gives a branching.

Wait, let me look at the possible options. The options are A, B, C, D.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Structure would be a phenyl group (4-ethylphenyl) attached to a CH2CH2COOH. So, the substituent on the benzene is a propionoic acid group. Let me see: the aromatic protons would be on the benzene ring, possibly at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. The substituent would be at position 2, but wait, the name is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid, so the propionoic acid is attached to the benzene at position 2. Then, the benzene would have an ethyl group at position 4 relative to the point of attachment. So, the substituents on the benzene would be at positions 2 (the propionoic acid) and 4 (ethyl). Wait, but that would make the substituents in the para positions relative to each other, which could cause the aromatic protons to split into two doublets.

Option C:4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. This would have a benzoic acid group and a sec-butyl group in the para position. So, the substituents are at positions 1 and 4. The benzoic acid is at position 1, and the sec-butyl at position 4. Wait, but in that case, the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the substituents are in the para positions, so the aromatic protons would be in two sets of doublets.

Wait, the NMR data has aromatic protons at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, each as a doublet of 2H. So, that suggests that each set of two protons is equivalent. So, perhaps the substituent is such that the ring has two substituents in the para positions, but that's only possible if there are two substituents. However, in the case of benzoic acid derivatives, you typically have only one substituent (the COOH group) unless another group is present.

Looking at the options, let's see.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the structure would be a benzene ring with COOH at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4. So, the substituents are para to each other. The aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. But wait, in such a structure, the protons ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6), and meta to COOH (positions 3 and 5) would have specific shifts. The sec-butyl group would be in position 4, which is para to COOH.

So, the ring protons would be:

- Positions 2 and 6: ortho to COOH. These are typically more deshielded (downfield) due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the COOH group. So, perhaps they appear around 8.0 ppm as a doublet each.

- Positions 3 and 5: meta to COOH. These would be less deshielded, so maybe around 7.2 ppm.

So, the NMR would show two doublets: one for positions 2 and 6 (each as a doublet) and another for positions 3 and 5 (each as a doublet). But wait, in reality, positions 2 and 6 are equivalent due to the substituent in position 1 (COOH), so their protons would be equivalent, and similarly for positions 3 and 5.

Wait, but in the NMR, each set is 2H. So, perhaps each doublet corresponds to a pair of equivalent protons.

So, for option C, the aromatic protons would be:

- Ortho to COOH: positions 2 and 6. Each has one proton. But since the COOH is in position 1, the ring would have symmetry, so positions 2 and 6 are equivalent. So their signals would merge into a single peak, perhaps as a doublet, with 2H integrating.

Similarly, the meta positions (3 and 5) would each have a proton, which would be equivalent, giving another doublet at a higher shift.

Wait, but in that case, the downfield shift (8.0 ppm) would be for the ortho protons, and the upfield (7.2 ppm) for the meta. That matches the NMR data.

So, the aromatic region seems to fit option C.

Now, looking at the other parts of the NMR.

The 1H NMR shows:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): probably the CH group in the sec-butyl substituent.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): the CH2 groups adjacent to the CH.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): the methyl group attached to the CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): the terminal methyl group of the ethyl chain.

Wait, the substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group. The structure would be -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group: the benzene is attached to a CH, which is attached to a CH2 and a CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, no. The sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Let me clarify: the substituent is -(CH2)CHCH2CH3? No, no, the structure of a sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3), but wait, more accurately, it's -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2? No, wait. The sec-butyl group is CH2CH2CH2CH3, but with the branch on the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but that would be a tertiary butyl group. Wait, no: the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but that's not correct because the butyl chain has four carbons.

Wait, no. The correct structure for a sec-butyl group is CH2CH2CH(CH3), but I might be getting confused. Let me think: the butyl group is -CH2CH2CH2CH3. The substituent could be in the secondary position, so the structure would be CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, perhaps it's CH2CH2CH(CH3)2? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, a sec-butyl group is a four-carbon chain where the point of attachment is on the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait: the correct structure is CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's a straight chain. For a sec-butyl, the branch is on the second carbon: it's CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, that would have three carbons beyond the point of attachment. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group where the branching occurs on the second carbon. So, the substituent would be CH(CH2CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene.

Wait, but in any case, the substituent would have a CH group attached to the benzene, which is connected to another CH2 and a CH2CH3.

So, looking at the NMR:

- The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): the CH group in the substituent.

- The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): the two CH2 groups adjacent to the CH.

Wait, no—the substituent would have a structure like CH2CH(CH2CH3). So, the CH2 next to the benzene is the first CH2, then the CH, then the CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group attached to the benzene.

So, the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3), making the group a sec-butyl group, which is a four-carbon group with branching on the second carbon.

In that case, the NMR would show:

- The CH group (the one attached to the benzene) as a multiplet around 2.9 ppm (1H).

- The CH2 group adjacent to the CH would show up as a triplet or multiplet around 1.7 ppm (2H).

- The CH2CH3 group would show as a triplet around 0.9 ppm (3H).

Wait, but in the NMR, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which is a methyl group attached to a CH. So, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH3? No, that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a isopropyl group. So, the structure would be -CH(CH3)2 attached to the benzene. But then, the NMR would show a singlet for the methyl groups, but in the given data, it's a doublet.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3) group. So, the substituent would be a propyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon.

In that case, the NMR would show:

- The CH (at 2.9 ppm, m, 1H), which is attached to the benzene.

- The adjacent CH2 group (at 1.7 ppm, m, 2H).

- The CH(CH3) group would have a methyl at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H).

- The terminal CH2CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

So, putting that together, the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3) group attached to the benzene. But wait, that would make the substituent a iso-propyl group, but in that case, the substituent would be a iso-propyl group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propanoyl group, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene at position 4, with the COOH at position 1. So, the substituent is in the para position relative to the COOH.

In that structure, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is a four-carbon chain with a branch on the second carbon. So, the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH2CH3).

Looking at the NMR, the substituent's CH (attached to the benzene) would be around 2.9 ppm (m,1H). The adjacent CH2 would be around 1.7 ppm (m,2H). Then, the CH2CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm (t,3H). The methyl group attached to the CH would be at 1.4 ppm (d,3H), which matches the NMR data.

So, this seems to fit.

So, the structure of Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Now, the reaction: Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. What does that reaction do?

Red phosphorus and HI (or HCl) are typically used in the HWE (Hoffmann-Williamson) reaction, but wait, no. Alternatively, red phosphorus is used in the preparation of acid chlorides from carboxylic acids. Wait, when a carboxylic acid reacts with SOCl2, it forms an acid chloride, but red phosphorus is used in another way. Wait, perhaps it's for the conversion of carboxylic acids to acyl chlorides, but that's typically done with SOCl2 or POCl3.

Wait, another reaction: when a carboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it forms an acyl iodide. For example, RCOOH + P + HI → RCOI + PHO and other byproducts. So, the reaction converts the carboxylic acid to an acyl iodide.

So, the product would be benzoyl iodide if the starting acid is benzoic acid. But in our case, the starting acid is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, so the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl iodide.

Wait, but looking at the options, they don't have an acyl iodide. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, the options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, so the options are either benzoic acids or substituted toluenes. So, if the reaction of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid with red phosphorus and HI is to form the acyl iodide, but that's not among the options. So perhaps I've made a mistake in identifying the reaction.

Wait, let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a hydrolysis or something else. Wait, but red phosphorus and HI are more likely involved in converting the acid to an acyl iodide. Another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that requires an acylium ion, which is formed under certain conditions. But I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the structure of Compound X. Let me reevaluate the NMR.

Wait, the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is a CH2CH2CH3. So, perhaps the substituent is an ethyl group. Let me think about option B and D, which are aromatic compounds with substituents, but without a COOH group.

Wait, but the IR shows a broad O-H, which suggests a COOH group. So, options B and D don't have COOH groups. So, the correct structure must be either A or C.

Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So, the structure would be a benzene ring with an ethyl group at position 4 and a propanoic acid group at position 2. Then, the aromatic protons would be in positions 3,4,5,6. But wait, the substituents are at 2 (propanoic acid) and 4 (ethyl). So, the substituents are in the para positions relative to each other. Then, the aromatic protons would be in positions 3,5,6, etc. Hmm, but let me think about the NMR.

The aromatic protons in this case would have certain shifts. The ethyl group at position 4 would be electron-donating, so the ortho protons to it would be upfield. The propanoic acid group at position 2 would have its own effect. Perhaps the aromatic protons are split into two doublets as observed.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a ethyl group in the para position, leading the aromatic protons to be in two doublets.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the reaction again. If Compound X is a benzoic acid (option C), and it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it would form the acyl iodide. But none of the options match that. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the structure of Compound X.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't converting the acid group but something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution. Wait, red phosphorus and HI can also be used in the hydroxy group substitution. Wait, if the compound is an alcohol, the reaction could be converting it to an iodide. But in this case, the IR shows a strong O-H (carboxylic acid) and a carbonyl, so it's more likely a carboxylic acid.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration. Red phosphorus can be used as a reducing agent. Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be the conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acid chloride, but with red phosphorus and HI. I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. But the starting material is a benzoic acid, which might not have a good leaving group unless activated.

Wait, maybe I should reconsider the structure of Compound X. Let's think again about the NMR.

The aromatic protons are at 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). If the substituent is a COOH group and another group at the para position, that could split the aromatic protons into two doublets. So, for example, if the substituent is a COOH group and a methyl group in the para position, the aromatic protons would be ortho and meta to each group.

Wait, but the substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group, not a methyl. So, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group and a COOH in the para position.

But in that case, the aromatic protons would be ortho and meta to the COOH, leading to two doublets.

So, let's go back to the reaction. If Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), reacting with red phosphorus and HI would likely convert the COOH group into an acid chloride or an acyl iodide. But the options don't include an acyl iodide. So perhaps the correct answer isn't option C.

Another possibility: maybe the reaction is a substitution of the -OH group in the COOH. But in that case, the product would have an iodide instead of an OH, but that's not among the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the reaction. Red phosphorus and HI can also be used in the preparation of aryl iodides via the Ullmann reaction, but that usually requires a catalyst like copper. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution, but that would require a good leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound isn't a carboxylic acid. Let me re-examine the IR data. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which could also be an ester or ketone. If it's an ester, then the O-H peak at 10.5 ppm would be from an alcohol or something else. But the NMR shows a broad peak, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid O-H.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a phenyl ester. For example, something like phenyl acetate. But the NMR would show different patterns.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options, the correct answer must be among them. Let's analyze each option's structure and see what reaction would occur.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the COOH group into an acyl iodide. But none of the options match that. So perhaps the reaction is something else.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a dehydration to form an acid anhydride, but that doesn't fit the reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -OH group is replaced by an iodide. So, the COOH would become COI. But again, the options don't show that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution on the benzene ring. But that's more typical with a leaving group attached to the ring, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a reduction. Red phosphorus can act as a reducing agent, but in the presence of HI, perhaps it's a Clemmensen reduction, but that reduces aldehydes and ketones to alkanes. But the starting material doesn't have an aldehyde or ketone; it's a carboxylic acid.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try a different angle.

Looking at the options, which ones have a COOH group? Only options A and C.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

Structure: benzene ring with ethyl group at position 4 and propanoic acid at position 2. So, the aromatic protons would be in positions 3,5,6, etc. The NMR shows two doublets, each integrating to 2H. Would this structure fit?

If the substituents are at positions 2 and 4, the aromatic protons would be in positions 3,5,6, and perhaps position 6 would have another substituent.

Wait, perhaps I should draw this structure. The benzene ring has substituents at positions 2 and 4. The substituent at 2 is a propanoic acid (CH2CH2COOH), and at 4 is an ethyl group (CH2CH3).

In such a structure, the aromatic protons would be in positions 3,5,6. Wait, but position 6 would be adjacent to the substituent at position 2, which is a propanoic acid. So, the protons in positions 3 and 5 would be equivalent, and those in positions 6 and perhaps another would be another set.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are at position 2 and 4, leading to the aromatic protons being in two doublets.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps option C is the correct starting material, and the reaction produces an acyl iodide, which then undergoes some reaction to form another product. But I don't see that in the options.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic acyl substitution. If the starting material is a carboxylic acid, and with HI, it could form an acyl iodide as an intermediate. But again, the options don't show that.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the structure of Compound X. Let me reevaluate the NMR data.

The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet (1H), which is likely the O-H of a carboxylic acid.

The IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl. So, the compound has a COOH group and a carbonyl, but a COOH group already has a carbonyl. So, this is consistent.

The NMR shows an aromatic region with two doublets. So, perhaps the substituent is a COOH group and another substituent in the para position.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group in the para position. So, the structure would be 4-methylbenzoic acid. But that doesn't account for the substituent's branching in the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, but then the NMR would show more signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an isopropyl group, which would have a CH group in the NMR. But the substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider the possibility that the reaction is the formation of an acyl iodide, and the product isn't among the options. But that can't be the case because the options must include the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't about the COOH group but about something else. Let me think: the reaction of red phosphorus and HI is also used in the preparation of iodoarenes from phenols. But in this case, the starting material has a COOH group, not a phenol. Unless the COOH is converted into a phenol, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride, followed by some other reaction. But again, that's not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution of the hydroxyl group in the COOH. But in that case, the product would have an iodine atom replacing the OH. But that's not among the options. The options have substituents on the benzene ring but not on the COOH group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I can't think of any that applies here.

Perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again about the reaction. Red phosphorus and HI are often used to substitute -OH groups with iodine. For example, in the preparation of aryl iodides from phenols. But in this case, the starting material is a benzoic acid, which is more acidic than phenols. So, perhaps the reaction is substituting the -COOH group.

Wait, but how? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is simply removing the -OH group and introducing an iodide elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution on an activated position. For example, if the benzene ring has a good leaving group, but in this case, the substituents are a COOH group and a sec-butyl group, which aren't good leaving groups.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not related to the functional groups but to the side chain. For example, if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, the reaction might break it down, but that's unlikely with these reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Grignard-like addition, but I don't see how that applies here.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That would be a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl and methyl groups in the para positions. The NMR would show signals for the substituents, but no O-H or carbonyl signals. So, it doesn't fit the IR data.

Option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. Again, no carbonyl or O-H, so it doesn't fit.

Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So, the structure would have a benzene ring with an ethyl group in the para position relative to the point of attachment of the propanoic acid group. The aromatic protons would be in positions that cause the two doublets in the NMR.

In that structure, the aromatic protons would be in positions that are ortho to the ethyl group and meta to the propanoic acid, possibly leading to the observed NMR signals.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, and the reaction forms an acyl iodide, but the options don't reflect that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the reaction.

Wait, another thought: the reaction of a benzoic acid with red phosphorus and HI might be a substitution where the hydroxyl group is replaced by iodide. But the product would be benzoyl iodide, which isn't listed.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid chloride, but again, not listed.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction converts the COOH group into a methyl group. But that doesn't make sense with the reagents.

Hmm. I'm not making progress here. Perhaps I should consider that the reaction is a substitution of the -OH group in the COOH, leading to an iodide, but the product isn't listed. So, perhaps the correct starting material is option C, and the reaction doesn't change the substituents on the ring but affects the COOH group, which isn't reflected in the options. But that can't be right because the options must include the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration, converting the COOH into a methyl group. But that would require a lot of energy and probably isn't feasible with these reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction, converting the COOH into a CH2OH group. But I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution on the benzene ring. If the ring has a good leaving group, but in this case, it's a COOH group and a sec-butyl group, which aren't good leaving groups. So, that's unlikely.

I'm really stuck. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the reaction doesn't involve the COOH group but instead the substituent on the ring. For example, if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, the reaction could be removing a hydrogen from the side chain to form a double bond, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is simply the removal of the COOH group, but I don't see how that would happen with red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be converting the COOH group into an acid bromide or iodide, but again, the product isn't among the options.

At this point, I think I need to make an educated guess. Based on the NMR and IR data, the most likely structure for Compound X is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Reacting this with red phosphorus and HI would form the corresponding acyl iodide, but since that's not an option, perhaps the reaction is something else. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the reaction mechanism.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't about the COOH group but about the substituent on the ring. If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, and the reaction is cleaving it, but I don't see how that would apply.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a hydrogen on the substituent is replaced by iodine. For example, the sec-butyl group could lose a hydrogen to form an iodide. But that's speculative and I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a deprotonation and iodide substitution on the side chain. For example, the CH group in the substituent could be deprotonated and then substituted by iodide. But that would produce a -CHI group, which isn't part of any option.

Hmm. I'm really not sure. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a best guess. Based on the NMR and IR data, the structure is most likely option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI would form the acyl iodide, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option C? But that can't be right because the question is about the final product, which is among the options.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is converted into a CH2 group. But that's not feasible with these reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction, converting the COOH group into a CH2OH group, but that would require different reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the -OH of the COOH is replaced by iodide, making the product 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid iodide. But that's not an option.

Given all that, perhaps the reaction doesn't involve the COOH group, and the substituent side chain is affected. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydration of the substituent, but that's unclear.

I think I'll have to conclude that the correct structure is option C and the reaction forms the acyl iodide, which isn't listed, but perhaps the question intended the reaction to form the acyl iodide and the answer isn't listed. But since the options are given, I must choose among them.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't about the COOH group but about a different functional group. Wait, looking back, the IR shows a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are indicative of aromatic C=C stretching. So, the ring is likely intact.

Given that, perhaps the reaction is a substitution on the benzene ring. For example, if there's a substituent with a good leaving group, but in our case, the substituents are a COOH and a sec-butyl group, which aren't good leaving groups.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that requires a Lewis acid catalyst like AlCl3, and the reagents here are red phosphorus and HI, which don't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the initial analysis, the structure is option C. So, the reaction converts the COOH into an acyl iodide, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option C, meaning no reaction occurs, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is a dehydration of the substituent, converting it into an alkene. For example, the sec-butyl group could lose a water molecule to form a double bond. But that would require a different setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -OH group is replaced by an iodide, making the substituent an iodide. But again, that's not reflected in the options.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution on the substituent. For example, the CH group in the substituent could be replaced by iodide, but that's speculative.

At this point, I think I'll have to go with option C as the structure of Compound X, and perhaps the reaction doesn't change the substituents on the ring but affects the COOH group, leading to a product not listed. But since the options must include the correct answer, perhaps I've made a mistake in the reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the COOH group to a CH2OH group, but with red phosphorus and HI, I'm not sure that's feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation, forming an alkane. But again, that's not among the options.

Given all this confusion, I'll have to make a choice. The structure of Compound X is option C, and the reaction converts the COOH into an iodide, but that's not an option. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option C, meaning no reaction occurs. But that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent isn't a sec-butyl group but a isopropyl group. Let me check the NMR again.

If the substituent were an isopropyl group, the NMR would show a singlet for the two methyl groups attached to the CH. But in the given data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which suggests a methyl group attached to a CH.

So, the substituent is more likely a sec-butyl group, making option C the correct structure. So, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would form the acyl iodide, but that's not an option. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option C, and the reaction doesn't change the structure, but that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the hydroxyl group is replaced by an iodide, making the product 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl iodide, but that's not listed.

In this case, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but I must choose from the given options. Therefore, I'll have to pick option C as the starting material, and perhaps the reaction doesn't change the structure, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the structure. Let me think again.

The 1H NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is a CH2CH2CH3 group. So, the substituent includes an ethyl group.

In option C, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which includes an ethyl chain.

So, perhaps the reaction is converting the ethyl group into an iodide. For example, the ethyl group could undergo substitution to become CH2CH2I. But that would require a good leaving group, which the ethyl group doesn't have.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of the ethyl group, but that's speculative.

At this point, I think I've spent enough time and have to make a decision. The structure of Compound X is option C, and the reaction forms the acyl iodide, but since that's not an option, I might have made a mistake in the reaction mechanism.

Perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the hydroxyl group is replaced by HI, leading to an iodide. But again, that's not among the options.

Given all that, I'll conclude that the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.


The question involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins by interpreting the given IR and NMR data to deduce the structure of Compound X.

### IR Analysis:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.
- **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretching vibrations, suggesting the presence of a benzene ring.

### NMR Analysis:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: Broad singlet, characteristic of an O-H proton in a carboxylic acid.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicative of a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: Multiplet, likely from a CH group.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: Multiplet, likely from CH₂ groups.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: Doublet, likely from a methyl group attached to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: Triplet, likely from a terminal methyl group (CH₂CH₂CH₃).

### Structural Interpretation:
The IR and NMR data suggest that Compound X is a benzoic acid derivative with a para-substituted benzene ring. The substituents include a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group. This matches **Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Reaction Analysis:
When Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is likely converted into an acyl iodide (-COI). However, none of the provided options correspond to an acyl iodide. The reaction does not appear to alter the substituents on the benzene ring or the side chain of the sec-butyl group. Thus, the reaction does not produce a product listed among the options.

### Conclusion:
Based on the spectral data and the reaction conditions, the most likely structure of Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid** (Option C). However, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI does not yield a product listed in the options. Despite this, the correct answer must be selected from the given choices, leading to the conclusion that **Option C** is the starting material, and the reaction does not produce a listed product.
