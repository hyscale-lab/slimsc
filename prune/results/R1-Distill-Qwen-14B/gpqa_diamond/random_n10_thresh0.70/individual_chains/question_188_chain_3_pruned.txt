Okay, so I've got this crystallography question here about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees each. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The options are A to D, but I'll have to calculate it properly.

Wait, rhombohedral crystals are a type of Bravais lattice, right? They have all sides equal and all angles equal too. So a rhombohedral unit cell is like a cube that's been skewed, but all edges a, b, c are the same length. Oh wait, in this case, the problem says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. I think in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter a. But wait, in a rhombohedral system, if it's a primitive cell, the basis might be more complicated. Or maybe in this case, since it's rhombohedral, the lattice parameter 'a' is 10 Angstroms because all atoms are at the corners? Or is the interatomic distance a different measure?

Wait, maybe I should recall the formula for interplanar distances. The general formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (h k cos γ + h l cos β + k l cos α)/(a²)

Wait, but that's for a general cubic system. Since in a rhombohedral system, all angles are the same, so alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees. So maybe I can plug in those angles into the formula.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. For a cubic system, the formula simplifies because all angles are 90 degrees. But for rhombohedral, the angles are 30 degrees, so the formula will be different.

Another thought: the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral crystal can be written in terms of the lattice parameter a and the Miller indices. The general formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl) * cosθ )

Wait, because in a rhombohedral system, the angles between the axes are all equal to θ, which is 30 degrees here. So cosθ would be cos(3
