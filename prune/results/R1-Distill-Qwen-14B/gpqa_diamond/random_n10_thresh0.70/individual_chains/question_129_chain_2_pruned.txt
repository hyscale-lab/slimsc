Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to break it down step by step. The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. Let's go through each step carefully.

First, let me read the problem again. So, compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B. Then, B is reduced with H2 and Pd catalyst to form C. C reacts with HNO2 to form D, and D upon elimination gives E. There are also some hints provided, so I should pay attention to those.

Looking at the hints: Hint a says that when compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on ylides, but I remember that they're used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction typically forms alkenes by reacting an aldehyde or ketone with a ylide. So, if A reacts with a ylide to form that cyclopentane structure, A must be a ketone or aldehyde because those are the typical substrates for Wittig reactions.

Wait, the product of the Wittig reaction is an alkene. The product given is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me visualize that structure. So, cyclopentane with substituents at positions 1,2, and 4. The substituent at position 4 is a propan-2-ylidene group, which I think is a propene group attached via the central carbon. So, something like CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 attached to the cyclopentane ring.

So, the Wittig would form an alkene. That means compound A must have been a ketone or aldehyde that, when reacted with the ylide, forms that structure. Let me think about the structure of A. The ylide would have a (propan-2-ylidene) group, so perhaps the ylide was formed from an alkyllithium or another source. Wait, no, ylides are typically formed from alkenes and phosphorous reagents, like triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide.

Wait, the ylide in the Wittig reaction is usually something like Ph3P=CH-R. So, when that reacts with a carbonyl (A being a ketone or aldehyde), it would form R-CH2-CH2-R' or similar.

Wait, no. The Wittig reaction forms an alkene. So, if the product is an alkene attached to the cyclopentane, then A must have been a ketone in the cyclopentane ring. Because the Wittig adds the ylide's R group as a new substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps compound A is a cyclic ketone. Let's imagine cyclopentanone. If I add a Wittig reagent that's, say, propan-2-ylidene (like CH2-C(CH3)=PPh3), then the reaction would form an alkene. So, the product would be cyclopentane with substituents.

Wait, the product given is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(pro
