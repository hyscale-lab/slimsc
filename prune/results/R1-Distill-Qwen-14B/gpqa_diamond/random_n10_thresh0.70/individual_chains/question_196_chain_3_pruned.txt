Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The problem states that it's a 1-dimensional system with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which I remember is F = -kx. They're asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass, considering relativistic effects since the options involve the speed of light c.

Wait, wait. In a regular, non-relativistic harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed can be found using energy conservation. The potential energy at maximum displacement (amplitude A) is converted into kinetic energy as the oscillator passes through the equilibrium point. So the formula would be (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA², which gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But that's the non-relativistic case. Looking at the options, option C is exactly that, so it's probably the non-relativistic solution. But the question here is relativistic, so I can't use that directly.

In relativity, things get more complicated because as objects move faster, their relativistic mass increases. The kinetic energy in relativity is given by (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I need to set the total energy (rest energy plus kinetic) equal to the potential energy at maximum amplitude.

Wait, let me think. The total mechanical energy in the harmonic oscillator is the sum of kinetic and potential. At maximum displacement, the potential is maximum and kinetic is zero. So in the relativistic case, the potential energy is still (1/2)kA², right? Or does relativistic physics change that? Hmm, I think Hooke's law is a classical concept, so maybe the potential is still (1/2)kx². So the total energy E is (1/2)kA².

At the equilibrium position (x=0), the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum. So the total energy E is equal to the relativistic kinetic energy at that point. So E = (γ - 1)mc². But wait, E is also (1/2)kA². So setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (γ - 1)mc².

Hmm, but γ is 1/sqrt(1 - (
