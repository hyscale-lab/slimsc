Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my parallax and distance relationships, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, parallax is related to distance. I remember that parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1/distance, but wait, no, actually, I think it's the other way around. Because the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So distance (d) is inversely proportional to parallax. So d = 1/plx. Or wait, is it more precise to say d (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by the parallax in arcseconds. Yeah, that's right: d = 1/plx.

So the number of stars (let's call it N) varies as 1/(plx)^5. Wait, the question says N is proportional to 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since d = 1/plx, then plx = 1/d. Let me substitute that into the equation.

Substituting plx with 1/d, the equation becomes N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's calculate that. (1/d)^5 is 1/(d^5), so 1 divided by that is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. 

But the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Wait, maybe the question is about the number of stars per unit distance. Like, the density or the number in a shell of thickness dr. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, if N is proportional to d^5, then how does N change as d increases? But wait, perhaps the question is about the differential number of stars with distance. Like, for each increment in distance, how does the number of stars change. Because right now, N is proportional to d^5, so as d increases, N increases as d^5.

Wait, but the options are about how N changes with r (distance). So if N is proportional to d^5, then d is increasing, and N increases more rapidly as d increases. But wait, the question is phrased as "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)"? Hmm, wait, perhaps the question is about the number per unit distance, or perhaps the density.

Wait, maybe I should re-express the relation in terms of distance d. So N ∝ (1/plx)^5. So plx = 1/d, so (1/plx) = d. So N ∝ d^5. So N increases with d^5. But if the question is about how the number changes with distance, meaning as you go further away, how does the number change. So for a small change in d, how does N change? That would be the derivative, dN/dr. Let's compute that.

If N = k * d^5, where k is a constant, then dN/dd = 5k d^4. So the number of stars increases with the fourth power of d. Wait, but the question is
