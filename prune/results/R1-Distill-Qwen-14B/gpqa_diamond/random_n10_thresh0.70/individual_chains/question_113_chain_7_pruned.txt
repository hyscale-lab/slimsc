Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me take it step by step.

First, the question says the compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's look at each piece of data.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum: There's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H groups. The broadness suggests it's not an aliphatic alcohol because those are usually less broad, but wait, maybe it's a carboxylic acid? Because carboxylic acids have strong, broad O-H stretches. Alternatively, maybe an ester? But esters typically have a sharp peak. Hmm, but wait, another possibility is an ether, but ethers don't have O-H. So, maybe it's a carbonyl group plus something else. Wait, the FTIR has peaks at 1700 and 1650. 

The 1700 peak is a strong one. That's a region for carbonyl groups (C=O). 1700 could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak might be another carbonyl or possibly an aromatic ring (like conjugated carbonyls or something else). Wait, 1650 could be an amide or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated groups. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Because the NMR mentions vinyl hydrogens, so the compound has a double bond.

So putting that together: FTIR shows a broad O-H, suggesting something like a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Wait, but wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H is very broad and strong, which fits. But then the 1700 would be the C=O from the acid. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester, but in that case, the O-H might not be as broad. Let me think. Also, the 1650 could be an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, like in an ester or a ketone with a conjugated double bond.

Wait, the NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl refers to CH2=CH groups, so the compound has a double bond. So maybe the structure has an ester group and a double bond, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. That would explain the 1700 and 1650 peaks. The 1700 would be the ester carbonyl, and the 1650 would be the conjugated double bond. Wait, but what's the exact region for conjugated carbonyls? I think carbonyl groups in conjugation with double bonds can absorb lower. For example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone might have a carbonyl around 1700, but the conjugated double bond's stretching (like the C=C) is around 1650. Oh wait, wait, no. The 1650 is a carbonyl? Or maybe it's a C=C stretch.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible functional groups. So the FTIR has 3000 (b
