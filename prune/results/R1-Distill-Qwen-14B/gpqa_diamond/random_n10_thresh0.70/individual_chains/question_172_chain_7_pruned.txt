Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar atmospheres, but let's try to think through this.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can probably use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, what's the Boltzmann distribution again? Oh right, it describes the population of particles in different energy states. The formula is n_i / n_j = exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k T) ), right? Where n_i and n_j are the number of particles in states i and j, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference is given as Î”E = 1.38e-23 J. Let's say that's E_2 - E_1, so the higher energy level is E_2. But I'm not sure if I got the order right, but I think the ratio depends on the difference.

Star_1 has twice as many excited atoms as star_2. So if n_2 is the number in the higher state for star_2, then for star_1, it's 2*n_2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So if E is the higher energy level, then n_2 (for star_1) is twice n_2 for star_2? Or perhaps it's the other way around.

Wait, maybe I should model this. Let's denote the lower energy level as state 1 and the higher as state 2. So for each star, the ratio of n_2 to n_1 would be governed by the Boltzmann factor.

But wait, the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms in the specific energy level (say, level 2) are twice as excited as in star_2. So n_2 (star_1) = 2 * n_2 (star_2). Or wait, no. Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps
