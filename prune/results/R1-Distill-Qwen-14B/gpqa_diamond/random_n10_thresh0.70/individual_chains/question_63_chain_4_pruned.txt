Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules can be modeled using the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator approximations. But wait, the question says it's using the non-rigid rotor model, which might complicate things a bit. Or wait, maybe it's just combining rotation and vibration since it's called the rotation-vibration model.

The question is about what momentum a photon should have so that when it's absorbed, the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state. The molecule is currently in its fundamental state. I'm a bit fuzzy on what the fundamental state means here. Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so that's the ground state for both rotation and vibration modes. But wait, I think in the rotational-vibrational model, the energy levels are quantized and a combination of both rotation and vibration.

So when a photon is absorbed, it must provide the energy needed to transition the molecule to the next higher energy state. But the question says the molecule should switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I think that refers to the next vibrational state? Or maybe the next rotational state? Or perhaps a combination.

Wait, no. The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is a combination of both rotation and vibration. So the molecule's energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational energy. The fundamental state is the lowest possible vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (like J=0 or J=1, depending on the model). Wait, for a rigid rotor, the rotational states are quantized as J=0,1,2... and each has energy levels proportional to J(J+1). But for a diatomic, the non-rigid rotor might have a different treatment, but perhaps when considering vibration, the primary transition is between vibrational states, but rotation can also play a role.

Wait, but the problem states the molecule is in its fundamental state. So I think that means the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (like J=0). But wait, for a diatomic molecule, the rotational state when J=0 is the ground state, but sometimes molecules can't have J=0 because of the way the rotational partition function works, but maybe that's not relevant here.

When a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next state. Now, the next state with the lowest possible energy—so I think that means the next higher vibrational state (v=1), but perhaps with the same or lowest rotational state. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition within the same vibrational state but to a higher rotational state. Hmm, but which transition is lower in energy? The vibrational transitions are usually higher in energy than rotational ones because the vibrational energy levels are spaced further apart.

Wait the problem says the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model, so the energy levels are a combination of both. So the total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies. The fundamental state is v=0 and J=0, perhaps. So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can transition to a state where either v increases by one (v=1, J=0) or J increases, say J=1 with v=0, but which transition requires less energy? Because the question is about the photon's momentum—so the energy of the photon must match the energy difference between two states.

Wait, the photon's energy is E_photon
