Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about two stars and their luminosities. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

Alright, the question says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. But wait, I'm not sure if the mass is relevant here. Luminosity usually relates to radius and temperature, right? Like the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which says L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Oh right, so luminosity depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power.

The problem says that the stars are observed to have the same wavelength at which they appear brightest. I remember that the peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.8977719×10^-3 m·K). So if both stars have the same λ_max, that means their temperatures are the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So T1 = T2? That's interesting because usually when stars are more massive, they are hotter, but here their peak wavelengths are the same, so same temperature. So T1 equals T2.

Wait, but I should double-check that. If both have same λ_max, then T is same. So T1 = T2.

So then, the luminosity ratio would be L1/L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4). But since T1 = T2, the T terms drop out, so L1/L2 = (R1²)/(R2²) = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that's 2.25 times. So the factor is 2.25, which is option A. But wait, wait. Are there any other factors I'm missing?

Wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has 0 km/s, Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, how does that affect the observed luminosity? Oh, because when a star is moving towards us or away, there's a Doppler shift which affects the observed wavelength. But wait, the peak wavelengths were determined through spectroscopy. So do we need to correct for the Doppler shift?

Wait, the emission from the star is being observed, and the peak wavelength is the observed one. So if Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, its light is blueshifted. So the observed λ_max would be different from the actual emitted λ_max. But the problem says that the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. Ah, so when they say the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same, that's the observed wavelength. So we have to correct for their velocities.

So let's think. Since Star_1 has 0 velocity, its emitted λ_max is the same as the observed. But Star_2 has a velocity, so its observed λ_max is different from its emitted. But the problem states that the observed λ_max are the same. So, let's compute the actual temperature of
