Okay, so I have this question about planets and transit probabilities. Hmm, transits are when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, right? And the chance of that happening depends on the size of the planet's orbit, the star's size, and the planet's orbital plane alignment. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details, so let me think this through.

The question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. Oh wait, their masses are the same, so that doesn't matter. But their orbital periods are different: Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star since shorter period means closer orbit.

The stars are both the same size because they have the same radii. But Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's. Wait, but same radius, so maybe they are similar in size but different in mass. Oh, but for transit probability, the main factors are the orbital period (distance from star) and the star's size, and the planet's size.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. The formula I think is P = R*/a, where R* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis (which is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law). The probability increases as this ratio increases because the planet has a higher chance of crossing our line of sight.

So for each planet, the probability of transit is proportional to (R*)/a. But a is related to the orbital period. Using Kepler's third law: a^3 = (G(M+ m) ) P^2/(4π²), but since the planet's mass is negligible, it's a^3 proportional to (M*) * P². So a is proportional to (M*)^(1/3) * P^(2/3). So a = k * M*^(1/3) * P^(2/3), where k is a constant.

Wait, but since the transit probability is (R*)/a, let's substitute a. So P_transit = R*/(k * M*^(1/3) * P^(2/3)).

Wait, but R* is the same for both stars, so for each planet, their transit probabilities depend on 1/(M*^(1/3) * P^(2/3)).

So let's get the values for each planet.

Planet_1: M1 = 2 M2 (since M1 is twice M2's mass). P1 is 1/3 of P2, since it's three times shorter.

Wait, no, actually, the question says Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 = (1/3) P2.

Wait, let me rephrase. Let’s denote P2 as the period of Planet_2. So P1 = (1/3) P2, because it's three times shorter.

So for Planet_1:

a1 = ( (M1) * (P1)^2 )^(1/3) / (some constants). Similarly for Planet_2: a2 = ( (M2) * (P2)^2 )^(1/3).

So substituting:

a1 = [ (2 M2) * ( (P2/3) )^2 ]^(1/3)
= [ 2 M2 * (P2² / 9) ) ]^(1/3)
= [ (2/9) * M2 P2² ]^(1/3)
= [ (2/9) ]^(1/3) * [ M2 P2² ]^(1/3 )

Similarly, a2 = [ M2 * P2² ]^(1/3 )

So the ratio a1/a2 is [ (2/9) ]^(1/3) = (2/(9))^(1/3) = (2/3²)^(1/3) = (2)^(1/3) / (3^(2/3)).

But wait, the transit probability is (R*)/a. Since R* is same for both, the probability ratio is (1/a1) / (1/a2) ) = a2 / a1.

So the probability for Planet_1 is P1 = R*/a1.

Similarly, Planet_2's probability is P2 = R*/a2.

So the ratio P1/P2 = (a2)/(a1) = (a2/a1).

From above, a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

So a2/a1 = 1/( (2/9)^(1/3) ) = (9/2)^(1/3).

What's 9/2? That's 4.5. So cube root of 4.5 is about 1.6506. Because 1.6^3 is 4.096, 1.65^3 is approximately 4.5.

Wait, 1.65 * 1.65 = 2.7225, times 1.65 is about 4.49 (since 2.7225 *1.65= let's compute 2.7225 *1.6 = 4.356, plus 2.7225*0.05=0.136125, so total ~4.492). So cube root is around 1.65.

So the ratio a2/a1 is about 1.65. Thus, the transit probability for Planet_2 is 1.65 times higher than Planet_1's.

Wait, but wait: the question says the researchers choose to observe the planet with the higher probability. So if Planet_2 has higher probability, they'd choose Planet_2. Let's see the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Planet_2 is preferred due to ~2.25 times higher.

Option B: 1.5 times.

Option C: Planet_1 preferred due to 1.65.

Option D: 2.7.

Wait, according to my calculation, Planet_2's probability is higher by a factor of about 1.65. So that would mean option C is wrong because that's about Planet_1. So the correct option would be either A or B or another, but I think my calculation is that P2 is higher by 1.65 times.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check.

Wait, earlier I said P_transit is proportional to R*/a, and since R* is same, it's 1/a. So P1's probability is P1 = R*/a1, P2's is R*/a2.

So the ratio of P2's probability to P1's is (R*/a2) / (R*/a1) ) = a1/a2.

Wait, no, wait: P1 is R*/a1, P2 is R*/a2. So the ratio P2/P1 is (R*/a2)/(R*/a1) )= a1/a2.

Wait, I think I got that mixed up earlier.

So let me recast. Let me compute P2 (probability for planet 2) divided by P1 (probability for planet 1).

P2/P1 = (R*/a2) / (R*/a1) ) = a1/a2.

Wait, earlier I found that a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) * a2.

So a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2.

Thus, a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.2222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

Wait, so P2/P1 = 0.606. So Planet_2's probability is about 0.606 times Planet_1's probability.

Wait, that can't be right. Because earlier I thought a2 was larger than a1, but now I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in substituting the periods.

Let me approach this from another angle.

The formula for transit probability is:

P_transit = (R_star / a) * (1 / (e * sqrt(1 - e²))) )

But for circular orbits, e=0, so the factor becomes 1/(0* something), which I think isn't correct. Wait, no, the eccentricity term is actually for the probability calculation when the orbit is eccentric. But wait, for a circular orbit (e=0), the formula simplifies. Let me look it up.

Wait, I don't have the exact formula, but I remember that for a circular orbit, the transit probability is (R_star / a) * (1 / (something)), but perhaps more accurately, it's (R_star / a) multiplied by a factor that depends on the inclination. Wait, no, the transit probability is the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. It's given by (R*/a) * (sqrt( (1 + (b/(R*)))^2 - 1 )) or something like that, but perhaps I'm making it more complicated.

Alternatively, I remember that the geometric probability for a transit is approximately (R*/a), assuming edge-on orbit. So the probability is proportional to (R*/a).

Wait, that's probably the case. So the probability P ≈ (R*/a) * (some function of the eccentricity and other factors), but for circular orbits, it's just (R*/a). Or perhaps it's (R*/a) multiplied by 1/(sqrt(1 - e²)) or something like that. But since both planets have circular orbits, e=0, and the formula simplifies. So perhaps the geometric probability is (R*/a) multiplied by (something like 1/(something)).

Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula. But since I can't, I'll proceed with the approximation that P is proportional to (R*/a). So the transit probability increases when a is smaller, because R* is fixed.

So for each planet, the probability is proportional to R*/a. Since R* is same for both, P is inversely proportional to a.

So the planet with smaller a (closer to the star) has a higher probability of transiting.

But wait: Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period (three times shorter) than Planet_2. So according to Kepler's third law, a is related to (M* * P²)^(1/3). Since Planet_1 is around a more massive star (M1=2*M2) and has a shorter period, let's compute a1 and a2.

M1 = 2*M2.

P1 = P2 / 3.

So a1^3 = (M1 * P1^2 ) = (2 M2) * (P2/3)^2 = 2 M2 * P2^2 /9 = (2/9) M2 P2^2.

a2^3 = M2 * P2^2.

So a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3. So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ a2 * 0.606.

So a1 is smaller than a2. Hence, the transit probability for Planet_1 is R*/a1, which is higher than R*/a2 for Planet_2.

Wait, so Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting because it's closer to its star (since a is smaller). So that would mean the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1, because it's more likely to transit.

Wait, but that's conflicting with my earlier calculation. Hmm. Let me double-check.

Wait, if a1 is 0.606 a2, then a1 is smaller. So R*/a1 is larger than R*/a2.

Therefore, P1 (probability for Planet_1) is (R*/a1) which is higher than (R*/a2) which is P2.

So Planet_1 has a higher transit probability. So the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1.

So looking back at the options, options C and D are about Planet_1 having higher probability.

Option C: ~1.65 times higher.

Option D: ~2.7 times higher.

Wait, but earlier, when I thought about the ratio P2/P1, I thought it was 1.65, but that was perhaps due to a miscalculation.

Wait, let's compute the exact ratio of P1 to P2.

P1 = R*/a1.

P2 = R*/a2.

So P1/P2 = (R*/a1) / (R*/a2) ) = a2 / a1.

From earlier, a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

So a2/a1 = [ 1 / (2/9)^(1/3) ] = (9/2)^(1/3) ≈ cube root of 4.5 ≈ 1.65.

So P1 is 1.65 times higher than P2. So P1/P2 = 1.65.

Wait, wait no: if a1 is smaller, then P1 is higher. So if a1 is 0.606 a2, then a2/a1 is about 1.65.

So P1 = R*/a1, P2 = R*/a2.

Therefore, P1 = (a2/a1) * P2 = 1.65 * P2.

So P1 is 1.65 times higher than P2. So the probability for Planet_1 is higher, so they should choose to observe Planet_1.

Wait, but that's conflicting with the earlier conclusion. So which is correct?

Wait, the question gives options where the researchers have chosen to observe Planet_2. Let me look at the options again.

Wait the options are:

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~2.25 times higher probability.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~1.5 times higher.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher.

So according to my latest calculation, Planet_1 has a higher probability by ~1.65 times. So option C says that, so the researchers would prefer Planet_1.

But wait, wait a second. Another point to consider: the star's mass affects the star's radius. Oh, but the question states that both host stars have the same radii. So R* is the same for both, so that doesn't affect the transit probability ratio.

Wait, but another factor: The semi-major axis a is determined by the planet's orbital period and the star's mass. So a is smaller for Planet_1 because it has a shorter period and a more massive star. So a1 is smaller than a2, making R*/a1 larger, so the transit probability for Planet_1 is higher.

So the correct answer would be option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Wait, but looking back, I think I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me recompute.

Compute a1 and a2.

Given:

M1 = 2*M2.

P1 = (1/3) P2.

a^3 = (G(M) P^2)/(4π²). So a1^3 = (2 M2) * (P2/3)^2 /k, where k is a constant.

a2^3 = (M2) * (P2)^2 /k.

So a1^3 = (2 M2 * (P2^2)/(9)) ) / k.

So a1^3 = (2/9) * (M2 P2^2 /k ) = (2/9) a2^3.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Which is a1 = a2 * (2)^(1/3) / (9)^(1/3) = a2 * (2^0.333) / (3^2^0.333) ).

2^0.333 is about 1.26, 3^0.666 is about 4.326, so 1.26 / 4.326 ≈ 0.291. So a1 ≈ 0.291 a2.

Wait, wait, wait. 9 is 3^2, so 9^(1/3) is 3^(2/3) ≈ 2.08.

So 2/9 is approximately 0.2222, and cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.606. So a1 = a2 * 0.606.

So a1 is 0.606 a2.

So the transit probabilities are:

P1 = R*/a1 = R*/(0.606 a2) ≈ 1.65 * (R*/a2) = 1.65 P2.

So P1 = 1.65 * P2.

That means Planet_1's probability is 1.65 times that of Planet_2. So the researchers should choose Planet_1, which has a higher probability.

So the correct option is C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

But wait, looking back, option C says Planet_1 is preferred because of 1.65 times higher. So yes.

Wait, but the initial calculation I did was that the probability for Planet_1 is higher, so they would choose to observe Planet_1, which matches option C.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine which planet has the higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \( P_{\text{transit}} \propto \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the star's radius and \( a \) is the planet's orbital semi-major axis. Since both stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability depends inversely on the semi-major axis (\( a \)).

### Step 1: Relating orbital period and semi-major axis
Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) and the star's mass \( M_* \) by:

\[
a^3 \propto M_* \cdot P^2
\]

For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) (Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's star).
- \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2 \) (Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's).

Substituting these values:
\[
a_1^3 \propto (2M_2) \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{2}{9} M_2 P_2^2
\]
\[
a_2^3 \propto M_2 \cdot P_2^2
\]

Taking the cube root:
\[
a_1 \propto \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} a_2
\]

Thus:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

### Step 2: Transit probability ratio
The transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), so:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Since Planet_1 has a higher transit probability, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1. Among the options provided, the correct choice is:

**C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**
