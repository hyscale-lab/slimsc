Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again and break it down.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The setup is that when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. The problem says that this situation can look like an exoplanet causing similar variations. The question is, what would be the radius of a planet that would produce the same light curve amplitude as this spotted star, assuming the star wasn't spotted.

Hmm. So, I think I need to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots to the variation caused by a planet transiting the star.

First, let me think about how brightness variation works. When a planet transits a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing the observed brightness to dip. The amplitude of this dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. Similarly, the spots on the star would cause a variation in brightness as the star rotates, so we can model this as a periodic dimming and brightening as the spots come into view.

Wait, but the spots are cooler, so when they face us, the star appears dimmer, and when the other side (without spots) faces us, it's brighter. So the net effect is a variation in the observed brightness due to the spots.

But wait, the problem says that the observed brightness variation due to the spots is similar to an exoplanet transiting the star. So I need to find the planet radius that would cause the same dip as the spots do.

Let me think about both scenarios.

Case 1: Spots on the star. The spots cover 20% of the hemisphere, so the filling factor is 0.2. But wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered, right? So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (Area of hemisphere). Wait, the hemisphere's area is (1/2) * 4πR² = 2πR². So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². But wait, the entire star's area is 4πR², so the spots cover 0.4π
