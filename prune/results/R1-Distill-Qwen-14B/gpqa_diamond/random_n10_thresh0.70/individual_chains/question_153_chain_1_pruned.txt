Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about Michael additions. Hmm, I need to figure out the reactants and major products for three different reactions. Let's take it step by step.

First, looking at the reactions given. There are three parts: A, B, and C. Each involves a Michael addition. I remember that the Michael reaction is when a nucleophile attacks the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound, leading to a conjugate addition.

Let me tackle each part separately.

Starting with Reaction A:

The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions. Dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOEt)2. It's a good nucleophile, especially the enolate part. The other compound is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester. The structure is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the acrylate part is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 attached to a p-tolyl group. Wait, no, wait: (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-(p-tolyl)COOEt? Or maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Wait, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is probably CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the substituents on the double bond would be the p-tolyl and the COOEt group. Wait, no, the formula is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe it's CH2=C(C6H4-4-CH3)COOEt. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-CH2-p-tolyl? No, wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-O-R. So in this case, the R is methyl, and the substituent is at
