Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are A to D, each with different values in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance (also called the decay length) is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like L = gamma * beta * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is v/c, and tau is the proper lifetime.

But wait, how do I get tau? Oh, right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime by the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that Γ ≈ ħ / tau. So tau ≈ ħ / Γ. Oh, but I should be careful with units here.

So first, I think I need to compute the lifetime tau. Let's see, the Planck constant ħ is about 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and the constants are usually in these units for particle physics.

Wait, Γ is given in MeV. Let me convert that to GeV to match units. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ_X = 0.32 GeV.

So tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV. Let me calculate that. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Next, I need to find gamma and beta. Gamma is the Lorentz factor: gamma = E / (m c^2). Wait, no, wait. The energy E is the total energy, which is gamma m c^2. So gamma = E / (m c^2). But wait, the units here are in GeV, so perhaps I can ignore the c^2 factors for unit conversion since they'll cancel out when considering natural units, but I might need to convert them later.

Wait, I think in particle physics, when using natural units (c=1), the calculations are simpler. So E is given in GeV, m in GeV/c² (but perhaps the units are such that mass is in GeV/c², but since we're using E = gamma m c², but when c=1, E = gamma m. So in natural units, E (in GeV) is equal to gamma times m (in GeV).

So E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV/c². So gamma = E_X / m_X. Let me compute that: 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So gamma is approximately 6.6667.

Beta is v/c. Beta can be found from gamma using the relation gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). Rearranging, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

So let's compute beta. Gamma is 6.6667, so gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.4444. So 1/gamma squared is 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. Square root of that is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta is approximately 0.9887.

So now, gamma is about 6.6667, beta is about 0.9887.

Now, the mean lifetime tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds. So the mean decay length L is gamma * beta * c * tau.

Wait, but I need to compute this. Let's plug in the numbers:

Gamma = 6.6667
Beta = 0.9887
c is the speed of light, about 3e8 meters per second.

So L = 6.6667 * 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, let me compute this step by step.

First, compute 6.6667 * 0.9887. Let me approximate that: 6.6667 is about 20/3, which is about 6.6667. So 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ approx 6.6667 * (1 - 0.0113) ≈ 6.6667 - (6.6667 * 0.0113) ≈ 6.6667 - 0.0753 ≈ 6.5914.

Hmm, maybe more accurately, 6.6667 * 0.9887. Let me compute it exactly:

6.6667 * 0.9887 = ?

Well, 6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322, and 0.6667 *0.9887≈0.66. So about 5.9322 + 0.66=6.5922. So approximately 6.592.

So 6.592 * 3e8 m/s = 1.9776e9 m/s.

Multiply this by tau, which is 2.056875e-24 s. So 1.9776e9 * 2.056875e-24 = ?

Let me compute the exponents first: 1e9 * 1e-24 = 1e-15.

So 1.9776 * 2.056875 = approximately 4.065 (since 2 * 2=4, and 0.9776 * 2.056875 is about 2.016 so total around 4.016, but perhaps I should compute more accurately.)

Wait, 1.9776 * 2.056875.

Let me compute 2 * 2.056875=4.11375. Then subtract 0.0224 *2.056875 (because 1.9776 is 2 - 0.0224). So 0.0224 *2.056875 ≈0.0461.

So 4.11375 - 0.0461 ≈4.06765. So the product is approximately 4.06765e-15 meters.

Wait, but the options are in different orders of magnitude. Let me check the options:

Option A: 5.0223e-16 m

Option B:4.0655e-15 m

Option C:5.0223e-15 m

Option D:4.0655e-16 m

So my calculation gives approximately 4.067e-15 m. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close. So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't miss any unit conversions.

Because the calculation for tau was using ħ in GeV·s. Let me check that.

Yes, ħ is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ is 0.32 GeV, so tau = 6.582e-25 /0.32 = approx 2.056875e-24 seconds. That part looks correct.

Gamma is E/(m c^2). Wait, but in natural units, c=1, so E = gamma m. So gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6667. Correct.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) → sqrt(1 - 1/(44.444)) → sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.9887. Correct.

So the calculation for L: gamma beta c tau.

Wait, but in the initial step, I think I might have missed a factor of c somewhere. Let me re-express the formula correctly.

The mean decay length L is given by L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Wait, but in natural units, where c=1, perhaps I can express it as L = gamma * beta * tau * c.

Wait, but in SI units, the speed is in m/s, so yes, I think I did it correctly.

But let me think again. Tau is in seconds, c is in m/s. So gamma * beta * tau * c gives units (dimensionless) * (m/s) * s → meters. Correct.

So the calculation is L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Yes, and the numbers came out to approximately 4.067e-15 m, which aligns with option B.

So the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity in units of the speed of light,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Compute the proper lifetime \( \tau \)
The width \( \Gamma_X \) is related to the lifetime \( \tau \) via the uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_X}
\]

Here, \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma_X = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \gamma \) and \( \beta \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X}
\]

where \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

The velocity \( \beta \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{44.444}} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 3: Compute the mean decay distance \( L \)
Substituting \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \), \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \) into the formula for \( L \):

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

\[
L = 6.6667 \cdot 0.9887 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24})
\]

First, compute \( 6.6667 \cdot 0.9887 \approx 6.592 \). Then:

\[
L = 6.592 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24})
\]

\[
L = (6.592 \cdot 3) \cdot 10^{-16} \cdot 2.056875
\]

\[
L \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The closest option to \( L \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is:

**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**.
