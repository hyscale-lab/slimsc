Okay, so I have this question about transit detection probabilities for two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to choose which one to observe based on the highest probability of a transit. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves the planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability depends on the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight.

Wait, the question says both planets have the same mass but different orbital periods. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star because a shorter orbital period usually means a smaller orbit, right? Because Kepler's third law relates the period squared to the cube of the semi-major axis, but since the mass of the star is different, that might complicate things.

The host stars have the same radii but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But wait, they have the same radius? So Planet_1 is orbiting a more massive star with the same size as Planet_2's star. That might affect the probability because the star's size influences the apparent size of the planet relative to it.

I remember that the transit probability depends on the alignment of the orbit. The probability is higher when the planet's orbit is edge-on relative to us. But how do the other factors, like orbital distance and star size, come into play here?

The probability of a transit is given by the formula P ≈ (R_star / a) * (something about the inclination), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Wait, maybe I should think about the geometric probability. The transit probability is roughly (R_star / a) * (something else). Oh, wait, another factor is the relative size of the planet compared to the star, but since both are Earth-like, their radii are similar, so that effect might be the same for both.

Wait, no, the probability also depends on the host star's size. The transit depth depends on (R_planet / R_star)^2, but the probability of transit is more about the orbital geometry. I think the transit probability is approximately (R_star / a), where a is the semi-major axis. Because the star's radius defines the maximum distance where the planet could transit. The planet's orbit must be such that it passes in front of the star from our view, which is a geometric probability.

Wait, another thought: The transit probability also involves the ratio of the orbital distance (a) to the
