Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem is about identifying compound E in a series of reactions. The starting compound is A, and it goes through several transformations to become E. There are also some hints provided, which I should definitely consider.

First, let's break down each reaction step:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are two hints (a and b):

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are four different cyclic ketones.

Alright, let's start by analyzing the reactions and the hints.

Starting with hint (b). The IR peaks suggest carbonyl groups. A has a peak at 1750 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl. That's typical for a ketone (around 1700-1750 cm^-1), maybe an aldehyde? But aldehydes are usually a bit higher, like 1720-1740. Wait, but ketones can vary. Wait, 1750 is a bit high for a regular ketone. Maybe A is an ester or maybe an aldehyde? Hmm, but then E has a peak at 1715, which is more in the ketone range. So perhaps A is an aldehyde or an ester, and E is a ketone.

Wait, but let me think. The reactions might help.

First reaction: A + HCN → B. HCN adds to carbonyl groups. So if A is a ketone or an aldehyde, HCN would add as a nucleophile. For example, if A is a ketone, adding HCN would give a cyanohydrin. Wait, but HCN adds to ketones to form cyanohydrins, which are diols with a cyanide group. Alternatively, if A is an aldehyde, HCN would form a similar structure. Alternatively, maybe A is an ester? No, because HCN adding to esters might form a different product, but I think more likely A is a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, but the IR of A is at 1750, which is more like an ester or maybe an aldehyde. Let's think: Esters have carbonyl around 1730-1750. Aldehydes are 1720-1740, maybe. So 1750 is more ester-like. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone with strong electron-withdrawing groups.

But moving on. The second step: B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. So what kind of reduction is this? H2 and Pd is usually a hydrogenation catalyst. So if B has a nitrile group (from HCN addition), then reducing it would add hydrogen. Wait, HCN adds to a carbonyl to form a cyanohydrin. For example, if A is R-C=O, then B would be R-C(OH)-CN. Then, hydrogenation might reduce the carbonyl groups. Wait, but Pd is usually for hydrogenolysis or hydrogenation of triple bonds or double bonds, maybe. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a nitrile. Because HCN adds to a carbonyl to form a cyanohydrin, which has an -OH and CN group. But upon reduction, perhaps the nitrile group is reduced. Let me think. If B has a nitrile group (like R-CN), then H2 with Pd would reduce it to R-CH2-NH2, but wait, that's more for amide reductions. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone that's being reduced.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's think about each step.

Step 1: A → B with HCN.

Assuming A is a ketone: R2CO → R2C(OH)CN. So B is a cyanohydrin. Then, step 2: B is hydrogenated with H2 and Pd. Hydrogenation would typically add H2 across double bonds or reduce nitriles to amines. Wait, but in a cyanohydrin, the structure after HCN addition is R2C(OH)CN. So the C=O becomes C(OH)CN. Then, when you hydrogenate that, perhaps the C(OH)CN part is reduced. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps
