Okay, so I have this question about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal and all the angles equal too. So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the lattice parameter, right? So a would be 10 Angstroms.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Oh right, interplanar distance is calculated using the formula d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ)^(1/2) ? Or wait, no, maybe the formula is different. Let me think. Oh right, the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) ) ). Wait, no, I might be mixing up the angles. Because in a rhombohedral system, the angles are all the same, so it's easier. But I'm a bit confused about the exact formula.

Wait, I think the correct formula is d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) * cos α ), since all angles α, β, γ are equal in a rhombohedral structure. Because in a
