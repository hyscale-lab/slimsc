Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me. Hmm, let me try to think through it. The question is about two quantum states with different energies, E1 and E2, and their lifetimes. The lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly resolved. The options are A to D, each with different values.

Wait, I remember that the lifetime of an energy level is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The uncertainty in energy multiplied by the uncertainty in time is on the order of ħ/2, maybe? So the formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

Here, Δt would be the lifetime of the state, because that's the time it exists before decaying or something. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy ΔE is about ħ divided by (2 times the lifetime). But wait, since we have two different lifetimes, maybe each state has its own uncertainty.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. Let me think. So the energy levels have their own lifetimes. The energy difference must be sufficiently large so that the lines don't overlap when measured. How does the uncertainty in energy affect the ability to resolve them?

Oh, I think the idea is that if the energy difference between the two states is much larger than the uncertainties in their energies, then we can distinguish them. Otherwise, if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might blend together and we can't tell them apart.

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE_i = ħ/(2τ_i), where τ is the lifetime. Let's compute that for both.

The lifetimes are τ1 = 1e-9 s and τ2 = 1e-8 s.

Hmm, Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ is h/(2π), which is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So for τ1, ΔE1 = ħ/(2*τ1) ≈ (1.05e-34)/(2 * 1e-9) = (1.05e-34)/(2e-9) = 5.25e-26 J. To convert that to eV, since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 5.25e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.28e-7 eV. Wait, that's about 3.28e-7 eV.

For τ2, ΔE2 = ħ/(2*τ2) = (1.05e-34)/(2e-8) = (1.05e-34)/(2e-8) = 5.25e-27 J. Convert to eV: 5.25e-27 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.28e-8 eV.

So the uncertainties are ΔE1 ≈ 3.28e-7 eV and ΔE2 ≈ 3.28e-8 eV.

Wait, but the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties to be clearly distinguishable. Because otherwise, the two states' energy ranges might overlap. So the minimum energy difference should be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Let's calculate that sum: 3.28e-7 + 3.28e-8 = 3.61e-7 eV.

So the energy difference needs to be at least around 3.6e-7 eV or more. Let me look at the options.

Options are:
A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV → way smaller than 3.6e-7
B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller
C) 1e-4 eV → much larger, 1e-4 is 1e4 * 1e-8, which is way bigger than 3.6e-7.
D) 1e-8 eV → 0.1e-7, which is 0.1e-7 is 1e-8. So 1e-8 is smaller than 3.6e-7.

So option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way bigger than our calculated 3.6e-7 eV. So that would definitely be resolvable. The other options are too small.

Wait, but wait. Another thing I'm a bit fuzzy on: the exact formula. Because the energy uncertainty is ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ), but sometimes it's written as ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. Let me double-check that. Oh, right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. So the minimal ΔE is ħ/(2Δt), which is what I used. So that should be correct.

So the sum of ΔE1 and ΔE2 is approximately 3.6e-7 eV. So the energy difference has to be bigger than that. So only option C is bigger. So the correct answer should be option C.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because in reality, when you have two energy levels, the energy difference is E2 - E1. Each has its own uncertainty. For them to be distinguishable, the separation must be more than the sum of the uncertainties.

Alternatively, perhaps the uncertainty in the energy difference is the combination of both uncertainties. So the total uncertainty in ΔE = E2 - E1 would be the sum of the individual uncertainties, I think. Because each energy has its own uncertainty, and the difference would have a combined uncertainty.

So yeah, the energy difference must be much larger than the sum of the two uncertainties. So in that case, option C is the only one that's big enough. So the answer must be option C.


To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), and lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The uncertainty in energy for each state is given by:

\[
\Delta E_i = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_i},
\]

where \( \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). Converting \( \Delta E_i \) to electron volts (1 eV = \( 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

1. For \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J},
   \]
   \[
   \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. For \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J},
   \]
   \[
   \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

The total uncertainty in the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) is approximately the sum of the individual uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} + 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \approx 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For the two energy levels to be clearly distinguishable, the energy difference \( |E_2 - E_1| \) must be significantly larger than \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \). Evaluating the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is too small.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so this is also too small.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is much larger than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is sufficient.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is not sufficient.

Thus, the only energy difference that satisfies the condition for clear resolution is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).
