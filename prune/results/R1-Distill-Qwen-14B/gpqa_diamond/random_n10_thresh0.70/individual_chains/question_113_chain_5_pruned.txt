Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct formula for an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the question lists the characterization techniques used: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The data points are:

1. FTIR:
   - Very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Hmm, broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, a very broad peak could be from an alcohol or a carbonyl group? Or maybe it's an -OH group like in an ester or something else.
   - Also, strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Those are in the range of carbonyl groups (C=O). The 1700 is around where esters, ketones, or aldehydes absorb. The 1650 might be an conjugated carbonyl or maybe something like an aromatic ring with a substituent, like a carbonyl attached to a benzene ring.

2. 1H NMR:
   - Several peaks, including vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are those on a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound probably has a double bond. The integration of these peaks would tell how many H's are attached, but since it's not given, maybe I can infer from the structure.

3. Mass Spec:
   - Fragment peak at m/z =45. That's a key point. I remember that the m/z 45 fragment is common for certain functional groups. For example, if it's a CH3CO+ fragment, which would be 45 (molecular weight of 45 is C2H3O: 12*2 +1*3 +16=24+3+16=43? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 45... Let me think. CH3CO+ is (12*2 + 1*3 +16) = 24+3+16=43, but maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe it's the tropylium ion or something else. Alternatively, another possibility: the fragment could be a ketene ion, which would have a molecular ion of 45. Or perhaps it's a fragment from an ester or a cyclic structure.

Now, the options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O.

Let me think about the IR first. The broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is likely an O-H stretch. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad and maybe stronger. Alternatively, an alcohol would have a broad O-H as well. However, the presence of two carbonyl peaks suggests there are two different carbonyl groups in the molecule. But wait, that's not possible unless maybe one is conjugated or something else.

Wait, the two peaks are at 1700 and 1650. Let me think. A carbonyl in an ester is usually around 1740-1700. A conjugated carbonyl (like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester or ketone) might absorb lower, around 1680-1700. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe one is a ketone and the other is an ester? Or perhaps one is a carbonyl and another is an aromatic ring with conjugation.

Wait, another possibility: the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak could be an aromatic C=C stretching. Sometimes, aromatic rings show strong absorption around 1600 cm⁻¹, but if it's substituted, the position can vary. But wait, I thought the 1650 could be a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl. Let me think: for example, an aromatic ester, like a phenyl ester. The carbonyl of the ester would be around 1700, and maybe the aromatic ring's C=C would be around 1600. But the 1650 is a bit higher than typical aromatic C=C.

Alternatively, perhaps the two peaks are the ester carbonyl and another carbonyl group, like in a diketone? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe one is an ester and the other is a conjugated carbonyl in a different part of the molecule.

Then, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond. So the compound must have an alkene group.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming X and N are 0. So (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2= 1. So one degree of unsaturation, which could be a ring or a double bond. But wait, the NMR
