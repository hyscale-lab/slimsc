Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

So, the scenario is that researchers are trying to detect transits of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They need to choose which one to observe because they have limited time. The goal is to pick the one with the higher probability of transiting, making it easier to detect.

From what I remember, the transit method relies on the planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of a transit depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. I think the probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us, but how does that translate into actual probability calculations?

I recall that the probability (p) of a planet transiting is given by p = R_star / a_planet, where R_star is the star's radius and a_planet is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait, but wait—no, that might not be exactly right. Oh right, the formula I remember is p = (R_star / a) * (1 / (e * sqrt(1-e²))) ), but for circular orbits, e is zero, so that part might not apply. Wait, no, that's the formula for the probability considering inclination. Oh wait, perhaps I'm mixing up some terms.

Wait, I think the transit probability formula for a randomly oriented orbit is p = (R_star + R_planet) / (a * sqrt(1 - (b^2))) ), but I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think in terms of the geometry.

Wait, another approach: for a circular orbit, the probability that the inclination is such that we see a transit is approximately (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since the planets are Earth-like, their radii are much smaller than the stars, so R_planet is negligible compared to R_star. So the probability simplifies to p ≈ (R_star) / a.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure about this. Alternatively, I think the actual formula for the transit probability is p = (R_star / a) * (1 / sin i), but that's when inclination i is considered. Wait, no, that might not be right either.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the formula as p = (R_star / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - (b²)))), where b is
