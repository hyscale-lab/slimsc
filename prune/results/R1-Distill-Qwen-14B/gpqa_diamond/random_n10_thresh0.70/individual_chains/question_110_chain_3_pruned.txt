Okay, so I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I recall the information given. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. So anything with V magnitude less than or equal to 17 is observable by ESPRESSO. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, meaning V mag less than or equal to 16 are observable by HIRES.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says stars brighter than X mag can be observed. So, brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO, and brighter than 16 for HIRES. So the magnitude scale is such that lower numbers are brighter. So, a star with V mag 16 is brighter than 17. So, ESPRESSO can observe up to 17, HIRES up to 16. So for a star to be observed by both, its apparent V magnitude must be less than or equal to 16. Because if it's 16, HIRES can see it, and since 16 is also within ESPRESSO's limit (17), both can observe.

But wait, let me clarify. The question says with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So, any star with V mag <17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so V mag <16. So, a star that is brighter than 16
