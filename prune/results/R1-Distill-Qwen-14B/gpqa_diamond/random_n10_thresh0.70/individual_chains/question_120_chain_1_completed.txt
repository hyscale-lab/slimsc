Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think this through.

Alright, parallax is a measure of distance, right? The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh wait, no, wait. Parallax is actually inversely proportional to distance. So a smaller parallax means the star is farther away. Yeah, that's right. Because the formula is distance = 1 / parallax (in parsecs), if parallax is small, distance is large.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniformly distributed in terms of volume, I assume, because if they're spread out equally in space, their number density is the same in all regions. So, I'm thinking about how the number of stars relates to the parallax.

Parallax (plx) is measured in arcseconds. The formula I remember is that the number of stars you can see within a certain parallax range depends on the volume of that region. Since stars are uniformly distributed, their number should be proportional to the volume.

Wait, how does the parallax translate to distance? Oh, right, distance d is approximately 1 / plx, where plx is in arcseconds and d is in parsecs. So if plx increases (meaning the star is closer), the distance decreases.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So I need to think about how many stars are in a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx. Since stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number per unit volume is constant. So the number in a volume depends on the volume of that shell.

The volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd is approximately 4πd² dd. Because the volume of a sphere is 4/3 π r³, so the difference between r and r+dr is about the surface area (4πr²) multiplied by dr.

Since d = 1 / plx, I can express the volume in terms of plx. Let's see, d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, because if plx increases, d decreases. So when plx increases by dplx, d decreases by (dplx / plx²) because d is 1/plx.

So the volume element in terms of plx would be 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - dplx / (plx²) ) )? Hmm, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me think in terms of plx.

The thin shell's volume is 4π d² dd. Since d is 1/plx, substituting that in, the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd). But wait, dd is related to dplx. Since d = 1/plx, taking the derivative, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, but the negative sign just indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but since we're dealing with magnitude, we can ignore the sign for now. So the volume for a unit change in plx (dplx) is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) ) ?

Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check. If plx is p, then d = 1/p. So if I have a thin shell at p, the thickness in p is dp, then the thickness in d is dd = - (1/p²) dp. So the volume is 4π d² dd = 4π ( (1/p)^2 ) ( -1/p² dp ) ) = 4π (1/p^4) * (-dp). But since p is increasing, perhaps we take the absolute value, so the volume is 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because if I'm integrating over p, then the volume is proportional to (1/p²) * (1/p²) ) dp. So 1/p^4? That seems very steep. But wait, is that correct?

Wait, another approach. If you have a thin shell at distance d, with thickness dd, then the volume is 4π d² dd. Now, because d = 1/p, then dd = - dp / p². So substituting, the volume becomes 4π (1/p)^2 * ( - dp / p² ) ) = 4π (-dp) / p^4. But since we're considering the magnitude, the volume is 4π dp / p^4.

But wait, let's think about the number of stars. The number per unit volume is constant, say n. So the number of stars in this shell is n * volume = n * (4π dp / p^4).

So the number per unit dp is proportional to 1/p^4. Hmm. So the number of stars per unit range of plx (dp) would decrease as p^4 increases. So as p increases, the number of stars in each dp decreases by 1/p^4.

But the question is about how the number per unit range of plx changes with plx. So that would be n * 4π (1/p^4). So the number is inversely proportional to p^4.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 1/plx^4, which would be the case if the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/p^4.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing the way the volume relates to parallax. Let's think about the differential. The volume element in terms of parallax is the volume of a shell with parallax p and thickness dp. So dV = 4 π d² dd, and d = 1/p, so dd = - (1/p²) dp. So:

dV = 4 π ( (1/p)^2 ) * ( -1/p² dp ) ) = 4 π (-1/p^4) dp.

But since dp is positive (assuming increasing p), the negative indicates the direction, but the magnitude is 4 π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars in that shell is n * dV, which is n * 4 π (1/p^4) dp. Therefore, the number per unit dp is (n *4 π) (1/p^4).

So the number of stars per unit range of plx is proportional to 1/p^4. So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but let me think about this again. Another approach: the number density of stars is uniform, so N = n * V.

If I have a parallax range from p to p + dp, the corresponding distance range is from d=1/p to d=1/(p+dp). But for small dp, this is approximately d to d - (dp)/(p²). Because the derivative of 1/p is -1/p².

Wait, maybe I should consider the volume between p and p+dp as a thin shell in parallax space. Alternatively, perhaps I should express the volume in terms of p.

Alternatively, perhaps using the relation between distance and parallax, and then express the number of stars as a function of p.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about it in terms of distances. For a given distance range (d to d + dd), the number of stars is proportional to the volume, which is 4π d² dd. So N ∝ d² dd.

But since d = 1/p, then dd = - (1/p²) dp. Thus, N ∝ (1/p^2) * (1/p²) dp = 1/p^4 dp.

So again, that leads to N ∝ 1/p^4.

Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

Looking at the options, option A is 1/plx^4, which matches our conclusion.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). The number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume of that region, assuming a uniform distribution of stars in space.

For a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \), the volume is approximately \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we find \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). The volume of the shell in terms of parallax becomes:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars in this shell is proportional to the volume, so the number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( d\text{plx} \)) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). This means the number of stars decreases rapidly as parallax increases.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ 1/plx^4**
