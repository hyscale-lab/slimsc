Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says stars are uniformly distributed, and we need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are like different power laws, so I need to think about the relationship between parallax and the number of stars in a given parallax range.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs), so distance d = 1/plx. So as plx increases, the distance decreases. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, I think that means the number density is constant in space. So more stars would be in a larger volume. Volume depends on distance, right? Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So as the distance increases, the volume increases with the cube of the distance.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So I think I need to relate the number of stars in a thin shell (between plx and plx + dplx) to the parallax. Since the distance is 1/plx, a thin shell at distance d has a thickness dd. So dd = -d(1/plx²) because d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, but I'm thinking about the thickness in distance terms, and how that relates to parallax.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the number of stars per
