Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

Wait, parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance. So, a star with a larger parallax is closer to us. Right, because plx (in arcseconds) is distance in parsecs as 1/distance. So, plx = 1/d, where d is distance.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. I'm assuming that means their spatial density is uniform in space. So, in a given volume, the number of stars is the same everywhere. But how does that translate to the number we observe with a certain parallax?

I think I remember something about the volume of a sphere. Since stars are spread out uniformly, the number of stars you can see within a certain distance depends on the volume of the sphere up to that distance. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, right? So the number of stars in a shell between r and r+dr would be proportional to 4πr² dr, because the volume of the shell is the surface area (4πr²) times dr.

Wait, so the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r is proportional to r² dr. But we're looking at this in terms of parallax. Parallax plx is related to distance as plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let me substitute that in.

So, the number of stars per unit parallax interval. Let's say I consider a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx. Since plx is 1/d, d = 1/plx. So, when plx increases, d decreases because the star is closer.

But I need to find how the number of stars per unit plx changes. Let's think about the number of stars in a certain range of plx.

Wait, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is N = 4πd² dr, where dr is the thickness of the shell. But since d = 1/plx, dr = -d(plx)/dplx * dplx. Wait, because when plx increases, d decreases. So, I think it's easier to express everything in terms of plx.

So, d = 1/plx. Then
