Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy production is mainly through the proton-proton chain, and there are different branches in that process. The pp-I, II, III... I think the pp-III branch might be one of the later steps, perhaps involving higher energy reactions.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So that means if the pp-III process stopped, the effect on the neutrino flux would be felt here on Earth after that time. But the question is about the current flux, so it's considering the neutrinos that were produced before and after the pp-III stopped.

Neutrinos are produced in various steps of the proton-proton chain. The pp-III branch probably produces a certain type of neutrino, maybe the higher energy ones. Oh right, the primary neutrinos are the electron neutrinos (Î½e) produced in the fusion reactions. The different branches might produce different energies of neutrinos.

So, the pp-III branch stopping would affect the production of certain neutrinos. Let me think: the main pp chain produces neutrinos through the process where two protons fuse into deuterium, emitting a positron and a neutrino. But there are side branches. The pp-I and pp-II might produce lower energy neutrinos, and pp-III perhaps higher energy ones?

Wait, actually, I'm a bit confused. I thought that the pp chain has two main branches: the dominant one (pp-I) which produces a positron and a neutrino, and another (pp-II) which produces a neutron and then a decay, but maybe that's for heavier elements. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is part of a different process. Alternatively, I might be mixing up the details.

Wait, I should probably think about the neutrino energies. The question is about two bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So these are in the range of the so-called "pep" neutrinos and the main pp neutrinos. Wait, no. Main pp neutrinos are lower energy, around a few hundred keV. Oh wait, no, the main neutrino from the Sun is the pep neutrino, which comes from the
