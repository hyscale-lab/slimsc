Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. It's about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me think.

So, the operator is P, and we're looking at a muon, which I think is just a particle here. The direction is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Wait, right, quantum mechanical operators have eigenvectors and eigenvalues, so this means when P acts on the eigenvector, it scales it by ħ/2.

The components of P are given: P_x, P_y, P_z. Each is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. Let me write those down.

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So that's like the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2.

P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix scaled similarly.

P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]], the Pauli Z matrix scaled.

The operator P is probably the angular momentum operator, since it has components like L_x, L_y, L_z, but here it's P. But the structure suggests it's spin-1/2, given the 2x2 matrices.

Wait, but the question says the operator is P, and it's along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So, the operator for angular momentum along direction n is P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

But n lies in the x-z plane, so n_y = 0. So the operator simplifies to P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but n is an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, so it's a unit vector. So n can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) or something? Wait, no, in the x-z plane, φ would be 0 or π/2, actually. Wait, no, because any direction in x-z plane can be described with polar angles where φ is 0 or π, but wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: a direction in x-z plane is any (a,0,c) where a² + c² = 1. So,
