Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located in the qubit space. Hmm, density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. 

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait a minute, I remember that |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1| are projectors onto the states |0⟩ and |1⟩, respectively. So adding them together and then scaling by 1/2.

I think this might be a mixed state because it's a statistical mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩. Because each term is a projector and they are summed, and the coefficients are 1/2 each. So the density matrix represents a classical mixture of the two basis states.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubit space. I'm a bit hazy on how the density matrix relates to the Bloch sphere. Oh right, the Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states. For a pure state |ψ⟩, the density matrix ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ| corresponds to a point on the surface of the Bloch sphere. But for mixed states, it's inside the sphere.

Wait, what's the Bloch vector? The Bloch vector is a vector in three-dimensional space that represents the state of a qubit. For a density matrix, it's given by a vector r such that ρ can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and I is the identity matrix.

So let's expand our given ρ. Let me write it out:

ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| )

But |0⟩⟨0| is the same as [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So ρ is (I)/2. So ρ = I/2.

Wait, but the general form is (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ) / 2. So if our ρ is I/2, then the coefficients for σ_x, σ_y, σ_z must all
