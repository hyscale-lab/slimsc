Okay, so I'm looking at this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let's try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So I guess this is a 2-dimensional metric because it's in terms of dx and dy. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which looks familiar, like the equation of a circle or sphere. Wait, 4 is 2 squared, so maybe this is a sphere of radius 2 in some coordinate system.

Wait, but the question talks about a pseudosphere. Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, like a saddle shape. But wait, the metric given doesn't look like a hyperbolic metric. Let me think. Hyperbolic space metrics usually involve terms with x² and y² but with negative signs, or maybe different coefficients. Wait, this metric's denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So when x² + y² <4, the denominator is positive. But when x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, making the metric terms blow up. That might be a coordinate singularity.

Wait, perhaps this is a metric for a 2-dimensional surface. Let me think about what kind of geometry this describes. The line element is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²), maybe? Wait, no, the original metric is in terms of dx and dy,
