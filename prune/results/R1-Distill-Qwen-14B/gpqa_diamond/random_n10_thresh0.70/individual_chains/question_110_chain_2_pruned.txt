Okay, so I've got this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck Observatory. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question provides five stars (Star1 to Star5) with various properties, and I have to determine which pair can be observed by both spectrographs. The key information given is about their magnitudes and distances. Also, the observatories have different brightness limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, and HIRES can go down to 16. So a star must be brighter (i.e., have a lower magnitude) than 17 to be seen by ESPRESSO, and brighter than 16 for HIRES. Wait, wait, no—ESPRESSO observes stars with V mag brighter than 17, meaning apparent V magnitude less than 17, right? Because lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star's V is brighter than 17, that's apparent magnitude less than 17, which is detectable. Similarly, HIRES can see stars brighter than 16, so apparent V mag less than 16.

Wait, no, the question says: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 can be observed." Wait, that's a bit confusing. Wait, magnitudes work such that lower numbers are brighter. So, if a star's apparent V magnitude is 17, that's a certain brightness. If ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, that means the star's apparent V mag must be less than 17. Because, say, a star with mag 16 is brighter than one with 17. So the condition is that the apparent V mag must be ≤ something. Wait, let me get this straight.

Wait, the question says: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 can be observed." So, for ESPRESSO, the star's apparent V must be brighter (lower magnitude) than 17, which is the same as apparent V mag ≤17? No, wait, no—apparent V mag brighter than 17 would be apparent V mag less than 17. Because, for example, a star with V mag 16 is brighter than 17. So, for a star to be detectable by ESPRESS
