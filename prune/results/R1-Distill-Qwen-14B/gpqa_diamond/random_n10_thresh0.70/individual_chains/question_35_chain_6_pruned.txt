Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix Ay.

Wait, right, the eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ. So I need to solve for a and φ.

First, let me write down the matrix S. So S is:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i  0 ]

And c is h/(4π), so Ay would be c multiplied by this S matrix. So Ay is:

c*0   c*(-i)
c*i    c*0

Which simplifies to:

[ 0    -i c ]
[ i c     0 ]

But wait, c is h/(4π), so substituting that in, it becomes:

[ 0       -(i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)    0   ]

Hmm, okay. So now, to find the eigenvalues of Ay, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

The matrix Ay - a I would be:

[ -a       -(i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)    -a  ]

The determinant of this is (-a)(-a) - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ].

Calculating each part: the product of the diagonal elements is a^2. The other term is (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)).

Wait, what's i multiplied by -i? i * (-i) is -i², and since i² is -1, so that's -(-1) = 1.

So (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) = (i * -i) (h²/(4π)^2) ) = (1) * (h²/(16 π²)).

So the determinant becomes a^2 - [ (h²)/(16 π²) ) * (1) ] = 0.

So the equation is a² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0.

Solving for a, we get a² = h²/(16 π²), so a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, because taking square roots, a is ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are +h/(4π) and -h/(4π). These are real numbers. So the eigenvalues are real and their imaginary parts are zero. That's interesting because the matrix Ay is Hermitian, I think. Let me check: for a matrix to be Hermitian, the elements satisfy (M_ij)* = M_ji. So for Ay, element (1,2) is -i c, and element (2,1) is i c. The complex conjugate of element (1,2) is i c, which equals (2,1) element. So yes, Ay is Hermitian. So
