Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and then it's reacted through a series of reagents. I need to find the final product from the given options.

First, I'll focus on the NMR data to figure out the structure. The NMR peaks are:

- 9.72 ppm: a triplet integrating to 1H. That's a high chemical shift, so probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. But wait, the triplet suggests it's coupling with two neighboring protons. Hmm, but aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and don't couple much. Oh wait, maybe it's not an aldehyde then. Alternatively, could it be an acidic proton like from a phenol? No, phenols are around 5 ppm. Maybe an enol form? Or perhaps it's a formyl group attached to something else.

Looking at the next peaks:

- 6.98 ppm: doublet, 2H. That's likely aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted phenyl rings? Like two protons adjacent on a benzene ring.
- 6.51 ppm: another doublet, 2H. Also aromatic. Could these be part of a conjugated system, perhaps?
- 6.27 ppm: broad singlet, 2H. This might be protons on a double bond or maybe some sort of conjugated system. Alternatively, protons on an enol or near an electronegative atom, like next to an oxygen.
- 3.66 ppm: doublet, 2H. That seems like a methylene group (CH2) adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group.

Putting this together, perhaps it's a structure with a benzene ring, a conjugated system, and some substituents. Let's think about the molecular formula C8H9NO. Breaking that down: 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen.

Wait, the formula can be rewritten as C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. X is zero here, so (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2=5. So 5 degrees. That could be a benzene ring (3 degrees), a double bond (1), and a ring or another double bond, or maybe an aromatic ring and some substituents.

Hmm, let me think about the possible structure. The NMR has a triplet at 9.72 ppm for 1H. Could that be part of a conjugated system, like an alpha proton to a carbonyl group? Oh wait, maybe an enal? Enals have conjugated double bonds involving an aldehyde.

Wait, another possibility: the triplet at 9.72 might be a vinyl proton adjacent to an aldehyde. Like in a compound like cinnamaldehyde, but perhaps substituted.

Wait, let's think about the integration. The
