Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's think about this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, so I'll take it slow.

First, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I remember that in relativity, when dealing with speeds, you can't just add them like in classical mechanics because you get values exceeding the speed of light, which isn't possible. So, I think I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula for their relative speed.

Wait, the question is about the relative speed between them. Since they are moving in the same direction, I should subtract their velocities, but relativistically. The formula for velocity addition is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)), right? Oh wait, wait. I think I might be getting this wrong. Let me think. If object A is moving at u and object B at v, both in the same direction, the relative speed of A with respect to B would be (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)).

So, plugging the numbers in: u is 0.6c and v is 0.5c. Let me compute the numerator first. 0.6c minus 0.5c is 0.1c. Now the denominator is 1 minus (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²). Let's compute that. 0.6 * 0.5 is 0.3, and c² cancels out, so denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. So approximately 0.14c, which would round to 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's a good start.

Next, I need to calculate the total energy of the system. Hmm, the total energy in relativity is the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy E is gamma multiplied by m c squared. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, each astronaut has their own gamma. So for the first astronaut with mass 2m moving at
