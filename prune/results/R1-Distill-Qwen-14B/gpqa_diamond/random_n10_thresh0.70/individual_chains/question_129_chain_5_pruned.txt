Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out what compound E is. Let's break it down step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll try to think it through.

The reaction scheme starts with compound A. When A reacts with HCN, it forms B. Then, B is reduced with H2 and Pd to make C. Then C reacts with HNO2 to form D, and finally, D eliminates an inert gas to become E.

The hints are important too. Hint a says that when A is reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions, right? So the Wittig reaction forms alkenes. So A must have a carbonyl group because that's what the Wittig reacts with. The product is a cyclopentane derivative with substituents.

Looking at the product structure: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me visualize that. The cyclopentane ring has methyl groups at positions 1 and 2, and at position 4 there's a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene would be a CH2-C(CH3)= group attached as a substituent? Wait, no, wait. The structure would be like a cyclopentane ring, with methyl groups on carbons 1 and 2. At carbon 4, there's a substituent which is propan-2-ylidene. Propan-2-ylidene would be a group like CH2-C(CH3)=, but wait, that's just a substituting double bond. So the substituent is a methylene group attached to a methyl group, like CH2-C(CH3)-.

Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think: another way to think about the Wittig product. The ylide would attack the carbonyl group of A, forming a new double bond. So if the product is a cyclopentane with a substituent that's an alkenyl group, then A must have been a cyclopentanone (a cyclic ketone) with substituents.

So perhaps A is a cyclopentanone with some substituents. The Wittig reaction would add a double bond. Let me think: the product has a cyclopentane ring, so the starting material (A) would have been a cyclopentanone. The substituents would be determined by the ylide. Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Propan-2-ylidene is a group like CH2-C(CH3)-, but that doesn't sound right. Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be a CH2- group attached to a carbonyl? No, wait, the ylide is a phosphorus ylide, which adds to the carbonyl. So when the Wittig reaction happens, the carbonyl becomes a double bond. So A's structure would be a cyclopentanone with substituents that, after
