Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the formula is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that distance (d) in parsecs is equal to 1 divided by the parallax in arcseconds. So, d = 1/plx. 

Wait, so if plx is small, the distance is large, and vice versa. So as the parallax decreases, the distance increases.

The given relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Let me express this in terms of distance. Since plx = 1/d, substituting that into the equation: N ∝ 1/( (1/d)^5 ) = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5? Wait, but wait a second, because N is varying with plx as 1/plx^5. So substituting plx = 1/d, we get N ∝ (d)^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. That is, the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r+dr, so the number density. So it's the number of stars per unit distance.

Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me think again.

The problem says the number of stars varies as 1/(plx)^5. So N = k/(plx)^5, where k is some constant.

But since plx = 1/d, substituting that in: N = k/( (1/d)^5 ) = k * d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but that's the total number of stars up to a distance d. Or is it the number of stars per some volume? Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of the number of stars per unit volume as a function of distance.

Wait, perhaps I should model this using flux or density. Let me think about the volume involved. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr would be the surface area of the shell multiplied
