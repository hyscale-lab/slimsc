Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. The solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16.

Hmm, wait, stability constants. Right, the stability constant (β) for a complex tells us how stable the complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex is favored. So, β1 to β4 probably correspond to the formation of complexes with 1 to 4 thiocyanate ions attached to the cobalt.

So the complex would form stepwise, right? Like Co(SCN)1^x+ would form first, then Co(SCN)2^y+, and so on. The β values are for each step. So β1 is for the first SCN addition, β2 for the second, etc.

Wait, the problem is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ions attached. So they're asking for the percentage of Co(SCN)₂^z+ in the solution compared to all other cobalt species.

Let me think about how to approach this. I think I need to calculate the distribution of all the cobalt species and find out what fraction is the dithiocyanato complex.

I remember that when dealing with multiple complexes, the distribution can be found using the formation constants and the concentrations of the ligands. The general approach involves setting up expressions for each complex's concentration and then finding their ratios.

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the species: [Co²+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)3]^3+ + [Co(SCN)4]^4+ = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

But since the concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M, which is higher than the total Co concentration, the solutions will form complexes. The higher β values mean more stable complexes as we go from CoSCN+ to higher ones.

Wait, the β values are given as: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, β4 is lower than β3? Hmm, that's interesting. So the third complex is more stable than the fourth. So the most stable complex is probably the third one, Co(SCN)3^3+.

Wait, but the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is the second one, [Co(SCN)₂]^2+. So I need to find the fraction of [Co(SCN)₂] compared to all cobalt species.

How do I compute that? I think I should use the stepwise formation constants. The stepwise constant for each subsequent complex is the ratio of the concentration of the next complex to the previous one multiplied by the ligand concentration.

Alternatively, the fraction of each species can be determined by the ratios of the successive β values and the concentration of the ligand.

Wait, another approach: the fraction of each complex can be calculated using the formula that involves the product of the previous β and the ligand concentration, divided by (1 + all such terms for higher and lower complexes).

Wait, I think I need to model this with the formation steps. Let's outline the complexes:

Co²+ + SCN^- ⇌ CoSCN+ (β1 =9)
CoSCN+ + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)₂^2+ (β2=40)
Co(SCN)₂^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)3^3+ (β3=63)
Co(SCN)3^3+ + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)4^4+ (β4=16)

Each β is the formation constant for adding each SCN^-.

The general approach for such a distribution is to calculate the fraction of each complex, where the fractions depend on the stability constants and the ligand concentration.

I remember that for each complex, the fraction can be calculated using the following formula:

f_n = (β1β2...βn) * [SCN^-]^n / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β1β2β3 [SCN^-]^3 + ... )

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each β_i is the formation constant for the ith step. So the formation of the nth complex involves the product β1*β2*...*βn.

Wait, more accurately. The fraction of each species is the product of the step constants up to that species, divided by the sum of all possible species' products multiplied by their respective [SCN] terms.

Hmm, perhaps the fractions can be determined using the following ratios:

Let me think. The concentration of Co(SCN)₂^2+ is [Co²+]β1[SCN] β2[SCN].

Wait, no. Alternatively, the concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of Co²+ and the product of the βs and [SCN] terms.

Wait, another approach: the fraction of each species can be found by considering the cumulative product of the βs and [SCN] concentrations.

Let me define the species as S0=Co²+, S1=CoSCN+, S2=Co(SCN)₂^2+, S3=Co(SCN)3^3+, S4=Co(SCN)4^4+.

The concentration of each species can be written in terms of [S0], which is [Co²+], and the product of the βs.

So:

[S1] = β1 [S0] [SCN^-]
[S2] = β1 β2 [S0] [SCN^-]^2
[S3] = β1 β2 β3 [S0] [SCN^-]^3
[S4] = β1 β2 β3 β4 [S0] [SCN^-]^4

But wait, no, because each step involves adding one SCN. So for [S2], it's [S1] multiplied by β2 [SCN^-], which is (β1 [S0][SCN^-]) * β2 [SCN^-] = β1 β2 [S0] [SCN^-]^2.

So yes, that seems correct.

But then, the total concentration of all cobalt species is [S0] + [S1] + [S2] + [S3] + [S4] =
