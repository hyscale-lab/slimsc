Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is:

- Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So, R1 = 1.5 * R2.
- The mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. M1 = 1.5 * M2.
- The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So, their peak emission wavelengths are equal.
- The radial velocities are 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Hmm, I'm not sure how that plays into this yet, but maybe it's about Doppler shift affecting observed wavelengths or luminosity?
- The question is asking about the ratio of their luminosities, specifically how much greater L1 is compared to L2.

The options are A to D, with numbers around 2.2 to 2.35. So it's a matter of calculating the right factor.

I remember that the luminosity of a star can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So, L is proportional to R² T⁴.

Wait, but if the stars are radiating as black bodies, then their peak wavelengths are determined by Wien's law. Wien's law says lambda_max * T = constant (approximately 2.898 × 10^-3 m·K). So, lambda_max is inversely proportional to T. Since their lambda_max are the same, that implies their temperatures are the same? Wait, no. Because if their velocities are different, that might affect the observed wavelengths due to Doppler shift. Oh right, so even if their rest frame emission peaks are the same, their observed wavelengths could be different because they're moving. But the problem says the observed wavelengths are the same. So I think that's a clue.

Wait, let me think. The problem says that the astronomers found the same wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. So that's the observed wavelength, right? Which would be affected by their velocities. So, for each star, their emitted wavelength (from Wien's law) is lambda_rest, but due to their
