Alright, I'm trying to tackle this organic chemistry problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll walk through it step by step.

The question is about the Michael addition reaction. I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, forming an enolate intermediate. So, the reactants are usually a nucleophile (the enolate) and an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (the Michael acceptor).

Looking at the first reaction: dimethyl malonate is the nucleophile. Wait, no, dimethyl malonate is a Michael donor because it can form an enolate. Or is it acting as the nucleophile here? Let me think. Oh, right, in the Michael reaction, the enolate (nucleophile) attacks the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (acceptor). So in this case, dimethyl malonate is the enolate source because it's a diester, which is a good Michael donor. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound, so it's the Michael acceptor.

So reaction (A) is the Michael addition between dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The conditions are NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). Sodium ethoxide is a strong base, so it deprotonates the malonate to form the enolate. The enolate attacks the beta position of the acrylate.

The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH- (with E geometry) connected to the p-tolyl group and a methyl ester. So the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's more like CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think again. The IUPAC name is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the parent chain is propenoate (acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-), so the substituent is at the 3 position. Wait, propenoate is CH2=CHCOO-, so number the double bond from the carbonyl. So the positions are 1 (COO), 2 (CH2), 3 (CH)? Hmm, wait. No, the numbering for acrylate would start from the carbonyl. So the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. So the substituent is on the beta carbon (the CH2 group), but wait, the substituent is p-tolyl. So the correct structure would be CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Wait, no, that's for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let me draw it out mentally. The acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. The substituent is on the 3 position, which is the CH2 group adjacent to the double bond. So substituting that with p-tolyl would give CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=C(CH2-p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, the substituent is directly on the beta carbon.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more accurately written as CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So when the enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks, the enolate (from CH2(CO2Me)2âˆ’) would attack the beta carbon (the CH2 adjacent to the double bond, which is connected to the p-tolyl group). Wait, no, the enolate would attack the beta position of the acrylate, which is the CH2 next to the double bond.

Wait, the acrylate is CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, with C3 being the carbonyl. The beta position is C2 and C1? Wait, no. The alpha and beta positions for the acrylate would be the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl. So the carbonyl is at C3, so the alpha is C2 (CH), and the beta is C1
