Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Hmm. I think the key here is to find the fraction of the cobalt that's in the form [Co(SCN)_2]^2+. Wait, wait. Wait, I remember that the dithiocyanato complex is probably the tetrahedral one, which is blue. So, the question is asking for the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]²+ in the solution.

Stability constants. Right, the stability constant β for a complex [MLn] is given by β = [MLn]/([M][L]^n). So, each β here represents a different complex.

The complexes would be:

- Co²+ (the free ion),
- [Co(SCN)]+ (β1=9),
- [Co(SCN)₂]²+ (β2=40),
- [Co(SCN)₃]^- (β3=63),
- [Co(SCN)₄]^2- (β4=16).

Wait, no. Wait, let's think about the charges. Co²+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN⁻ is -1. So for each complex:

1. [Co(SCN)]^+ → Co²+ + SCN⁻ → charge is +1 (2 + (-1) = +1).
   So, [Co(SCN)]^+ → β1 is 9.

2. [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ → Co²+ + 2 SCN⁻ → 2+ + (-2) = 0? Wait, no, wait. Co²+ plus two SCN⁻ would make Co(SCN)₂²+? Wait, no, let me calculate. Co²+ (charge +2) plus 2 SCN⁻ (each -1) → total charge is +2 + (2*(-1)) = 0. Wait, but [Co(SCN)₂] would be neutral, but the charge for the complex is written as +2? Or maybe I'm getting the formula wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ suggests that it's a +2 charge. So that would require Co²+ plus 2 SCN⁻, but then the total charge would be +2 + 2*(-1) = 0. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the formula. Maybe each SCN is a ligand with charge -1. So, for the complex [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, the charge is +2, so Co must be in a higher oxidation state. Wait, no, wait. Wait, Co is in +2 oxidation state in all cases here.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula. Let's think again. The complex [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ would have a charge of +2. Co is +2. Each SCN⁻ is -1. So 2 SCN⁻ contribute -2. So total charge is +2 -2 = 0. Hence, the formula [Co(SCN)₂] would be neutral. So perhaps the correct formula is [Co(SCN)₂]^{0}? Or maybe I'm getting the formula wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the charge is [Co(SCN)₂]^0. Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should proceed without worrying about the exact charges and focus on the stability constants and the fractions.

So, the problem is to find the fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ among all cobalt species. Wait, but according to the β values, β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [CoSCN₂]^2+, β3 for [CoSCN₃]^-, and β4 for [CoSCN₄]^2-.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck on the exact formula, but perhaps I can proceed with the formulae as given by the β values. So each step adds another SCN⁻.

Now, the approach I think is to model the distribution of Co²+ among the different complexes and the free ion using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions.

The problem is about speciation. So, we can model the distribution of Co²+ into the different complexes as a series of equilibria:

Co²+ + SCN⁻ ↔ [Co(SCN)]^+ (β1)
[Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN⁻ ↔ [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ (β2)
[Co(SCN)₂]^2+ + SCN⁻ ↔ [Co(SCN)₃]^− (β3)
[Co(SCN)₃
