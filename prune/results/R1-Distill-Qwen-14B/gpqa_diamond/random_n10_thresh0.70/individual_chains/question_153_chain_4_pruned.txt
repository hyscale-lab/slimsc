Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about Michael additions. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves enolates attacking a beta position in a carbonyl compound. Let me try to think through each part step by step.

First, the question has three parts, A, B, and C, each a different reaction. I need to figure out the products for each and then match them with the options given.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). So, NaOEt is a strong base, which suggests it's deprotonating something to form an enolate.

Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it's a diester, right? It can form an enolate easily. The enolate would attack the beta position of the acceptor, which is the acrylate here. The methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure where the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (maybe?) but wait, let me think. The formula is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. Wait, no, wait: acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but wait, perhaps I got the substituents wrong. Let me correct that. The correct structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Wait, no, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Wait, no, wait: the acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the substituent is on the third carbon. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Oh wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but the p-tolyl group is on the CH2 group. So, the structure would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH
