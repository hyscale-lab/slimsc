Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out step by step.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, what's a stability constant again? Oh right, the stability constant (β) for a complex tells us how stable it is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form. So β is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from its ions.

So the complexes would be Co(SCN)_n^2−n, where n is the number of thiocyanate ligands attached. The stability constants given are for n=1 to 4. The β values increase up to n=3 and then drop for n=4. Interesting.

The question is about the percentage of the dithiocyanato complexes, which I think refers to the Co(SCN)_2^0 complex. Because "di" means two SCN ligands. But wait, I'm a bit confused about the charge. Co(II) has a +2 charge. Each SCN is a -1. So for two SCN, the charge would be +2 -2 = 0, so the complex is neutral. But the options might be referring to the color, like the blue one is a specific complex.

Wait, but the problem specifically says "dithiocyanato", which is two SCN per Co. So that would be Co(SCN)_2^0. So the stability constant for n=2 is β2=40.

But wait, wait, the βs are given as β1, β2, etc. So which β corresponds to which complex? Typically, the stability constant for the first ligand is the formation of the first complex, the second is the next, etc. So β1 is for Co(SCN), β2 is for Co(SCN)2, etc.

Wait, no, wait. Stability constants are usually given for each step. So for the first complex, CoSC
