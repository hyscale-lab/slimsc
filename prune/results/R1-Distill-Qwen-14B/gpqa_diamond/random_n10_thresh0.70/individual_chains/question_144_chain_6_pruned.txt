Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember from my studies that mesons are subatomic particles, and when they decay, they have something to do with their mean lifetime and decay distance. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formulas. Let me think through this step by step.

The question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance, which I think is the average distance the meson travels before decaying.

Wait, mean decay distance... Oh right! It's the product of the meson's lifetime (proper time) and its speed. So, the formula should be something like distance = v * γ * τ, where τ is the mean lifetime. But how do I find τ?

I remember that the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ. The relation is τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh wait, but I think Γ is the total decay width. So, okay, I can compute τ once I have Γ, which is given as 320 MeV. But wait, units are important here.

First, let me get all the units straight. The energy is given in GeV and MeV. I should convert everything to consistent units, probably using SI units like meters and seconds.

So, Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, because 1 GeV is 1
