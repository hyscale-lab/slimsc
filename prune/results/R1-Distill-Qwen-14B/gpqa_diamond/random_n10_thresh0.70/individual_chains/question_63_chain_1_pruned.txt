Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state. The options are A to D.

Wait, let me recall what the quantum rotation-vibration model entails. I think it's a model that considers both rotational and vibrational energy states of a molecule. So the energy levels aren't just quantized in rotation or vibration separately but a combination of both.

The molecule is X-Y, with masses 20 amu and 2 amu. The bond length is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency is given as 4e14 rad/s.

The fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So the next state would be the next higher energy level. But wait, what's the order of energy levels in this model? I remember that for a diatomic molecule, the rotational and vibrational states are quantized. The rotational energy levels are given by (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

But wait, the problem is about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, wait, I think when they say "next state", they might be referring to the first excited state, but I'm not entirely sure if it's the next rotational state, the next vibrational state, or a mix of both.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about a photon being absorbed that causes the
