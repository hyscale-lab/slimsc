Alright, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Okay, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I know that luminosity is related to a star's properties like radius and temperature. The question gives me some info: Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, but mass might not directly affect luminosity, but radius and temperature do. Wait, wait. Oh right, the mass might relate to other factors like temperature, but in this problem, the question says the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. Hmm.

Wait, the question says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that's probably related to their temperatures. Because the peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is given by Wien's Law: lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, then their temperatures must be the same. Because lambda_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So T1 = T2.

But wait, how? Because Star_1 and Star_2 have different masses and radii. Let's think. For main-sequence stars, mass and radius are correlated. More massive stars are larger and hotter. But this problem might complicate that, but maybe since their peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures are the same.

So, if T1 = T2, then what about luminosity? The luminosity of a star as a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth.

Since T is the same for both stars, L is proportional to R squared. So let's compute the ratio of their luminosities.

Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2.

So L1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴) = ( (1.5 R2)^2 * T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 * T2^4 )

But since T1 = T2, T1^4 / T2^4 = 1. So it becomes ( (1.5)^2 R2^2 ) / R2^2 ) = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

Wait, but the options don't have exactly 2.25 as the correct answer. Let me check the options:

Options:
A) ~2.25
B) ~2.32
C) ~2.35
D) ~2.23

So A is 2.25. But wait, the question says that the calculated luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor of which option. So according to this, it should be 2.25, which is option A.

But wait, the question mentions radial velocities. Oh, that's 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2. How does that tie in? Hmm, I dismissed that part earlier.

Wait, perhaps the radial velocity affects
