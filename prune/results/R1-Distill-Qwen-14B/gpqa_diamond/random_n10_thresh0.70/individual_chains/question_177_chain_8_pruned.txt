Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read through it again carefully.

Alright, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their radii and masses are both 1.5 times larger for Star_1 compared to Star_2. Interesting. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that's the peak wavelength for a black body, which I remember relates to temperature. Spectroscopy tells us that the peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature, from Wien's Law: λ_max * T = constant. So if both have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. So same peak emission, so same temperature. Got it.

Next, the radial velocities are given as 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Hmm. Radial velocity is the speed at which the star is moving towards or away from us. But how does that affect the observed luminosity? Oh wait, maybe it's about the Doppler effect. Because when a star is moving towards us, the light gets blueshifted, and moving away causes redshift. But wait, the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. So Star_1 isn't moving, but Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s. Wait, but velocity can be towards or away, so if it's positive 700, that might indicate moving away. But I'm not sure how that affects the luminosity calculation yet.

But wait, the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So I need to find L1 / L2.

Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. Oh right, because the star emits as a black body. So since both stars have the same temperature (from the same λ_max), the luminosity depends on R². But wait, let me think again.

Wait, wait. The question says to assume the stars radiate as black bodies. So L is indeed 4π R² σ T⁴, divided by (something if there's a Doppler effect? Hmm. Wait,
