Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that astronomers are studying a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Wait, dark spots on a star usually mean sunspots, right? So when the spots cover part of the surface, the observed effective temperature changes. But how does that affect the photospheric conditions?

The question then talks about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—meaning, how much bigger is the ratio when there are no spots compared to when there are spots.

Hmm, the transition between these levels is at about 1448 Å. Oh, so that's in the near-ultraviolet or maybe even far-UV range. I remember that the ionization state of atoms in stellar atmospheres depends on the temperature. Higher temperatures can ionize more atoms, so lower temperatures might mean more neutral atoms.

Wait, but in this case, the effective temperature of the photosphere is lower when there are spots. So, when the star has spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K, which is cooler than 6000 K. And the ratio of Ti level 1 to level 2 decreases. Since the ratio decreases, that means that level 1 has fewer atoms compared to level 2 when the spots are present.

Wait no, the ratio is level 1 over level 2. So when the spots are present, ratio (N1/N2) decreases. So without spots, the ratio is higher. So we need to find N1/N2 when Teff is 6000 K divided by when Teff is 5500 K.

Wait, but wait. How does temperature affect the population of energy levels? Oh right, the Boltzmann equation comes into play here. The ratio of populations in two energy levels (E1 and E2) is given by:

N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k*T))

Where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy), and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature.

So the ratio N1/N2 is the inverse: N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Wait, but wait, the question says when the star has spots, the overall Teff decreases. So the photosphere's temperature changes. But wait, the star's surface isn't just a single temperature. Spots are cooler regions. So when 40% is covered by spots, the total observed Teff is 5500 K, but the spots themselves are cooler, say maybe 5000 K or something? Because, I think, the spots are usually cooler than the surrounding photosphere.

Wait, but
