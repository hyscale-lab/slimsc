Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, I remember that the transit method relies on the planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. But what factors determine the probability of this happening?

Wait, right, the probability depends on the size of the planet compared to the star and the alignment of the orbit. But wait, I think the key here is the size of the star and the orbital distance. Oh, right! The probability is higher when the planet's orbit is such that it's more likely to cross our line of sight. The formula for the transit probability is something like (R_planet / R_star)² divided by the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, no. The probability P is approximately (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (a/(R_s))^2, but I might be mixing it up. Alternatively, I think it's proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 divided by (a/(R_s))^3, or something like that. No, wait, no, I'm getting confused. I should think about the geometry.

Transit probability is the area of the planet's disk relative to the star's disk, and also depends on the orbital distance. The formula I remember is P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s / a) )² ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think it's more like (
