Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about finding the maximum speed v_max of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic scenario. Oh right, in classical mechanics, the maximum speed in a harmonic oscillator is given by v_max = ωA, where ω is the angular frequency and A is the amplitude. But wait, this is relativistic, so I can't use the classical formulas directly. I need to consider relativistic effects.

The problem gives me that the oscillator obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. So it's the same as the classical harmonic oscillator, but with relativistic considerations. The maximum amplitude is A.

In the classical case, the angular frequency ω is sqrt(k/m). But with relativity, the mass might change due to velocity. Oh wait, in special relativity, the relativistic mass is gamma times m, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So as the object speeds up, its mass increases, which affects the motion.

Wait, but in this problem, is the mass considered as m or gamma m? Hmm, the problem states the mass is m. So perhaps we're using the rest mass, and we have to account for the relativistic effects in the equations of motion.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the relativistic form of the oscillator equation. I'm not too clear on that.

Let me think about energy. In the classical case, the potential energy at maximum displacement (x=A) is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero. As the mass moves towards equilibrium, all potential energy converts into kinetic energy. So the maximum speed occurs when all potential energy is converted. But in relativity, the total energy includes kinetic and rest mass energy.

Wait, but in relativity, the total energy is gamma*m*c². At maximum displacement, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², but wait, maybe in relativistic terms, the potential energy isn't (1/2)kx² anymore. Or is it? The problem says it obeys Hooke's law, so F = -kx, so the potential energy should still be (1/2)kx². Hmm, but for an oscillator, the potential is (1/2)kx², but when you include relativistic speeds, the energy expressions change.

Wait, another approach: For
