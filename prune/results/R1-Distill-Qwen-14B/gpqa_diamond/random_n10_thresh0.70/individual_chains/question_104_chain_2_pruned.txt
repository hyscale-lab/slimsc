Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let me think about what I know.

Alright, the question says that two stars with the same mass as our Sun have each been found to have a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. They used the RV method, so I remember that this method looks for Doppler shifts in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull.

The RV method measures the velocity of the star's movement towards and away from us. The size of this shift depends on the mass of the planet and the characteristics of its orbit. The formula I remember is something like the velocity semi-amplitude K, which relates to the planet's mass, orbital period, and the star's mass.

The planet's velocity causes a Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines. The shift is measured in milliangstroms. Planet #1 caused a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused 7. So the question is about the ratio of their orbital periods.

Wait, wait. The orbital period is how long the planet takes to orbit the star. Since both stars are the same mass, and the planets have similar masses, the main factors here would be the velocity shifts they cause. But how does the Doppler shift relate to the orbital period?

I think the Doppler shift relates to the velocity semi-amplitude K. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(2/3) )) ) ) * (1/( (1 + (M_star/M_p) ) )^(something?))

Wait, maybe I should recall the correct formula. I think the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) ) ] * ( (2Ï€) / (P) )^(1/3) ) / c

Wait, that's probably not exact. Alternatively, the formula for K is:

K = [ ( (G * M_p^3 ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 * (1 - e^2) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1) ) ] / (c * ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) )

Hmm
