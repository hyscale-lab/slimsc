Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, so the setup is about a star similar to the Sun, right? The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%—wait, what does that mean again? Oh, right, the filling factor is the fraction of the stellar surface covered by spots. So 20% of one hemisphere is covered in spots. But wait, the star is a sphere, so maybe the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, which would be 10% of the entire star's surface? Hmm, maybe I should think about that more.

The star's effective temperature is given as 6000 K, which is similar to the Sun. The spots are cooler, I assume, because they're dark. The temperature difference is 1000 K. So the spots are either 5000 K or 7000 K? Wait, no—since the star's Teff is 6000K, spots are likely cooler. So probably 6000-1000=5000K.

Now, the situation is that when you observe this star, because it's rotating, the spots come into and out of view. Since only one hemisphere is spotty, the rotational modulation in brightness should cause the star to vary in brightness periodically. The variation would look similar to when a planet transits the star, blocking some light. So the question says that this situation can closely resemble an exoplanet's effect on the star's light curve. 

But the actual question is: what's the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet needed to produce the same amplitude in the light curve? Meaning, if instead of spots, a planet transiting the star causes the same dip in brightness, what would the planet's radius be relative to the star.

So, I think this involves comparing the light blocked by the planet (which is a simple area-based calculation) versus the light blocked by the spots.

Wait, but the spots are cooler, so when they're visible, they contribute less to the star's total brightness. So when the spots rotate into view, the total brightness decreases. But how does that compare to a planet blocking the star's light?

Let me think about the star's flux without spots and with the planet. Without spots, the star's brightness is uniform. When
