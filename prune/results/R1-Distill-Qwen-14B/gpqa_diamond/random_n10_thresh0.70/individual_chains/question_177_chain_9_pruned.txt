Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about two stars and their luminosities. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step. 

The question says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So, Radius1 = 1.5 * Radius2. Also, their masses are in the same ratio; Star_1 is 1.5 times more massive. But wait, the mass might not directly affect the luminosity in this scenario since the problem is about blackbody radiation. Oh right, because for blackbody radiation, the luminosity depends on radius and temperature, not mass. So I can probably ignore the mass part unless it's a trick. 

The key point is that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh! That's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. Remember, the peak wavelength is given by Wien's Law, which is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. Since the peak wavelengths are the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because if lambda is the same, T must be same.

Wait, but wait. If Star_1 and Star_2 have the same peak wavelength, then by Wien's law, their temperatures are equal. So T1 = T2. That's an important point.

Now, the luminosity of a star (as a blackbody) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power. Since both stars have the same T, the luminosity ratio will be (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. But T1 = T2, so (T1/T2)^4 is 1. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2.

Wait, but wait another thing. Because R1 is 1.5 times R2. So (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1/L2 should be 2.25, right? So the factor is 2.25. Looking at the options, option A is ~2.25. So why are there other options like C being ~2.35 and D ~2.23?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something here. Oh! Wait, no, wait. Because in the problem statement, they mention radial velocities. Hmm. The
