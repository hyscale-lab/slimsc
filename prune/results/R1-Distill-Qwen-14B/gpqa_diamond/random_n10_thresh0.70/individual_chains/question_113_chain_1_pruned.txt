Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and see what I can deduce.

The question says that an unknown compound was prepared and characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR shows a very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹. Two other strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The NMR has peaks for vinyl hydrogens. The mass spec has a fragment at m/z 45. The options are four different formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O.

Hmm. Let me break down each piece of information and see what they imply.

Starting with FTIR. The broad peak around 3000 is probably O-H stretching. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate hydrogen bonding, which is common in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but if it's a broad peak, could it be an alcohol (like -OH) or perhaps an aromatic ring with substituents? Or maybe something else. 

The strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Those are in the range of carbonyl groups. 1700 is typical for esters, ketones, maybe aldehydes. 1650 could be conjugated carbonyl groups, like an ester or a conjugated ketone, or maybe an amide, but I don't see any info about amines here. Alternatively, maybe an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group, like a carbonyl adjacent to a benzene ring which might cause a shift.

So, two strong peaks in the carbonyl region. That suggests maybe two different types of carbonyl groups, or perhaps one strong and another weaker but still strong. Alternatively, maybe one carbonyl and another functional group, but that might not fit.

Wait, 1700 is more like an ester or ketone. 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl, perhaps an ester with conjugation, or maybe a carbonyl next to an electron-withdrawing group. Another possibility is that 1700 is an ester and 1650 is an aromatic ring's C=C stretching. Wait, no, aromatic C=C is typically around 1450-1600 cm⁻¹. So maybe 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl, like an ester group with conjugation.

So, the IR suggests that the compound might have an -OH group, possibly an ester or ketone, and another carbonyl group. Or maybe one carbonyl and something else. Wait, maybe it's two different carbonyls. Alternatively, could the 1700 be an ester and 1650 a conjugated carbonyl, perhaps part of a ring structure.

Wait, another thought: 1700 cm⁻¹ is a carbonyl, maybe from an ester. The peak at 1650 might be an aromatic C=C. But wait, aromatic C=C is usually around 1480-1600 cm⁻¹. So 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, 1650
