Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. The given data includes production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A through D with various numbers.

Hmm, I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle. The longer the lifetime, the farther it can travel before decaying. But wait, isn't the mean decay length related to the particle's velocity and lifetime?

So the formula I think is: decay length L = γ * c * τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, c is the speed of light, and τ is the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame). But wait, I need to be careful here. I might have that right.

But how do I find τ? Oh right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime by the uncertainty principle. Γ is the total decay width, and the relation is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, but units might be an issue here. Let me think about the units. ħ is in units of GeV·s, I think. So I need to convert everything properly.

Let me jot down the steps:

1. Compute the lifetime τ using τ = ħ / Γ.
2. Calculate the Lorentz factor γ using E and m.
3. Then, find the velocity β from γ and m.
4. The mean decay distance L is then γ * β * c * τ.

Wait, or is it γ * c * τ? Because lifetime is dilated by γ, so in the lab frame, the lifetime is γ τ. So the decay length is velocity (β c) multiplied by the lifetime (γ τ). So L = β γ c τ.

But let me make sure. The lifetime observed is γ τ, and the distance is velocity times time. So yes, L = β c * (γ τ).

So putting it together, L = β γ c τ.

Now let's compute each part step by step.

First, compute τ.

Γ is given as 320 MeV. Let me convert that to GeV: 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So τ = ħ / Γ.

So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s.

Calculating 6.582 / 0.32: 0.32 * 20 is 6.4, so 6.582 is a bit more. 6.582 / 0.32 = approx 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me be precise. 6.582 divided by 0.32:

6.582 / 0.32 = let's see: 0.3
