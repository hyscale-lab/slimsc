Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let's visualize that structure. It seems like there's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent attached. Specifically, one of the carbons on the cyclohexane is connected to another cyclohexyl group, a hydroxyl (OH) group, and a methyl group. Also, there's a formyl (CHO) group attached to the same carbon. Wait, no, wait—cyclohexanecarbaldehyde would have the aldehyde group on the cyclohexane. So the main structure is a cyclohexane ring where one of the CH2 groups is replaced by a CH that's attached to a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and a formyl group. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me draw it mentally: maybe it's a cyclohexane ring where one of the carbons has a substituent that's a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and an aldehyde group. Or perhaps it's a branch where the carbon is connected to cyclohexane, another cyclohexane, a hydroxymethyl, and a formyl. Wait, maybe it's more like a cyclohexane with a substituent that's a CH(OH)CH2-Cyclohexyl, and also a formyl group. No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the starting material instead.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So that's cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. The structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Or wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so it's cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡CH group attached? No, wait, ethynyl is -C≡C- group. Wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a -C≡CH substituent. So perhaps cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane attached directly to the carbon of the triple bond? Like cyclohexane-C
