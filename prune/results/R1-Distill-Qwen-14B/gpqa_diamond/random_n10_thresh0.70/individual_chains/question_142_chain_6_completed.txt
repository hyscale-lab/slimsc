Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used in quantum mechanics to describe the state of a system, including mixed states. But wait, I'm a bit rusty on the details. Let's think this through.

The question gives the density matrix ρ as (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I think this is a density matrix representation. So, what does this matrix look like? Let me write it out.

The |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix that's 1 in the top-left corner and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is 1 in the bottom-right corner. Adding those two together would give a 2x2 matrix where both diagonal elements are 1, and the off-diagonal are 0. Then, multiplying by 1/2, each diagonal element becomes 1/2. So ρ is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. That's a diagonal matrix with both diagonal entries equal to 0.5.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I remember that for qubits, the state can be represented on the Bloch sphere. But wait, this is a density matrix, so it's a mixed state or a classical probabilistic mixture of states.

The Bloch sphere typically describes pure states. For a qubit, a pure state is on the unit sphere, while mixed states are inside. So the density matrix given here is a mixed state because it's a convex combination of |0⟩ and |1⟩. Specifically, it's an equal mixture of the two basis states.

How do you represent such a mixed state on the Bloch sphere? I think the Bloch vector for a density matrix ρ is given by the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. The density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Pauli matrices: ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector and σ are the Pauli matrices.

Wait, let me write that down. The general form for a single-qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + xX + yY + zZ)/2. Here, I is the identity matrix, and X, Y, Z are the Pauli matrices. The vector r is (x, y, z).

Let me plug in the given ρ into this equation. Our ρ is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. So, 0.5 * I is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. The other terms (xX + yY + zZ) multiplied by 0.5 must sum to zero because our ρ doesn't have any off-diagonal terms or other elements beyond the diagonal.

Wait, wait. Let me compute it. The identity matrix multiplied by 0.5 is 0.5 I, which gives the diagonal as 0.5, 0.5. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when multiplied by x, it becomes [[0, x], [x, 0]]. Similarly, Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], multiplied by y gives [[0, -iy], [iy, 0]]. Z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so multiplied by z gives [[z,0],[0,-z]].

Adding all these together and dividing by 2. Wait, our equation is ρ = (I + xX + yY + zZ)/2. So let's compute each part.

I/2 is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. 

xX/2 is [[0, x/2], [x/2, 0]].
yY/2 is [[0, -iy/2], [iy/2, 0]].
zZ/2 is [[z/2, 0], [0, -z/2]].

Adding all these together:

The (1,1) element: 0.5 + z/2
The (1,2) element: x/2 - i y/2
The (2,1) element: x/2 + i y/2
The (2,2) element: 0.5 - z/2

Our given ρ is diagonal with 0.5 on the diagonal. So the (1,2) and (2,1) elements must be zero. Therefore:

x/2 - i y/2 = 0 → x = i y. But x and y are real numbers, so the only solution is x = 0 and y = 0.

So for the off-diagonal terms to be zero, x and y must be zero. Now, the diagonal terms:

(1,1) element is 0.5 = 0.5 + z/2 → 0.5 = 0.5 + z/2 → z/2 = 0 → z=0.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, looking again. The given ρ is 0.5 I, so all elements are 0.5 on the diagonal. So when I set up the equation, I have:

(1,1) element: 0.5 + z/2 = 0.5 → 0.5 + z/2 = 0.5 → z/2=0 → z=0.

Similarly, (2,2) element: 0.5 - z/2 = 0.5 → -z/2 = 0 → z=0. So z must be zero.

So the vector r is (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0).

Wait, but this is the origin. So the density matrix ρ representing the completely mixed state (maximally mixed state) is at the center of the Bloch sphere. Because the Bloch sphere has radius 1, and the origin is (0,0,0).

Looking back at the options:

A) (1,1,0) - No, that would be outside the sphere.

B) (0,0,1) - That's the north pole, which is |0⟩ state.

C) (0,0,0) - That's the center.

D) (1,1,1) - That's also outside.

So the correct answer is option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right),
\]

which simplifies to 

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & 0 \\ 0 & 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state, as it is an equal probabilistic mixture of the computational basis states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a single-qubit density matrix, the Bloch vector \(r = (x, y, z)\) is related to the density matrix by the relation:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + xX + yY + zZ \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, and \(X\), \(Y\), \(Z\) are the Pauli matrices. Expanding this, the density matrix can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2}(1 + z) & \frac{1}{2}(x - iy) \\ \frac{1}{2}(x + iy) & \frac{1}{2}(1 - z) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this with the given \(\rho = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & 0 \\ 0 & 0.5 \end{bmatrix}\), we observe:

1. The off-diagonal terms \(\frac{1}{2}(x - iy)\) and \(\frac{1}{2}(x + iy)\) must be zero. This implies \(x = 0\) and \(y = 0\).
2. The diagonal terms \(\frac{1}{2}(1 + z)\) and \(\frac{1}{2}(1 - z)\) must both equal \(0.5\). This implies \(z = 0\).

Thus, the Bloch vector is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\), which corresponds to the origin in qubit space. This represents the completely mixed state, which is at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** This is outside the Bloch sphere and incorrect.
- **B) \(r = (0, 0, 1):** This corresponds to the \(|0\rangle\) state, not the mixed state.
- **C) \(r = (0, 0, 0):** This is the origin, representing the completely mixed state. Correct.
- **D) \(r = (1, 1, 1):** This is outside the Bloch sphere and incorrect.

The correct answer is **C**.
