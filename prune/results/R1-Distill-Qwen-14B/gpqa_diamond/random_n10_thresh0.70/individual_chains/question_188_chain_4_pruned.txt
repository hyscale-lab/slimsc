Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, rhombohedral... I remember it's one of the seven crystal systems. Right, a rhombohedral crystal has all its edges equal and all angles equal too. So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. I'm supposed to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, interplanar distance. Oh right, that's the d-spacing. The formula I think I need here is the interplanar distance formula for a crystal lattice. For a general cubic system, the formula is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but wait, this is a rhombohedral system, so maybe the formula is a bit different because the angles aren't 90 degrees.

Oh right, in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance formula involves the angles. The formula is d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (h k (1 - cos α) + k l (1 - cos β) + l h (1 - cos γ)) ) )? Or was it something else? Hmm, maybe I should think about the general Miller indices formula for interplanar spacing in any crystal system.

I think the general formula for a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles α, β, γ is:

1/d² = (h²/a²)(1/sin² α) + (k²/b²)(1/sin² β) + (l²/c²)(1/sin² γ) ) + ... wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, I recall the formula for the interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system simplifies because a = b = c (since it's rhombohedral), and all angles are equal (α=β=γ=30 degrees here).

So, the formula for d_{hkl} in rhombohedral system is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk + kl + lh) cos α ), right? Or wait, is it with a factor of 1/(something)?

Wait, maybe it's better to go back to the basics. The interplanar distance formula in a crystal system uses the reciprocal of the plane's equation. For a general crystal system, the formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 /
