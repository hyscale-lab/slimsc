Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. Let me read the problem again carefully.

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.
Second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with different reagents A and B.

Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. The reagents are NaCN and A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think about what kind of reaction this is.

NaCN is a nucleophile. In ketones, nucleophilic addition typically occurs. But wait, ketones usually require some activation for nucleophilic attack. Oh, right! I remember that in the presence of an acid, like in a nucleophilic addition to a ketone, the reaction can proceed.

Wait, but wait, butanone reacting with KCN or NaCN. Oh wait, I think the reaction is the addition of CN- to the carbonyl group. So, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, it's a nucleophilic addition. But in what conditions?

I think the mechanism is that the ketone (butan-2-one) reacts with NaCN, which provides CN^- as a nucleophile. The CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming a cyanohydrin. But does this happen under acidic conditions? Because I remember that for the formation of cyanohydrin, a catalytic amount of acid is often used. So perhaps reagent A is H3O+.

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN and acid? So, in the presence of H3O+ (which is option A and B for reagent A), the CN^- would attack the carbonyl. The mechanism would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then CN^-
