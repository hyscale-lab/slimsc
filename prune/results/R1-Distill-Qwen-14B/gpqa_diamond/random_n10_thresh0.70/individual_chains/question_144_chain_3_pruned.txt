Okay, so I've got this physics problem about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it. So the question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different distances in meters.

Wait, wait. I remember that the mean decay length is related to the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like decay length L = gamma * beta * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is v/c, and tau is the proper lifetime. But first, I need to find the lifetime.

The particle's lifetime is given by the uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy (ΔE) is the width Γ, so tau is approximately hbar divided by Γ. But wait, units are important here. Let me write down the steps.

First, calculate the lifetime tau. Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So tau ≈ hbar / Gamma. The reduced Planck constant hbar is about 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) ) → that would be approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, let me compute that: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is roughly 2.056875e-24 s.

Next, I need to find the velocity of the meson. Since E_X is the total energy, which is 8 GeV, and the mass is 1.2 GeV, I can find the gamma factor. The relativistic energy is E = gamma m c^2. So gamma here is E/(m c^2), but wait, since E and m are both in GeV and c^2 is in (GeV/c² * c²) = GeV, so perhaps units will cancel correctly.

So gamma = E_X / m_X = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666... So gamma is 6.6667. Then, beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). So let's compute beta.

Gamma squared is (
