Alright, I'm going to tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Let's see, the question is about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, Ay. 

So, first, I remember that the angular momentum operators in quantum mechanics are related to the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices usually come into play when dealing with spin-1/2 particles, like electrons or muons. 

The problem states that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given by c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), where h is probably Planck's constant. The matrix S has its first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, the Pauli matrices! The Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so S must be the Pauli Y matrix. 

So Ay = (h/(4π)) * S. Now, S is the Pauli Y matrix, which for spin systems, has eigenvalues ±ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (h/(2π)). Wait, but here c is h/(4π), so let me compute what c times S would be in terms of ħ. 

Wait, ħ is h/(2π), so h = 2π ħ. So c = h/(4π) = (2π ħ)/(4π) ) = ħ/2. So c is ħ/2. Therefore, Ay becomes (ħ/2) * S. But S is the Pauli Y matrix, whose eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. Wait, no, wait. No, the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1, right? Because each Pauli matrix (X, Y, Z) has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So when you multiply by (ħ/2), then the eigenvalues of Ay would be (ħ/2) * (1) and (ħ/2) * (-1).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The Pauli Y matrix S has eigenvalues ±1. So when we multiply by c = ħ/2, the eigenvalues become (ħ/2) * 1 and (ħ/2) * (-1). So the eigenvalues of Ay are ± ħ/(2). But wait, planck's constant is h, so
