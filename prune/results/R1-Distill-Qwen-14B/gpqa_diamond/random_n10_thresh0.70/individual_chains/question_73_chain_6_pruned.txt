Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to work through this step by step.

Alright, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just simple subtraction. Oh right, I remember that you can't just say 0.6c minus 0.5c because of the way velocities add up relativistically. There's this formula for relative velocity when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light. The formula is something like (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/cÂ²), right? Because of the Lorentz factor.

So let me get that straight. If one object is moving at u and another at v, their relative speed according to the observer isn't just u - v. Oh wait, but in this case, both are moving in the same direction, so the relative speed would be the difference, but adjusted for relativity.

Wait, but wait. Let me think: if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c, from A's frame, what's B's speed? Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be (u' - v')/(1 - (
