Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed determined by its amplitude and spring constant. But this is relativistic, so I guess I need to consider how relativity affects the motion.

The problem says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. We're supposed to find the maximum speed, v_max.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed would be given by v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, right? But wait, since it's relativistic, the speed can't exceed c. So maybe the answer isn't C. Or perhaps it's modified.

I remember that in special relativity, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². It's (γ - 1)mc². Where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So maybe the energy approach is the way to go.

In a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. For the classical oscillator, the total energy E is (1/2)kA². But in relativity, does that change? Probably, because the potential energy might be different or the kinetic part is relativistic.

Wait, the potential energy in Hooke's law is (1/2)kx², which is the same in classical and relativistic contexts, maybe? Or does it change? I'm not sure. Let me think. For small oscillations, the potential is still x², so maybe the total energy is still (1/2)kA², but now the kinetic energy is relativistic.

So the total energy E would be (γ - 1)mc² plus the potential energy. Wait, but at maximum displacement (x=A), the velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), all is kinetic. So perhaps the total energy is the same in both places. So when the mass is at x=0, the kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc², which equals the total energy, which is (1/2)kA².

Wait, no, because in non-relativistic case, the total energy is (1/2)kA², but when relativistic, the kinetic energy is more than just (1/2)mv².

So let's set up the equation:

At x=0, all energy is kinetic: E = (γ - 1)mc².

At x=A, all energy is potential: E = (1/2)kA².

So, (γ - 1)mc² = (1/2)kA².

Wait, but wait. Is that correct? Or is there a mistake here? Because in the potential energy, is it (1/2)kA² in the relativistic case?

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that in the relativistic scenario, the equation of motion is modified. The harmonic oscillator equation in relativity isn't F = -kx, but maybe the force is different considering relativistic forces. But the problem states F = -kx, so maybe it's just a classical setup with relativistic energy considerations.

So, assuming that the total energy is still (1/2)kA², which is the maximum potential energy, and at the equilibrium point, all of that is converted into relativistic kinetic energy.

So, (γ - 1)mc² = (1/2)kA².

Let me write that as:

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

But γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Wait, that seems promising. Let me square both sides to get rid of the square root.

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )]^2

Take reciprocal on both sides:

(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)]^2

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1 / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2))^2 ]

Hmm, then take square root:

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c² ))^2 ) )

Wait, that doesn't match any options directly. Let me check the options:

Option D is v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c² ))^2 )). Yes, that's what I have here.

Wait, no, actually, in my equation, I have 1/(1 + ... ) squared. Let me check again.

Wait, in my equation, the denominator is [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²)] squared. So 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²) is a term, and I have 1 over that squared.

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/( [1 + (kA²/(2 m c²))]^2 ) )

Which can be rewritten as:

v = c * sqrt( [ (1 + (kA²/(2 m c²)))^2 -1 ] / (1 + (kA²/(2 m c²)))^2 ) )

Wait, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the term can be simplified. Let me compute the expression inside the square root.

1 - 1/(1 + a)^2, where a = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Expanding the denominator:

(1 + a)^2 = 1 + 2a + a²

So,

1 - 1/(1 + 2a + a²) = [ (1 + 2a + a²) - 1 ]/(1 + 2a + a²) ) = (2a + a²)/(1 + 2a + a² )

Factor numerator and denominator:

= a (2 + a) / (1 + a)^2 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( [a (2 + a)] / (1 +a )^2 )

= c * sqrt( a (2 +a) ) / (1 +a )

But a is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Let me plug that in:

a = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

sqrt( a (2 +a) ) = sqrt( (k A²/(2 m c² )) * ( 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )) )

= sqrt( (k A²/(2 m c² )) * [ (4 m c² + k A² )/(2 m c² ) ) ] )

= sqrt( (k A² (4 m c² + k A² )) / (4 m² c^4) ) )

Hmm, this is getting messy. Maybe there's a better approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the options. Let's see:

Option A: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - kA²/(2m))^2 )

Wait, that denominator term is (1 - kA²/(2m)).

But in our case, the denominator in the expression was (1 + (kA²)/(2 m c^2 ))^2.

So perhaps that's not matching.

Option B: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - kA²/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, no. Let me see:

Option B is sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2 m c² )) )

Wait, in our case, the expression inside was 1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation.

Wait, let's go back. At x=0, the kinetic energy is (γ -1) mc², which equals the potential energy (1/2) k A².

Wait, but is the potential energy (1/2)k A²? Because in relativistic cases, the potential energy might be considered differently. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum potential energy is (1/2)kA², as in the classical case.

Alternatively, perhaps in the relativistic case, the total mechanical energy is the sum of relativistic kinetic and potential energy, which is (γ -1) mc² + (1/2)k x².

At maximum amplitude, x=A, velocity is zero, so the total energy is (1/2)k A².

At x=0, the total energy is (γ -1) mc² = (1/2)k A².

So,

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Which is correct. So,

γ = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c² )

But γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c² ) as a term, say b. So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1 + b.

So,

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1/(1 + b )

Then,

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/(1 + b )^2

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + b )^2

= [ (1 + b )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + b )^2

Expand numerator:

(1 + 2b + b² - 1 ) / (1 +b )^2 = (2b + b²)/(1 + b )^2

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2b + b² ) / (1 + b )^2 )

= c * sqrt( b (2 + b) ) / (1 + b )

But since b is (k A²)/(2 m c² ), let's plug that in:

= c * sqrt( [ (k A²)/(2 m c² ) ] * [ 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ] ) / ( 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ) )

Hmm, maybe this is a dead end. Alternatively, perhaps I should manipulate the equation I have for v.

Wait, another approach: we have from earlier,

v = c * sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 ] )

Let me compute 1 - [1/(... )^2 ]:

= [ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 - 1 ] / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

The numerator is [ 1 + 2*(k A²)/(2 m c² ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4 ) - 1 ]

Which simplifies to (k A²)/(m c² ) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )

So the numerator is [ (k A² m c^2 )/(m c^2 ) ) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4 ) * m^2 c^4 ) ] Wait, maybe I should factor it.

Wait, perhaps I can factor the numerator:

(k A² m c² )/(m c² ) ) is not correct. Let me compute it properly.

Wait, the numerator is:

(k A²)/(m c² ) * ( m c² ) ) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4 ) * (4 m² c^4 )

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Alternatively, factor out (k A²)/(2 m c² ):

= (k A²)/(2 m c² ) [ 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ) ]

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A²)/(2 m c² ) (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )) ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

= c * sqrt( [ (k A²)/(2 m c² ) (2 + a) ] / (1 + a )^2 ), where a is (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

= c * sqrt( [ a (2 + a ) ] / (1 +a )^2 )

= c * sqrt( [ a (2 +a ) ] ) / (1 + a )

But I'm not sure if this leads me anywhere. Let me look at the options again.

Option D is:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Wait, no. Option D is written as sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c² )) ) squared.

Wait, let me look again.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Wait, the denominator inside is (1 + (kA²/(2 m c^2 )) ) squared.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 ] )

Which is exactly what I have. So the square root of [1 - 1/(1 + a )^2 ], where a is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So the expression inside the square root is [ ( (1 + a )^2 -1 ) / (1 + a )^2 ].

Which simplifies to [ (1 + 2a + a^2 - 1 ) ] / (1 +a )^2 = (2a + a^2)/(1 +a )^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2a + a^2) / (1 +a )^2 ) = c * [ sqrt( a (2 + a ) ) ] / (1 + a )

But none of the options present it like that. So looking back at the options, option D is the one that matches the initial expression I had.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the expression in terms of 1/(1 + ... ), but I think option D is correct.

Wait, another approach. Let me compute for a very small kA², so that the term (kA²/(2 m c^2 )) is much less than 1.

In that case, the non-relativistic limit should apply. So, maximum speed should approach sqrt( (k A^2) / m )

But let's see what each option gives in that limit.

Option C: v_max = sqrt( kA²/m ), which is correct for non-relativistic case. But in reality, for relativistic speeds, the maximum speed can't exceed c. So when kA² is large, the speed approaches c.

But in the non-relativistic limit, when (kA²/(2 m c² )) is small, let's expand the expression in option D:

v = c * sqrt( [1 - 1/(1 + a )^2 ] ), where a is small.

So,

1/(1 + a )^2 ≈ 1 - 2a + 3a^2 - ... ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to take a as small, so:

1/(1 + a )^2 ≈ 1 - 2a.

So,

1 - 1/(1 + a )^2 ≈ 1 - [1 - 2a ] = 2a = 2*(k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) = (k A^2)/(m c² )

So,

v ≈ c * sqrt( (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) ) ) = c * ( sqrt( k A^2/(m c^2 ) ) )

= c * ( sqrt( (k A²)/(m c²) )) ) = (c) * ( sqrt(k A² )/(c sqrt(m)) )) )

= sqrt(k A²/(m )) )

Which is option C. So in the non-rel limit, option D gives the same as option C, which is correct.

But what happens when (kA²/(2 m c^2 )) is large? Let me see. Suppose (k A²/(2 m c^2 )) → ∞, which would imply that the term (1 + a ) is dominated by a, so (1 +a ) ≈ a.

So,

v_max ≈ c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(a^2 ) )

Wait, 1/(a^2 ) is very small, so 1 - 1/(a^2 ) ≈1.

So v_max ≈ c, which makes sense because when the energy is so large, the speed approaches c.

Alternatively, when a is large, the expression for v_max approaches c, which is correct.

So option D seems to have the correct behavior in both limits.

Looking back at the options:

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Let me check the option D again.

Option D says:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c² )) )^2 )

Wait, that's 1 + (kA²/(2 m c² )) ) squared in the denominator.

Wait, so the expression is:

1 - [1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c² )) )^2 ]

Which is the same as:

( (1 + (kA²/(2 m c² )) )^2 - 1 ) / (1 + (kA²/(2 m c² )) )^2 )

Expanding the numerator:

= [1 + 2*(kA²/(2 m c² )) + (kA²/(2 m c² ))^2 - 1 ] 

= [ 2*(kA²/(2 m c² )) + (kA²/(2 m c² ))^2 ]

= [ (kA²)/(m c² ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4 ) ]

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (kA²/(m c² ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )) ] / (1 + kA²/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, another approach: express the denominator (1 + a )^2, where a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

Denominator is (1 + a )^2 = 1 + 2a + a^2.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (2a + a^2) / (1 + 2a + a^2) )

I can factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: a(2 + a )

Denominator: (1 + a )^2

Wait, but a is (k A^2 )/( 2 m c^2 ), so maybe this can be written as:

v = c * sqrt( a (2 + a ) / (1 + a )^2 )

= c * sqrt( a (2 + a) ) / (1 + a )

But I'm not sure. Let me see if any of the options can be simplified to this.

Wait, option D is sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + a )^2 ), which is the same as what I have. So I think option D is correct.

Wait, but looking back, another thought: in the equation E = (γ -1 ) mc² = (1/2) k A².

So,

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Which is correct. Let me write that as γ = 1 + (k A² )/(2 m c² )

Then,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1 + (k A² )/(2 m c² )

Let me denote (k A² )/(2 m c² ) as b.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1 + b.

Squaring both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c² ) = (1 + b )²

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + b )²

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + b )^2

Which is the same as:

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + b )^2 )

Where b = (k A² )/(2 m c² )

Which is exactly option D when you plug in the value of b.

Yes, so option D is correct.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the relativistic energy considerations.

In this problem, the total energy of the oscillator is the sum of relativistic kinetic energy and potential energy. At maximum displacement \( x = A \), all the energy is potential, given by \( E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). At \( x = 0 \), all the energy is relativistic kinetic energy, which is expressed as \( E = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

Equating the total energy at \( x = 0 \) and \( x = A \), we have:

\[
(\gamma - 1)mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( \gamma \), we find:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2.
\]

Taking the reciprocal:

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches the form of option D. To confirm, we analyze the limits:

1. **Non-relativistic limit**: When \( \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \) is small, the expression simplifies to \( v_{\text{max}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}} \), consistent with the classical result.
2. **Relativistic limit**: When \( \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \) is large, the speed approaches \( c \), as expected.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
