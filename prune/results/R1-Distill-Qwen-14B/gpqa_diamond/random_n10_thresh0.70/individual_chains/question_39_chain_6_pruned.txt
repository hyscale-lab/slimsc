Okay, let's try to figure out this quantum mechanics problem. So, we have a bunch of identical particles, each moving in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm. Wait, but wave functions are usually expressed as complex numbers, right? So the real part is (a / sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. Oh wait, no—wait, the wave function is written as (a / sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So it's a complex function: real part a/(sqrt(1+x)), and imaginary part -0.5.

But wait, the wave function probably should satisfy the normalization condition. Because in quantum mechanics, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function should equal 1. So I think I need to compute the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3, and set it equal to 1.

Wait, but the problem says that when measuring the position, none were found outside x=1 and x=3, which implies that the wave function is zero outside that region. So, the wave function is defined as given only between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. So the normalization integral is from x=1 to x=3.

But wait, let me think about the given wave function again. It's (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the square of the absolute value is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. Because |ψ|^2 is (real
