Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the different complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think is the [Co(SCN)_2]²+ complex, but wait, wait. Wait, the blue dithiocyanato would be the tetra? Or maybe the di? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me recall: I think the blue color comes from the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex. Oh wait, no, wait. I remember that the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is blue, but wait, in the problem, the question is about the dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato means two SCN ligands. So that would be [Co(SCN)_2]^n+. But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the structures here. Let me think.

Wait, the stability constants are given as β1 through β4. So maybe each β corresponds to the complex with a certain number of SCN- ligands. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, perhaps? Because each step adds a SCN ligand. So the first complex would be [CoSCN]^+, with β1=9. Then the second is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β2=40, and so on.

So the problem is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Wait, but what's the dithiocyanato part? Dithiocyanato implies two SCN ligands. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is the species with two SCN attached. So the question is, what's the percentage of this species among all cobalt species.

Wait, but the blue color is associated with [Co(SCN)_4
