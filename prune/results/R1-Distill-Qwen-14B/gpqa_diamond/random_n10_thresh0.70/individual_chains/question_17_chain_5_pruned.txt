Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me read the question again.

The question says: It's a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions.

Hmm, right. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like Ca²+ pretty tightly. The Ca-EDTA complex is formed, and the problem gives the formation constant, which I think is Kf. 

Wait, what's the formation constant again? Oh right, the formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex ion from the metal ion and EDTA. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. 

I think the formation constant Kf is given, and since it's a large number (5x10^10), the complex is very stable. That means most of the EDTA is bound to Ca²+.

But wait, the question is about the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. So because the complex is so stable, the concentration of free Ca²+ should be really low.

The initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Let me think about how to model this. 

So, the solution has [CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 M. The complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- according to the reaction:

CaEDTA^2− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4− 

The formation constant Kf would be [Ca²+][EDTA^4−]/[CaEDTA^2−]. So Kf = ( [Ca²+] [EDTA^4−] ) / [CaEDTA^2−] 

But wait, isn't Kf the inverse of the dissociation constant Kd? Because Kd is the constant for the dissociation of the complex into metal and ligand. Oh right, so Kd = 1/Kf. 

So, Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA^4−] / [CaEDTA^2−] = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

But
