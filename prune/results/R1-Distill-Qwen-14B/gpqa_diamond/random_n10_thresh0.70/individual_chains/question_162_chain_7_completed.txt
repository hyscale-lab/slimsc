Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a line element in two dimensions, so maybe it's a 2D space described by this metric. Or could it be part of a higher-dimensional space? Hmm, not sure yet.

I remember that a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. The metric must be representing such a space. Wait, the metric seems similar to the Poincaré disk model. In the Poincaré disk, the metric is usually something like ds² = [2/(1 + r²)]² (dx² + dy²), where r is the radial coordinate in the disk. But wait, in this case, the denominator is 4 - x² - y². Oh, 4 is (2)^2, so maybe this is scaled differently.

Wait, the standard Poincaré disk for hyperbolic space has a curvature, which relates to the radius. The area of a pseudosphere, which I think is the entire hyperbolic plane, but perhaps they're talking about a specific radius. Wait, the question refers to a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, but in the metric, the denominator is 4 - x² - y², which is 4 when x and y are zero. Maybe it's scaled so the curvature corresponds to a radius of 2.

Wait, the area of a pseudosphere in hyperbolic geometry. Oh, wait, I remember that the area of a hyperbolic plane is infinite. Because as you go to infinity, the area just keeps increasing. So if this metric represents a hyperbolic plane, then the total area would be infinite. But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius 2. Wait, isn't a pseudosphere (like a tractricoid) a finite surface? Or maybe I'm getting confused between different models.

Wait, no. Wait, the pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, but it's a finite surface. It's like a horn torus but with negative curvature. So maybe the area is finite. But I'm not so sure.

Wait, let's think about the metric again. The line element is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So in polar coordinates, x² + y² = r², so the metric becomes ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). Hmm, because in polar coordinates, dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ².

So this is a 2D metric, with coordinates (r, θ), I think. The denominator is (4 - r²), so this is valid only when r² <4, meaning r<2. So the domain is a disk of radius 2. Wait, but the Poincaré disk model has a similar setup, right? So this is a model of hyperbolic space with radius 2, because the domain is up to r=2.

In hyperbolic geometry, the area of the entire space is infinite. So if this metric represents the entire hyperbolic plane, then the area would be infinite. But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh, wait, a pseudosphere is a finite surface. So perhaps I'm getting confused between the Poincaré disk (which models an infinite hyperbolic plane) and a pseudosphere, which is a finite surface.

So the question is, what's the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. Wait, the pseudosphere is a surface of revolution of a tractrix. Its area is finite. But wait, how does that relate to the given metric?

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is for a hyperbolic space, and the question is about the area of the entire space. If so, the area would be infinite. Looking at the options, option D is +infty.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is for a pseudosphere, and the area is finite. But then I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's think in terms of the metric provided. The line element is given as ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let's compute the area of the space described by this metric.

In 2D, the area element is sqrt(g) dr dθ, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric tensor here is diagonal, so the determinant is (32/(4 - r²)) * (32/(4 - r²))? Wait, no. Wait, in 2D, the metric is:

ds² = g_rr dr² + g_θθ dθ².

In this case, g_rr = 32/(4 - r²), and g_θθ = same, because (dx² + dy²) becomes dr² + r² dθ², so the coefficient for dr² is 32/(4 - r²), and for dθ² is 32 r²/(4 - r²).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, let me write the metric correctly. The original metric is:

ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²).

Expressed in polar coordinates, it becomes:

ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²).

So the metric tensor components are:

g_{rr} = 32/(4 - r²),
g_{θθ} = [32 r²]/(4 - r²),
and the cross terms are zero.

The determinant of the metric is g_{rr} * g_{θθ} = [32/(4 - r²)] * [32 r²/(4 - r²)] = (32)^2 r² / (4 - r²)^2.

So the area element is sqrt(det g) dr dθ = [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Wait, because sqrt( (32/(4-r²)) * (32 r²/(4-r²)) ) ) = sqrt( (32^2 r²)/(4-r²)^2 ) = 32 r/(4 - r²).

So the area is the integral over r from 0 to 2 (since r < 2), and θ from 0 to 2π.

So the area A is ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) dθ.

The θ integral is 2π, so A = 2π ∫ (0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute the integral ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr. Let me make substitution u = 4 - r². Then du = -2r dr. So r dr = -du/2.

So the integral becomes 32 ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) = 32 ∫ (-du/2)/u = -16 ∫ (1/u) du = -16 ln|u| + C.

So evaluating from r=0 to 2:

At r=2, u=4 -4=0. At r=0, u=4.

Wait, wait, when r approaches 2, u approaches 0. So when r=0, u=4.

So the integral from 0 to 2 is from u=4 to u=0. So:

-16 [ln(u) ] from 4 to 0 → -16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so the integral is -16 [ (-infty) - ln(4) ] → -16*(-infty) → positive infinity.

So the integral ∫ (0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr diverges to infinity.

Thus, the area A is 2π * infinity = infinity.

So the area is infinite. So the answer should be D) +infty.

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere of radius 2. Oh, wait, the metric describes a hyperbolic plane with radius 2, which has infinite area. So the pseudosphere in this context is the entire hyperbolic plane, so the area is infinite.

Alternatively, if the pseudosphere refers to a finite surface, like the tractrix surface of revolution, then perhaps the area is finite. But I think that's not the case here. The given metric seems to represent an infinite area because the integral diverges.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This describes a 2D space with coordinates \((x, y)\). In polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\), where \(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\), the metric becomes:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right).
\]

The determinant of the metric tensor is:

\[
\text{det}(g) = g_{rr} \cdot g_{\theta\theta} = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2} = \frac{32^2 r^2}{(4 - r^2)^2}.
\]

The area element is:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\text{det}(g)} \, dr \, d\theta = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

To compute the total area, we integrate over the domain of the metric. Since the denominator \(4 - r^2\) becomes zero at \(r = 2\), the domain is \(0 \leq r < 2\) and \(0 \leq \theta < 2\pi\). The total area is:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral over \(\theta\) is:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

The radial integral is:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -16 \int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{1}{u} \, du = -16 \left[\ln|u|\right]_{4}^{0}.
\]

As \(u \to 0\), \(\ln|u| \to -\infty\), so the integral diverges to \(+\infty\). Thus, the total area is:

\[
A = 2\pi \cdot (+\infty) = +\infty.
\]

This indicates that the space described by the metric has infinite area. Since the metric represents a hyperbolic plane, the total area is indeed infinite. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is infinite.
