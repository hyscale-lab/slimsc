Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. The setup is that Ay is a 2x2 matrix operator, and it's given as c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So, I think S is a matrix representing something like the Pauli matrices, maybe the y-component.

Wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices (like sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z) are 2x2 and used in quantum mechanics for spin operators. Oh right, sigma_y would be [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So yes, S here is sigma_y.

The operator Ay is c * sigma_y. So c is h/(4π), right? Hmm.

The problem asks which statement about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay is correct. There are four options, A to D.

Let me think about the process. To find eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue.

Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, let's write it out. Let's compute c * S. So S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so multiplying by c, we get:

Ay = c * S
