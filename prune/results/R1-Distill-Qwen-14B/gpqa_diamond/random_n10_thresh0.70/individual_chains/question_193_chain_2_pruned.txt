Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, based on the given relationship. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star caused by the Earth's movement around the Sun. Oh right, the formula is that distance (in parsecs) is 1 divided by the parallax (in arcseconds), so d = 1/plx.

Wait, the problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. I need to find how N changes with distance. Since I know d =1/plx, maybe I can express plx in terms of d. Let's see, plx = 1/d. So substituting that into the equation, N ∝ 1/( (1/d)^5 ) = d^5.

Wait wait, that would make N proportional to d^5. But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So per unit distance, how does the number of stars change. Oh, I think I need to find the derivative of N with respect to d. Let me think about that.

So if N ∝ d^5, then dN/dr would be proportional to 5d^4. But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Because the question might be asking about the number of stars in a region as a function of distance, not the rate of change. Wait no, the question says "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of
