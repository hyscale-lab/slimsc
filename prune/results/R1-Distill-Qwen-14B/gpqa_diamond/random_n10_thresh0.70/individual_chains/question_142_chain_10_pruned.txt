Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the density matrix of a qubit. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through.

The question gives the density matrix rho as (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, including pure states and mixed states. So first, I should figure out if this rho represents a pure state or a mixed state.

Wait, a pure state is a density matrix like |ψ><ψ|, which has trace 1 and rank 1. If I have |0><0|, that's a pure state. Similarly for |1><1|. But here, rho is a sum of two projectors each multiplied by 1/2. So it's a mixture of |0> and |1>, each with equal probability. Therefore, rho represents a mixed state because it's a statistical mixture of two orthogonal pure states.

Now the question is about its geometrical position in the qubits space. I'm not exactly sure what that refers to, but I think it's about the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Pure states are on the surface of the sphere, while mixed states are inside.

The Bloch vector for a qubit density matrix rho is given by r = (x, y, z), where each component corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. The general form of rho is:

rho = (I + r·σ)/2,

where σ are the Pauli matrices and I is the identity matrix.

So let me compute the components
