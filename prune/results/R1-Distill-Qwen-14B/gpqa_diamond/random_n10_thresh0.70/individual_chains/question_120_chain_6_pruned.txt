Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax value. Hmm, let me think. I remember that parallax is related to distance, right? Oh wait, yes, the parallax in arcseconds (pl) is inversely proportional to the distance in parsecs. So, pl = 1/d, where d is the distance. That means if a star is closer, it has a larger parallax, and farther stars have smaller parallax.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So, the number density of stars doesn't depend on distance. Wait, no, uniform distribution might mean that the number per unit volume is the same everywhere. So, the number of stars in a certain volume should be proportional to the volume.

Wait, let's get into more details. The number of stars per unit volume (n) is a constant. So, to find the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr, it would be n * 4πd² dr, since the volume of a thin shell is 4πd² dr.

But parallax pl is 1/d, so d = 1/pl. So, substituting d, let's express everything in terms of pl. Let me see, dr is the change in distance, so when pl changes by d(pl), how does that relate? Let's think about differentials. Since pl = 1/d, then d(pl) = -1/d² dd. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Maybe it's better to express everything in terms of pl.

So, the volume element in terms of
