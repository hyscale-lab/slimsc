Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these two reactions. Let me break it down step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is between 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (in the presence of H2O) to produce 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. I need to choose the correct options from A to D.

Hmm. Let me think about what's happening in each reaction.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN. I remember that in such cases, nitriles can be formed from ketones via substitution. Wait, what's the typical reagent for that? Oh right, the formation of a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrins are formed when a nitrile (like CN-) attacks a carbonyl group. But wait, the reaction conditions are important here. I think the reaction usually involves an acid catalyst because the carbonyl is electrophilic, and the acid protonates it, making it more reactive. Also, the nitrile ion (CN-) would attack the carbonyl carbon. But NaCN is a source of CN- ions, but it's usually in a solution where the nitrile is acting as a nucleophile. So, could it be that the reaction is a nucleophilic addition to the ketone, forming a cyanohydrin?

Wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone, so when it reacts with a nitrile under acidic conditions, it forms a cyanohydrin. So the product would have both an alcohol (from the OH) and a nitrile group attached to the same carbon. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which makes sense.

So the reagent A would be something that provides the acidic conditions. Since NaCN is a weak base, maybe it's not enough. So adding an acid like H3O+ (which is option A and B) would help. Alternatively, maybe another acid like H2SO4 or something else. Wait, looking at the options, the choices for A are either H3O+ or NaHSO3. Oh, wait, NaHSO3 is
