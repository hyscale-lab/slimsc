Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about calculating the minimum energy of a system of charges. Let's see what the problem says.

Alright, so there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. But wait, the problem says they have negligible mass. Hmm, not sure if that's important yet.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. So, point P is where the 13th charge is, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So, the setup is like a central charge with 12 others arranged in a sphere around it, each at radius 2 meters.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy of the system. So I think I need to calculate the electrostatic potential energy of this configuration. Because potential energy in electrostatics is due to the arrangement of charges, and for a system of charges, it's the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

But wait, the system is isolated, so I don't have to worry about any external fields, just the interactions between the charges themselves.

So the formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, which is approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². And the elementary charge e is about 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs.

Each charge here is 2e, so each has a charge of 2 * 1.602e-19 C. Let me calculate that: 3.204e-19 C each.

Now, the system has 13 charges. The 13th is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away. So, I need to calculate the potential energy of all the pairs of charges.

Wait, but in a system of multiple charges, the potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair, but each pair is counted once. So the total potential energy U_total is (1/2) * sum over all pairs of U_ij.

Wait, but when a charge is fixed, like the 13th charge at P, how does that affect the calculation?

Wait, actually, the 13th charge is fixed, so when considering the potential energy due to the other charges, perhaps it's only the interactions between the 12 charges and the fixed charge that contribute. Wait, but no, because the 12 charges are all identical and placed symmetrically, so they might also interact with each other.

Wait, wait, no. The problem states that the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2 m from P. So each of the 12 charges is 2 m from P, and their positions are all at a distance of 2 m from P. But are they placed in a sphere around P? I think so, yes. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from P, but what about their distances from each other?

Hmm, that's a good point. The distance between any two of the
