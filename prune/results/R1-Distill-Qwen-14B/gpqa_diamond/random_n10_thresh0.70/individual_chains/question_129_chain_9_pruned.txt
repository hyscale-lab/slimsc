Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because reaction mechanisms can be tricky. Let's take it step by step. The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are multiple steps, and I need to figure out each one to get to E.

First, let me read the problem again carefully. 

The reaction steps are:
1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are some hints:
a) Compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) The IR of A has a peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are A-D, each a cyclic ketone.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.

Starting with compound A. Reacting with HCN gives B. HCN usually adds to carbonyl groups to form cyanohydrins. So if A is a ketone, then B would be a cyanohydrin, introducing an OH and a CN group.

But wait, the IR of A shows a peak around 1750 cm^-1, which is typical for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So A is likely a cyclic ketone.

Next, B is treated with H2 and Pd. Reduction of a cyanohydrinâ€”what happens here? Cyanohydrins have a structure like R2C(OH)CN. Reducing this might involve hydrogenation. Wait, H2 with Pd is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So maybe the CN group is being reduced. CN is a nitrile, which upon hydrogenation becomes an amine? Wait, no, H2 and Pd would probably reduce nitriles to amines, but wait, more accurately, nitriles can be hydrogenated to primary amines. Alternatively, maybe the ketone in A is involved.

Wait, let me think again. Compound B is A reacted with HCN. So if A is a ketone, B is a cyanohydrin. Then
