Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, or 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, each with a different power of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. The formula I think is plx = 1/distance in parsecs. So as distance increases, parallax decreases. So if the number of stars varies with 1/plx^5, that would mean the number N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5.

Wait, let me think about how parallax and distance are connected. Oh right, the formula is plx (in arcseconds) equals 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So plx is inversely proportional to d. That means as d increases, plx decreases.

The problem says N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Let's write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, we get N ∝ (d)^5. Because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5. Wait, because (1/(1/d)) is d, so (1/(1/d)^5) is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. So, I think that's the number per unit distance, which would be the derivative of N with respect to r (distance). Because if N is proportional to d^5, then the change in N with d would be dN/dd = 5d^4. But wait, wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, the number of stars in a region varies with 1/plx^5. So, N = k * (1/(plx)^5), where k is a constant. Since plx = 1/d, substituting that in, N = k * (d)^5. So N increases as d^5.

But the question isn't about N itself, but how the number changes with distance per unit range. Oh, I think that refers to the differential number, like the number of
