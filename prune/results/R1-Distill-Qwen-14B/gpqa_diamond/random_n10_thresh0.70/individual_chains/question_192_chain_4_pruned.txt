Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, the setup is: there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity.

The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and both l and L are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are four different expressions for E, each involving these variables and constants. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm. I remember that conductors have some properties regarding electric fields and charges. Since the conductor is uncharged initially, but then a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, I think this will induce charges on the conductor's inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, right. When you place a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge opposite to q, and the outer surface will have an induced charge equal in magnitude to q, because the conductor was initially neutral. Or wait, wait, the conductor is uncharged, so the sum of all charges on it must be zero. So, the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface must have +q to balance it out because the conductor itself was neutral. Or wait, no, the conductor starts uncharged, so the total charge on the conductor must be zero. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q because the net charge on the conductor is zero.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The conductor is neutral, so the total charge on it is zero. When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's surface) must have an induced charge of -q to cancel the field inside the conductor material. Then, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to make the total conductor's charge zero (since the inner is -q). Because the conductor as a whole is neutral, the sum of inner and outer must be zero: (-q) + (+q) = 0. So yes, that makes sense. So the outer surface has a charge of +q.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor (since L > R). So, when you're outside a conductor, the electric field is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. That's the shell theorem, right? So the outer surface's charge +q will produce an electric field at P as if it's a point charge located at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but the charge in the cavity is +q, but the conductor's outer surface is also +q? So, the net charge outside is +q, so the field at P would be like that of a point charge +q at the center of the conductor.

But wait, the conductor's outer surface is at radius R, and the point P is outside, so using the formula for a point charge, E = (1/(4πε₀)) *
