Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of a planet transiting depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance.

The question gives me two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, which is detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. But their orbital periods are different: Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh wait, orbital period is related to the distance from the star. Shorter period means closer orbit, right? So Planet_1 is orbiting closer to its star.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Interesting. So even though Planet_1's star is more massive, it's not larger in radius. That must mean it's more dense, perhaps a main-sequence star where higher mass isn't necessarily leading to a larger radius? Or maybe Planet_2's star is slightly evolved, which the question mentions. Like a subgiant or something, which would expand a bit but in this case, they have the same radius. Hmm.

Wait, the probability of a planet transiting depends on the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. The formula for the probability (P) that a planet transits is roughly (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. But since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it can be approximated as R_star / a. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formula. I think the transit probability is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. So P â‰ˆ (R*/a) / (1 + (M_p/M*))^(1/3) )? Wait, no, the RV method gives the minimum mass, but that's a different factor.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The transit probability is given by P = (R*/a) / (1 + (M_p/M_* )^(1/3)) ). Or is it (R*/a) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 + (M_p/M_* )^(1/3)) )) ? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should look for a simpler approach.

Wait, another formula I remember is that the probability is approximately (R*/a) divided by (1 + (M_p/(M_* + M_p))^(1/3)), but since M_p is much smaller than M_*, it can be approximated as (R*/a) / (1 + (M_p/M_*)^(1/3)) ). But I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe the probability is just (R*/a) times some function of the orbital inclination. But since both planets are already detected via RV, I think that implies that their orbital inclinations are such that their RV method gives a minimum mass. But for the transit, the inclination needs to be very close to 90 degrees for the planet to transit.

Wait, but the RV method gives the minimum mass because it only measures the velocity along our line of sight. So the actual mass is M sin i, where i is the inclination angle. If they've already detected the planets via RV, that means that their sin i is non-zero, but we don't know exactly what i is. But when calculating the transit probability, we're looking for the probability that i is exactly 90 degrees, so that the planet transits, given that it's already in a plane that allows RV detection.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating things. Let's try to approach this step by step.

The probability that a planet transits is given by:

P = (R*/a) * (1 / e) / ( (1 + e)^(1/2) ) )

Wait, but the orbits are circular (e=0), so that simplifies things. So for circular orbits, the probability becomes P = (R*/a) / (1 + (M_p / M_*)^(1/3)) ), but wait, that might not be right. Alternatively, I think the transit probability for a circular orbit is simply (R
