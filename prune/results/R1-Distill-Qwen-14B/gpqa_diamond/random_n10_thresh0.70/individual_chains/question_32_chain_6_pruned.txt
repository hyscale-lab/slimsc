Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and figuring out the energy needed for a nucleus to reach a certain speed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it step by step.

The question says the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li-6 maybe? Because Li normally has 3 protons and 3 neutrons makes Li-6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion. Oh wait, but wait, sometimes isotopes are referred to with their mass numbers. So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, yeah.

So the problem is about finding the energy of the RHIC so that the nucleus X moves at 0.96c. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle depends on its gamma factor. The total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy. But wait, since it's a nucleus, which is a heavy ion, we can consider it as a non-lepton, so perhaps we only need to calculate it using relativistic mechanics.

First, I think I need to find the energy of the ion. The formula for total energy is E = gamma * m0 * cÂ², where m0 is the rest mass. But wait, the problem is about the kinetic energy or the total energy? Hmm, the question says "the energy of the RHIC", which I believe refers to the kinetic energy imparted to the ion. Because in colliders, the energy given is usually the kinetic
