Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, so let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. Breaking it down, the degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is halogens, which are zero here. So, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1.

So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That's probably a combination of rings and double bonds. Maybe one ring (like benzene) and some double bonds or other rings.

The NMR data is given:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H) – that's a triplet, probably an aldehyde proton since aldehydes are high, around 9-10 ppm. But wait, sometimes aromatic protons can be in that region too, but it's a triplet, so maybe an aldehyde adjacent to something else, like a CH2 group.

6.98 (d, 2H) – doublet, so two protons with similar neighboring. Maybe part of a para-substituted aromatic ring.

6.51 (d, 2H) – another doublet, perhaps another aromatic ring substituent, maybe meta or ortho?

Wait, let's think. If the aromatic regions are two doublets, each integrating to 2H, maybe it's a para-substituted ring with two different substituents. Or maybe each is part of a coupling between two rings.

Wait, but also there's 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H) – broad singlet, maybe two aromatic protons, but broad suggests maybe they're near an exchangeable proton, like OH. Oh wait, but in the NMR, that's a singlet. Hmm, or maybe they're in a different environment, like a conjugated system.

Then 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) – a doublet for two protons, probably adjacent to something. Maybe a CH2 group next to an electron-withdrawing group, like an oxygen. Could be part of an ether or an est
