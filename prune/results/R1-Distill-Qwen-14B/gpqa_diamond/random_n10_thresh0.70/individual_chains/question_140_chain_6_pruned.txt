Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, but I'm a bit confused. Let me read through it again and see if I can break it down step by step.

The question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y, producing a gas W, a precipitate G, and another product B when heated. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, let's start by trying to figure out what each of these substances might be. Substance X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its elements. That suggests it's maybe a diatomic molecule with a substituted isotope. Wait, could X be something like H2O where one hydrogen is replaced by deuterium? Or maybe something else?

The reaction with liquid Y releases gas W, which has the same number of neutrons and protons in its molecule. Oh wait, same number of neutrons and protonsâ€”so that would make the molecule's atomic number equal to its mass number. Wait, no, that's not possible because each atom adds both. Wait, no, wait. If each molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons, then for example, if the molecule is H2O, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something like CO, but that doesn't make sense. Or maybe it's CH4? No, that's four protons and nine neutrons, so not same. Hmm.

Wait, let me think differently. If the gas W's molecule has same neutrons and protons, maybe each atom in the molecule has equal number of neutrons and protons. But wait, the molecule could have a single atom. So for example, if W is O2, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (if it's 16O). So each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So the molecule O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons in total. But wait, the question says gas W's molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. So for each molecule, the total protons equals the total neutrons.

Wait, but if the molecule is H2O, the total protons would be 2+8=10, and neutrons would be 0 (for H)
