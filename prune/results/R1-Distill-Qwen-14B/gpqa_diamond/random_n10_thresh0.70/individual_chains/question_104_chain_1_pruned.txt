Okay, so I have this astronomy problem to solve. Let me read through it again and make sure I understand what's being asked. So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. There are two stars, each with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits.

The RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The more massive the planet, the larger the shift. Also, if the planet is more massive and/or closer to the star, the shift would be more frequent, I think.

Wait, but in this problem, both planets have masses similar to Neptune, so their masses are the same. So the variation must come from other factors. The problem says that the spectral line shift for planet #1 is up to 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2 it's 7 milliangstroms. So planet #2 causes a larger shift in the star's spectrum.

Hmm, but wait, the RV method's shift depends on the planet's mass and the distance between the star and planet. The formula I remember is that the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star)^(1/3) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_star))^(1/3) ) * ( (1) / sqrt(1 - e²) ) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that term doesn't matter.

But wait, since both stars have the same mass (solar masses) and the planets have the same mass, and the same orbital inclination (since they're detected, they must have i≈90 degrees, so sin i is about 1), then the semi-amplitude K should depend on the cube root of the (M_p^3 / (M_star * (M_star + M_p)^2 )) ), but since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune is about 17 Earth masses, Sun is 333,000 Earth masses), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So K is approximately (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3)) ) * something else.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the formula for K from the RV method. The semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / (2π * (M_star + M_p)^(2/3)) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) ) * ( (2π * a * sin i ) / (P * (M_star + M_p) )) )

Wait, maybe I should simplify. Another approach is that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * P ) / (2π c ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) M_star^(1/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again. The RV method's semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 day) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

But I might be mixing up the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the relationship between the semi-amplitude K and the orbital period P.

Wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (P/(1 yr)) )^(-1/3) * (1/(sqrt(1 - e^2))).

But since the planets are in circular orbits, e=0, so that term is 1. So K ∝ (M_p / M_star) * P^(-1/3).

Wait, but M_p is the same for both planets, and M_star is the same for both stars. So the ratio of K1 and K2 would be (P1/P2)^(-1/3).

Wait, no, more accurately, K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * ( (P)/(1 yr) )^(-1/3) )

But since M_p and M_star are the same, K1/K2 = (P1 / P2 )^(-1/3 )

So, since K2 is larger than K1, because 7 >5, so K2 = 7/5 * K1. So K2/K1 = 7/5.

So K2/K1 = (P1 / P2 )^(-1/3 )

=> (P1/P2 )^(-1/3 ) = 7/5

Take both sides to the power of -3:

P1/P2 = (7/5)^(-3) = (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So that means P1 is about 0.3
