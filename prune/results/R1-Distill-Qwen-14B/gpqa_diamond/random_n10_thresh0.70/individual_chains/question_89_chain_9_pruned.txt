Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's go through it step by step. 

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halides on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically forming an alkene. Since adamantane is a diamondoid structure, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have the bromines on adjacent carbons of the adamantane skeleton. 

Heating with KOH would lead to an E2 elimination, producing a double bond. The product would be 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantaneâ€”bromines on carbons 1 and 3. So elimination would form a double bond between 1 and 2 or 2 and 3? No, wait. If it's 1 and 3, then elimination would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 2 and 2 and 3? No, wait, elimination removes two adjacent X groups. So perhaps the structure is such that the dihalide is on adjacent carbons, leading to a double bond. Wait, maybe it's 1 and 3 on the same face? Not sure, but regardless, the product after KOH would be an adamantane with a double bond somewhere.

The product 1 has an IR absorption at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So the product isn't just an alkene. Wait, maybe it's a ketone? How does that happen? Oh, wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by another reaction. Wait, KOH in what conditions? Maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or something else. Alternatively, could it be an intramolecular reaction?

Wait, maybe after elimination of HBr, the compound could undergo a ring expansion or form a cyclic ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the initial product is a diene, but the IR suggests a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Wait, another possibility: when dibromides react with KOH, sometimes they can form epoxides, but that usually requires peracids. Alternatively, perhaps it's an example of the formation of an epoxide via a different mechanism, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, epoxide formation is
