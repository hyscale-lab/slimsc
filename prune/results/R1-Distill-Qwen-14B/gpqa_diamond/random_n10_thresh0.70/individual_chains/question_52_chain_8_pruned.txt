Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me read it carefully and then think through the steps.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question deals with the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I'm supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm. So, the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), right? The Boltzmann factor relates the populations of two energy states.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of populations (n1/n2) is equal to (g1/g2) * exp(- (E2 - E1)/(k T)), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energies of the states, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff is lower. So, the temperature we're considering is the effective temperature of the photosphere. But wait, the spots are cooler regions, so when they cover part of the surface, the overall flux (and thus the effective temperature) decreases. But in this case, the question is about the photosphere when spots are present. So, perhaps the temperature used in the Boltzmann equation is the effective photospheric temperature, which is 5500 K when spots are present.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star's surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000K. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500K. But the transition is in the photosphere, so perhaps each region (spot and non-spot) has its own temperature. But the question says to assume LTE in the photosphere, so maybe the entire photosphere is at the effective temperature? Or perhaps the spots are at a lower temperature
