Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration calculations. But I'll try to tackle it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. The initial solution is made by diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct pair of pH values.

First, I'll try to outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. **Calculate the initial concentration after dilution of acetic acid.**
   Since we're mixing 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Using the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2, I can find the new concentration.

2. **Determine the equivalence point.**
   The equivalence point is where moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So I need to calculate the moles initially present and then find out how much NaOH is needed.

3. **Find out what happens at 25% titration.**
   This means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. I'll need to calculate the moles of NaOH added at this point and adjust the concentrations accordingly.

4. **Calculate the pH at both the 25% titration and equivalence point using the appropriate methods.**
   For the 25%, it's a buffer solution, so I'll use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. At equivalence, it's a solution of the sodium acetate salt, so I'll calculate the pH based on the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.

Let me start with step 1.

**Step 1: Calculate diluted acetic acid concentration.**

The initial volume (V1) is 20.00 cm³, and the initial concentration (M1) is 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the new volume (V2) is 40 cm³. Using M1V1 = M2V2,

M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = (1) / 40 = 0.025 M.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that calculation. 0.05 M * 20 cm³ is 1 mmol (since 1 cm³ is 1 mL and 0.05 M is 0.05 mmol/cm³). Oh wait, wait no, 0.05 M is 0.05 moles per liter. So 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters. So moles = M * V = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Then, when diluted to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Right.

So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

**Step 2: Determine the equivalence point.**

At equivalence, moles of NaOH added equals moles of acetic acid initially present.

Moles of acetic acid: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles.

NaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M. Let's find the volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence.

Moles NaOH = 0.001 = 0.1 M * V → V = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So, at equivalence, 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added.

But wait, the initial solution is 40 cm³, and adding 10 cm³ makes the total solution volume 50 cm³. But maybe that doesn't matter right now.

**Step 3: 25% titration.**

25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So moles of NaOH added would be 25% of 0.001 moles, which is 0.00025 moles.

Alternatively, since the equivalence point requires 10 cm³, 25% titration would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, because 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So that's the volume added.

But maybe another approach: the reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

So for each mole of NaOH, a mole of CH3COOH is neutralized, converting it to acetate.

So initially, moles of CH3COOH = 0.001.

After adding 0.25 moles (25%) of NaOH (because 25% of 0.001 is 0.00025), the moles of CH3COOH left would be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

And moles of CH3COO^- formed would be 0.00025 moles.

But wait, since we're adding 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, let's confirm:

Moles NaOH = 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Correct.

So the solution now contains 0.00075 moles of acetic acid and 0.00025 moles of acetate ion.

The total volume is initial 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³, which is 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

But wait, when using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, the concentrations are in terms of moles divided by the same volume, so the ratio will be (moles of acetate)/(moles of acetic acid). Because the same volume is used for both, the volume cancels out.

So the ratio is (0.00025) / (0.00075) = 1/3.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log ( [A^-]/[HA] )

pKa is given by the Ka value. Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)).

Wait, pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that.

log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) → log(1/3) is approximately -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256. Let's say approximately 4.26.

Wait, but checking the options:

Option A is 4.26 and 8.52.

Option D is 4.57; 6.92.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution is 0.025 M, correct. So moles in 40 cm³ is 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol.

At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol of NaOH added. So moles of CH3COOH left = 0.00075, and moles of acetate = 0.00025.

So the ratio is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log(1/3) → pKa is 4.733.

log(1/3) is approximately -0.477 → 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256, which rounds to 4.26. So the pH at 25% is about 4.26.

Now, moving on to the equivalence point.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So now the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base. So the solution will be basic.

The concentration of acetate comes from the moles of NaOH added (0.001 mol) divided by the total solution volume (40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L).

So the concentration of acetate ion is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) reacts with water as follows:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka.

Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The expression for Kb is:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Since the initial concentration of acetate is 0.02 M, and x is the concentration of OH^- produced, we can approximate:

At equilibrium, [CH3COO^-] ≈ 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since Kb is very small, x is negligible).

So, Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 → x² = Kb * 0.02 → x = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02)

Calculating that:

5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11

sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.28e-6 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 3.28e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.28e-6) → log(3.28) is about 0.515, so 0.515 -6 → -5.485 → pOH ≈ 5.485. So pH = 14 - 5.485 = 8.515.

Wait, but that's around 8.52, which is option A. But wait, looking back at the options, option A says the equivalence point pH is 8.52, which matches.

But wait, let me check my Kb calculation again.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 → 1/1.8
