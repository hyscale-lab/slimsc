Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product based on the given IR and NMR data. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm, red phosphorus and HI—wait, isn't that a common reagent for hydrolysis? Oh right, I think when you have a nitro group, you can reduce it using red phosphorus and HI. Or maybe it's for removing certain protecting groups? Alternatively, I remember that HI can be used in the cleavage of certain functional groups, like in the case of allylic alcohols or maybe in the hydrolysis of esters or amides. Oh wait, but red phosphorus is often involved in the reduction of nitro groups to amines. Let me think: typical reactions with red phosphorus and HI. Oh, right, it's used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines, but wait, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's for the cleavage of esters or something else. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another thought. Red phosphorus and HI are used together for the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines. Wait, but wait, no—another possibility. Red phosphorus is used in the Staudinger reaction for converting azides to iminophosphoranes, but that's with triphenylphosphine, not red. Alternatively, maybe it's a deprotection reaction. Hmm. Maybe I should look at the IR and NMR data first to figure out what Compound X is.

Looking at the IR data: peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1. That broad region suggests O-H stretching, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Also, a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 could be aromatic C=C stretching.

So putting this together, we might have a benzene ring (from the aromatic peaks), a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid), and an O-H group. But wait, the 1720 cm-1 is a high wavenumber, which is more indicative of an ester or maybe a ketone. Wait, carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3000 (broad) and a carbonyl around 1700 cm-1. So in the IR, the 3400–2500 is a broad O-H, which could be a carboxylic acid. Wait, but then the 1720 would be a bit higher than typical for a carboxylic acid (maybe around 1700). Hmm. Alternatively, it could be an ester (which also has a carbonyl around 1720-1740). But then, an ester doesn't have an O-H stretch in the IR except from any hydroxyl groups elsewhere.

Wait, the NMR might help. Let's look at the 1H NMR data:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a very downfield peak, probably an acidic proton. Could be a carboxylic acid -COOH proton. Or maybe an aldehyde proton, but those are usually around 9-10. But the broad singlet suggests exchange with water, which is more like a carboxylic acid.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This looks like two aromatic protons as a doublet, which would be on adjacent carbons, perhaps as part of a para-substituted benzene. Similarly, 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) would be the other two protons of the para-substituted benzene (like in para-substituted rings).

Then, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This is a multiplet, maybe a CH group attached to something, like an oxygen or adjacent to another CH2 group.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Two protons, perhaps part of a CH2 group next to another group, like a branch.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of 3H as a doublet. Wait, no, a doublet for 3H. That suggests a CH2CH3 group where the CH2 is attached to something else, like a branching point. Or maybe a (CH2)2CH3 group where the CH is attached to another group. Wait, a doublet for 3H would be a CH3 group attached to a CH with two neighboring protons, like in an isopropyl group. Wait, no, if it's a triplet, but here it's a doublet. Hmm. Wait, maybe the 1.4 ppm doublet (d) for 3
