Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is given as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li usually has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, then its atomic number is 3, and mass number A is 3 + 3 = 6. So X is Li-6.

The options are A) 18.475 GeV, B) 23.069 GeV, C) 20.132 GeV, D) 21.419 GeV. I need to compute the energy and see which option matches.

Wait, I remember that in particle accelerators, the energy is typically the kinetic energy, but sometimes it refers to the total energy. Wait no, wait. I think for heavy ions, the energy is usually given as the kinetic energy per nucleon. Or maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to the total energy of the nucleus.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The energy of a particle in relativity is given by gamma times m c squared. But is that the kinetic energy or the total energy? I think gamma*m c² is the total energy, and kinetic is (gamma - 1)*m c². So I need to clarify whether the problem is asking for the total energy or the kinetic.

The question says, "What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?" So in this context, the energy of the collider would typically be the kinetic energy imparted to the ions. Or wait, sometimes colliders specify their energy as the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the formula. The velocity is 0.96c, so beta is 0.96. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). So beta is 0.96, so beta squared is 0.9216. 1 - beta^2 is 0.0784. Square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait,
