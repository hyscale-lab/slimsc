Okay, so I've got this question here about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. Hmm, I remember that both of these are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations. The question gives some details about each star's apparent magnitude, absolute magnitude, distance, and some extinction values.

First, I need to figure out which stars are bright enough to be observed by both instruments. The problem states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, so apparent V mag less than or equal to 17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so apparent V mag less than or equal to 16. Wait, no, wait. The way it's worded: "brighter than 17 mag" would mean less than 17, because lower magnitude numbers are brighter. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag less than or equal to 17. HIRES can observe stars with V mag less than or equal to 16. So a star needs to have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be detected by both, because HIRES is the more restrictive in this case.

Wait, no. Wait, the question is which stars can be detected with both. So each star must satisfy both observatories' brightness requirements. So the apparent V magnitude must be ≤16 (since HIRES can't go beyond 16), and also ≤17. So the stricter condition is ≤16. So any star with apparent V mag ≤16 would satisfy both.

But wait, some stars have absolute magnitudes given, and others have apparent. So I need to calculate the apparent magnitude for the stars with absolute magnitudes, considering their distance and any extinction.

Let me go through each star:

Star1: Absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. Since absolute magnitude (M) is the apparent magnitude (m) at 10 pc, so at 10 pc, m = M. But this star is at 10 pc, so m = 15.5. Wait, but that's the apparent magnitude. Then, what about extinction? Wait, Star1's info doesn't mention E(B-V). So I think for Star1, no extinction is applied. So m = 15.5. Now, check against both observatories: ESPRESSO can go up to 17
