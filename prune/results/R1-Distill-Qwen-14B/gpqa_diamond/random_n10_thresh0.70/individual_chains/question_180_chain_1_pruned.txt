Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their mass is negligible. 12 of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system in Joules, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, okay. I remember that in electrostatics, the potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them. Since all the charges are the same, the energy will depend on their arrangement. But wait, the setup here is a bit specific.

So, there's a central charge fixed at point P. The other 12 are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. So, they form a spherical shell around P, I guess. Since they are identical and all at the same distance, it's symmetric. So, each of those 12 charges is at radius 2 meters from P.

Wait, the problem is about the minimum energy. So, I think the charges are either all positive or all negative. Since they're identical and we're talking about their potential energy, which depends on their arrangement.

Wait, each of the 13 charges is 2e. So, each is 2 times the elementary charge. So, we have 13 charges each of 2e. So, the central charge is 2e, and the other 12 are each 2e and placed at 2 m
