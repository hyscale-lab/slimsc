Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, let's see. The question involves finding the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species in the solution.

Wait, the solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate ions. The concentrations given are c(Co) = 10^-2 M and [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants β1 to β4 are provided. Oh right, stability constants tell us about the stability of the complexes—the higher the β, the more stable the complex is.

So, the problem is about the distribution of cobalt species in solution. Cobalt can form different complexes with thiocyanate. The complexes are probably [Co(SCN)]^n+ where n varies. The stability constants increase up to β3=63 and then decrease to β4=16. Wait, that seems a bit odd because usually the stability constants increase with the number of ligands, but maybe here it's different for some reason. Or perhaps β4 refers to a different structure.

Wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think the blue complexes are the more stable ones. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands attached. So, the complex would be Co(SCN)_2^2+ maybe. Or perhaps it's a different charge.

Stability constants (β) are given for different complexes. I remember that β is the formation constant. For a complex like Co(SCN)_n^(2-n), the β would be the equilibrium constant for Co^2+ + n SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)_n^(2-n). Each β corresponds to a different n.

So, the complexes are:

β1: Co(SCN)^+ (n=1)
β2: Co(SCN)_2^0 (n=2)
β3: Co(SCN)_3^- (n=3)
β4: Co(SCN)_4^2- (n=4)

Wait, I'm not sure about the charges. Let me think. Each SCN^- is -1. So, Co^2+ plus n SCN^- would give a charge of 2 - n.

So for n=1: 2+ +1 SCN^- → Co(SCN)^(+1) → charge is +1? Because 2+ plus one -1 SCN gives +1. Hmm, but
