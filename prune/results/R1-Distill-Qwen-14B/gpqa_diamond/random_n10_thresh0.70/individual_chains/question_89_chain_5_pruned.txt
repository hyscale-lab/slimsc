Okay, so I need to figure out what the NMR coupling pattern is for the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. Let me try to work through each step of the reaction.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating this with excess KOH at 240°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (like 1,3-dibromo) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably an E2 mechanism. So this would form an alkene. The product here is a light yellow solid, product 1. The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Wait, that's unexpected because elimination usually forms alkenes. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction. Wait, but KOH is a base, so elimination is more likely. Hmm, but the IR peak at 1720 is actually a carbonyl group. So perhaps it's not elimination but a substitution that forms a ketone?

Wait, maybe the structure of adamantane comes into play. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on adjacent carbons in the diamond structure. When KOH is used, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation (elimination) to form an alkene. But the IR suggests a ketone. Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by OH, but that would require two substitutions, but KOH is a base, not a nucleophile in that sense. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is symmetric, so substitution would form 1,3-dihydroxyl adamantane. Wait, but the IR peak is at 1720, which is more like a ketone. So if elimination forms an alkene, but then why the IR has a carbonyl?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Oh, wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination. Maybe it's a substitution where the bromide is replaced by something else. But KOH isn't a nucleophile in a typical SN2 reaction because it's a strong base. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, forming a double bond, but then what gives the carbonyl? Maybe the initial reaction isn't that. Wait, another thought: when vic
