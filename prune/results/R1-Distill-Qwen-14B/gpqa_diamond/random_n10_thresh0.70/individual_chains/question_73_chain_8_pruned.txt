Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking about the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the problem states that two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, are these speeds as measured from the same frame, like the rest frame of the system or something else? I think it's from the same frame, like maybe the lab frame. Or perhaps each astronaut's speed is measured relative to some other frame. Oh, wait, the question says they're moving in the positive x-direction, so probably their speeds are given in the same inertial frame. So we can calculate their relative speed using relativistic velocity addition.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction isn't just the difference. Because at high speeds, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/cÂ²)). But wait, in this case, the first astronaut (A) is moving at 0.6c and the second (B) at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's frame, what is B's speed?

Wait, no, wait. Because according to the question, we're to find the relative speed between them. So the relative speed would be from A's frame to B's frame or vice
