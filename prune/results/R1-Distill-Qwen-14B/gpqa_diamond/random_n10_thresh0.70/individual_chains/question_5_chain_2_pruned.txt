Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

Wait, the operator is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is ħ/2 multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So I think the operator P itself is a vector operator, so its components are Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. Because the Pauli matrices for X, Y, Z are well-known. Let's recall them.

The X-component matrix given is [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, Py is [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y. Pz is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so that's Pauli Z. So each component is (ħ/2) multiplied by the corresponding Pauli matrix.

The operator along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh wait, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so it's like any direction that's a combination of x and z. So the unit vector n would be something like (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because in the x-z plane, the angle θ might be measured from the z-axis, so x is sinθ and z is cosθ. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. In spherical coordinates, if n is in the x-z plane, then the polar angle θ would be measured from the z-axis. So x is sinθ cosφ, but since it's in x-z plane, φ is zero, so x component is sinθ, and z is cosθ. So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

Wait, but the operator P is given as a vector operator. So the operator along direction n would be the dot product of n with the Pauli matrices. So P·n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. But wait, since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So Py term would drop out. So the operator is P·n = (ħ/2) (n_x σx + n_z σz).

But wait, n is a unit vector, so n_x^
