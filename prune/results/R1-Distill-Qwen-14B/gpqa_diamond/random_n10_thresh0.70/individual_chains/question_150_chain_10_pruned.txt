Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's a start. The NMR data is given, and then it's reacted through a series of reagents. The question is to find the final product among the options given.

First, I should probably analyze the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. Let's look at the peaks:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a triplet integrating for 1 proton. High chemical shift, maybe an aldehyde proton? Or possibly an aromatic ring with strong electron-withdrawing groups.
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): Doublet, 2 protons. Could be part of an aromatic ring, perhaps a para-substituted ring. Like, maybe a para-substituted benzene with some substituents.
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, 2H. Maybe the other pair of protons in a para-substituted ring? Or maybe part of a conjugated system.
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something, like an -OH group. Or perhaps it's part of an aromatic ring that's more deshielded but without splitting, like if it's adjacent to a substituent.
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H): Doublet for 2H. This could be a methylene group (CH2) next to something that splits the peak into a doublet. Maybe adjacent to an oxygen, like an OCH2 or part of an enol structure.

Now, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So 5 degrees. Which could be one ring, one double bond, and another double bond, or a ring and two double bonds, etc. But looking at the NMR, there's aromatic protons, so probably at least a benzene ring (which is 3 degrees: 3 double bonds in a ring). The rest would be other double bonds or rings.

Looking at the NMR, the aldehyde at 9.72 ppm suggests maybe a benzaldehyde derivative. The 6.98 and 6.51 ppm are likely from a para-substituted benzene, perhaps with some substituents. The 6.27 ppm could be a couple of protons adjacent to an oxygen, maybe in a conjugated system or part of a hydroxyl group.

Wait, the 6.27 is a broad singlet. Broad suggests they're exchanging, like an -OH group, but integrating as 2H... that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a dienol structure or something else. Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring with substituents
