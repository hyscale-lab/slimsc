Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that a student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to select the correct reagent (A) and catalyst (B) from the options given.

Hmm, I remember that when amines react under certain conditions, they can undergo various reactions. Since the reaction is acid-catalyzed, maybe it's some kind of acid-catalyzed alkylation or something similar.

Wait, the product has a cyclohexylidene group attached. Cyclohexylidene... that's like a cyclohexene ring, right? So, the structure is a pyrrolidine ring with a substituent that's a cyclohexene attached via a methylene group. 

So, the starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine. When it reacts with compound A under acid catalysis, it forms this new compound. I'm trying to think about possible reactions that would add this cyclohexene group.

I recall that when secondary amines react with ketones or aldehydes, they can undergo condensation reactions, like the Mannich reaction, but that usually requires an amine, a ketone, and an aldehyde. Alternatively, perhaps it's an example of a ring expansion or a cycloaddition?

Wait, another possibility: Friedel-Crafts alkylation? No, wait, that's for aromatic rings. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction involving the formation of an iminium ion, which could then undergo some kind of conjugate addition.

Wait, the product looks like it's formed via a [1,2] addition or something. Alternatively, perhaps the amine is acting as a nucleophile attacking an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound.

Wait, cyclohexylidene could be part of an enone system. So, if compound A is an aldehyde or ketone that can form an enol, then perhaps the amine is undergoing some kind of conjugate addition.

Wait, another thought: Maybe it's a reaction where the amine is undergoing alkylation. But in acid catalyzed conditions, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution.

Alternatively, if compound A is a carbonyl compound
