Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. The key is understanding the brightness limits of each spectrograph. Oh right, the brightness is given in magnitudes, so lower numbers mean brighter stars.

From the question, ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V mag. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says, with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Oh, so apparent magnitude less than 17, because lower magnitudes are brighter. So, if a star's apparent V mag is ≤17, ESPRESSO can see it?

Wait wait, no, the wording is: "brighter than 17 mag", so that's apparent magnitude less than 17. Because higher magnitude means fainter. So for ESPRESSO, apparent V mag must be ≤17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so apparent V mag ≤16.

So any star that has an apparent V magnitude ≤16 can be detected by both, because HIRES can go down to 16, and ESPRESSO can go to 17. Wait, no, because for both to detect, the star needs to be within both instruments' capabilities. So for a star to be seen by both, its apparent V mag must be ≤16, because HIRES can't see beyond 16. Because if it's 16.5, then HIRES can't detect it, but ESPRESSO can. But since the question is about stars detectable by both, the star's apparent V mag must be ≤16.

Wait, no, because ESPRESSO can go up to 17. So a star with apparent mag 16.5 would be detectable by ESPRESSO but not by HIRES, since HIRES only goes up to 16. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V mag must be ≤16.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check each star.

Wait, the stars are given with either absolute magnitude or apparent magnitude. So I'll need to calculate the apparent magnitude for each star where it's not given
