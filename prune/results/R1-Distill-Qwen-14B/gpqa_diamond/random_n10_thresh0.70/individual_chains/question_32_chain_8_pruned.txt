Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and figuring out the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's think this through.

First, the problem says the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li usually has 3 protons. So Li-6? Because Li has atomic number 3, and 3 protons plus 3 neutrons makes 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number A=6. So the mass would be the mass of 6 nucleons, but I think for heavy ions, we usually approximate the mass as A times the mass of a proton, since protons and neutrons are close in mass. But wait, I'm not sure if I should calculate the exact mass or use an approximation. Maybe the problem expects me to use the mass of a single nucleon, but perhaps the exact mass isn't necessary because it's a ratio or something.

The question is about the energy of the RHIC. I remember that in particle accelerators, the kinetic energy is often considered, but sometimes the total energy is what's given. Wait, no, the RHIC's energy is the total energy, I think. Or wait, noâ€”wait, no, the energy given by accelerators is usually the kinetic energy. Or wait, sometimes they give the total energy (kinetic plus rest mass). Hmm, maybe I should clarify. Oh wait, the problem says "the energy of the RHIC," so I
