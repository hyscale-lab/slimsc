Okay, so I have to figure out the chemical formula of this unknown compound based on the spectroscopy data given. Let's see, I'll start by going through each piece of data and see what they tell me.

First, the FTIR. The broad peak at 3000 cm-1 suggests the presence of either an alcohol (OH) or maybe an amine, but since amines usually have a sharper peak, I'll think it's an -OH group. The broadness is typical of the O-H stretch in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but there are also strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. Those are important. The 1700 is usually a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. The 1650 could be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in an aromatic ketone or an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Alternatively, the 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl, maybe something like a conjugated ester or an acid.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are the ones on a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound probably has a double bond. Also, the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests that the structure includes an alkene, maybe as part of a carbonyl group like in an enone system.

Looking at the mass spec data: the fragment peak at m/z 45. What's that? Let's think about common fragments. 45 could be CH3CO+ (acetate) which is 43? Wait, acetone is (propan-2-one) has a molecular ion at 58, but maybe the fragment. Alternatively, the fragment could be from a ketone, like the (CH2)2CO+ group. Wait, 45 is also the molecular weight of CH3CHO (acetaldehyde is 44, but maybe the fragment is something else. Alternatively, it could be a CH2O group? Or perhaps a ketene ion? Hmm, not sure yet. Maybe I'll come back to that.

So putting the IR together: a broad peak at 3000 suggests an -OH group. The two carbonyl peaks at 1700 and 1650 might mean there are two carbonyl groups
