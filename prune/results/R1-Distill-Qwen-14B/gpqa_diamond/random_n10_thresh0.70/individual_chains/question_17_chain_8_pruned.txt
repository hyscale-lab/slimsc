Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds metal ions like calcium. 

The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, stoichiometric means that the ratio of Ca to EDTA is 1:1, right? So each Ca is bound by one EDTA molecule. 

The question is about finding the concentration of free calcium ions. I think the key here is the formation constant, K, which tells us how strong the complex is. The K for Ca-EDTA is given as 5x10^10. So, K is a large number, which means the complex is very stable, and the free calcium ions should be very low in concentration.

Wait, how does the formation constant tie into the concentrations? I remember that the formation constant Kf is equal to [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca][EDTA]). So if we have the complex concentration, we can find the product of the concentrations of free Ca and free EDTA.

But wait, in this solution, the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote that as C_total = [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M. 

If I assume that the solution is at equilibrium, the concentration of the complex is much larger than the free ions because
