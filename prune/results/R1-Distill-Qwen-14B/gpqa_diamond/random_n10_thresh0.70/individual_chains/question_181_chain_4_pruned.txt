Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun, and I'm a bit rusty on some of this stuff, but let me think it through. Let's see...

The question is about the flux of neutrinos in two energy bands, band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV), right after the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stops. The options are ratios of flux in band 1 over band 2.

Hmm, first, I remember that the Sun's energy production has different processes. The main one is the proton-proton chain, which has different branches. The pp-I, II, and III branches. Oh wait, the question specifically mentions the pp-III branch stopping. So I should focus on that.

What do I know about pp-III? I think the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos compared to the other branches. Because it involves heavier elements or more energetic reactions. So if the pp-III branch stops, the production of high-energy neutrinos would decrease.

Wait, but in this scenario, all other reactions continue. So the other branches, like pp-I and pp-II, are still active. Also, the CNO cycle, which produces neutrinos as well, but I think those are lower energy compared to pp-III. Or wait, no, the CNO cycle neutrinos are lower in energy than the pp chain's, but I'm not sure.

I remember that the main source of neutrinos comes from the pp chain, especially the pp-I and pp-II branches. The pp-III branch is a minor part but contributes to higher energy neutrinos.

So if pp-III stops, the flux of higher-energy neutrinos (like in band 2) would drop because that's where pp-III contributes more. But wait, the other branches (pp-I and II) are still producing neutrinos, but perhaps at lower energies.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The pp chain has three branches, but I think the main contributor to neutrinos is the pp-I branch, which is the dominant one. The pp-II and pp-III are minor. So if pp-III stops, would that significantly affect the high-energy neutrinos?

The neutrinos from the pp chain are mainly produced via the beta decay steps. The pp-III branch might produce a specific type, maybe like the 7 Be neutrinos which have a certain energy range. Oh wait, the 7 Be neutrinos are around
