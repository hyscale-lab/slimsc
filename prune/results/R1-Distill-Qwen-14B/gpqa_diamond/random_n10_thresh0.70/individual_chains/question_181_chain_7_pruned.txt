Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8 and a half minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is roughly the time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth, right? So if the pp-III stopped, the neutrinos produced from that reaction wouldn't reach us anymore. But wait, the problem is about the flux of neutrinos in two energy bands. So I need to figure out how the stopping of pp-III affects the flux in those bands.

First, I should recall what the pp-III branch is. The proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun. The pp-I branch is the initial reaction, producing deuterium. Then pp-II involves fusing deuterium into helium-3, and pp-III is the next step where two helium-3 nuclei combine into helium-4, releasing two protons, right? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. I think pp-III is the part where the two He-3 nuclei (helium-3) combine to make He-4, plus two protons. So pp-III is a key part of the proton-proton cycle, and it's a major source of neutrinos, specifically the electron neutrinos.

Neutrinos are produced in several steps of the pp chain. The main neutrinos come from the decay of boron-8, which is a product of the pp-III reactions. So if the pp-III branch stops, the production of those neutrinos would stop.

So, the flux of neutrinos on Earth is the rate at which they arrive. The question is about the ratio of flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2).

Wait, neutrino energies from the Sun are mostly around a few MeV, but the specific bands here are lower, like sub-MeV. So in the pp chain, which reactions produce neutrinos?

In the pp-I and pp-II branches, the main neutrinos are probably lower energy, but I think the majority of the high-energy neutrinos come from pp-III. Because in the pp-III, the reaction is He-3 + He-3 â†’ He-4 + 2 protons. As part of this, beta decay happens
