Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions. The question says we have a 0.02 M solution of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. And they give the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. Oh wait, wait, what's the formation constant again?

So the formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. So K is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution. Oh, right, that means that the concentrations of calcium and EDTA are in a 1:1 ratio because the complex is Ca-EDTA. So initially, when you mix them, you have equal amounts, but some form the complex.

Wait, but the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But if it's a 1:1 complex, then the initial concentrations before complexation would be [Ca²+]=0.02 M and [EDTA]=0.02 M. But wait, no, because when the complex forms, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, but the free [Ca²+] and free [EDTA]
