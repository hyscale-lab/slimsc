Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read through the question carefully.

The first part is about 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH to form product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to make product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethyl sulfide to form product 3. The question asks about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm, let's break this down. Starting with the first reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, and dibrominated at 1 and 3 positions. Heating with KOH suggests an elimination reaction—like dehydrohalogenation. But wait, with two bromines, maybe it's a double elimination? Alternatively, it could be a substitution, but since KOH is a strong base, elimination is more likely.

Wait, 1,3-dibromo adamantane would have two bromide groups in a way that when KOH is added, it could lead to the formation of a diene. Since adamantane is a fused ring structure, perhaps the elimination forms an exo-cyclic double bond or a bridgehead double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening elimination. But wait, adamantane is a very stable structure, so elimination is more probable.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a molecule where two adjacent (or non-adjacent?) carbons have bromines. Considering the structure, the reaction with KOH would lead to the formation of a double bond via dehydrohalogenation. Let me think: if two bromines are on adjacent carbons (vicinal), they can eliminate to form a double bond. But in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the positions are 1 and 3, which in the adamantane structure are not adjacent. So maybe it’s a case of two bromines on the same face, allowing for a double elimination.

Wait, perhaps the KOH causes both bromides to leave, but that's unlikely because it's a two-step elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a single elimination to form a bromide, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH leads to a substitution, but two substitutions would require a lot
