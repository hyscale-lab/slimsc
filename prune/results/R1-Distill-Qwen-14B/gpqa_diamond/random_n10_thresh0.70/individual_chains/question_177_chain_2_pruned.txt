Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me read through it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The info given is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. The wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. Additionally, their radial velocities are 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The problem states that the stars radiate as black bodies and asks by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I remember that the luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. The formula I think is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Oh wait, right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law. So L is proportional to R² times T⁴.

But wait, the problem says they have the same wavelengths where they're brightest. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait a second. The radial velocities are given. Star_1 is not moving towards or away from us (radial velocity 0), so its wavelength isn't Doppler shifted. But Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Does that affect the observed wavelength? Oh, right, because if a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength shifts. But the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So maybe the observed λ_max is the same, but the intrinsic λ_max might be different due to the Doppler effect.

Wait, the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is the same for both. So I guess we need to consider the Doppler shift for Star_2.

Let me think. The Doppler shift formula is λ = λ0 * sqrt( (1 + v_r
