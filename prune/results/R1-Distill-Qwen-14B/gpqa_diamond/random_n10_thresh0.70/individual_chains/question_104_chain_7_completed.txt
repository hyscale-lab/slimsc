Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, let's see what it says. 

Alright, the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet similar to Neptune. So both planets are probably in the same size ballpark. The planets are in circular orbits, which is good because that simplifies things.

The radial velocity method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. The idea is that as the planet orbits the star, it causes the star to wobble a bit. The bigger the wobble (the larger the Doppler shift), the more massive the planet or the closer it is to the star, I think. But wait, the Doppler shift depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period, right?

In this problem, they're giving me the maximum Doppler shift for each planet. Planet #1 caused a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but wait—since the RV method detects the star's velocity towards and away from us, the observed Doppler shift relates to the star's velocity. So the velocity semi-amplitude K is what's being measured here. Oh yeah, K is the maximum velocity of the star due to the planet.

So the question is, how does the orbital period of planet #2 compare to that of planet #1? They're asking for the ratio of the periods, P2/P1.

I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(P * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, I think there's a simplified version when the planet mass is much smaller than the star's mass (which is the case here, since Neptune is much less massive than the Sun). So M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

Then the formula simplifies. Let me recall: K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1 / (P)) )^(1/3) * (1/(1 - e²)^(1/2)) )

But since the orbits are circular, e=0, so the denominator is 1. So K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1 / P^(1/3)) ) )? Wait, let me think again. 

Wait, I think the formula for K is:

K = ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) * P ) )^(1/3) )

But since M_p << M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p) / M_star )^(1/3) * (1/(P)) )^(1/3) )

Wait, because I think the formula is K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * sqrt(1-e²)) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps another way: the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v_star) = ( (2 pi G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But since the planetary masses are much smaller, M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, and sin i is approximately 1 (if the orbit is edge-on, which is the case for maximum Doppler shift; but in reality, it's a factor, but since both planets are detected, perhaps their inclinations are similar or we can assume sin i is same for both).

So for this problem, maybe we can ignore the sin i term, or assume it's the same for both planets. So K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) )

Wait, wait, let me think again. Let's recall the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude:

K = ( (v) ) = ( (27 * pi G )^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) * c ) )

But perhaps a better way is to use the formula in terms of P, the orbital period. Since the problem states that both stars have the same mass as the Sun, M_star is the same for both. And both planets have masses similar to Neptune, so M_p is the same for both as well. Wait, the problem says both have masses similar to Neptune. So M_p1 ≈ M_p2.

Wait, no, the question says both planets have masses similar to Neptune. So M_p1 ~ M_p2.

Wait, that's important. So if M_p1 is approximately equal to M_p2, and M_star is same for both, then in the formula for K, the only variable left is P.

So from the formula, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because K = (something) * (M_p / (M_star^(2/3) )) * (1/P^(1/3)) )

So if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P is proportional to (1/K)^(3).

Wait, let me write it as K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)). Therefore, P ∝ (1/K)^3.

So, for each planet, P1 and P2:

P1 ∝ (1/K1)^3,

P2 ∝ (1/K2)^3.

Thus, the ratio P2/P1 is ( (1/K2)^3 ) / ( (1/K1)^3 ) ) = ( K1 / K2 )^3.

Because (1/K2)^3 / (1/K1)^3 = (K1/K2)^3.

So the ratio is (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, but the problem states that K for Planet #1 is 5 milliangstroms, and K for Planet #2 is 7 milliangstroms.

So K1 = 5, K2=7.

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = (5^3)/(7^3) = 125 / 343 ≈ approximately 0.364.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36, which matches this.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider any other factors, but wait. Because both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and the planets have similar masses, so M_p is same, M_star same. So yes, the only variable is P, and K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So the ratio is (K1/K2)^3.

So the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. So P2 is shorter than P1. Wait, but wait, according to the calculation, if K2 is higher, then P2 is smaller than P1. Because higher K implies shorter period. Because for the same star and planet mass, a closer-in planet (shorter period) would cause a bigger Doppler shift. Because K is higher when the planet is closer, hence faster orbit.

So in this case, Planet #2 has a larger K (7>5), so it's orbiting closer and has a shorter period than Planet #1. So P2 is shorter than P1, so the ratio P2/P1 is about 0.36.

So the correct answer is A) ~0.36.


The problem involves determining the ratio of the orbital periods of two planets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both planets orbit stars with masses similar to the Sun, and the planets themselves have masses similar to Neptune. The RV method measures the Doppler shift caused by the star's wobble due to the planet's gravitational pull, with the semi-amplitude of the shift, \( K \), being inversely proportional to the orbital period \( P \) raised to the power of \( 1/3 \). Mathematically, \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \), which implies \( P \propto (1/K)^3 \).

Given:
- \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) for Planet #1,
- \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) for Planet #2,

the ratio of the orbital periods is:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{K_1}{K_2} \right)^3 = \left( \frac{5}{7} \right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364.
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. This matches option A.
