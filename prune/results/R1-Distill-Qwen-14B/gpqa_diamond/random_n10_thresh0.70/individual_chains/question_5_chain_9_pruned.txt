Okay, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of an operator. Let me read the question carefully.

So, the problem says that we're dealing with a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The operator P has three components: Px, Py, and Pz, each given as ħ/2 multiplied by specific 2x2 matrices.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the angular momentum operator is represented by these components. The total angular momentum operator P is the sum of its components multiplied by the direction vector n. So, P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

But wait, the direction n is in the x-z plane, so n_y must be zero. That simplifies things a bit because the Py component won't contribute.

The eigenvalue equation is P|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>. So, the operator P acting on the eigenvector |ψ> gives (ħ/2) times |ψ>.

Let me write down the matrices for each component:

Px matrix: [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py matrix: [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz matrix: [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Each of these is multiplied by ħ/2.

So, P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
Similarly for the others.

Since n lies in the x-z plane, n = (n_x, 0, n_z). So, the operator P becomes P = n_x P_x + 0*P_y + n_z P_z.

So, P = n_x*(ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z*(ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

I can factor out ħ/2:

P = (ħ/2) [n_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute the matrix inside:

The matrix is:

[ n_z       n_x       ]
[ n_x     -n_z       ]

Wait, let me check:

n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] is:

[0, n_x]
[n_x, 0]

n_z * [[
