Okay, I need to figure out the electric field at point P outside a conducting sphere with a cavity. Let me think through this step by step.

So, the setup: there's an uncharged spherical conductor of radius R, and inside it, there's a small cavity of radius r. The center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. There's a charge +q placed somewhere inside this cavity. Point P is outside the conductor, a distance L from the conductor's center. Also, the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and the angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, so the conductor is initially uncharged. Then, when a charge is placed inside the cavity, the conductor's charges redistribute. I remember from my studies that when a charge is inside a conducting cavity, the conductor's inner surface gets an induced charge opposite to it, and the outer surface gets induced charge of the same sign.

But wait, the conductor was initially neutral. So when +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must induce a -q charge. Because the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must then have +q to balance out. So the total charge on the outer surface is +q.

Now, what about the electric field outside the conductor? I think the field outside a conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed, treating the conductor as a point charge. So the field outside would be the same as if all the charge were at the center. So for a point outside, the electric field is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², right? Because the conductor's outer surface has +q, so any point outside would see that charge as if it's a point charge at the center.

Wait, but what about the position of P relative to the cavity's center? Oh, but since the conductor's charge is on the outside, the position of the cavity's charges shouldn't affect the external field. Because the external field is only due to the total charge on the conductor's outer surface. So whether the cavity's charge is near the wall or shifted, the external field shouldn't depend on that.

Wait, but the options have some expressions that involve l and cos(theta). Let me look at the options again. Option B is (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L²), which matches what I was thinking. Option C and D involve l, but I thought the external field doesn't depend on l. Hmm.

Wait
