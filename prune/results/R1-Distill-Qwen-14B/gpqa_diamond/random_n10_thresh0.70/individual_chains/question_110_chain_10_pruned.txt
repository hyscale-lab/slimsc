Okay, so I've got this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that each spectrograph has different brightness limits. Let me think.

The question gives me five stars, Star1 to Star5, each with different properties. I need to figure out their apparent magnitudes because the observatories have different V magnitude limits. Oh right, ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, meaning apparent V mag ≤ 17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so apparent V mag ≤ 16.

Wait, so a star must be visible to both if its apparent magnitude is ≤16 because HIRES is more sensitive (since 16 is brighter than 17). So any star that's too faint for HIRES (apparent mag >16) won't be detected by both. So I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star and see which ones are ≤16.

Let me go through each star one by one.

Starting with Star1:
Star1's absolute magnitude (Mv) is 15.5. It's at 10 pc. Absolute magnitude is how bright a star would appear at 10 pc. Since it's exactly at 10 pc, the apparent magnitude (mv) is the same as Mv. So mv=15.5. Both telescopes can see it because 15.5 is less than 17 and 16. So Star1 is detectable by both. Wait, but wait—what about extinction? Oh, the question says to disregard the absorption? Or wait, looking back: the note says to disregard pointing limits and altitudes, but for Star3 and Star4, there's an E(B-V) and instructions about absorption.

Wait, Star1's question doesn't mention any extinction. So Star1's apparent magnitude is 15.5. Both telescopes can see it. So Star1 is a candidate.

Star2:
Apparent V magnitude is given as 16.5. So that's right at the limit. HIRES can observe up to 16.5? Wait, the question says stars brighter than 16 mag. Hmm, so does that mean mv <16? Or mv <=16? Wait, the question wording says "brighter than 17" for ESPRESSO and "brighter than
