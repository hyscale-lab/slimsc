Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power, like 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, with different dependence on r.

Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the angle at which the position of a star appears to shift when observed from two points in space. The formula I remember is that distance (r) is approximately 1 divided by the parallax (plx), but wait, I think it's more precise to say r ≈ 1 / plx, but in parsecs. So 1 parsec is the distance where the parallax is 1 arcsecond.

Wait, but in this problem, the number of stars (let's call it N) is proportional to 1/plx^5, right? So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

I need to express this in terms of distance r. Since r is related to 1/plx, maybe I can find a relationship between N and r.

Let me think. Parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/(r), but wait, that's if distance is in parsecs because plx in arcseconds times r in parsecs equals 1. So r = 1/plx. So plx = 1/r.

So substituting plx = 1/r into the expression N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

Let me write that down. N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Because plx is 1/r. So (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5. So 1 over that is r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. If N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/r, then 1/plx is r. So 1/plx^5 = (1/plx)^5 = r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So when distance r increases, the number of stars increases as r^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Hmm, does that affect anything? Or is it just asking about the functional dependence?

Wait, the question says, "How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" Oh, so maybe it's the change in N per unit change in r, which would be the derivative dN/dr. Or perhaps it's the differential, like for a small change in r, how much does N change. Or maybe it's just the relation of N as a function of r.

But the options are given in terms of ~ r^something. So perhaps it's simply the dependence, not the derivative.

Wait, the question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Then since plx = 1/r, N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of r. So the correct answer would be option B, which is ~ r^5.

But wait, let me think again. Let's say I have N = k / plx^5, where k is some constant. And plx = 1/r, so substituting, N = k * r^5. So N increases as r^5. So yes, option B is correct.

Alternatively, considering the inverse relationship, if I have more distance, the parallax is smaller. So 1/plx^5 would be a very large number when plx is small, implying more stars. Which makes sense because when looking further away, you're seeing more stars, but wait, how does that scale?

Wait, wait, hold on. Wait, this might not be correct because the number of stars in a given volume depends on the volume. Like, the number density of stars might be constant, so the number of stars up to a distance r would be proportional to r^3 (since volume increases as r^3). But wait, the question isn't about cumulative number, it's about the number varying as 1/plx^5. Hmm, perhaps the reasoning is different.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of stars per unit volume, or per some other measure. Oh, but let's think again.

The problem states that N varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So for each unit of distance, how does N change? Let's break it down.

Parallax plx = 1 / r (in parsecs). So plx = 1/r.

So N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5 = r^5.

So N is proportional to r^5. So when r increases, N increases as r^5.

Therefore, the correct option is B, which is ~ r^5. So the answer should be B.


The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) as \( N \propto 1/\text{plx}^5 \). Parallax is inversely related to distance (\( r \)), with \( \text{plx} = 1/r \) (in parsecs). Substituting \( \text{plx} = 1/r \) into the given proportionality, we find:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{(1/r)^5} = r^5.
\]

Thus, the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance. The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range of distance, \( r \)), and the options are expressed in terms of \( r \). Based on the derived relationship, \( N \propto r^5 \), the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
