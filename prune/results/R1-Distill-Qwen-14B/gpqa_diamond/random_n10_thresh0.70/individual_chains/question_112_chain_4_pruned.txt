Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: We have an electron described by the state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I remember that spin states for electrons are two-level systems, so |up> and |down> form a basis here.

The task is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Also, we need to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, wait. The matrix of the operator A is given. Let me write that out. Since it's a 2x2 matrix (because the state is two-dimensional), the elements are:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ ħ/2, 0 ] ]

Wait, because for i≠j, A_ij is ħ/2. So the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero, and the off-diagonal are ħ/2. So this operator looks familiar—it's similar to the Pauli X operator scaled by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

Wait, so the operator A is (ħ/2) σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix. That might be useful because the eigenstates of σ_x are known. Oh, right! The eigenstates of σ_x are the spin states in the x-direction, often denoted as |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

So, since A is proportional to σ_x, its eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, and the eigenvalues would be (ħ/2)*1 and (ħ/2)*(-1), because σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1.

Wait, no. Wait, σ_x multiplied by (ħ/2), so the eigenvalues would be (ħ/2)(1) and (ħ/2)(-1). So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

So the
