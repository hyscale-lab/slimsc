Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first reaction is heating it with excess KOH at 240°C, producing a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR and IR data are given for product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to give product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR, excluding those that exchange with the solvent.

Hmm, let me break this down.

First, what's 1,3-dibromoadamantane? Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3. Heating with KOH—probably an elimination or dehydrohalogenation reaction. Oh, wait, KOH in such conditions would likely lead to an E2 elimination. Since there are two bromine atoms, perhaps it's a double elimination, forming an alkene. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would need to lose two HBr molecules to form a diene? Or maybe it's an elimination to form a cyclopropane or some ring structure.

Wait, but more accurately, 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon treatment with KOH would undergo dehydrohalogenation twice. Each elimination would remove a Br and a β hydrogen, forming double bonds. But how does the structure of adamantane influence this?

Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings connected. So, 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent carbons, perhaps, making it possible for two eliminations to form a conjugated diene. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that two adjacent Br atoms would lead to the formation of a double bond. Wait, no, 1,3 are not adjacent; in adamantane, the positions are across, but I'm not exactly sure of the structure.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of this as a norbornene-like structure. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a bicyclic diene.

Wait, but looking at the NMR
