Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, what's given? The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I'm supposed to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think is the [Co(SCN)_2]²+ complex because dithiocyanato means two SCN ligands.

Wait, I remember that the stability constant, β, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex. So for each complex, the β is the constant for the formation of [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n), since Co²+ has a charge of +2, and each SCN is -1.

So the complexes would be:

- [Co(SCN)]^+ : n=1, β1=9
- [Co(SCN)_2]^0 : n=2, β2=40
- [Co(SCN)_3]^- : n=3, β3=63
- [Co(SCN)_4]^2- : n=4, β4=16

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. The β is the formation constant from the n-th complex. So for each step, the formation is adding one SCN. So for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, the formation would be adding a second SCN to [Co(SCN)]^+.

But when calculating the distribution of species, we have to consider all possible complexes and their concentrations based on the stability constants.

But wait, the problem is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So I think it's the second complex in the series.

The approach I think is to calculate the fraction of all cobalt species that are present as [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

But how to do that? I remember that the fractions can be found using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligands.

The formula for each species is [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) = β_n [Co²+] [SCN^-]^n.

But wait, the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all these complexes plus the free Co²+.

Alternatively, perhaps the fraction of each complex can be calculated using the stepwise formation constants and the ligand concentration.

But another approach is to use the cumulative formation constants. Let me think.

Wait, the cumulative formation constant, K_n, is the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn. So for each complex, the cumulative constant is K_n = β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

Wait, no, wait. No, the stepwise β is the constant for adding one more ligand. So βn is the constant for the nth ligand. So the cumulative constant K_n is the product of β1 to βn.

Yes, correct. So
