Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with EDTA. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds to metal ions like calcium. The question says we have a 0.02 M solution of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions.

Wait, so the complex is Ca-EDTA, and the solution is at stoichiometric concentration. I think that means the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, which is the total concentration of Ca and EDTA as the complex. Because EDTA usually forms a 1:1 complex with Ca²+.

I remember that the formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in this case, the solution is at stoichiometric concentration. So, if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, that means that all the Ca and EDTA are bound into the complex. Or does it? No, wait, no, because in solution, some of the Ca and EDTA might dissociate. So, the Kf is given, and we can use it to find the concentration of free Ca²+.

Let me think. The total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. But wait, is that the case? Or is the 0.02 M the total concentration of Ca in solution, considering the complex?

Wait, the problem states it's a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So I think that means the concentration of the complex itself is 0.02 M. So the total Ca in solution is 0.02 M because each complex has one Ca²+.

But wait, no, no. Because the Ca is in the complex. So the total concentration of Ca (bound plus free) is 0.02 M. Similarly, the EDTA (bound plus free) is also 0.02 M, assuming stoichiometry 1:1.

Wait, but in reality
