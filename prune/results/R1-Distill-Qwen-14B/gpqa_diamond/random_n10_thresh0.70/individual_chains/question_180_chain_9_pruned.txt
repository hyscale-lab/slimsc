Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are A to D.

Hmm. So the setup is that point P has one charge, and the other 12 are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. Since all the charges are the same, this must be some kind of electrostatic potential problem, right?

So I'm thinking about electric potential energy. When dealing with multiple charges, the potential energy is the work done to bring each charge from infinity to their positions. But wait, in this case, the 13th charge is fixed, so maybe we're considering the potential energy between the 12 moving charges and the fixed one.

Wait, the system is isolated, so we're probably looking for the electrostatic potential energy of the system as a whole.

Each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from P, where the 13th charge is fixed. So each of these 12 charges is 2 meters away from the fixed charge. So each contributes to the potential energy between them.

Wait, but wait. Since all the 12 are identical and at the same distance from P, maybe the total potential energy comes from two parts:
