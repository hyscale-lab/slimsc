Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and I need to identify the final product. The options are A to D. The data given are IR and 1H NMR spectra.

First, I need to analyze the spectral data to determine the structure of Compound X. Then, understand the reaction conditions to predict the product.

Starting with the IR data: the peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches, but since the options are carboxylic acids and benzene derivatives, probably O-H. But wait, the other peaks are 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm-1. 1720 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which could be from a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 might be aromatic C=C stretches, which makes sense if there's a benzene ring.

Looking at the NMR data: The 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet (bs) for 1H. That's a strong sign of an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm and appear as singlets. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid proton is also around 10-12 ppm, but those tend to be broad due to hydrogen bonding. The 8.0 ppm doublet (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm doublet (d, 2H) suggest a para-substituted benzene ring because the two sets of two protons each would be in a para arrangement. So, maybe the compound is a para-substituted aromatic with a substituent that has a carbonyl group.

Looking at the other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d, 3H), and 0.9 (t, 3H). The 0.9 triplet suggests a methyl group attached to a CH2, like in an ethyl group. The 1.4 doublet is probably a methyl attached to a CH, as in (CH2CH(CH3)) something. Wait, the 2.9 multiplet with 1H and 1.7 with 2H could be a propyl chain or something like that.

Putting this together: The aromatic ring has substituents in the para positions. One substituent is a carbonyl group (from IR 1720), which could be a ketone or a carboxylic acid. The other substituent is an alkyl group.

Wait, but the NMR has 10.5 as a broad singlet. If it were a carboxylic acid, that would make sense because the –COOH proton is usually around 10-12 ppm. But sometimes, the O-H in phenols is around 5 ppm, but that's broader. Wait, but the 10.5 is a broad singlet, which is more indicative of a carboxylic acid.

So, assuming that the compound has a para-substituted benzene ring with a –COOH group and another substituent.

Looking at the NMR shifts again: The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH next to a carbonyl, like in a ketone or an ester. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be CH2 groups adjacent to that. The 1.4 (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH, perhaps as in a CH(CH3) group. And the 0.9 (t, 3H) is a terminal CH3, like an ethyl group.

Hmm, maybe the substituent on the benzene is a propyl group attached in some fashion. Let me think about the structure.

If the aromatic ring has a –COOH group at one position and another group at the para position, and that other substituent is an alkyl chain, perhaps a branched one. For example, maybe it's a –CH2CH(CH3)2 group or something. Wait, but let's think about the substituent.

Looking at the substituent's NMR: The 2.9 is a multiplet for 1H, which might be a CH attached to another CH2. The 1.7 is two Hs as a multiplet, perhaps adjacent to that CH. The 1.4 doublet (3H) is a methyl attached to a CH, like CH(CH3) something. The 0.9 triplet (3H) is likely a CH2CH3 group.

Putting it all together, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Wait, what's a sec-butyl? It's CH2CH(CH2CH3)– but wait, no. Wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH2CH3)–, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, sec-butyl is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no. Let me visualize. The substituent is an isobutyl group? Because the substituent would have a CH that's connected to two CH2 groups or something.

Wait, the substituent might be a propyl group with a branch. Let me try to figure it out.

Looking at the substituent's NMR:

The 2.9 (m, 1H) suggests a single proton in a complex environment, perhaps a CH group adjacent to another CH2.

The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be two protons on a CH2 connected to the CH (from 2.9). The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to the CH. So, perhaps the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-something.

Wait, that would make it a isopropyl group. But the 0.9 (t, 3H) suggests an ethyl group. So maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a butyl group. Let's see: The substituent on the benzene is a propyl chain, maybe. But wait, the substituent could be a pentyl group, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached through a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, another approach: The substituent in the benzene is a chain that includes a carbonyl group. Wait, no, because the IR carbonyl is at 1720, which is more like a ketone or aldehyde or carboxylic acid. But if the substituent is an alkyl group, perhaps the benzene has a carbonyl substituent on one side and an alkyl on the other.

Wait, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a –COOH group and a –O– group? No, because the options don't show that. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzene ring with a –COOH and a –CH2CH(CH3)2 group or something like that.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let me think about the substituent's structure. The NMR indicates:

- 0.9 t: 3H => this is likely a CH2CH3 group, so an ethyl somewhere.

- 1.4 d (3H): this is a CH(CH3) group.

- 1.7 m (2H): maybe a CH2 connected to the CH from the 2
