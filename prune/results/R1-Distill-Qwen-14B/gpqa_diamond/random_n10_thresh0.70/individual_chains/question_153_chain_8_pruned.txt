Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Michael addition problem. I've got three different reactions here, each labeled A, B, and C. I need to figure out the products for each and then match them with the options given. Let me take it step by step.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate under NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH. NaOEt is a strong base, so it probably deprotonates something to form an enolate. Dimethyl malonate is a good enolate donor, meaning it can easily form the enolate ion. The other reactant is an acrylate, which has an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group, making it a good Michael acceptor.

In a Michael addition, the enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β position of the acceptor. So the enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the β carbon of the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The E configuration means the substituents on the double bond are on opposite sides, but I think that might not affect the product structure as much as the regiochemistry.

So, when the enolate attacks, it adds to the β position of the acrylate. Let me visualize this: dimethyl malonate has two methyl groups on the central carbon (the malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2). The enolate would form on the central carbon, so when it attacks, it would add across the double bond. The acrylate has a p-tolyl group on the β carbon. After the attack, the structure would have the malonate part attached to the acrylate's β carbon. Then, when the reaction is done, the product would have a new carbon-carbon bond.

Wait, the product would be a trimethyl something. Let me think about the structure. The acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait no, the structure is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but 3-(p-tolyl) would mean the p-tolyl is on the third carbon. Wait, wait, the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the substituent is on the β position. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me write the structure:

The acrylate is (E)-methyl 3-(p-tolyl)prop-2-enoate. So, it's CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Wait, no. Wait, prop-2-enoate is CH2=CHCOO-. So, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So, 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon—maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3? No,
