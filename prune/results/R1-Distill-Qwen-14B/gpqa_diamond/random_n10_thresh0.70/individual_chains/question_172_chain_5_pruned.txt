Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let's see what it says. It mentions that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the excitation of atoms relates to the temperature through the Boltzmann equation. 

The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, that number looks familiar. Oh, that's the Boltzmann constant multiplied by a temperature difference? Let me think. The Boltzmann constant k is about 1.38e-23 J/K, right. So the energy difference ΔE is k * T_avg or something like that? Or wait, no, the energy difference is given, so maybe that's used in the Boltzmann factor.

The question says the photospheres are in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So the Boltzmann distribution applies. The excitation levels are related to temperature. The ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor: (n_i / n_j) = exp( -(ΔE)/(k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference between levels i and j, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So for the same energy levels, the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n_1 / n_2 = 2. But wait, wait, the question says "twice as excited in a specific energy level". So I think that's the ratio of the populations in that level compared to the ground state, or maybe compared to another level? Or perhaps it's the ratio between the two stars for the same level.

Wait, the way the problem is phrased: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So for the same energy level, the number in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So n1 = 2 * n2.

But no, wait, perhaps it's about the ratio of their populations for the same level in each star. So (n_i)_1 / (n_j)_1 = something, and similarly for star_2. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the excitation
