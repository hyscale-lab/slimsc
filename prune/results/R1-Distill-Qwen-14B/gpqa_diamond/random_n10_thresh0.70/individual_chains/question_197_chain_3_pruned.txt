Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow because I'm still learning.

The question is about identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically involved in some kind of substitution reaction. Oh right, that's the HI in the presence of a phosphorus, which probably means it's a hydrolysis reaction, maybe going through an SN2 mechanism or something like that. Or wait, maybe it's a substitution where a leaving group is replaced by an iodide.

Looking at the data given: IR and NMR of Compound X. I need to figure out what Compound X is first, and then determine what happens when it reacts with those reagents.

Starting with the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1. That broad range suggests maybe an -OH group or an alkyne. The 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, probably a ketone or ester or maybe an acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching, so there's probably a benzene ring in the molecule.

Now the NMR data. Let's break it down.

1H NMR:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. Broad usually means it's exchanging, like an -OH proton in an acid. But wait, benzoic acid's -OH is usually around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton, but those are usually around 9-10. But aldehydes have a triplet in the IR around 2800, which I don't see here. So maybe this is an -OH from a carboxylic acid group. So maybe the compound has a benzene ring and a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but another thought: the IR doesn't show a broad O-H stretch around 3000-3500 cm-1, which is typical for carboxylic acids. Instead, the IR shows 3400-2500, which could be an -OH, but maybe it's an -NH group? Or perhaps an alky
