Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question involves titration of acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, it's a neutralization reaction.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Alright, first, I think I should figure out the concentrations after dilution. Wait, when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and after adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³.

So the initial moles of acetic acid would be volume (L) multiplied by molarity. Let me calculate that. 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So moles = 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles of acetic acid.

After dilution, the volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So the new concentration is moles divided by volume. 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So moles of NaOH needed would be 0.001 moles, right? Because each mole of acetic acid reacts with one mole of NaOH.

So the volume of NaOH needed at equivalence is moles/volume. Wait, actually, the formula is volume = moles / concentration. So V = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is reached when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question is about 25% titration. So, 25% of the equivalence point volume. 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Wait, but in a titration, when you add a strong base to a weak acid, the reaction is HC2H3O2 + OH- → C2H3O2^- + H2O. The OH- comes from NaOH, which is a strong base, so it dissociates completely.

At 25% titration, only a quarter of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So, the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol of HC2H3O2 has reacted with NaOH. So, the moles of conjugate base (acetate ion) formed would be 0.00025 mol. And the remaining unreacted acetic acid would be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

But wait, the total volume now is the initial diluted solution (40 cm³) plus the NaOH added (2.5 cm³). So, 42.5 cm³ total volume, which is 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[HC2H3O2] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = let's calculate that. 0.00075 divided by 0.0425. Hmm, 0.00075 is 7.5e-4. 42.5e-3 liters. So 7.5e-4 / 4.25e-2 = (7.5 /4.25) * 1e-2. 7.5 /4.25 is about 1.7647, so 0.017647 M. Let's say approximately 0.0176 M.

[acetate] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M. Approximately 0.00588 M.

Wait, but wait, wait. We can also consider the dilution of the solution when adding NaOH. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would be easier here. Because we have a buffer solution at 25% tit
