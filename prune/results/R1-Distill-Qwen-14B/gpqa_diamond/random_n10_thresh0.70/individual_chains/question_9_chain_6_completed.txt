Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. Hmm, C3h symmetry... I remember that C3h is a type of molecular symmetry. The letters in the symmetry groups usually stand for certain operations. Let me think. Oh right, C stands for a cyclic group, and the h probably indicates a horizontal mirror plane. So C3h would involve a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror.

The options are four molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone, and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

First, I should probably recall what each of these molecules looks like. I remember triisopropyl borate is a borane with three isopropyl groups attached. Its structure is something like B with three bulky isopropyl substituents. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic amine, I think, with a bridge structure. It's a saturated molecule, maybe with a cage-like structure.

The other two options are more complex. The benzo... one looks like a fused ring system, maybe something with a benzene ring fused to furan rings. And the triphenyleno... one probably has phenyl groups attached to a furan structure as well.

Wait, but symmetry is key here. I need to figure out which of these has a three-fold axis with a horizontal mirror. Or wait, C3h symmetry includes a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule should have a three-fold axis perpendicular to the mirror plane.

Let me think about each option:

1. Triisopropyl borate: Boron has three isopropyl groups. The structure is trigonal planar, right? So the molecule is symmetric with a C3 axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Well, if the molecule is planar, like the three substituents are arranged in a trigonal planar around B, then there might be a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, but is that the case for triisopropyl borate? I think in such compounds, the molecule is non-planar because the substituents are bulky. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Triisopropyl borane would have a trigonal planar geometry, so the molecule is symmetric with a C3 axis, but does it have a horizontal mirror? Hmm. Maybe not, because the mirror would be in the plane of the boron. Or perhaps it's in a different orientation. I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

2. Quinuclidine: This molecule is a bicyclic system with a bridge. The structure is like a cube where one corner is replaced by an NH group. Wait, quinuclidine has a [2.2.2] cage structure. It's a bridged bicyclic amine. Does it have C3h symmetry? I'm not sure. Quinuclidine has a high degree of symmetry but I think it belongs to a different point group, perhaps S4 or something else. Wait, I think quinuclidine is tetrahedral, but with specific symmetry elements. Alternatively, maybe it has a three-fold axis. Wait, no. Quinuclidine has a structure where the nitrogen is in a bridgehead position, leading to a certain symmetry. I'm not entirely sure about its symmetry group.

3. Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone: Hmm, that's a mouthful. So it's a trifuran system with a benzo ring fused. Let's break it down. Trifuran is three fused furan rings, right? Benzo would add a benzene ring fused to one part. Wait, the brackets show the fusion points. So the benzo is fused at positions [1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']. Trifuran has three rings, and the benzo is adding another ring. But wait, benzo[...]trifuran... might have a structure where a benzene is fused to the trifuran system. Then, the molecule would have a certain symmetry. For it to have C3h symmetry, perhaps the structure is symmetric around a three-fold axis, with a horizontal mirror.

4. Triphenyleno[...]trifuran...: This sounds like a similar structure, but with phenyl groups attached. Triphenyleno suggests three phenyl groups attached to the trifuran system. So the structure is a trifuran core with three phenyl substituents. The question is about symmetry. If the phenyl groups are symmetrically placed, perhaps in a trigonal arrangement, then the molecule could have C3h symmetry.

Wait, let me think about symmetry elements. For C3h, you need a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (h) perpendicular to that axis. So the molecule should look the same when rotated 120 degrees around the C3 axis and also have a mirror plane that is horizontal relative to that axis.

Triisopropyl borate: The molecule has three identical substituents (isopropyl groups) around B. So the structure is trigonal planar, which suggests a C3 axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror? If the molecule is flat, the mirror plane would be through the B atom, but that's the same plane as the C3 axis, so it's a sigma (σ) plane, not a pi (π) plane. Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. The point group for trigonal planar is D3h. Oh, right! D3h has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So triisopropyl borate would have D3h symmetry, which includes C3h as a subgroup? Wait, no. The D3h group is the symmetry group itself, which includes C3, three C2 axes, and horizontal mirrors. So if the molecule is in D3h, then it does have C3h symmetry. So option C (triisopropyl borate) might be the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm not so sure. Let me check the other options. If triisopropyl borate has D3h symmetry, then it must have a horizontal mirror plane. But in reality, is triisopropyl borane planar? Because borane is usually tetrahedral. Oh wait, no! Triisopropyl borane is a trigonal planar molecule. Boron is in the center with three isopropyl groups. Since it's trigonal planar, the symmetry is D3h. So that would include a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So that would make it have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but what about the other options. Let's think about quinuclidine. Quinuclidine has a cage-like structure, maybe with a bridge. Its structure is a bicyclic system with a bridge between the two nitrogen atoms. Wait, no, quinuclidine is a bridged bicyclic amine, with a bridged structure. Its structure is [2.2.2]bicyclo system, so the molecule is actually quite symmetric. I think its point group is S4, which includes a four-fold screw axis. So that wouldn't fit C3h symmetry.

The other two options are more complex. For the benzo-trifuran and triphenyleno-trifuran systems. Let me think about the benzo one. If the benzo ring is fused to the trifuran system, the symmetry might be lower. The substituents (like the ketones in the hexaone) might disrupt higher symmetry. The same would apply to the triphenyleno... molecule. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, perhaps in a trigonal fashion, then C3h symmetry could be present.

Wait, but the benzo... structure has a benzene ring fused. Benzo rings are symmetric, but perhaps the overall structure might not have a three-fold axis. Let me imagine: if the benzo is attached in a way that creates a three-fold symmetry, then yes. Alternatively, if the substituents are placed at 120-degree intervals around the molecule, that would suggest a C3 axis.

Alternatively, the triphenyleno... structure has three phenyl groups attached. If they're attached in a trigonal arrangement, then the molecule would have a C3 axis and perhaps a horizontal mirror.

Wait, but I think the key is that triisopropyl borate has D3h symmetry, so it definitely has C3h. But I'm not entirely sure about this. Alternatively, maybe the triphenyleno... compound has higher symmetry. Let me imagine: if it's a trifuran core with three phenyl groups attached, and they're placed symmetrically at 120 degrees apart, then yes. So the molecule would have a three-fold axis and a mirror plane.

Wait, but looking at the option labels: options A and B are the two complex molecules. So if the molecule is a trifuran with three substituents arranged symmetrically, then it would have C3h symmetry. So either option A or B could be correct.

Wait, let's think again about the D3h group. Triisopropyl borate is trigonal planar, so yes, D3h. Hence, C3h would be a part of that symmetry. So the molecule would have C3h symmetry. So option C is triisopropyl borate, which should be correct.

But wait, the question is which has C3h symmetry. So if triisopropyl borate is in D3h, then it does have C3h. So option C is correct. But then why are the other options included? Let me make sure.

Another approach: think about the structures. Triisopropyl borate has a planar trigonal structure. So when you rotate it by 120 degrees, it looks the same. And a horizontal mirror plane would reflect it onto itself. So yes, C3h symmetry.

Quinuclidine, as I thought, has a different symmetry, maybe lower. The other molecules, benzo and triphenylene, probably have a different kind of symmetry. For example, if the substituents are in a different arrangement, perhaps a four-fold symmetry or lower.

So, the correct answer would be triisopropyl borate, which is option C.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on their structures and symmetry properties. **C₃h** symmetry involves a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (h) perpendicular to this axis. 

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule consists of a trifuran core with three phenyl groups attached. For it to have **C₃h** symmetry, the phenyl groups must be arranged symmetrically at 120° intervals around the molecule. However, the fused ring system and substituents likely disrupt the required symmetry, making this option unlikely.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule is a benzo-fused trifuran system with ketone groups. The fused benzene ring and additional substituents likely lower the symmetry. While the trifuran core might suggest some rotational symmetry, the overall structure does not align with the **C₃h** symmetry requirements.

### Option C: Triisopropyl borate  
Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar geometry with three identical isopropyl groups arranged symmetrically around the boron atom. This structure exhibits **D₃h** symmetry, which includes a **C₃** axis and a horizontal mirror plane (h). Since **C₃h** is a subgroup of **D₃h**, this molecule satisfies the **C₃h** symmetry criteria.

### Option D: Quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic amine with a [2.2.2] cage-like structure. Its symmetry is described by the **S₄** group, which involves a four-fold screw axis, not a three-fold axis with a horizontal mirror plane. Therefore, it does not exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

### Conclusion  
Among the options, **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) is the only molecule that satisfies the **C₃h** symmetry requirements due to its trigonal planar geometry and **D₃h** symmetry group.

**Answer: C**
