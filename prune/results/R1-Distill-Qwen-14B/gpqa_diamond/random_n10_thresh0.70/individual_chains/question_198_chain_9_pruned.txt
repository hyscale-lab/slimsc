Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and thiocyanate ions. Hmm, I need to figure out the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution. Let's see what I remember from my studies.

Alright, the problem states that the solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The concentrations are given: cobalt is 1e-2 M, and SCN- is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So, the β values are increasing up to β3 and then β4 is lower. That's interesting.

Wait, stability constants are the formation constants, right? So, for each step, βn = [Co(SCN)_n^2+]/([Co^{2+}][SCN^-]^n). So, each β represents the formation of the next complex.

The complexes would be Co(SCN)_1, Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3, Co(SCN)_4. Each subsequent complex has an additional SCN- ligand. The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2^2+ ion. Dithiocyanato implies two SCN- ligands.

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit confused. Dithiocyanato? Oh, wait, no, maybe the blue complex is the tetra-aqua dithiocyanato? Or perhaps the blue is the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex. Alternatively, I'm not sure, but the question specifies the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would imply two SCN- ligands. So the complex is [Co(SCN)_2(H2O)_4]^2+. Or maybe it's another structure, but for the sake of this problem, I'll assume that the blue complex is the one with two SCN- ligands, which is the second complex in the series.

So, the problem is to find the fraction of Co in the form of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ among all Co species.

The approach is probably to calculate the distribution of Co among the different complexes. Since the stability constants are given, we can model the formation of each complex step by step.

The total concentration of Co is given as 1e-2 M
