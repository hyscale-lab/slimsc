Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Let's see what I remember about these reactions.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me break it down. I see "cyclohexyl" groups, a hydroxymethyl group attached, and a carbaldehyde group. So, it looks like we have two cyclohexane rings connected with some substituents.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynyl means a triple bond attached to the cyclohexane ring. So, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (CH2-C≡CH, perhaps? Or maybe it's cyclohexane with a triple bond substituent, like C≡C-CH2- attached? Wait, ethynyl is C≡C-H, so maybe it's cyclohexyl attached to a carbon that's triple bonded to another carbon. So, structure like cyclohexane-C≡CH?

The goal is to get a molecule that has a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and a carbaldehyde group attached. Wait, perhaps I should draw this out.

Wait, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The main chain seems to be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a -CHO group attached. The substituent is at position 1, which is the same as the position where the cyclohexane is attached. So the substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, that's a methylene group (CH2-) attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

So the substituent is -CH(OH)-cyclohexane. So putting it all together, the molecule is cyclohexane with a -CHO group and another substituent which is a CH2-OH connected to a cyclohexyl group. Wait, no, the substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl, which would be a CH2 group where one H is replaced by a hydroxyl and the other by cyclohexyl. So it's like
