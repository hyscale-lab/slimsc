Okay, so I have this astronomy question here. Let me read it again. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance in a specific region of the sky. Hmm, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the power of 5. Oh wait, they've told me the relation is 1/plx^5. So I need to figure out how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range.

Wait, I remember that parallax (plx) is inversely related to distance. So parallax plx = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So as distance increases, parallax decreases. That makes sense because the closer a star is, the larger its parallax.

The problem says the number of stars N varies with 1/plx^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/d (where d is distance), substituting that in gives N ∝ 1/( (1/d)^5 ) → which is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So maybe they're asking for the derivative of N with respect to distance. Because the question says "per unit range of distance, r". Hmm, perhaps the number per unit distance.

Wait, N is proportional to d^5. So if I think about the number of stars in a shell between d and d + dr, that's the differential number. The differential of N with respect to d would be dN/dd = 5d^4. But if
