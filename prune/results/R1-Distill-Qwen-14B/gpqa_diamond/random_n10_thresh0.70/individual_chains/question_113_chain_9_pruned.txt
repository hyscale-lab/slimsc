Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with C6H something O or O2. Let's break down the information given.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, if it's a very broad peak, maybe it's an alcohol, because carboxylic acids tend to have a broader and often stronger peak, but sometimes the broadness can vary. Also, the presence of two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Those look like they could be carbonyl groups. The 1700 is probably a carbonyl (maybe a ketone or ester), and 1650 could be another carbonyl—maybe an ester or something else. Alternatively, maybe one is a C=O and the other is a C=C? Wait, no, C=C is usually around 1600-1680. So 1700 is more likely a carbonyl. Maybe the compound has two different types of carbonyl groups. Or perhaps one is the main carbonyl and the other is something else, like an aromatic ring (but that's usually lower). Hmm.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum has peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond. So maybe it's an ester with a double bond or something else. Also, because it's an NMR, the integration can tell us about the structure, but I don't have that data here.

Then, the Mass Spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. I'm trying to think of what fragments give m/z 45. Common fragments with that mass could be a methyl group attached to something else. Wait, 45 is CH3O? No, wait, CH3O would be 32 (12+16). Or maybe the fragment is (CH2)2O or something? Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketene ion or something else. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of something like (CH3)2O—wait, no. Molecular weight of 45: Let's calculate. 12 for C, 1 for H, 16 for O. Let's see: 45 could be C3H7O? Or maybe C2H5O2? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a loss of something. For example, if the molecule breaks off a fragment that's 45, like perhaps an ester group losing the R-, but I'm not so sure. Or perhaps it's a fragment like an ethylene glycol unit or something else. Alternatively, another common fragment is the CH2=CH-O- group, but I don't know.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A) C6H12O2
Option B) C6H10O
Option C) C6H10O2
Option D) C6H12O

So, the molecular formulas are all C6, but varying in H and O. Let's think about the possible structures each could have.

FTIR has O-H (from the broad peak). So the compound has an O-H group. So that suggests either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the IR would have a very broad peak, perhaps stronger than an alcohol. Also, the 1700 cm^-1 peak could be a carbonyl in an ester or ketone. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700, and maybe a strong O-H. Let me think.

But wait, in the IR data, the broad peak is at 3000. That's a region for O-H, but also perhaps N-H, but here it's more likely O-H. So maybe an alcohol. But then, what about the 1700 and 1650 peaks. 1700 is a carbonyl, so perhaps an ester group. Because esters have a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe a ketone and another group.

Wait, esters have two carbonyl peaks? Or no, esters have a single carbonyl. Hmm. Let me think. An ester has one carbonyl group, typically around 1700-1750. So why is there a peak at 1650? Maybe another carbonyl group, but that's a bit low. Or perhaps it's conjugated. For example, in an aromatic ester, the carbonyl might be lower. Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. Because in such a structure, the carbonyl could be at a lower wavenumber due to conjug
