Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, let me read the question again. The question is asking which stars can be detected by both spectrographs. The key point is their apparent V magnitudes because both instruments have brightness limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, and HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 mag. So a star must have an apparent V magnitude (m) that is less than or equal to 16 mag because that's the brighter limit for HIRES. Wait, no, no, wait. Wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, they can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. Oh wait, no—apparent magnitude is such that lower numbers are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag in V, meaning its apparent magnitude is less than 17, ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, for HIRES, stars brighter than 16 mag are observed, so m < 16.

So a star must have apparent V magnitude ≤ 16 to be seen by HIRES, and ≤17 to be seen by ESPRESSO. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. Brighter than 17 means m <17. Similarly, with HIRES, brighter than 16, so m <16.

So a star that can be detected by both would have m ≤16, because that's the stricter condition. Because if a star is visible to HIRES (m <16), it's automatically visible to ESPRESSO since 16 <17.

But wait, no. Because if a star's apparent magnitude is 16.5, it's brighter than 17? No, 16.5 is brighter than 17, right? Because lower magnitudes are brighter. Wait, wait: wait, no. Wait, 17 mag is fainter than 16.5. So a star with apparent magnitude 16.5 is brighter than 17, correct. So any star with m <17 can be seen by ESPRESSO. But to be seen by HIRES, it must have m <16
