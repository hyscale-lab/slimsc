Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through. The question is about wave functions and normalization. Hmm, right, wave functions need to be normalized so that the total probability is 1. I remember that the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1.

The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that seems a bit strange. Normally, the wave function would be a complex function, but I'm trying to remember if this is a stationary state or something else. Oh, and the problem says that when measuring position, particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. So, the wave function must be zero outside this region. But wait, the wave function here is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That suggests it's non-zero only in a specific area.

Wait, but the wave function is given, but perhaps the actual function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3. Oh, but the expression is written as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So, maybe this is the form in the region where it's non-zero, and zero elsewhere. So, for the normalization integral, I need to integrate from x=1 to x=3.

The wave function is ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1 + x)] - 0.5i. To find the normalization constant 'a', I need to compute the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from
