Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers should observe that one. Both planets are Earth-like and have been detected by the radial velocity (RV) method. I remember that the RV method gives us the minimum mass, but since both have the same mass, that part might not matter as much here.

The key factors for the transit probability are the orbital period and the size of the star, I think. Because the probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The formula I recall for the probability is something like (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis. Wait, actually, more precisely, the transit probability is proportional to (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since Earth's radius is small compared to stars, R_planet is negligible. So maybe it's approximately R_star / a.

Wait, no, the transit probability is actually the ratio of the area of the planet's disk to the area of the star's disk. But wait, no, that's for the depth of the transit. No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The probability of a transit happening depends on the alignment. The probability is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, but that's actually the approximate equation for the probability. So as a increases, the probability decreases. Because if the planet's orbit is more distant, the chance that it passes in front of the star from our perspective is smaller.

Wait, but the orbital period is related to the semi-major axis
