Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Let me read the setup again. So, Ay is given by c multiplied by S, where c is h over 4π, and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is [0, -i], and the second is [i, 0]. So, let me write down what S looks like.

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

Then, Ay = c * S, with c = h/(4π). So the matrix Ay would be:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

I remember that for angular momentum operators, the eigenvalues are related to the possible values of the component. Since this is a 2x2 matrix, it's spin-1/2, like the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, isn't S similar to the Pauli matrices? Let me think: Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. The given S looks like σy, but let me check.

Wait, σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], exactly like S. So S is the Pauli Y matrix. So Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

I need to find the eigenvalues of Ay. The eigenvalues of a matrix satisfy det(Ay - aI) = 0. So let's compute that.

First, the matrix Ay is:

[ [0, -(i h/(4π)) ],
  [ (i h/(4π)), 0 ] ]

So let's write Ay - a I as:

[ [ -a , -(i h/(4π)) ],
  [ (i h/(4π)), -a ] ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) ] = a^2 - [ (-i^2) (h/(4π))^2 ]

Wait, i times -i is -i^2, which is -(-1) = 1. So the term becomes (h/(4π))^2 * (1), because the two i's multiply to i^2, which is -1, but there are two negative signs outside.

Wait, let me compute the product (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)).

Multiply the scalars: i * (-i) = -i^2 = -(-1) = 1. Then multiply (h/(4π))^2.

So the determinant becomes a^2 - (1) * (h/(4π))^2 = 0.

So a^2 = (h/(4π))^2 → a = ± h/(4π)

Wait, but wait, wait a second. Wait, the determinant is:

a^2 - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) ] = a^2 - [ (i * -i) (h^2/(4π)^2) ) ]

i * -i is -i² = -(-1) = 1. So yes, determinant becomes a^2 - (h/(4π))^2 =0.

So the eigenvalues a are ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues of Ay are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). These are real numbers, right? So the eigenvalues are real and equal to ±c, since c is h/(4π). So any option that says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts must be incorrect.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). But wait, the eigenvalues are real, so the imaginary parts are zero. So option A is wrong because it claims imaginary parts are present.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Also wrong for the same reason; our eigenvalues are real.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A². Hmm. Well, since A is the angular momentum operator, A² has eigenvalues a(a+1)
