Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question asks for the speed of the light relative to the observer. Oh wait, and the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1, so that's our unit here.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with light in a medium, the speed depends on the refractive index. Normally, the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n. But here, the medium (the glass) is moving, so I think I need to apply some relativity here. Because the glass is moving, the observer in the lab frame would see the light moving differently than just v = 1/n.

Wait, but wait, in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. Oh right, the velocity addition formula. The formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/cÂ²). But wait, since c is 1, that might simplify things. Hmm.

Wait, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the glass is moving towards the observer. Wait no, the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass. Wait, no, the glass is moving towards the observer. Wait, the setup is a bit confusing. Let me read it again.

The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Oh, so the beam is moving towards the observer,
