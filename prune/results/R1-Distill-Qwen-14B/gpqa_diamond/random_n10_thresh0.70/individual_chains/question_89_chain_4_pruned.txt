Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the problem again and break it down.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. The product is a light yellow solid, product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to give product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm, okay, so I need to figure out what each reaction step does and the structures of the products.

Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. The 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on two of the bridgehead carbons. When you treat a dibromide with KOH, especially in a high-temperature condition, it's likely an elimination reaction. Wait, but KOH in what solvent? If it's a vicinal dihalide, like 1,2-dibromo, elimination would form an alkene. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a diegeminal dibromide? No, wait. The 1 and 3 positions are bridgehead carbons. So each has a Br.

Wait, when you heat a dihalide with KOH, especially in a strong base like KOH, it's probably an elimination reaction. But since both Brs are on bridgehead carbons, which are usually quaternary and don't have H's, so elimination might not be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but wait, if each C has only one Br, perhaps it's more of a substitution? No, because substitution would require a good leaving group and a base. Wait, but adamantane is a very rigid structure.

Wait, another thought: when KOH is used with vicinal dihalides, it can lead to elimination, forming alkenes. But in this case, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a vicinal dihalide. So maybe it's an E2 elimination, but can it form a double bond between the 1 and 3 positions? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, is the reaction a dehydrohalogenation, but perhaps leading to an allene or some other structure? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the product's NMR. Product 1 has an IR absorbance at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl peak, so maybe a ketone or ester. The NMR of product 1 has peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is probably an OCH2 group, maybe from a diol or a hemiacetal? Or perhaps an ether? Wait, but 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl, so maybe a ketone.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an epoxide? But no, the IR of an epoxide isn't typically around 1720. That's more like a carbonyl. So more likely, product 1 is a cyclic ketone. But how?

Wait, maybe the reaction is a pinacol-like rearrangement. Wait, pinacol rearrangement is when a 1,2-diol loses water to form a carbonyl, but I'm not sure if that applies here. Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing a cleavage of the C-Br bonds, but as the molecule is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. Wait, but if both Brs are on bridgehead carbons, could elimination form a double bond between them, making an allene? But that doesn't explain the carbonyl peak.

Wait, perhaps it's an elimination to form an enol ether? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. But if the
