Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Let me think about this step by step.

Wait, I remember parallax is related to distance. Right, the parallax of a star (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to its distance from us. So a star that's closer has a larger parallax. Like, plx = 1/distance in parsecs. Oh wait, that's right. So if a star is closer (smaller distance), the parallax is larger.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. So that probably means that their actual distances are spread out uniformly in space. But how does that translate into their distribution in terms of parallax?

So, the number of stars per unit parallax interval. Let me think about the volume of space at a certain distance. If we take a thin shell of stars at a distance d, the volume of that shell is the surface area of a sphere (4πr²) multiplied by the thickness (dr). The number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the volume, assuming uniform distribution.

But parallax is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So let's express everything in terms of parallax (p). Let me substitute d with 1/p. So the volume element in terms of p would involve derivatives because we're changing variables.

The number of stars per unit volume is uniform, so number density n is constant. So the number of stars in a volume dV is n * dV.

Now, dV is 4πd² * dd, where dd is the thickness in distance. But since we're talking about a change in parallax, I need to relate dd to a change in p. Because p = 1/d, so d = 1/p. Then, dd = -1/p² * dp. The negative sign indicates that as p increases, d decreases, but the magnitude is what matters here.

Substituting d into the expression for dV: dV = 4π (1/p)² * (-1/p²) dp. Wait, wait. Let me make sure. If p = 1/d, then dp = - (1/d²) dd. So dp = -p² dd. So, dd = - dp/(p²). The negative indicates direction, but when considering the volume, we take the absolute value, so dd = dp/(p²).

So the volume element becomes dV = 4π d²
