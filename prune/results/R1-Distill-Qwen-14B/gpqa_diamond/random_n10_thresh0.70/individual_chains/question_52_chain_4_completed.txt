Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question talks about a star with some specific parameters and how the presence of dark spots affects the temperature and the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels.

So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) and how this ratio changes when the star has spots.

Wait, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, that ratio is lower than when it doesn't. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—meaning, what's the ratio of (ratio without spots) divided by (ratio with spots)?

The problem states that the transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. I'm assuming this is an emission or absorption line, but since it's about the ratio of populations in two levels, maybe it's about the Boltzmann equation.

Oh right, the Boltzmann distribution. In Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the ratio of their statistical weights multiplied by an exponential factor involving the energy difference and temperature.

The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Here, E2 is the energy of level 2, E1 of level 1. So the ratio is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1.

But wait, the energy difference can be expressed in terms of the photon's wavelength. Oh, right, because the energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. So if the transition corresponds to λ=1448 Å, then the energy difference ΔE is hc/(λ). But wait, which level is higher? Well, when an electron transitions from a higher to a lower energy level, it emits a photon. So if the star is emitting at 1448 Å when it's hotter, that would be a transition from level 2 to level 1, meaning E2 > E1. So ΔE = E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

But wait, wait. If the star is hotter, more ionization would happen. But here, the spots are cooler, but the overall photosphere's effective temperature is lower when spots are present. Hmm. Oh, but I'm not sure if that affects the specific calculation here. Let's focus on the ratio.

So, the ratio of n2 to n1 is proportional to exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ), which is exp( -hc/(λ k T) ).

But wait, in the problem, the ratio is n1/n2, perhaps? Because when the temperature changes, the ratio of the number of atoms in the two levels changes. Wait, let me clarify.

The ratio of the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2 is n1/n2. Using the Boltzmann equation:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Because n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) and n2/n1 is as per the Boltzmann factor.

Wait, no, wait. Let me rephrase. The Boltzmann factor is (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

So, for level 1 and level 2, assuming E2 > E1, then E2 - E1 is positive. So for n1/n2, it would be (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )? Wait, wait, no:

Wait, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Which can also be written as exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) * (g1/g2) )

But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. Wait, let's see.

Wait, without spots, Teff is 6000 K. With spots, Teff is 5500 K. So when the temperature is lower, what happens to the ratio n1/n2?

Because the exponent in the Boltzmann distribution involves temperature in the denominator. So as T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases because T is in the denominator. So exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) increases as T decreases.

Wait, wait, let's compute:

Without spots, T is 6000 K, so (E2-E1)/(k *6000) = some value.

With spots, T is 5500 K, so (E2-E1)/(k *5500) is higher. So the exponential term increases as T decreases.

So if T decreases, the factor exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) increases. So n1/n2 is proportional to that. So if the ratio n1/n2 increases when T decreases, but the problem states that when there are spots (T=5500 K), the ratio decreases. Hmm, that seems contradictory.

Wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So in the absence of spots, the ratio is higher than when spots are present.

Wait, that would imply that without spots, T is higher (which it is: 6000 K compared to 5500 K). So let's see: if T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases. So the exponential term would decrease. So n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So when T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, making the exponential smaller. So n1/n2 would decrease when T increases.

Wait, no. Let me do a concrete example. Let's say E2-E1 is positive. So when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes smaller. So exp( x ) where x is smaller. So n1/n2 becomes smaller. So if T increases, the ratio n1/n2 decreases.

So in the problem, when the star has spots, T decreases to 5500 K. So that would cause (E2-E1)/(k T) to increase, making exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) increase. So n1/n2 would increase when T decreases. But the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So that contradicts the expectation.

Wait, that can't be right. So perhaps I got the ratio backward. Maybe the ratio that's given is n2/n1. Let me read the question again.

The question says: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots."

So, the ratio (n1/n2) is decreasing when the star has spots. Or is the ratio (n2/n1) decreasing?

Wait, the question says the ratio of the number in level 1 to level 2, i.e., n1/n2. So when the star has spots, this ratio decreases.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, if T decreases, and E2>E1, then (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) increases. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So, if T decreases, the exponent increases, so n1/n2 increases. But the problem says that the ratio decreases when spots are present. So something's wrong here.

Hmm, wait, perhaps the problem is that when spots are present, the effective temperature is lower, but the actual temperature of the photosphere where the Ti atoms are may be different. Wait, no, the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases, so the photosphere is at a lower temperature.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the ratio the wrong way. Maybe the question is about n2/n1, not n1/n2. Let me reread the question.

"Astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots."

So the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. So when T decreases, n1/n2 decreases. How?

Wait, let's think again. The ratio (n1/n2) with spots is lower than without spots. So when T is lower (5500 K), the ratio is lower than when T is higher (6000 K). How is that possible?

Wait, because maybe the energy levels are such that level 2 is higher. So when T is lower, the population in higher levels decreases more. So the ratio n1/n2 would be (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

If E2>E1, then (E2-E1)/(k T) is positive. So when T decreases, this term increases. So the exponential increases, so n1/n2 increases as T decreases. But the problem says it decreases. So perhaps the energy difference is such that E2 < E1. Wait, but that would mean that the transition is from E1 to E2, which would be a lower energy emission.

But the wavelength given is 1448 Å, which is in the near UV. For Ti, that might correspond to a transition from a lower to higher energy level. Wait, but in stars, most transitions are due to electrons moving between energy levels, emitting or absorbing photons.

Wait, maybe I messed up the levels. Let's say level 2 is lower in energy. So E1 is higher than E2. Then E2 - E1 would be negative. So (E2-E1)/(k T) is negative. Then the exponential would be exp( (negative number) ), which is a small number. So when T increases, the denominator increases, making the term more negative. So the exponential becomes smaller, and n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Wait, but if E2 < E1, then (E2-E1) is negative. So (E2-E1)/(k T) is negative, so exp( negative ) is 1 over exp(positive). So when T increases, the denominator increases, making the (E2-E1)/(k T) more negative, so the exponential becomes smaller. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (negative) ), so as T increases, n1/n2 decreases.

Wait, but this would mean that when T increases, n1/n2 decreases. Let's think: if E1 is higher than E2, then higher energy level is E1. So, as T increases, more atoms can be excited to E1, so n1 increases, n2 (lower level) would decrease. So n1/n2 would increase. Wait, no. Because if E1 is higher than E2, and T increases, more atoms are in higher energy levels. So n1 would increase, n2 would decrease, so n1/n2 increases.

Wait, but if the problem says the ratio decreases when T decreases, which would happen if the ratio is n2/n1. Let me think.

Wait, maybe I should just proceed with the calculation.

The key is that the ratio (n1/n2) without spots is R, and with spots is r. The problem says R is higher than r, because the ratio decreases when spots are present.

So, R/r is the factor by which the ratio changes. We need to compute R/r.

Let me denote the two cases: without spots (T1=6000 K) and with spots (T2=5500 K).

The ratio n1/n2 in each case is given by:

R = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) )

r = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) )

So, R/r = exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T1) - (E2 - E1)/(k T2) ) )

Factor out (E2-E1)/(k):

R/r = exp[ (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) ]

But E2 - E1 = hc/λ, because the transition corresponds to a photon of wavelength λ. Wait, actually, the energy difference is equal to the energy of the photon emitted when transitioning from E2 to E1. So E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

Wait, but in our case, if the transition corresponds to wavelength λ, then E2 = E1 + hc/λ, assuming the photon is emitted when an electron falls from E2 to E1.

So, E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

Thus, substituting,

R/r = exp( (hc/(λ k)) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

We can compute this value.

Given λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 meters.

Constants:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

k = Boltzmann constant = 1.38e-23 J/K

So,

hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

λ = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m

So,

hc/(λ k) = (1.9878e-25 J·m ) / (1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K )

Let me compute denominator first:

1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = (1.448 * 1.38) * 1e-30 J·m/K

1.448 *1.38 ≈ 2.008

So denominator ≈ 2.008e-30 J·m/K

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, hc/(λ k) is [ (J·m) ] / ( m * J/K ) ) → [ J·m ] / (m * J/K) ) → K.

So the units are Kelvin, which is correct because it's (E2-E1)/(k) term.

So compute:

(1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23) ) 

Let me compute the denominator first: 1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23 = 1.448 *1.38 = approx 2.007, and exponents: 1e-7 * 1e-23 = 1e-30. So denominator is 2.007e-30.

So numerator is 1.9878e-25.

So:

(1.9878e-25) / (2.007e-30) ) → (1.9878 / 2.007) ) * 1e5 → approximately (0.99) * 1e5 → approx 9.9e4.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

1.9878e-25 divided by 2.007e-30 is equal to (1.9878 / 2.007) ) * (1e-25 / 1e-30) ) → approx (0.99) * 1e5 → 99000.

Wait, let's compute 1.9878 / 2.007:

Hmm, 2.007 is approximately 2 + 0.007. 1.9878 is 1.9878, which is about 0.0122 less than 2. So 1.9878 / 2.007 ≈ (2 - 0.0122) / (2 + 0.007) ) → approximately (2*(1 - 0.0061)) / (2*(1 + 0.0035))) ) → (1-0.0061)/(1+0.0035) ) → approx (0.9939)/(1.0035) ) → approx 0.9905.

So approx 0.9905.

Multiply by 1e5, which gives about 99050. So approximately 9.905e4.

So, (hc/(λ k)) ≈ 9.905e4 K.

Wait, but wait, no—wait, the denominator is 2.007e-30, but 1e-25 / 1e-30 is 1e5. So 1.9878e-25 / 2.007e-30 = (1.9878 / 2.007) ) *1e5 ≈ 0.99 * 1e5=9.9e4.

So,

R/r = exp( (9.9e4 K) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Compute (1/T1 - 1/T2):

T1=6000 K, T2=5500 K.

1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667

1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818

So the difference is 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151.

So,

(9.9e4 K) * 0.000015151 ≈ 9.9e4 * 1.5151e-5 ≈ (9.9 * 1.5151) * 1e-1 → approx 15 * 0.99 → 14.85 → 14.85 * 0.1 = 1.485.

So,

R/r = exp(1.485) ≈ e^1.485.

e^1 is 2.718, e^1.4 is about 4.055, e^1.5 is about 4.4817.

Let me compute e^1.485.

Compute e^0.485:

We know that ln(1.625) ≈ 0.485. Because ln(1.6) is about 0.47, ln(1.625) is approx 0.485.

So e^0.485 is approx 1.625.

So e^1.485 = e^1 * e^0.485 ≈ 2.718 * 1.625 ≈ 4.413.

So R/r ≈ 4.413.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the factor is approximately 4.4, which is close to 4.5.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation of (1/T1 - 1/T2).

T1=6000 K, T2=5500 K.

So,

1/6000 = 1.666666...e-4

1/5500 = 1.818181...e-4

Difference: 1.81818e-4 - 1.66666e-4 = 0.1515e-4 = 1.515e-5.

Multiply by 9.9e4:

9.9e4 * 1.515e-5 = (9.9 * 1.515) * (1e4 * 1e-5) ) → (15.0) * (0.1) ) = 1.5.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute 9.9e4 * 1.515e-5.

9.9e4 is 99,000.

1.515e-5 is 0.00001515.

99,000 * 0.00001515 = 99,000 * 1.515e-5.

Compute 99,000 * 1.515e-5:

= (99,000) * (1.515) * 1e-5

= (99 * 1.515) * 1e-2

99 * 1.515 = approx 150? Let me compute 100 *1.515=151.5, minus 1*1.515=1.515 → 151.5-1.515=149.985.

So 149.985 *1e-2 = 1.49985 ≈ 1.5.

So R/r = exp(1.5) ≈ 4.4817.

Which is approximately 4.48. So the factor is about 4.48, which is ~4.5. So the correct option is C) ~4.5.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann distribution. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right)
\]

Here, \(E_2 - E_1 = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h\) is Planck's constant, \(c\) is the speed of light, and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\). The effective temperatures of the star are \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) (without spots) and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\) (with spots). The ratio of the two ratios is:

\[
\frac{R}{r} = \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)\right)
\]

### Step 1: Compute \(E_2 - E_1 = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\)
Using \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\), \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), and \(\lambda = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\):

\[
E_2 - E_1 = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.38 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 2: Compute \(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k}\)
Using \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\):

\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} = \frac{1.38 \times 10^{-19}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 10^4 \, \text{K}
\]

### Step 3: Compute \(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\)
For \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\):

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.6667 \times 10^{-4}, \quad \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{5500} \approx 1.8182 \times 10^{-4}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} = 1.6667 \times 10^{-4} - 1.8182 \times 10^{-4} \approx -1.515 \times 10^{-5}
\]

### Step 4: Compute the exponent
\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right) = (10^4)(-1.515 \times 10^{-5}) \approx -1.515
\]

### Step 5: Compute \(\frac{R}{r} = \exp(-1.515)\)
\[
\frac{R}{r} = \exp(-1.515) \approx 0.221
\]

### Step 6: Interpret the result
The ratio of the number of Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases when the star has spots. The factor by which the ratio changes is approximately \(0.221\), which corresponds to a decrease by a factor of approximately \(1/0.221 \approx 4.5\).

### Final Answer:
The factor by which the ratio changes is approximately **4.5**.
