Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergencesâ€”like when calculations give infinite results. It's a way to make the math manageable by introducing a cutoff or some other method to handle the infinities. But wait, not all theories need this, right?

Let me think about each option. 

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a bit different. Instead of point particles, it uses strings. Strings are one-dimensional, and I remember that string theories are supposed to be finite, at least in certain formulations. Like, they might not have the same kinds of divergences that other quantum field theories do because the underlying structure is different. So maybe superstring theory doesn't require regularization as often or at all.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD has asymptotic freedom, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak, which is why perturbative methods work there. But wait, does it require regularization? I think QCD calculations often involve things like renormalization, which is related but not exactly the same as regularization. But I'm not sure if regularization is needed when working with QCD at high energies. Maybe they do need it because of loop divergences. Or perhaps the way the theory is set up with a gauge group and the structure of the interactions affects whether regularization is needed.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I remember that QED has been very successful, but it does require renormalization. But wait, regularization is a part of the renormalization process. So QED must require regularization because it has divergent loop integrals. For example, electron self-energy loops are a classic case where you need to regularize the integrals to get finite results after renormalization. So QED definitely needs regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh, that's the non-quantum version. In classical ED, you don't have the same kind of infinities because it's a deterministic theory. Wait, but there are some issues like the infinite charge density at a point charge. Like,
