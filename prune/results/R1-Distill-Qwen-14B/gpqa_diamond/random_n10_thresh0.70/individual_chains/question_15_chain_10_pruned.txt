Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, I remember that the transit method depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. But wait, both planets have the same mass, but their orbital periods and host stars are different.

So, let me think about the transit probability formula. I think the probability P is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by something else. Wait, no, I might be mixing it up. Oh right, the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 times the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight, which is based on the inclination. But wait, since we're using the radial velocity method, we might already have some information about the inclination. Oh wait, no, RV gives us the minimum mass because it depends on sin(i), so unless we know the inclination, we don't know if the planet transits. But in this case, they're trying to choose between the two based on transit probability.

Wait, I think the transit probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's size. Or maybe the probability is higher when the planet's orbit is closer to edge-on. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: the probability that a planet transits its star is roughly (R_s / a)^2 multiplied by something else. Wait, no, no, the transit probability depends on the relative sizes of the star and planet, but also the orbital size. Wait, perhaps the probability is (
