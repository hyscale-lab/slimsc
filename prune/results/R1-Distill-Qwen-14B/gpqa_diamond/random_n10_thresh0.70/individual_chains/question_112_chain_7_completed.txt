Okay, let's see. I've got a quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

So the problem says that there's an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Oh wait, and |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. Right, I remember that spin up and spin down states are orthonormal. So I guess the first thing I need to do is find the actual state vector by normalizing it because the problem says it's proportional, not normalized.

Wait, the state is given as proportional, so the coefficients (1+i) and (2-i) aren't normalized yet. So I should calculate the normalization factor. The normalization is important because probabilities depend on the squared magnitudes.

So the state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The normalization factor would be the inverse of the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

Let me compute the square of the coefficients. The coefficient of |up> is (1 + i). The magnitude squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because (1)(i) would have magnitude sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2), so squared is 2.

The coefficient for |down> is (2 - i). The magnitude squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the total magnitude squared is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now the next part is about another operator whose matrix representation is given by Aij. The matrix elements Aij are hbar/2 when i≠j and 0 otherwise. Hmm, so what kind of matrix is this?

For a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero, and the off-diagonal elements (i≠j) are hbar/2. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

Wait, wait, maybe I should write it as:

A = [[0, ħ/2],
     [ħ/2, 0]]

Yes, that's right. So this is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 on the off-diagonal. I think this is the spin-x operator scaled by something? Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this looks similar but scaled.

But perhaps more importantly, I need to find the eigenstates of this operator A because the question is about measuring the particle in the eigenstates of A. So the probability of measuring each eigenvalue is based on the projection of |alpha> onto the corresponding eigenstate.

So first, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.

The matrix A is 2x2. The eigenvalues can be found by solving det(A - λI)=0.

The characteristic equation is determinant of [[-λ, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -λ]] = 0.

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (ħ/2)^2 = λ² - (ħ² /4) =0.

So λ² = ħ² /4 => λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

The corresponding eigenvectors can be found for each λ.

For λ = ħ/2:

A - (ħ/2) I = [[-ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -ħ/2]]

The equations are:

(-ħ/2) a + (ħ/2) b =0
(ħ/2) a + (-ħ/2) b =0

These simplify to a = b.

So any vector where the two components are equal is an eigenvector. Let's choose a=1, b=1. So the eigenvector is |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). Wait, but I need to confirm that. Because the standard eigenstates for the Pauli X matrix are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), which correspond to eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively. So in our case, since A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix, the eigenstates should be the same.

Wait, let me think. Because A is (ħ/2) times sigma_x. So A = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]. So its eigenvectors are the same as those of sigma_x, and the eigenvalues are (ħ/2)*1 and (ħ/2)*(-1), which are ħ/2 and -ħ/2 as found earlier.

So the eigenstates are |+A> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-A> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Now, the state |alpha> is expressed in the z-basis (|up>, |down>). We need to project |alpha> onto the eigenstates of A to find the probabilities.

So the probability P(+A) is |< +A | alpha > |^2, and similarly P(-A) is |< -A | alpha > |^2.

Let me compute each inner product.

First, let me write |alpha> as:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>

And |+A> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), so the inner product < +A | alpha > is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1 + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) *1 ] / sqrt(2).

Wait, because when you take the inner product, you take the conjugate of |+A>, so the coefficients become 1/sqrt(2) for both. Alternatively, we can compute it as:

< +A | alpha > = [ (1 + i)/sqrt(7) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) ]

So factor out 1/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)) = 1/sqrt(14).

So the expression becomes (1+i + 2 -i) / sqrt(14) = (3) / sqrt(14).

So the magnitude squared is (3^2)/(14) )= 9/14 ≈ 0.642857. Hmm.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me recalculate that. Because |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, normalized by 1/sqrt(7). So when I compute < +A | alpha >, it's [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ] / sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2).

Because |+A> has (1/sqrt(2)) for both |up> and |down> coefficients. So the inner product is:

( (1+i) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) + ( (2 -i) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) ) / sqrt(7)

Which simplifies to [ (1+i + 2 -i) ] / sqrt(14) = (3) / sqrt(14).

So the modulus squared is (3^2)/(14) )= 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, the inner product for |-A> is:

< -A | alpha > = [ (1+i) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2 - i) * (-1/sqrt(2)) ) ] / sqrt(7)

Because |-A> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So,

= [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(14)
= [ (1 - 2) + (i + i) ] / sqrt(14)
= [ (-1) + 2i ] / sqrt(14)

The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check that calculation.

Wait, the numerator is (-1 + 2i). The magnitude squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 =1 +4=5. So 5/14.

Wait but 9/14 +5/14 = 14/14=1, which checks out. So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.6429 and 5/14 ≈ 0.3571. So the first part of the question is about these probabilities.

Now, looking at the options, let's see which one has 9/14 and 5/14.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64. Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36. Hmm, 0.36 is 9/25, which is 0.36. But 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is about 0.36. Wait, but 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is 35.7% so 0.357. But option A has 0.36. Hmm. Let me check the other options.

Option D has 0.61 and 0.29, which doesn't add up. Option B: 0.54 and 0.46. Wait, 0.54 + 0.46=1, but these don't add up to our 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I made a mistake. Because 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, so 0.64 is close. 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is 0.357. But none of the options have exactly that. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36.

Option D: 0.61, 0.29.

Wait, 0.64 plus 0.36 equals 1. 9/14 is about 0.6428, so that's 0.64, and 5/14 is about 0.357, which is approximately 0.36. So option A says 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute 9/14 and 5/14 exactly.

9 ÷14 = 0.642857...

5 ÷14 =0.357142...

So 0.642857 is approximately 0.64, and 0.35714 is approximately 0.357, which is closer to 0.36. So option A's first two numbers match.

But wait, there's more to the problem. The second part is to find the average value of the operator A. The expectation value <A> is given by <alpha| A |alpha>.

So let's compute that.

The operator A is represented as [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. So in the z-basis, the matrix is:

[[0, ħ/2],
 [ ħ/2, 0 ]]

So to compute <A>, we can compute |alpha>^† A |alpha>.

Alternatively, we can express |alpha> as a column vector and compute the product.

|alpha> is ( (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) )^T.

So the vector is:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) 

(2 -i)/sqrt(7)

So |alpha>^† is the row vector: [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ].

So |alpha>^† A |alpha> is:

[ (1 - i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * A * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7)
                                              (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Multiplying this out.

Let me compute each term.

Alternatively, since A is symmetric, I can compute it as:

= (1 - i)(1+i) (ħ/2) / (7) + (1 - i)(2 - i) (ħ/2) / (7) + (2 + i)(1+i) (ħ/2) / (7) + (2 + i)(2 - i)(ħ/2) / (7)

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to compute the matrix product step by step.

Wait, A is a 2x2 matrix. So when you multiply |alpha>^† (which is 1x2) by A (2x2) you get a 1x2 vector, then multiply by |alpha> (2x1), which gives a scalar.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute each element.

Let me compute the product:

= [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ [0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0] ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ; (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Wait, the matrix multiplication steps.

First multiply A with |alpha>:

A |alpha> is:

First component: (0)(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (ħ/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7) = (ħ/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7)

Second component: (ħ/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2-i)/sqrt(7) = (ħ/2)(1 + i)/sqrt(7)

So A |alpha> is [ (ħ/2)(2 -i) ) / sqrt(7), (ħ/2)(1 +i) ) / sqrt(7) ]^T.

Then, |alpha>^† times that vector:

= [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (ħ/2)(2 -i) ) / sqrt(7), (ħ/2)(1 +i) ) / sqrt(7) ]

= (1 -i)(2 -i)(ħ/2) /7 + (2 +i)(1 +i)(ħ/2)/7

So compute each term:

First term: (1 -i)(2 -i) = (2)(1) + (1)(-i) -i(2) + i^2. Let me compute:

(1)(2)=2; 1*(-i) = -i; (-i)*2= -2i; (-i)(-i)=i^2= -1.

So sum: 2 -i -2i -1 = (2-1) + (-i-2i) = 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i = 2 +2i +i +i². i² is -1.

So 2+3i -1 =1 +3i.

Now, putting it all together:

= [ (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) ] * (ħ/2) /7

Wait, because each term is multiplied by (ħ/2)/7.

So (1-3i) + (1+3i) = 2.

So 2 * (ħ/2) /7 = ( ħ ) /7.

So the expectation value <A> is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options, option A has average value ħ/7. So the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36), and average value ħ/7.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says average value is ħ/7, probabilities 0.64 and 0.36.

So that's option A. But let me check the options again.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7.

So that should be the correct answer.


To solve the problem, we start with the given state:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle
\]

where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are orthonormal eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. Since the state is proportional but not normalized, we calculate the normalization factor. The coefficients have magnitudes squared \( |1+i|^2 = 2 \) and \( |2-i|^2 = 5 \), so the total magnitude squared is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \). The normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \) with matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is a scaled version of the Pauli \( X \)-matrix. The eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), and the corresponding eigenstates are:

\[
|+A\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-A\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), we project \( |\alpha\rangle \) onto \( |+A\rangle \) and \( |-A\rangle \). The inner products are:

\[
\langle +A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{(1+i) + (2-i)}{\sqrt{14}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]

\[
\langle -A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{(1+i) - (2-i)}{\sqrt{14}} = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these projections:

\[
P(+A) = \left|\langle +A | \alpha \rangle\right|^2 = \frac{9}{14}, \quad P(-A) = \left|\langle -A | \alpha \rangle\right|^2 = \frac{5}{14}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \).

Next, we calculate the average value of \( A \), which is the expectation value \( \langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle \). Using the matrix representation of \( A \) and the coefficients of \( |\alpha\rangle \), we compute:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{(1+i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)}{7} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2}.
\]

Simplifying the numerator:

\[
(1+i)(2-i) = 1 - i - 2i + i^2 = 1 - 3i - 1 = -3i, \quad (2+i)(1+i) = 2 + 2i + i + i^2 = 2 + 3i - 1 = 1 + 3i.
\]

Adding these gives:

\[
-3i + 1 + 3i = 1.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{1}{7} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Finally, comparing with the options, the correct probabilities are \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). This matches **Option A**.
