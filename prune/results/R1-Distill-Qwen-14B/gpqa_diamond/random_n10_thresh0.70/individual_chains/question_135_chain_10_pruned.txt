Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details.

The question is about the decay of a boson X. The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is provided, which is L(y) = -λf f-bar ψf (y) (υ + X(y)) ψf(y). Hmm, I need to parse that.

Wait, the Lagrangian looks a bit confusing. Let me try to understand it. So, the term is -λ times something involving fermions. I think it's an interaction between the boson X and fermions. The structure looks similar to Yukawa coupling terms, which usually involve a scalar field interacting with fermions.

So, Yukawa interactions typically have a term like g ψ^† ψ X, where X is the scalar field. So in this case, the interaction would be between the fermion fields ψf and the boson X. The Lagrangian term given seems to be -λ f f-bar ψf (y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check notation again.

Wait, the notation is a bit unclear. Maybe it's written as -λ_f f̄ ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So the interaction is between the fermion ψ_f and the boson X. So the coupling term is proportional to X(y) times the fermion fields.

In Yukawa theory, the interaction allows the scalar (here, X) to decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The possible decays depend on the mass of the boson and the masses of the fermions it can couple to.

So, the mass of X is 6 GeV. For a decay X → f f̄ to be possible, the sum of the fermion masses must be less than the mass of X. But wait, in reality, the fermions' rest masses are much smaller. So X can decay into any fermion pair as long as 2m_f ≤ m_X.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The fermions that X can decay into are those whose combined mass is less than or equal to the mass of X. So for each fermion species, 2m_f must be ≤ 6 GeV.

But what are the masses of the various fermions?
