Okay, let me try to work through this chemistry problem. It's a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step.

So, the question is about a reaction involving Substance X and Liquid Y. Let's break down the information given.

First, Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. That suggests that X is likely a compound where one of its elements has an isotope that's heavier. Maybe something like Cl in a molecule, since chlorine has isotopes, like Cl-35 and Cl-37.

The reaction between X and Y is violent, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm, so for a molecule, each atom in it would contribute to the total. Wait, but the problem says the molecule of W has equal neutrons and protons. So let's think about possible gases. Common ones are like O2, N2, H2, etc. Let's see:

If the molecule is, say, H2, each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So total protons would be 2, neutrons 0. Not equal. Not good.

What about O2? Oxygen has 8 protons. Each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (if it's the common isotope, but wait, O can have different isotopes). But in O2, each O has 8 protons. So the molecule has 16 protons (since 2 O atoms) and 16 neutrons (each O is 16, so 32 total neutrons in the molecule? Wait no, each O has 8 neutrons, so two O atoms would have 16 neutrons. Wait, but that's for O-16. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons in the molecule. That fits, same number. So W is O2?

Wait, but O2's molecule has 16 protons and 16 neutrons? Because each O is 16, which is 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So two O atoms: 16 protons, 16 neutrons. So total same. That fits. So W is O2? But wait, O2 is diatomic, and that makes sense as a gas.

Alternatively, another possibility could be something like CO2, but that's a linear molecule and not diatomic. Wait, but the problem
