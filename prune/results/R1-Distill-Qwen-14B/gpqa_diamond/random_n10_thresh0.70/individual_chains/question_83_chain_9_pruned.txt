Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Alright, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, they form sodium acetate and water.

The problem says that we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A to D.

First, I think I should find out the concentrations after dilution. Let's figure out the initial moles of acetic acid. The formula is C = moles / V, so moles = C×V. But volume is in cm³, which is same as mL, so for 20.00 cm³, that's 0.02 liters. Wait, no, for molarity (M), which is mol/L, the volume needs to be in liters. So moles = 0.05 M * 0.020 L = 0.001 moles.

Then, when we add 20.00 cm³ water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³, or 0.040 L. So the new concentration of acetic acid after dilution would be moles / V = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh wait, that's right because when you mix equal volumes, concentration halves if the volumes are additive. So 0.05 M / 2 = 0.025 M. That's the diluted acetic acid solution.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. Let me think about the equivalence point. At equivalence, moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid. So moles of acetic acid initially is 0.001 moles. So NaOH needed is 0.001 moles. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / C = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So when we reach the equivalence point, 10 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

But wait, the question isn't about the equivalence point directly, but about the pH at 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So at 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH to the 40 cm³ solution.

Wait, no. Wait, the initial solution is 40 cm³ (20+20). So when you add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, the total solution volume becomes 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³.

But another approach is to think in terms of moles. Let me
