Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, so nucleus X must be some heavy nucleus. Wait, the problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Oh right, Li is lithium. So lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it's Li with 3 neutrons, the isotope would be Li-6, since Li usually has 3 protons and 3 neutrons makes 6 nucleons in total. So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus.

The problem asks for the energy of the RHIC such that the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. Wait, I think the energy in particle physics usually refers to the kinetic energy or the total energy? I'm a bit confused about that. Oh wait, in colliders, the energy is typically the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy (rest mass plus kinetic). Hmm. But I think in this question, since it's about the speed, they're probably referring to relativistic energy. So I'll need to calculate the total energy of the nucleus, which includes both its rest mass and kinetic energy.

First, let's get the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The atomic mass of Li-6 can be found using the periodic table. But wait, lithium's atomic mass is about 6.941 g/mol. But wait, that's for a mole. So per nucleus, the mass would be approximately
