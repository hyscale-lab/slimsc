Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model (SM) plus higher-dimensional operators. The question is about which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect.

The options given are Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare Symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these: A is 1 and 2, B is 3 and 4, C is 1,2,4, and D is 1,3,4.

Wait, wait. I think I should break this down. Let me recall what each symmetry means.

First, Lorentz symmetry. Oh right, that's about how the laws of physics are the same for all observers in inertial frames and how space and time are treated symmetrically. In the SMEFT, all operators must be Lorentz scalars, I think, because the theory incorporates the SM which respects Lorentz symmetry. So operators are constructed from SM fields and their derivatives, ensuring Lorentz invariance. So Lorentz Symmetry (1) must be respected.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare is a bigger symmetry group that includes Lorentz symmetry as well as translations in space and time. So Poincare symmetry implies Lorentz plus momentum and energy conservation, etc. But in the SMEFT, the operators are added to the SM Lagrangian. The SM already respects Poincare symmetry, so when we add higher-dimensional operators, do they automatically respect Poincare as well? I think yes, because the SMEFT operators are constructed to maintain all the symmetries of the SM, including Poincare. So Poincare symmetry (2) is also a must-respect symmetry.

Wait, but wait a second. The SM includes Poincare symmetry, so the SMEFT, which is an extension, must also respect Poincare. Because each operator in SMEFT is a product of SM fields and derivatives, and the SM is Poincare invariant. So yes, all SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So options 1 and 2 are correct.

Now, CP symmetry. CP is charge conjugation followed by parity. The SM doesn't respect CP symmetry in general, right? For example, certain processes like kaon oscillations violate CP. So the SMEFT operators can potentially have CP violation if the SM fields have CP violation. Therefore, operators in SMEFT are not required to respect CP symmetry. So choice 3 is not necessarily respected; so the correct answer can't include 3. So any option with 3 is incorrect. That means option D is invalid since it includes 3.

What about CPT symmetry? CPT is charge-parity-time reversal. The SM respects CPT symmetry, and since SMEFT is built from SM fields, the operators would also respect CPT. Because any operator that violates CPT would cause the theory to be non-unitary, which we don't want. So all operators must respect CPT symmetry (4). So 4 is correct.

Putting it all together: which of the four symmetries must all operators respect? 1, 2, and 4. So looking at the options, which option has 1,2,4? Oh, option C is 1,2,4, and option D is 1,3,4. So the correct answer would be C.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2

B) 3,4

C) 1,2,4

D) 1,3,4

So the correct answer is C, which includes 1,2,4.

Wait, but wait another point. Does SMEFT respect Poincare symmetry? Because Poincare includes translations, so the theory must be translationally invariant. The SMEFT Lagrangian includes the SM Lagrangian plus higher-dimensional terms. The SM terms are translationally invariant, so adding higher-dim terms (which are products of SM fields and derivatives) would still be translationally invariant because each term would have terms with fields and derivatives, which are part of the Poincare symmetry. Therefore, yes, Poincare is respected.

So the symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. So option C is correct.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model (SM) Lagrangian. These operators must respect the symmetries of the SM. Let us analyze the given symmetries:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The SMEFT operators are constructed from SM fields and their derivatives. Since the SM respects Lorentz symmetry, all SMEFT operators must also respect Lorentz symmetry. This is a fundamental requirement.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry as well as translations in space and time. Since the SM respects Poincaré symmetry, and SMEFT operators are built from SM fields and derivatives, the SMEFT operators must also respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM does not respect CP symmetry in general (e.g., CP violation is observed in certain processes like kaon oscillations). Therefore, SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry, as they can include terms that violate CP if the SM fields allow for it.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM respects CPT symmetry, and since SMEFT is built from SM fields, all SMEFT operators must also respect CPT symmetry. Violating CPT symmetry would lead to non-unitary theories, which are not physically acceptable.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct option is **C**.

Answer: C
