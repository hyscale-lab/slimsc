Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. 12 of them are constrained to stay 2 meters away from a point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system.

Wait, electric potential energy, right. I remember that the potential energy between point charges is given by Coulomb's law for potential energy. The formula is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². But since there are multiple charges, I probably need to consider the contributions from each pair.

So, in this system, there's a central charge at point P, and 12 charges around it. Let's think about how many interactions there are. The 13th charge is fixed at P, so each of the 12 charges at 2 meters away will interact with it. Also, the 12 charges around might interact with each other. But wait, the problem says the system is isolated, and those 12 are constrained at 2m. So I guess the interactions between the 12 charges are also part of the total potential energy.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, in the problem setup, are the 12 charges all fixed at 2m from P, but do they interact with each other or not? Because if they're fixed at that point, maybe their
