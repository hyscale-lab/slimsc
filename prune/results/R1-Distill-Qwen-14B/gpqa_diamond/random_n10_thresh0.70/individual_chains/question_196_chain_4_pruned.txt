Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I need to find the maximum speed of the mass. Let's see what I remember from my studies.

The problem states it's a 1-dimensional system with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. So it's a harmonic oscillator, but relativistic. That probably means we need to consider relativistic effects, like how speed approaches the speed of light, c.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator can be found using conservation of energy. The potential energy at maximum displacement A is (1/2)kA², and this converts into kinetic energy (1/2)mv² at the equilibrium point. So v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, this is the non-relativistic case. The question is relativistic, so maybe that's not the right approach.

Relativistically, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². The relativistic kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy in the system would be the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy.

Wait, but in the harmonic oscillator, the energy is quantized in quanta, but the problem here is about the maximum speed, so perhaps it's treating it as a classical system. So the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy, but wait, in the relativistic oscillator, the potential and kinetic energy might have different forms.

Alternatively, maybe the potential energy in the relativistic case is similar to the non-relativistic, but the kinetic energy is relativistic. So at maximum displacement A, all the energy is potential, (1/2)kA². At the equilibrium point (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. But wait, in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc². So setting them equal:

(1/2)kA² = (γ - 1) mc².

But I'm not sure if the potential energy is still (1/2)kA² in relativistic terms. Maybe that's correct because Hooke's law is a classical force and the potential is derived from that. So let me proceed with that.

So, the equation is:

(1/2)k A² = (γ -
