Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, we can't just subtract the velocities normally because that would give a speed greater than c, which isn't possible according to Einstein's theory. So, I think I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, wait. The question is about the relative speed between them. So, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c. But wait, both are in the same direction, right? So from A's perspective, B is moving at a speed calculated as (v - u) but adjusted for relativity.

The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (v - u)/(1 - (vu)/c²). So v is the speed of the faster object, which is 0.6c, and u is the speed of the slower one, 0.5c. Plugging in those values: (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²).

Let me calculate the numerator first. 0.6c minus 0.5c is 0.1c. Then the denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c². Oh wait, 0.6 * 0.5 is 0.3, so 0.3c² divided by c² is 0.3. So 1-0.3 is 0.7.

So the relative speed would be 0.1c / 0.7. That's 0.142857...c, which is approximately 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So the relative speed part is either C or D.

Now, for the total energy of the system. I remember that the total energy in relativity isn't just the sum of their rest masses because each has kinetic energy as well. The formula for total energy of each astronaut is gamma multiplied by their rest mass energy, which is mc².

So each astronaut's energy is gamma * m * c², and the total energy is the
