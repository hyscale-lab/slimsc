Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Then there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with 2 oxygen atoms. Oh, and X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and X has an isotope that's heavier than the regular one.

Hmm, I need to figure out what X, Y, W, G, and B are. Then, from that, I can determine the elements in X and calculate the cumulative atomic masses.

Let me break this down. First, the reaction between X and Y produces gas W. Since W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons, the molecule must be something like H2O, NH3, CO2, or maybe something else. Wait, wait—each molecule. Let's think: for each molecule of W, number of protons equals the number of neutrons. Let's think about possible gases.

Wait, for example, water (H2O): each H has 1 proton, each O has 8. So H2O has 2 H and 1 O. The total protons would be 2*(1) + 8 = 10. The total neutrons would be (each H has 0 neutrons, O has 8 (since O is usually O-16)). So, 0*2 +8 =8. So 10≠8. So that can't be.

What about CO2? Each molecule has 1 C and 2 O. C has 6 protons, O has 8. So total protons:6 + 2*8=22. Neutrons: C has 6 neutrons (since C-12), each O has 8. So 6 + 2*8=22. Oh! So W could be CO2. Because 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So each molecule has equal protons and neutrons.

Wait, no. Wait, the molecule as a whole has the same number of protons and neutrons.
