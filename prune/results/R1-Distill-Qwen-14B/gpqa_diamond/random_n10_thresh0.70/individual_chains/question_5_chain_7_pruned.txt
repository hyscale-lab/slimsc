Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, eigenvectors and eigenvalues, right. I remember from linear algebra that an eigenvector of an operator satisfies the equation P|v> = λ|v>, where λ is the eigenvalue.

Wait, but wait. The operator here is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. So the total operator P is probably the vector operator, meaning P = P_x x + P_y y + P_z z, but wait wait, no. Wait, the operator along an arbitrary direction n would be the component of the vector operator P in that direction. Oh right, because if you have a vector operator, its component along a direction n is given by the dot product with n. So the operator P_n is P · n, where n is a unit vector.

The direction n is in the x-z plane, which means the vector n has components (nx, 0, nz). But since it's a unit vector, nx² + nz² = 1. Oh, and the problem says it's an arbitrary direction, so we might need to represent the eigenvector in terms of angles or something.

But wait, the eigenvector is for the operator P_n, which is (P_x * nx) + (P_z * nz), because
