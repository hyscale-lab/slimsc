Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit from our point of view. Let me try to break this down step by step. Hmm, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size. Oh wait, more precisely, it's the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. Because if the planet's orbit is closer to edge-on, it's more likely to pass in front of the star from our line of sight.

Wait, the formula for the probability of a transit is something like (R_star / a_planet), where R_star is the star's radius and a_planet is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, actually, I think it's (R_star / a_planet) squared, but no, wait. I think it's (R_star / a_planet) because it's the ratio of the size of the star to the size of the orbit. So the probability increases if the star is larger or the planet's orbit is smaller. Because a smaller orbit means the planet is more likely to pass in front when viewed edge-on.

Wait, no, actually, the transit probability is given by (R*/a)^2, where R* is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital distance. Or is it (R*/a) times some function? I'm getting a bit confused. Oh, right, the transit probability P is approximately (R*/a)², but wait, I think that's when you consider the area. Wait, no, the correct formula for the probability is P ≈ (R*/a)² * [something about the inclination]. Wait, perhaps it's best to think geometrically. The probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. Because, imagine the star as a disc. The planet's orbit is a circle around it. The chance that the line of sight intersects the star's disc is the area of the star's cross-section divided by the area of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, that's not right because the cross-section is π(R*)² and the orbital area is π(a)^2. So the ratio is (R*/a)^2. But wait, no, because the transit happens when the planet's orbit is in the same plane as our line of sight. So the probability is actually the ratio of the star's diameter to the orbital diameter, squared. Wait, no, I
