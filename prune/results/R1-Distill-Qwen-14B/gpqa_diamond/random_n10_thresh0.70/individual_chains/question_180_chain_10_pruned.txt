Okay, I'm faced with this physics problem, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

So, the problem describes an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. I know that e is the elementary charge, approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 2 times that, which is about 3.204 x 10^-19 C.

The setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. We're supposed to find the minimum energy of this system, right? 

Wait, energy in an electrostatic system. Oh, right, the electrostatic potential energy. Because in such systems, the potential energy is due to the arrangement of charges. Since these charges are all identical and have the same sign, they will repel each other. But how does that affect the potential energy?

I remember that the potential energy of a system of point charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. The formula for the potential energy U between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, about 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

But wait, when there are multiple charges, you have to consider each pair. The total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So for n charges, the number of unique pairs is n choose 2, which is n(n-1)/2.

In this case, there are 13 charges. So the total number of pairs is 13*12/2 = 78 pairs. But wait, since the 13th charge is fixed at P, all the other 12 charges are at a distance of 2 meters from it. So each of these 12 charges will have a potential energy with the 13th charge. 

Additionally, the 12 charges at 2 meters from P are themselves interacting with each other. So the total potential energy will have two parts: the energy due to the 12 charges each interacting with the fixed charge, and the energy due to each pair among the 12 charges.

But wait, the problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P. That suggests that their positions are fixed relative to point P, but
