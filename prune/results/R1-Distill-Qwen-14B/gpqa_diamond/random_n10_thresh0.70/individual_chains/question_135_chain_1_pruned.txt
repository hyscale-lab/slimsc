Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, specifically dealing with the decay of a boson. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question gives a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and fermions. The term is written as L = -λ f ψ_f (y)(υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think that might be a typo. Usually, the interaction terms have the fermion fields ψ and their conjugates, so maybe it's supposed to be ψ̄, like a Yukawa coupling. Oh right, the standard form is something like L = -λ ψ̄ ϕ ψ, where ϕ is the boson field. So I think in this case, the interaction is ψ̄ X ψ, maybe? Because the given Lagrangian has ψ_f (y) and the ψ_bar, but I'm not entirely sure. But for the purpose of finding decay channels, maybe the specifics of the Lagrangian aren't the main point. Hmm.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So the question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. I remember that for a boson to decay into fermions, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion because energy and momentum must be conserved. So each decay product must have a mass less than or equal to half the boson's mass.

So first, let's list the fermions and their masses. The known elementary particles' masses are in the Standard Model. Let me recall approximate masses:

- Electron (e): about 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Up quark (u): around 2.2 MeV (0.0022 GeV)
- Down quark (d): ~4.7 MeV (0.0047 GeV)
- Strange quark (s): ~95 MeV (0.095 GeV)
- Charm quark (c): ~1.3 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way heavier, like 173 GeV.

Wait, but wait. For a decay like X → f f̄, each fermion pair must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. Since each f has mass m, 2m ≤ 6 GeV => m ≤ 3 GeV. 

So the fermions f that have mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be decay products. Let me check each one:

- e: 0.0005 GeV → yes.
- μ: 0.105 → yes.
- τ: 1.78 → yes.
- u: 0.0022 → yes.
- d: 0.0047 → yes.
- s: 0.095 → yes.
- c: 1.3 → yes.
- b: 4.5 → 4.5 is more than 3 GeV. So 2
