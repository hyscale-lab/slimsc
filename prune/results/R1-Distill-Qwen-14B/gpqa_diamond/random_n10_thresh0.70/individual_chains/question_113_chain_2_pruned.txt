Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let's try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my spectroscopy, but I'll think through each clue one by one.

First, the FTIR data: a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually mean either O-H stretching (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) or maybe N-H. But the presence of other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, 1700 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, which might indicate conjugated carbonyl groups or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents. Or maybe it's an amide, but I don't see any info about N here.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the molecule has a double bond somewhere. Also, other peaks are present, but I don't have specific details about their shifts, which makes it a bit tricky.

The mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, what fragments give 45? Well, common fragments include the methyl group (15), but that's too low. Wait, 45 could be something like a ketene ion? Or maybe a CH2O group? Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment from a carbonyl-containing structure. Let me think: 45 could be CH3CO (which is 45: 12*2 + 1*4 + 16 = 44? Wait, 12*2 is 24, 1*3 (if CH3 is 15) plus 16 for O? Wait, 12 + 1*3 (CH3) is 15, plus 16 (O) is 31. No, that's not matching. Wait, another approach: 45 could correspond to (CH2O) maybe. Or perhaps a fragment like CH3CO-O something? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I'll keep that in mind.

Now, the possible formulas are C6H
