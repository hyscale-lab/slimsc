Alright, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when the pp-III branch stops. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino physics, but let me think this through step by step.

Okay, from what I remember, the Sun's energy production involves several steps in the proton-proton (pp) chain. The main branches are pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Each branch contributes differently to the neutrino flux we detect on Earth.

So the question says that the pp-III branch has suddenly stopped. Oh wait, the pp-III branch is one of the later steps in the chain, right? It's part of the CNO cycle or something else? Wait, no. Wait, the pp chain has a few steps. The initial steps are pp-I and pp-II, and then some of the products go into pp-III, which is a branch that produces helium-4 via a triple-alpha reaction or something else? No, wait. Oh right, the pp chain is all about fusing protons into helium-4, and the pp-III branch is a specific part of this process. 

In the pp chain, protons fuse into deuterium, then into helium-3, and then these helium-3 nuclei can either combine (pp-I and pp-II) or go through the pp-III branch. The pp-III branch involves a two-step process where two helium-3 nuclei combine into helium-4, releasing two protons. I think that branch is more significant in higher metallicity stars, but for the Sun, which is a lower metallicity star, the pp-I branch is more
