Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my concepts, but let me think this through.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization. Regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like infinite terms that pop up in calculations. So, when physicists compute loop diagrams or other processes, they often get infinities, which aren't physically meaningful. Regularization is a way to handle these by introducing a cutoff or some other method to make the integrals finite, and then you remove the cutoff in the end.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I remember that string theory is a candidate for a theory of everything, combining general relativity and quantum mechanics. One of the nice things about string theory is that it doesn't have the same kind of divergences as in other quantum field theories. Or wait, does it? Well, I think that in superstring theory, the perturbative expansion (like Feynman diagrams) can still have divergences, but I'm not entirely sure. But wait, maybe in string theory, the divergences are tamed because of the way the theory is structured. Like, higher-order terms might cancel out due to supersymmetry or some other mechanism. So maybe superstring theory doesn't require regularization in the same way other theories do?

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory and that it's asymptotically free, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak. But in practice, when doing loop calculations, you still get divergences. So you'd need to use regularization methods like dimensional regularization or lattice regularization. So QCD definitely requires regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I remember learning that QED has these issues with divergences, especially in higher-order processes. For example, the electron self-energy has divergences. But through the process of renormalization, these infinities can be absorbed by redefining the parameters (like mass and charge) of the theory. So QED does require regularization. People use methods like cutoff regularization or dimensional regularization, then renormalize.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, this is the classical version, not quantum. In classical electromagnetism, you don't have the same divergences that come up in quantum theories. Because in classical ED, you're dealing with Maxwell's equations, which don't involve the same kind of loop diagrams or virtual particles. So, in classical terms, you wouldn't need regularization because you're not calculating quantum loops with infinities. But wait, do classical theories have any divergences? Well, in classical ED, the concept of point charges leads to problems like the infinite self-energy of a point charge. But is that handled with regularization? Or is it more of a conceptual problem rather than something requiring regularization techniques? Since the question is about which theory never requires regularization, maybe classical ED doesn't need it because regularization is a quantum field theory tool.

Wait, the question specifies "at high energies". So I need to think about whether any of these theories are free from needing regularization when energies are high.

Wait, but the question is about which theory never requires regularization, regardless of the
