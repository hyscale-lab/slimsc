Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let me think about it. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, and I need to find out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different exponents.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax angle (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/distance, which means distance = 1/plx.

But wait, what's the question again? It's about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So if I have a certain range of parallax values, how does the count of stars change with that range?

Oh, right, this might be about the distribution of stars in space. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number density is constant. Let me think in terms of volume. The number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume.

So, considering a spherical shell at a certain distance. The volume of a thin shell depends on the radius squared times the thickness. Wait, the volume element in spherical coordinates is 4πr² dr. So for a thin shell between r and r+dr, the volume is 4πr² dr.

But how does this relate to parallax? Parallax plx is 1/r (since distance in parsecs r = 1/plx). So r = 1/plx. Then, dr in terms of plx would be, well, let's see. If plx = 1/r, then d(plx) = -1
