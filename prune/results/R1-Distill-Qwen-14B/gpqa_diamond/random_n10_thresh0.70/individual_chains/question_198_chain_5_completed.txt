Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about cobalt complexes. Hmm, let me read the question carefully.

Alright, the problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, so the blue dithiocyanato complex must be one of these. I remember that different coordination numbers give different colors, but I'm not exactly sure which one is which. But the key here is the stability constant, which tells us about the stability of each complex. The higher the beta, the more stable the complex.

So the complexes are Co(SCN)_n^2-n. Let me think: the possible complexes are n=1, 2, 3, 4. The stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, wait. Stability constants are for the formation of the complex from the ions. So the formation reaction for Co(SCN)_n is Co²+ + n SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)_n^2−. The beta is the equilibrium constant, so higher beta means more formation of the complex.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. The order of the stability constants given might matter. Let me list them:

β1 = 9: probably for the first complex, Co(SCN), with n=1.

β2=40: Co(SCN)₂.

β3=63: Co(SCN)₃.

β4=16: Co(SCN)₄.

Wait, wait. Wait, but I think that sometimes the stability constants are given for successive formation steps. So β1 is for the first ligand addition, β2 for the second, etc. So the overall formation for n=4 would have β1 * β2 * β3 * β4. Hmm, but in this problem, the beta values are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So perhaps each beta is the cumulative constant up to that n. Or maybe not. Hmm, I think I need to clarify that.

Wait, the way the question is phrased: "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." So each β corresponds to the complex with n=1, 2, 3, 4 ligands. So, for example, β1 is the stability constant for the complex with one SCN ligand, β2 for two, etc. So the stability of each complex is given directly, not as stepwise constants.

Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because typically, stability constants are given for each step, like K1, K2, etc., where K1 is for the first ligand, K2 for the second, and so on. So the overall K for n=4 would be K1*K2*K3*K4. But in this question, it seems each βn is the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. Suppose the complexes are Co(SCN)ⁿ²- with n=1, 2, 3, 4, and each βn is the overall stability constant for that complex.

So, for example, β1=9 is [Co(SCN)]²− / ([Co²+][SCN⁻]).

Similarly, β2=40 is [Co(SCN)₂]²− / ([Co²+][SCN⁻]^2), etc.

If that's the case, then the relative concentrations of each complex would depend on their respective βn and the ligand concentration.

But in the solution, the concentration of SCN⁻ is 0.1 M, and the total cobalt is fixed. So the distribution of Co species will depend on the stability of each complex and the SCN concentration.

Wait, but in solution, the Co²+ can form different complexes, and the distribution depends on their stability and the ligand concentration. The more stable a complex (higher βn), the more Co will be in that form, especially if the ligand is in excess.

But wait, the ligand here is SCN⁻ at 0.1 M. Let's think: for each complex, the formation depends on the ligand concentration. The higher the ligand concentration, the more the complex forms, given a high enough βn.

Our goal is to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is the one with two SCN⁻ ligands. So that's the n=2 complex, which has a β2=40.

Wait, but wait, the question says 'blue dithiocyanato,' which I think refers to the Co(SCN)₂²- complex. I think that in solution, the color varies with the number of ligands. For example, Co(SCN)₆³- is pink, but I'm not exactly sure about the colors for lower n. But regardless, the question specifies that we're looking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is the n=2 complex.

So, to find this percentage, I'll need to calculate the mole fractions of each cobalt species (n=0 to n=4) and then find which fraction corresponds to n=2.

But wait, wait. The total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 1e-2 M. So the sum of all the cobalt species is 1e-2 M. Each cobalt species is [Co(SCN)_n^2−] = [Co_n], where n is the number of SCN ligands.

So, the distribution is determined by the stability constants and the ligand concentration.

The general approach is to use the stability constants and the ligand concentration to find the fraction of each complex.

The formula for the fraction of each complex is given by the product of the stability constant and the ligand concentration raised to the nth power, divided by the sum of all such terms for all possible complexes, plus the uncomplexed Co²+.

Wait, more precisely, the fraction f_n for each complex with n ligands is:

f_n = (β_n * [SCN]^n) / (1 + β1 * [SCN] + β2 * [SCN]^2 + β3 * [SCN]^3 + β4 * [SCN]^4 )

But wait, no. Wait, the uncomplexed Co²+ is when n=0, so the denominator is the sum of all possible terms, including n=0, which is 1 (since [Co²+] is present as 1 when n=0).

Wait, no. No. I think I need to model it correctly. The fraction of each species is given by the Boltzmann distribution, considering the formation of each complex. So the fraction of Co(SCN)_n is:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n) / (β_0 [SCN]^0 + β_1 [SCN]^1 + β_2 [SCN]^2 + β_3 [SCN]^3 + β_4 [SCN]^4 )

Wait, but β_0 is 1, because the uncomplexed Co²+ has a stability constant of 1 (since it's just the ion itself; β_0 = [Co²+]/([Co²+][SCN]⁰) ) = 1. So, the denominator is 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

Wait, actually, is that correct? Because the overall fraction would be the ratio of (β_n [SCN]^n) to the sum over all m (β_m [SCN]^m).

Wait, perhaps. So let me rephrase:

Each species Co(SCN)_n has a concentration proportional to β_n [SCN]^n.

So the total concentration (sum) is:

Total = [Co²+] + [CoSCN] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4]

But [Co²+] is the concentration when n=0, which would be 1 * [SCN]^0 =1. So the total would be:

Total = 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

But wait, wait. I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. The formation of each complex is a stepwise process, but in this problem, each βn is the overall stability constant for the complex with n SCN ligands.

So, the expression for the fraction of the n=2 complex (dithiocyanato) would be:

f_2 = (β2 [SCN]^2) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

But wait, the problem states that the solution has Co²+ and SCN⁻. So the distribution depends on the ligand concentration and the stability constants.

So, let's plug in the numbers.

Given:

[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M

β1 = 9

β2 =40

β3=63

β4=16

So, let's compute each term in the denominator.

Denominator D = 1 + β1*[SCN] + β2*[SCN]^2 + β3*[SCN]^3 + β4*[SCN]^4

Compute each term:

Term0: 1 = 1

Term1: β1*[SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

Term2: β2*[SCN]^2 =40 * (0.1)^2 =40 * 0.01=0.4

Term3: β3*[SCN]^3 =63 * (0.1)^3=63 * 0.001=0.063

Term4: β4*[SCN]^4=16 * (0.1)^4=16 * 0.0001=0.0016

Now sum all terms:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

+0.4 → 2.3

+0.063 → 2.363

+0.0016 →2.3646

So D=2.3646.

Now, the fraction f_2 is term2 divided by D: 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169.

Wait, 0.4 / 2.3646 = approximately 0.169, which is about 16.9%. Hmm, but wait, that's matching option D, which is 16.9%.

But wait, wait. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. If dithiocyanato is the n=2 complex, then f_2 is 16.9%. But look at the options: option D is 16.9%.

But wait, there's another thing. The calculation assumes that each βn is for the specific complex. But perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is correct, but maybe I need to consider the possibility of more than four ligands or other factors.

Wait, no, the problem states the stability constants up to β4, implying that n goes up to 4.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have included Co²+ as an option, but in the denominator, it's already considered as term0.

Wait, but according to the calculation, the fractions are:

f0 = 1/D ≈ 0.423 → 42.3% for Co²+.

f1 =0.9/D ≈0.381 → 38.1% for n=1.

f2=0.4/D ≈16.9% → option D.

f3=0.063/D≈2.66% → ~2.66%

f4=0.0016/D≈0.067% → negligible.

So the percentages are:

n=0: ~42.3%

n=1: ~38.1%

n=2: ~16.9%

n=3: ~2.66%

n=4: ~0.067%

So the largest fraction is n=0 (uncomplexed Co²+), followed by n=1, then n=2, and so on.

Wait, but the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2. So that's 16.9%, which is option D.

But let me think again: why is the fraction of n=2 so low, even though β2=40 is the highest among the given betas except β3=63. Oh, because β3 is higher but [SCN] is 0.1 M, so [SCN]^3 is 0.001, which when multiplied by 63 gives 0.063, which is smaller than [SCN]^2 *40=0.4.

So the highest fraction is n=1, which is 38.1%, followed by n=0 (42.3%). Hmm, that's interesting.

Wait, but why is the uncomplexed (n=0) the highest?

Because when [SCN] is low, even if βn is high, the product βn [SCN]^n might not be the largest. Let me look at the terms:

Term0: 1

Term1: 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

Term2:40 *0.01=0.4

Term3:63 *0.001=0.063

Term4:16 *0.0001=0.0016

So term0 is 1, term1 is 0.9, which is lower, term2 is 0.4, etc.

So term0 is the largest, hence n=0 (uncomplexed Co²+) is the most abundant, followed by n=1, then n=2, etc.

But why is term0 the largest? Because [SCN] is 0.1 M, which is not very high. So for each higher n, [SCN]^n decreases, making the product βn [SCN]^n fall.

So the question is about the dithiocyanato (n=2) which is 0.4 / 2.3646 = ~16.9% → option D.

Wait, but the options given are:

A)42.3%

B)25.6%

C)38.1%

D)16.9%

So the correct answer should be D.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Denominator D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016.

Wait, 1 + 0.9 is 1.9.

1.9 + 0.4 is 2.3.

2.3 + 0.063 is 2.363.

2.363 + 0.0016 =2.3646.

So D=2.3646.

Then, for n=2, it's 0.4 / 2.3646 → let me compute that.

0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, which is 16.9%. So yes, option D.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I've heard that higher stability constants mean more complexation. So why is n=2, which has β2=40, giving a lower fraction than n=1, which has β1=9?

Ah, because with lower [SCN], the effect of n is significant.

Let me think: For n=1, β1=9, [SCN]=0.1 → 9 *0.1=0.9.

For n=2, β2=40, [SCN]^2=0.01 → 40*0.01=0.4.

So the term for n=1 is higher than for n=2.

So n=1 is more favored when [SCN] is 0.1 M, even though β2 is higher than β1.

So the distribution is dominated by the lower-order terms (n=0 and n=1) because [SCN] isn't high enough to favor higher n complexes.

Thus, the percentage for n=2 is 16.9%, so the correct answer is D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex (n=2) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants and the ligand concentration to calculate the mole fractions of each cobalt species. The stability constants provided are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16, and the thiocyanate concentration is [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.

The fraction of each cobalt species is proportional to the product of the stability constant and the ligand concentration raised to the power corresponding to the number of ligands (n). The total concentration of cobalt species is the sum of all such terms, including the uncomplexed Co²+ (n=0), which corresponds to a term of 1.

The fraction of the n=2 complex is given by:

\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Term}_0 = 1, \quad \text{Term}_1 = \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9, \quad \text{Term}_2 = \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4
\]
\[
\text{Term}_3 = \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063, \quad \text{Term}_4 = \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016
\]

The denominator is the sum of all terms:

\[
D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

The fraction of the n=2 complex is:

\[
f_2 = \frac{\text{Term}_2}{D} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

Converting to percentage:

\[
f_2 \approx 16.9\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex (n=2) is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
