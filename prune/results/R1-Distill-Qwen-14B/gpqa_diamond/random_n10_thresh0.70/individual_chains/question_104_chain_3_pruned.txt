Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

So, the setup is that there are two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun. Astronomers found exoplanets around each using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune. The orbits are circular.

Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift in the spectral lines, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer Planet #2's orbital period is compared to Planet #1's.

Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method relies on the Doppler shift. When a star moves towards us, its spectral lines shift blue (shorter wavelength), and when it moves away, they shift red (longer wavelength). The amount of shift depends on the velocity of the star towards or away from us.

The RV method measures the star's velocity as it's pulled by the planet's gravity. The formula I think is something involving the velocity semi-amplitude. Oh right, the formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p^3) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 * (1 - e^2) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 + (M_p/M_star))) )

Wait, but maybe that's more complicated than needed. Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star)^(1/3) ), but wait, I might be mixing up some terms.

Wait, let me think about the RV formula. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )

But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, another approach: the RV method gives the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's orbit. The maximum velocity (K) is given by:

K = (v) where v is the star's velocity due to the planet's gravitational pull.

The formula for K is approximately:

K = ( (G * P ) / (2 * pi * c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star
