Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure out which stars meet the brightness requirements for both.

Wait, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Oh, wait no, wait: brighter than 17? Because lower magnitude means brighter, right? So if a star's V magnitude is less than or equal to 17, ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, more than 16, meaning up to 16 mag and brighter.

So each star's apparent magnitude needs to be <=17 for ESPRESSO and <=16 for HIRES. Because if a star is brighter than 16, then both can see it? No, wait. Wait, no: ESPRESSO can observe stars up to 17 mag. So any star with V mag <=17 is observable by ESPRESSO. HIRES can observe stars up to 16. So any star with V mag <=16 is observable by HIRES. So the star must have V mag <=16 to be observed by both, because if it's 17, HIRES can't see it. Wait no, wait: wait, the question says for ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 can be observed. Wait, wait, the way it's worded: 'brighter than 17', which would be magnitude less than 17. Because lower magnitude is brighter. So if the apparent magnitude is more than 17, it's fainter than 17, so ESPRESSO can't see it. Or is it that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17. Hmm, the wording is a bit confusing.

Wait, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed." Oh, wait, so brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO. So if a star's V magnitude is, say, 16, it's brighter than 17? No, because 16 is brighter than 17. So that would mean that any star with V mag less than or equal to 17 is observable by ESPRESSO
