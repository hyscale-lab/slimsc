Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH, and I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so they should neutralize each other in the reaction.

First, let me break down what the problem says. We have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. We dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Wait, so the initial step is dilution. Because when you mix equal volumes of acid and water, the concentration decreases. So the initial diluted concentration of acetic acid will be half of 0.05 M, right? Oh wait, no, because concentration is moles over volume. So the original moles are 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ of water (same volume), the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Got it.

Now, when we titrate with NaOH, the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. The NaOH will neutralize the acetic acid. At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. And at equivalence, all of it has reacted.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the equivalence point first, maybe it's easier. At equivalence, all the acetic acid will have been converted into its conjugate base, acetate ions. So the solution will be a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so it should hydrolyze in water to make the solution basic.

So for the equivalence point, I can calculate the concentration of acetate ions and then find the pH using the Kb. Since Kb is Kw / Ka. Ka is given as 1.85
