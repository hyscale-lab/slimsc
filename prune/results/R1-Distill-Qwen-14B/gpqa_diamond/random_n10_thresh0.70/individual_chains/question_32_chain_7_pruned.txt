Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and figuring out the energy of the collider when the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that relativistic speeds involve using Einstein's equations, specifically dealing with gamma factors. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since the speed is given as 0.96c, that should help me calculate gamma.

Wait, but the problem isn't just about gamma. It's about finding the energy of the nucleus. Oh right, in particle physics, the total energy of a particle is gamma multiplied by its rest mass energy. So the energy E = gamma * m0c².

But wait, what's the rest mass of this nucleus? The problem states that X is Li with 3 neutrons. Let me think. Lithium usually has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons, so Li-6.

So the atomic mass of Li-6 is needed. I think I should look up the approximate mass of a Li-6 nucleus. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate it based on the number of protons and neutrons. Each proton has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c², same for neutrons, but wait, actually, the mass of a neutron is a bit less, but maybe for simplicity, we can take the average or use the given values.

Wait, precise mass data might be needed here. Let me think: The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015 g/mol. Wait, no, wait, I'm confusing grams per mole with per nucleus. Oh right, the molar mass is 6.015 g/mol, so the mass of one Li-6 nucleus is 6.015 / (Avogadro's number) grams. But since I'm working in GeV, perhaps I should convert that to energy units using E=mc².

Alternatively, I might remember that the rest mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². Hmm, but wait, I'm not sure if that's accurate. Let me think: the
