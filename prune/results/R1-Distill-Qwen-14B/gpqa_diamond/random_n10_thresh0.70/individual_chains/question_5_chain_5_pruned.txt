Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, with eigenvalue +ħ/2. The operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Hmm, first, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like angular momentum are represented as vectors, and the components (like P_x, P_y, P_z) are matrices. The operator P is probably the spin operator, since it's along x, y, z and has eigenvalues like ħ/2. So, the eigenvector we're looking for is an eigenstate of the operator P·n, where n is a direction in the x-z plane.

Wait, the direction n is arbitrary but in the x-z plane. So, n could be expressed as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), maybe? Or perhaps (cosθ, 0, sinθ), depending on the convention. Oh right, because in spherical coordinates, the direction in the x-z plane would have θ measured from the z-axis, so x would be r sinθ cosφ, but since it's in x-z, φ is zero. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), perhaps.

Wait, the operator P·n is P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. Since n is in x-z, n_y is zero. So P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

My goal is to find the eigenvector of this operator corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, I need to find the eigenvector equation (P·n)|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>.

But wait, P is a vector operator, so perhaps it's the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. Let me look at the given matrices.

Looking at P_x: it's (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]], which is (ħ/2) σ_x. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is (ħ/2) σ_y, and P_z is (ħ/2) [[1
