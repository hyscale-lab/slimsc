Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to figure it out. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, what do I remember about rhombohedral crystals?

Alright, a rhombohedral crystal system has all sides equal and all angles equal. So in this case, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms, and each angle alpha, beta, gamma is 30 degrees. Wait, the interatomic distance—does that mean the lattice parameter 'a' is 10 Angstroms? I think that's right because in a simple cubic system, the interatomic distance is just the edge length.

The interplanar distance, d, for a specific plane (hkl) can be found using the formula derived from the Bragg's law or the crystal planes. Oh right, the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos α) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos γ) ) ) but wait, I think I might have that wrong. Or maybe it's another formula when the angles are not 90 degrees. Let me think.

Oh wait, the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal with lattice a, and angles between the axes, is given by:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ )

Wait, but wait,
