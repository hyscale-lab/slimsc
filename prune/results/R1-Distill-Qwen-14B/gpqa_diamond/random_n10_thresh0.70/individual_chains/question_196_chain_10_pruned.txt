Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic context. The setup is a one-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. The speed of light is c, and they're asking for the maximum speed v_max.

From what I remember, in the classical (non-relativistic) case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator can be found using energy conservation. The potential energy at maximum displacement (amplitude A) is converted into kinetic energy at the equilibrium point (where speed is maximum). So for non-relativistic cases, the maximum speed v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m), right? But wait, that's the option C here. But the problem is relativistic, so I can't just use that.

In relativity, things get more complicated because as the object's speed approaches the speed of light, the relativistic effects become significant. The kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore; it's (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², I think. But the total energy would be the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic and potential energies. Wait, no, in relativistic mechanics, sometimes the potential is treated similarly, but the kinetic part is modified.

Let me outline the approach. At the maximum displacement x = A, the kinetic energy is zero, and all the energy is potential. At the equilibrium position (x=0), the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum. So the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy at that point.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Wait, in the relativistic case, the total energy E is the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. So E = gamma * m c². At maximum displacement, the potential energy is (1/2)k A². So the total energy would be E = (1/2)k A² + m c². Because at x = A, the object is momentarily at rest, so kinetic energy is zero, but the rest mass energy is still there. So when it
