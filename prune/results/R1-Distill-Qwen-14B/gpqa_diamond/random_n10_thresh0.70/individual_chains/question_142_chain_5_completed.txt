Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out where the given density matrix is positioned in the qubit space. Hmm, let's see. I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But wait, what's the geometrical position? Oh right, in the Bloch sphere representation, right? Because qubits can be represented on a sphere, the Bloch sphere.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me expand that. So each term is a projector. |0><0| is a matrix with 1 in the (1,1) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is 1 in (2,2) and zeros elsewhere. Adding these together, we get a diagonal matrix with 1s on the diagonal. Then multiply by 1/2, so the matrix becomes [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. 

Wait, what does this represent? I think a density matrix for a completely mixed state. Because when both |0> and |1> are equally probable, the state is maximally mixed, which would correspond to the completely depolarized state. In the Bloch sphere, pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. The completely mixed state is at the center, which is the origin.

So the Bloch vector for this state should be (0,0,0). Let me recall: the Bloch representation of a density matrix ρ is given by ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is the Bloch vector. Let's set up the equation. If ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, then 2ρ = I + r·σ. 

But our ρ is (I)/2, because (|0><0| + |1><1|) is the identity matrix. So 2*(1/2 I) = I. Therefore, I = I + r·σ. Subtracting I from both sides, 0 = r·σ. That implies that r is zero. So the vector r is (0,0,0). 

Looking back at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the correct answer must be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\left(|0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1|\right).
\]

Expanding this, we find that it is a diagonal matrix:

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix}
0.5 & 0 \\
0 & 0.5
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state, where the qubit is equally likely to be in the states \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\). In the Bloch sphere representation, pure states correspond to points on the surface of the sphere, while mixed states are inside the sphere. A maximally mixed state is located at the center of the Bloch sphere, which corresponds to the origin \((0,0,0)\).

The Bloch vector \(r\) is related to the density matrix by the formula:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + r \cdot \sigma}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix and \(\sigma\) are the Pauli matrices. Substituting \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\) into this equation, we find:

\[
\frac{I}{2} = \frac{I + r \cdot \sigma}{2}.
\]

Subtracting \(I/2\) from both sides gives \(r \cdot \sigma = 0\), which implies \(r = (0,0,0)\). Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \((0,0,0)\).

Answer: C
