Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully and try to break it down.

The question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y. The reaction produces a gas W, a precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used in organic chemistry as a reagent, especially a close analog.

First, I think I should identify what Substance X might be. The fact that it's used as a reagent in organic chemistry makes me think of common reagents. One that comes to mind is sodium or potassium, but maybe more likely, it's something like sodium or potassium hydroxide. Alternatively, maybe it's something like sodium or potassium, which are metals that react violently with water or other liquids.

Wait, the problem says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So perhaps X is a metal that has an isotope with a heavier mass. Let's think about metals commonly used as reagents. Maybe sodium or potassium, which are light, but the isotope part... Let me think about isotopes of sodium. The most common isotope is Na-23, which has 11 protons, 12 neutrons. Wait, but heavier isotopes would be like Na-25, which I'm not sure is common. Or maybe potassium, which has K-39, K-41, etc. K-41 is heavier than K-39, but I'm not sure.

The reaction between X and Y produces gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm, so W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about common gases. Could it be H2O? No, because H2O has H (1p, 0n) and O (8p, 8n?), wait, no. Alternatively, maybe something like NH3? No, because NH3 has 14 protons in total (1 for N, 3 for H) and 14 neutrons? Wait, that's not right. Wait, the molecule as a whole, not per atom.

Wait, the molecule's total protons equal the total neutrons. So for example, if W is CO2, then C has 6 p and
