Okay, so I've got this science question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. The question is about which physical theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences—those are the infinities that pop up in calculations. Without regularization, these infinities can make the math blow up, so you need a way to handle them. Regularization introduces a temporary cutoff or some other method to make the calculations finite, and then you take the cutoff away in a controlled way, maybe through renormalization.

Wait, right, renormalization is a process where you absorb these infinities into physical parameters like mass and charge, giving meaningful finite results. But some theories might not need regularization because they don't have these divergences—or maybe because the divergences are handled in another way.

So let's think about each option. 

Option A: Superstring Theory. Strings are tiny one-dimensional objects, right? Superstring theory is a type of string theory that incorporates supersymmetry. I think string theories in general are supposed to be finite and don't have the same kind of divergences as point particle theories. Because, in string theory, interactions are smooth and there's no point-like interaction, so maybe they don't need regularization. Or wait, do they? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I think in string theory, the perturbative expansions are better behaved, but I'm not entirely sure if they ever require regularization. Maybe they don't, but I'm not certain.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). That's the theory of the strong interaction. I remember that QCD does have issues with things like the quark confinement problem. Also, in the high-energy (or UV) limit, QCD becomes asymptotically free, which is why perturbation theory works at high energies. But wait, does that mean it doesn't require regularization? No, QCD is a quantum field theory with divergent loop integrals. So you need regularization and renormalization for QCD. So option B needs regularization, so it's not the correct answer.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism, dealing with electrons and photons. QED is a well-understood theory, and I know that it does require regularization. The calculations in QED have divergences, especially with loop diagrams. For example, the electron self-energy has divergences, and you need to regularize and renormalize QED. So option C does require regularization, so it's not the answer.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait a second. Classical theories don't involve the same divergences that quantum theories do. In classical E&M, you have Maxwell's equations, which are well-behaved. There are no infinities in the same way because you're not dealing with quantum fluctuations. So if the question is about a theory that never requires regularization, maybe this is the one. Because regularization is a quantum field theory technique.

Wait, but why is the question about high energies? Well, maybe in the high-energy limit, some classical theories might have issues, but I don't think classical E&M has any infinities in the same way as quantum theories do. For instance, the classical electron has a problem with radiation reaction, but that's more about the self-force, which might lead to some infinities, but I think in classical treatment, you just proceed without regularization because it's not a quantum effect.

So, putting it together: the theories that are quantum field theories (QCD, QED, Superstring) might require regularization, except maybe superstring theory. But wait, superstring theory is a quantum theory, so it must handle divergences. Alternatively, perhaps superstring theory doesn't need it because it's a different approach.

Wait, I remember that in perturbative string theory, the loop expansions (which are like the different orders beyond tree level) don't lead to the same kind of divergences as in QFT. Because in string theory, the interactions are different—they are not point interactions but rather extended. So maybe perturbative string theory calculations don't require the same type of regularization as Q
