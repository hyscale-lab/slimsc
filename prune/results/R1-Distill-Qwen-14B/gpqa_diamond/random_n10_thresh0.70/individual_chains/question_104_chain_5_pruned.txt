Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves a little back and forth, and we detect that as shifts in the spectral lines.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass, each having a planet similar to Neptune. Both have circular orbits. The key data points are the shifts in the spectral lines: 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2.

Wait, but how does the shift relate to anything else? I think the RV method gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's mass and the orbital period. Oh right, the formula I remember is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) or something along those lines. Or maybe it's better to think in terms of the Doppler shift formula.

Wait no, let's think about the formula for the semi-amplitude K of the star's velocity. The formula is K = ( (G * M_planet * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) multiplied by some constants. But since the planet masses are much smaller than the stars, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star, and since sin i is approximately 1 (because the orbits are probably edge-on, but the problem doesn't specify—so I guess we can assume sin i = 1 for both).

So K is proportional to (M_planet) / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3)) )^(1/1) — wait, no, let me get it right. The exact formula I think is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( (1)/(P * (1 - e²)^(3/2)) ) )^(1/3) ) — but wait, that's getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a simplified approach.

Wait another approach: The Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star. The RV method gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity as K = (v). The formula relating K to the planet's orbit is K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 AU)^(1/3) * P^(1/3) * (2π) ) * (1/(c)) )) — wait, maybe not. Alternatively, I remember that K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (P/(2π)) )^(-1/3). But I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the ratio between the two planets. Since both stars have the same mass and both planets have the same mass (similar to Neptune), but their RV shifts are different. So the K (velocity semi-amplitude) is different.

So K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) ) * ( (1/(P
