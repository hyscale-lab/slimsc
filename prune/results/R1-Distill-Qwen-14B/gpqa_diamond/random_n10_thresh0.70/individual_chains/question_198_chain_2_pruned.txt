Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out step by step.

The problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the different complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I'm supposed to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The options are A to D.

Wait, so stability constants, right? Those are formation constants. Each β represents the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex. For each complex, the higher the β, the more stable it is.

I think the complexes form stepwise. Like, first Co(SCN)1^-, then Co(SCN)2, and so on. The β values given are for each step of the formation.

So the complexes are:
Co²+ + SCN^- ↔ CoSCN^- (β1=9)
CoSCN^- + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)2^2- (β2=40)
Co(SCN)2^2- + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)3^3- (β3=63)
Co(SCN)3^3- + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)4^4- (β4=16)

Wait, wait, but β4 is 16, which is lower than β3. That's interesting. So the fourth complex might not form as much as the third.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think dithiocyanato would mean two SCN ligands. So that's the Co(SCN)2^2- complex. So, I need to find the fraction of all cobalt species that are in the Co(SCN)2^2- form.

But wait, blue might refer to a specific complex. I'm a bit confused. Oh, wait, the problem says "dithiocyanato", meaning two SCN- ligands. So we're looking for the concentration of Co(SCN)_2^{n-} divided by the total concentration of all cobalt species.

So first, I need to model the formation of all possible
