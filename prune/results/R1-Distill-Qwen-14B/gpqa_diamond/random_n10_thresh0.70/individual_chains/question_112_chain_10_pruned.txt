Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about calculating probabilities and the average value of an operator. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vectors and operators play a big role here. Let me read the problem again.

The state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh wait, proportional, so I guess we need to normalize it first. The states |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, |up> and |down> form an orthonormal basis.

The operator given has matrix elements A_ij. The elements are such that A_ij is hbar/2 when i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that would make the matrix a 2x2 matrix, since it's acting on a two-level system. Let me think: so the operator A would look like this:

[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0 ]

Because if iâ‰ j, the elements are non-zero. So the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. Hmm, that looks familiar. Oh right, that's similar to the Pauli X matrix multiplied by some factor. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

Wait, but the operator in question is whose matrix is A_ij. So it's a 2x2 matrix with zero diagonal and A_12 = A_21 = hbar/2. So that's the operator we need to consider.

The first task is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of this operator. Oh, wait, the eigenstates of A. Because when you measure an operator, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues, and the state collapses into the corresponding eigenstate. So the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes of the eigenstates in the given state |alpha>.

But wait, what are the eigenstates of A? Since A is proportional to the Pauli X matrix, its eigenstates are the same as those of the Pauli X. The Pauli X has eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates for the spin in the x-direction. Let me recall: the eigenstates of sigma_x (Pauli X) are (|up
