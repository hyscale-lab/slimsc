Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to piece it together.

The question is: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? And the options are given.

Wait, so the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, and towards the observer. So, the glass is moving toward the lab frame. Wait, but the light is also moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. Hmm, so the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, and the light is moving in that same direction.

I remember that when dealing with velocities in different frames, we might need to use the velocity addition formulas from relativity, but wait, this is about light in a medium. Oh right, the speed of light in a medium isn't c in the medium's rest frame; it's c/n, where n is the refractive index. But I'm getting confused because the medium itself is moving.

Wait, but in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. Oh wait, but the problem is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame. So if the glass is moving, does that affect the speed of the light inside it as observed in the lab?

Wait, no. Because from the lab frame, the glass is moving, but the speed of
