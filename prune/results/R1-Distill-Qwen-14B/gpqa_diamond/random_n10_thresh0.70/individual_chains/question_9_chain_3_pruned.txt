Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, C3h symmetry... I remember that symmetry in molecules involves certain operations like rotations and reflections that leave the molecule looking the same. 

Wait, C3h is a type of molecular symmetry. Let me think. I think C3h is a point group. Point groups are used in molecular symmetry to classify molecules based on their symmetry elements. So, C3h has a threefold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (Ïƒh). Or wait, sometimes the notation can be a bit confusing. I think in some sources, C3h is actually the same as D3h but without the inversion or something... Wait, maybe I should clarify.

Wait, no, D3h is a higher symmetry group, I think. The C3h group has a threefold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, maybe it's a horizontal mirror plane and a threefold axis perpendicular to it. Or is it the other way around? Hmm, perhaps I should recall the order of the point groups. Oh right, C3h is lower symmetry than D3h. So, C3h has a threefold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane that includes that axis.

So the molecule must have a threefold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Let's look at the options.

The options are four molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7
