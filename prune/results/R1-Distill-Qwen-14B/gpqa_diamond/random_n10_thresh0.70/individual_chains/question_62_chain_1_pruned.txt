Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using a sequence of reagents. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I'll try to visualize the target structure. The name suggests that there's a cyclohexane ring, and attached to it is a carbonyl group (since it's a carbaldehyde) and another group which is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. Wait, maybe I should draw it out. The main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, meaning a cyclohexane ring with a CH₂CHO group. But wait, the first part is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), so perhaps the cyclohexane has a substituent at the 1-position, which is a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH₂ group that has a hydroxyl. So, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a CH₂CHO group and another CH₂-OH group attached, but wait, no—the substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So that would be CH₂-OH attached to a cyclohexyl group. Wait, no, maybe it's a methyl group that is substituted with both cyclohexyl and hydroxyl groups. So,
