Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's going on.

The setup is about a spherical conductor. It's uncharged, which probably means it has no net charge initially. The conductor has a radius R, and inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of this cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. So, the cavity isn't right in the middle; it's shifted by s. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R, which makes sense because the cavity is inside.

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the spherical conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance of P from the cavity's center is l, and both l and L are greater than R. Also, there's an angle Î¸ between l and s.

The multiple-choice options are A, B, C, D, each giving a different expression for E.

Hmm. So, I remember that when charges are inside a conductor, the conductor's charges will redistribute, and that affects the electric field outside. But wait, the conductor is initially uncharged, and then a charge q is placed inside the cavity. So, how does that affect the conductor?

I think about the concept of electrostatic shielding. Charges inside a conductor's cavity affect the conductor's induced charges, but the electric field outside the conductor depends on the total enclosed charge. Oh right, from Gauss's Law, the electric field outside a conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor, not on where the charge is located inside.

Wait, but wait. Wait a second, in this setup, the conductor is neutral initially. Then, when a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the conductor must have induced charges. So, the inner surface of the conductor (the one facing the cavity) would have an induced charge of -q, because it's induced by the +q charge. But since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must then have a charge of +q, to balance it out. So the total charge on the conductor is +q.

Wait, no. Wait, the conductor is initially uncharged. When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) must have an induced
