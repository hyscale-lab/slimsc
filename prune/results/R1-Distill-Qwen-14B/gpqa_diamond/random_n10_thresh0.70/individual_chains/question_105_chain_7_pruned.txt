Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the setup is about a star similar to the Sun, radius same as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because of this, when we observe the star, the brightness variations due to rotation look like they could be caused by an exoplanet. The question is, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as this spotted star?

Hmm. The options are A to D, with various fractions. I need to find Rpl/Rstar.

Wait, the filling factor is 20%. I think the filling factor (f) is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So f is 0.2. So 20% of the star's surface is spots.

The star's Teff is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler, so their temperature is 5000K.

When a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light. The change in brightness (the dip) is proportional to the area blocked. So the maximum dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2, assuming the planet is a perfect disk and blocks the star uniformly.

But in this case, the star has spots, so the brightness variation is due to the spots rotating in and out of view. The amplitude of this variation would depend on the temperature difference between the spots and the rest of the star, as well as the area covered by the spots.

Wait, but when the spots are on the visible side, the star's total brightness is lower because spots emit less. So the variation in brightness would be the difference between when the spots are facing us (lower brightness) and when they're not. But since the star is rotating, the spots come into view and then go out of view, causing the brightness to dip and rise.

But in the problem, it's said that this situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So when the star's brightness varies because of the spots, it's similar to the dip caused by a planet transit. The question is, what would the planet's radius have to be to make the same amplitude in the light curve.

So, first, I need to calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots. Then, compare that to the amplitude caused by a planet transit, and solve for R_planet.

The amplitude for the planet is (R_p / R_s)^2, assuming the star's flux is uniform. But because the star has spots, the amplitude would be different.

So, how does the presence of spots change the brightness variation? Let's think about the star's surface as having two regions: the spotted area and the unspotted area.

The star's total flux without spots would be based on its effective temperature, T_eff. But when spots are present, the total flux is the sum of the flux from the spotted regions and the unspotted regions.

Flux from a star's surface is given by sigma * T^4 per unit area. So the total flux F is (f * (T_spot)^4 + (1 - f) * (T_star)^4 ) multiplied by the total surface area.

But when the star rotates, only one hemisphere is spotted, right? Wait, the question says, "only one hemisphere is spotty." Oh, wait, I think I might have misread that earlier. So the entire hemisphere is covered in spots. So f is 20%? Or is it that each hemisphere has 20% coverage?

Wait, the filling factor is 20% for each hemisphere. So each hemisphere (Northern and Southern, maybe) has 20% spots. But the question says that only one hemisphere is spotty. Hmm, no. Wait, the question says, "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." Oh, maybe I misread that. So one entire hemisphere is covered in spots. Wait, that can't be. Because a hemisphere is half the surface area. If the entire hemisphere is covered in spots with a
