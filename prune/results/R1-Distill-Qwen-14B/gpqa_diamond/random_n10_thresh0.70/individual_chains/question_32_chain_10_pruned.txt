Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and calculating the energy of a nucleus moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativistic mechanics, but let's try to work through this step by step.

First, I need to figure out what the nucleus is. The problem says it's X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Lithium usually has 3 protons. Wait, Li has atomic number 3, so if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion. I guess for the purpose of calculating its energy, we can treat it as a single particle with mass equal to the mass of a Li-6 nucleus. But wait, actually, maybe each nucleon contributes its rest mass energy. Or perhaps it's better to model it as a system of protons and neutrons, but perhaps the problem simplifies it by considering the nucleus as a single particle with mass equal to the sum of the individual nucleons. Hmm, but wait, the actual mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the sum due to binding energy, but I think for this problem, we can approximate it by the sum of individual nucleon masses. Or maybe the problem expects me to use the mass of a single proton, but no, because it's a Li nucleus with 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Wait, but the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus is a specific value. I'm not exactly sure about that, but I remember that the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². So let's calculate the total rest mass energy of the nucleus.

So for Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So each proton is about 938 MeV, each neutron around 939. So total mass would be 3*(938 +939) MeV? Wait, no, wait. Each proton and neutron contributes their mass. So 3*(938) for protons plus 3*(939) for neutrons. Let me calculate that: 3*(938 +939) = 3*(1877) = 5631 MeV, which is 5.631 GeV. But wait, wait, is that the correct approach?

Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is a specific known value. I think I should look that up, but since I can't, maybe I'll proceed with the approximation. So let's take the mass as the sum of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So each proton is m_p ≈ 938.272 MeV/c² and neutron is m_n ≈ 939.565 MeV/c². So the total rest mass energy is 3*(938.272) + 3*(939.565) = let's compute that.

3 * 938.272 = 2814.816 MeV
3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV
Total: 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV, which is 5.633511 GeV.

So the rest energy m*c² is about 5.6335 GeV.

Wait, but another approach: when dealing with heavy ions in colliders, the mass used is often the reduced mass of the two colliding nuclei. But the problem states it's the energy of the nucleus X, so perhaps it's a single-particle energy. I'll proceed with that assumption.

The speed is 0.96c, so I need to find the total energy E of the nucleus, which is gamma times m c squared.

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, given by 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So v is 0.96c, so let's compute gamma.

v = 0.96c → beta = v/c = 0.96.

So beta squared is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - beta squared = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.57142857.

So E = gamma * m c².

We have m c² as 5.6335 GeV. So E = 3.57142857 * 5.6335 GeV.

Let me compute that.
