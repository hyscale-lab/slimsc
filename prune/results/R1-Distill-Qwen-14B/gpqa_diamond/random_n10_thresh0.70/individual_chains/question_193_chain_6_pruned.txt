Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Wait, parallax is usually denoted as 'p' or sometimes 'plx', right? So the relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. 

Hmm, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. The formula I think is distance d = 1/(p), where p is the parallax in parsecs. Or wait, no, I think it's d = 1/(p) when p is in arcseconds. Because 1 parsec is the distance at which 1 AU subtends 1 arcsecond. So yes, if the parallax p decreases, the distance increases. So p = 1/d, so d = 1/p.

So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(p)^5. Let's write that as N ∝ p^(-5). Since d = 1/p, that would mean p = 1/d, so substituting that into N's equation: N ∝ ( (1/d) )^(-5) ) = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. 

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. Oh, right. So it's about the number of stars per unit distance, like the density or the rate of change. Or wait, maybe it's about the number of stars in a shell between r and r+dr. Because when you're considering a range, you're thinking in terms of differential quantities.

Let me think about that. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr would be the number density multiplied by the volume. But wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, the number of stars as a function of distance could be represented by N(r) dr, which is the number in a shell of thickness dr at distance r. So N(r) dr would be proportional to r^5 dr? Wait, earlier I found that N is proportional to r^5, which would be for a given r. But wait, wait.

Wait, I might have gotten ahead of myself. Let's re-examine.

Given that N ∝ 1/p^5. Since p = 1/d, then N ∝ d^5. So N increases as d^5. But how does the
