Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration calculations. Let's see what the problem is about. 

Alright, the question says that we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values. 

Wait, the Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5. Okay, I've seen that before, so that's good.

First, I think I need to figure out the concentration of the acetic acid solution after dilution. Because when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we're adding another 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³.

The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So the initial concentration M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. The final volume V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 would be (M1*V1)/V2. Let me calculate that. 0.05 * 20 / 40 = 1 M? Wait, no. 0.05 * 20 is 1, divided by 40 gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 0.05 M is molarity. So 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid has a certain number of moles. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M × 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) gives 0.001 moles of acetic acid. Then, when we add 20 cm³ of water, total volume is 40 cm³, so 0.04 L. So concentration is moles / volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yeah
