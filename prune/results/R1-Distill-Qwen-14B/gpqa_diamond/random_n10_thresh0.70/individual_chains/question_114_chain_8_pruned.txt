Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for each reaction. Let me go through it step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, especially under specific conditions, it's usually a nucleophilic addition. Wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone, right? So, adding NaCN here... NaCN is a source of the cyanide ion, which is a strong nucleophile.

Wait, but ketones typically react with nucleophiles in a nucleophilic addition. Like, for example, in the formation of cyanohydrins. Oh right, the cyanohydrin reaction! That's when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with a cyanide in the presence of a strong acid. The acid protonates the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic, and then the cyanide attacks, followed by water acting as a nucleophile to form the hydroxyl group. So the product is a secondary alcohol adjacent to the nitrile group.

So for this reaction, reagent A has to be an acid catalyst. Looking at the options, the possible A's are H3O+ or NaHSO3. H3O+ is a strong acid, which makes sense. NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a weaker acid and can act as a reducing agent, but I'm not sure if it's used here. The cyanohydrin formation usually uses an acid like H2SO4 or HCl as a catalyst. So for this first step, A is probably H3O+.

Then the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait, the nitrile group is turning into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen? Oh, I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions to form carboxylic acids. The typical conditions are either under acidic or basic conditions, with heat and water.

So the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids usually requires strong acidic or basic conditions. But wait, the reagent B is H2O. Wait, but maybe in this case, the
