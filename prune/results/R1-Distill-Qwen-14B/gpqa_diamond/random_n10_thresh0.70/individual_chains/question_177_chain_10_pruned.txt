Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. Let me read it carefully. 

So, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. They found the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. The radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. We are to assume the stars radiate as black bodies and find by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. The options are A to D, with numbers around 2.2 to 2.35.

Hmm, I remember that the luminosity of a star relates to its radius and temperature. The formula for luminosity is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

The problem says both stars have the same wavelength at which they appear brightest. That wavelength is the peak of their black body radiation, which, according to Wien's Law, is inversely proportional to the temperature. So, λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Wait, no, wait: if λ_max is same, then T must be same. Because if λ_max is same, then T would be same since λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait another moment. Oh, but wait, wait wait. No, I think I got that wrong. Wien's Law says λ_max * T = constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, then T must be the same. Because λ1 = λ2, so T1 = T2, because λ*T = const. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, that can't be right because the question gives their radial velocities. Oh, but wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift. Because if a star is moving towards us or away from us, the observed wavelengths shift. So the peak wavelength we observe is different from the star's rest wavelength.

So, the star's emitting at a certain peak wavelength, but due to radial velocity, we observe a different wavelength. So
