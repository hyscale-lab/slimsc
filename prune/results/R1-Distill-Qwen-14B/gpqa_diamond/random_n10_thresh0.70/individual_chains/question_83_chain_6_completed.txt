Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration calculations. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A to D, each with two pH values.

First, I think I should outline the steps I need to take. So, when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. Then, when you titrate, you're neutralizing the acid with the base. At 25% titration, only a quarter of the acetic acid has reacted, and at equivalence, all of it has reacted. 

Let me break it down step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.

We had 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³. 

Molarity (M) is moles per liter. So the initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) are:

Moles = Molarity × Volume (L)
So, 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

After dilution, the new volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is:

M = moles / volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M.

So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Step 2: Determine the volume of NaOH needed at equivalence point.

The reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O

At equivalence, moles of NaOH = moles of CH3COOH.

Moles of CH3COOH initially is 0.001 moles. So, moles of NaOH needed is also 0.001.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume = moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 liters, which is 10 cm³.

So, the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But wait, the question isn't just about equivalence. It's about the pH at 25% titration and equivalence.

So for 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So 25% of 0.001 moles is 0.00025 moles of NaOH added.

The total volume at 25% titration would be initial solution volume (40 cm³) plus 25% of the equivalence volume (which is 10 cm³). So 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

But wait, maybe it's easier to calculate moles directly.

Another approach: the moles of acetic acid initially is 0.001. At 25% titration, 0.25 × 0.001 = 0.00025 moles have reacted. So the remaining acetic acid is 0.00075 moles, and we have 0.00025 moles of acetate ions (CH3COO^-) formed.

So the solution at 25% titration is a buffer solution of acetic acid and its conjugate base. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85e-5) ≈ Let's compute that.

Calculating pKa:

1.85e-5 is the same as 1.85 × 10^-5. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

Wait, wait, let me double-check. Wait, log(1.85) is approximately 0.2672. So pKa = 4.733.

So pH = pKa + log (moles of A^- / moles of HA)

At 25% titration: moles of A^- is 0.00025, and moles of HA is 0.00075.

So the ratio is (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3.

Log(1/3) is log(0.3333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 + (-0.477) = approximately 4.256. Rounded to two decimal places, that's about 4.26.

Wait, but wait, the problem says 25% titration. Oh, but initial solution is 40 cm³, and we add 25% of the NaOH needed for equivalence. Equivalence requires 10 cm³ NaOH, so 25% is 2.5 cm³. So the total solution volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³.

But when using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, the ratio of concentrations is the same as the ratio of moles because the volume is the same for both (they are in the same solution), so the volume cancels out. So yeah, the ratio is 1/3, so log(1/3) is -0.477. So pH is ~4.73 - 0.477 = approx 4.25.

Which matches the first value in option A (4.26) and option D (4.57). Hmm, wait, but in option D, the first value is 4.57, which is higher. So perhaps I did a mistake in the calculation.

Wait wait, let me recheck the ratio. At 25% titration, we've added 25% of the NaOH needed to reach equivalence. So moles of NaOH added is 25% of 0.001 moles, which is 0.00025 moles.

So the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So initial moles:

CH3COOH: 0.001 moles.

NaOH added: 0.00025 moles.

So moles after reaction:

CH3COOH: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

CH3COO^-: 0 + 0.00025 moles.

So the ratio is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3.

So pH = pKa + log(1/3) ≈ 4.73 + (-0.477) = ~4.25.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52, option D is 4.57 and 6.92.

Hmm, but why is option D's first value 4.57? Maybe I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the initial concentration after dilution.

Wait, initial moles of acetic acid: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ water, volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That part seems correct.

So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

At 25% titration, the moles of NaOH added are 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025. That's correct.

So the buffer pH is 4.73 + log(1/3) ≈ 4.25.

Looking back at the options, option A is 4.26; 8.52. The second value is 8.52, which is higher than 7, so probably the equivalence point is beyond 7, but what's actually the pH at equivalence?

Wait, the equivalence point for a weak acid and strong base is in the basic region. The pH will be determined by the acetate ion, which is the conjugate base of a weak acid.

So, at equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water.

So moles of acetate ions: 0.001 moles.

The total volume at equivalence is 40 cm³ (original) + 10 cm³ (NaOH) = 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

Concentration of CH3COO^- is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, CH3COO^- is a weak base. It will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb can be calculated from Kw / Ka.

Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Then, the concentration is 0.02 M. Let's set up the expression for Kb.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assume x is the concentration of OH^- produced.

Kb ≈ x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02, since Kb is very small.

So x² = Kb * 0.02 = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 3.29e-6 → pOH = -log(3.29e-6) ≈ 5.485.

pH = 14 - 5.485 ≈ 8.515, which rounds to ~8.52.

So the pH at equivalence is about 8.52.

Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 and 8.52. The first value is 4.26, which matches our 25% titration pH. The second is 8.52, which matches the equivalence pH.

But wait, looking back at the options, option D is 4.57 and 6.92. I must have made a mistake because the equivalence pH is way higher than 7, which is basic.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the equivalence point.

Wait, the initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid. The volume is 40 cm³. When titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH added equals moles of CH3COOH.

Moles CH3COOH: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles.

Moles NaOH needed: 0.001.

Volume NaOH = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So total volume at equivalence: 40 +10=50 cm³. So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

So Kb is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10. So yes, correct.

So [OH^-] is sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6. So pOH is about 5.48, pH around 8.52.

So the equivalence pH is 8.52. So the two pH values are approximately 4.26 and 8.52. Looking at the options, option A says 4.26; 8.52. So that's the matching option.

Wait, but let me check another option. What about option D: 4.57 and 6.92. That would imply the pH at equivalence is around 6.92, which is acidic, which doesn't make sense because equivalence for a weak acid titration with a strong base is always in the basic region.

So option A is the only one where the equivalence pH is above 7.

Hmm, but wait, I need to double-check the 25% titration calculation.

Wait, another approach: maybe instead of using the Henderson equation, I can calculate it using the exact concentrations after mixing.

Wait, at 25% titration, the solution is a buffer. So let me calculate the concentrations.

Initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.00025 (25% of 0.001).

So moles of CH3COOH after reaction: 0.00075.

Moles of CH3COO^-: 0.00025.

The total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So applying Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]) = 4.733 + log(0.005882/0.017647).

Calculate 0.005882 /0.017647 ≈ 0.333.

Log(0.333) is about -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 -0.477 ≈ 4.256, which is about 4.26. So that's correct.

So the pH at 25% is 4.26, and equivalence pH is 8.52. So the correct option is A.

But wait, looking at the options again:

Option A says pH at 25% is 4.26, and equivalence is 8.52. Option D has 4.57 and 6.92.

So I think option A is correct. So the answer should be A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, there are 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, containing:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{moles}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### pH at 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH added} = 0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The remaining moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH₃COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The moles of acetate ions (CH₃COO⁻) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH₃COO⁻} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume of the solution at 25% titration is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 2.5 \, \text{cm³} = 42.5 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of CH₃COOH and CH₃COO⁻ are:

\[
[\text{CH₃COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH₃COO⁻}]}{[\text{CH₃COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

### pH at Equivalence Point
At equivalence, all the acetic acid has reacted, forming acetate ions. The moles of acetate ions are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH₃COO⁻} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume at equivalence is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 10.00 \, \text{cm³} = 50.00 \, \text{cm³} = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

Acetate ions act as a weak base in water, hydrolyzing according to:

\[
\text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH₃COOH} + \text{OH⁻}.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is:

\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{\text{K}_w}{\text{K}_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let the concentration of \(\text{OH⁻}\) at equilibrium be \(x\). Using the expression for \(\text{K}_b\):

\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH₃COO⁻}] - x}.
\]

Since \(\text{K}_b\) is very small, \(x \ll 0.02\), so:

\[
\text{K}_b \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x^2 = \text{K}_b \times 0.02 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \times 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}, \quad x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.485.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.485 = 8.515 \approx 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**A) 4.26; 8.52**
