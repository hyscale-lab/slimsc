Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down. Hmm. The question is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I'll have to calculate both values and see which option matches.

First, let's read the problem again. We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So that's mixing equal volumes, which would dilute the concentration by half, right? Because the volume doubles. So initial concentration is 0.05 M, after dilution, it's 0.025 M.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 equals (M1V1)/V2. M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, V2 is 40 cm³ (20+20). So, M2 = (0.05 *20)/40 = (1)/40 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Next, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The first part is to find the pH at 25% titration. 

So, 25% titration means that 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so they'll neutralize each other.

First, I need to find the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. The volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. Moles = Molarity × Volume. So moles of CH3COOH = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid is neutralized. So moles of NaOH added would be 0.25 × 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol.

Wait, but wait. NaOH is a strong base, so it will react completely. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So, the initial moles of CH3COOH are 0.001 mol. After adding 0.00025 mol of NaOH, moles of CH3COOH left would be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

And moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) formed would be 0.00025 mol.

So, the solution now is a buffer solution containing both acetic acid and its conjugate base. The pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is the negative logarithm of Ka. Given Ka is 1.85e-5. So, pKa = log
