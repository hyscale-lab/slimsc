Okay, I need to solve this physics problem. Let me read it again.

So the question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. The mass is negligible, so maybe I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or gravitational effects. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. I'm supposed to find the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals, and choose the right answer from the options given.

Hmm, so the system's energy. Since all these charges are electric, I think the problem is about electric potential energy. Because the particles are charged, their arrangement will influence the potential energy of the system. 

Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of those 12 charges is 2 meters away from the fixed charge. But what about the potential energy between each other? Since they are all identical and placed at 2 meters from P, but their positions relative to each other? Hmm, that's a bit tricky.

I remember that the potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. So for each charge, I need to calculate the potential energy it has with every other charge.

So, the system has two contributions: the energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12 charges, plus the energy between each pair of the 12 charges among themselves.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. So each of the 12 is 2 m from P. But how are they arranged around P? Are they all on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 m? So each of them is at a distance of 2 m from P, but their mutual distances vary. But calculating the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges would require knowing their distances from each other. But if all 12 are equally spaced on a sphere, the problem might be symmetric, but I don't think the exact arrangement is given. So maybe I can assume that the mutual distances between the 12 charges are all 2 meters? Or perhaps we're supposed to ignore the energy between the 12 charges because they're constrained and the problem is much simpler?

Wait, the problem is about the minimum energy. So maybe the 12 charges are placed in such a way that the potential energy is minimized. How does arranging the
