Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, I remember that neutrinos are produced in various nuclear reactions in the sun, especially in the proton-proton chain. The question is talking about the pp-III branch stopping. Wait, what's the pp-III branch again?

I think the proton-proton chain has a couple of branches. The main pp-I branch produces helium-4, and there's also the pp-II branch. Oh wait, pp-III might be a part of the chain that produces higher energy neutrinos. I remember that the pp-III branch involves reactions with heavier isotopes, like maybe boron or something. Oh right, the pp-III branch is where a proton captures a boron-8 nucleus, which then emits a positron and two neutrinos. Boron-8 is a major source of high-energy neutrinos, I think.

So the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh, because that's roughly the time it takes for sunlight to travel from the core to the Earth. So if the pp-III branch stops, the Earth would see a change in neutrino flux after about 8.5 minutes. But since the question is about the current state, the effect must have arrived already.

The question is about the ratio of flux between two energy bands. Band 1 is 700-800 keV, Band 2 is 800-900 keV. So we're looking at high-energy neutrinos here. 

I recall that the pp-III branch produces neutrinos around
