Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method looks for Doppler shifts in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift's periodicity tells us about the planet's orbit.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass, each having a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV shifts detected are 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2. I need to find how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, the RV method detects the star's velocity towards and away from us. The formula for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P * (1 - e²)^(3/2)) ) ) )^(1/1) ) ... or something like that. Wait, maybe the formula is better written as K = ( (2πG) ) / (c * P ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ), but since M_p is much smaller than M_star (like Neptune is much less than Sun), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies.

Wait, I think the simplified formula when M_p << M_star is K ≈ (v) = ( (2π G) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(c)) ), but I might have the constants wrong. Alternatively, another approach comes to mind: the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)) ). Since both stars have the same mass as the Sun, M_star is the same for both. And the planets have masses similar to Neptune, so M_p is the same for both planets as well. Also, since the planets are detected, sin i is probably close to 1 (edge-on orbits, so they maximize the RV signal). So i can assume sin i ≈ 1 for both.

So, K1 and K2 are the RV shifts for planet 1 and 2. The question says K1 is 5 milliangstrom and K2 is 7 milliangstrom. Wait wait, no, wait. Wait, the shift is inversely proportional to the period? Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K is larger, that would mean a smaller P. Because K is bigger, you have a smaller P.

Wait, let's write the formula again. Let me think: K is the semi-amplitude of the RV, which is given by K = (v) = ( ( G * M_p ) / ( ( M_star )^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/ something). Hmm, perhaps it's better to consider the equation in terms of K and P.

Wait, I might have forgotten the exact formula, but I think K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3
