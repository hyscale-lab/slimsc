Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals are part of the cubic crystal system, but they have all edges equal and all angles equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. So in this case, the angles α, β, and γ are each 30 degrees, which is pretty small.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom, but wait, in a crystal structure, the interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice parameter. So I think a rhombohedral structure has a = b = c, but the angles between them are all the same. So first, I need to find the lattice parameter 'a' which is 10 Angstrom. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the interatomic distance is the distance between atoms. In a simple cubic structure, the lattice parameter 'a' is equal to the interatomic distance. But in a rhombohedral structure, which is a type of cubic system but with angles not 90 degrees, I'm a bit confused about how to approach it.

Wait, no, wait. The problem says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Maybe that's the same as the lattice parameter 'a'? Because in a simple cubic structure, each atom is at the corners, and the distance between them is 'a'. But in a rhombohedral structure, which has a basis, maybe? Or perhaps not. Wait, I'm not sure. Let me get back to the question.

The question is about the inter
