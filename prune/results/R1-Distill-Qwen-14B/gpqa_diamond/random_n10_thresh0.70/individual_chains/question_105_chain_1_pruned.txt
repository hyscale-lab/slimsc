Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it step by step. I'll need to think carefully because it's a bit tricky.

The question is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because the spots are only on one hemisphere, when the star rotates, the brightness variations observed from Earth will look similar to those caused by an exoplanet transit. The question is asking what the radius of the exoplanet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the spots do.

Hmm, so first, I need to understand what causes the brightness variations in both scenarios. In the case of the star with spots, as it rotates, the spots come into and out of view. Since the spots are cooler, when they are on the side facing us, the total brightness decreases because that area is less bright. For the exoplanet, when it transits in front of the star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness.

The key here is to find the relative radius of the planet (Rpl) compared to the star (Rstar) such that the dip in brightness (amplitude) is the same as the dip caused by the spots.

Let's break it down.

First, let's think about the star's brightness variation due to spots. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, but wait, since it's a hemisphere, the total area covered is 20% of the entire star's surface? No, wait, a hemisphere is half the star's surface. So the spots are covering 20% of that hemisphere. So the total area of the spots is 20% of half the star's surface. Alternatively, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, so 10% of the total surface? Wait, let me clarify.

Filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's area covered by spots. So if the filling factor is 20% (0.2), that means 20% of the hemisphere is covered. Since a hemisphere is half the star, 20% of half is 10% of the total surface. So the spots cover 10% of the star's surface area.

But wait, the star's rotation is such that only one hemisphere
