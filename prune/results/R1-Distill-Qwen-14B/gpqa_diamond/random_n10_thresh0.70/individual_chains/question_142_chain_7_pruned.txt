Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in qubit space. Hmmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed, not pure.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, this is the density matrix for a completely mixed state. Because when you have a classical mixture of the states |0> and |1>, each with equal probability, the density matrix should be the average of the projections onto these states. So, each term is |0><0| and |1><1|, each multiplied by 1/2.

But the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I think I remember that the Bloch sphere is used to represent the state of a qubit. The Bloch sphere has a radius of 1, and any state can be represented as a point on the surface for pure states, or inside for mixed states.

Wait, the density matrix must satisfy certain conditions. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector components. Let's think. The general form of a density matrix for a single qubit is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (the Bloch vector) with components (x,y,z). The length of r must be ≤1 for a
