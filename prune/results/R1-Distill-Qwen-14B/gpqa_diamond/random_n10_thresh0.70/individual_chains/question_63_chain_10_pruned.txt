Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule transitioning between energy states. Hmm, the question says that the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon. I need to find the momentum of that photon so that the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, for diatomic molecules, the energy levels are quantized in both rotation and vibration. But I'm a bit confused about whether the problem is considering rotation, vibration, or both.

The question mentions moving to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I think the next state would be the next higher energy state, which could be a combination of a higher vibrational and/or rotational state.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So maybe the next state is the first excited state. But in quantum mechanics, for a diatomic molecule, the energy levels are the sum of rotational and vibrational contributions. Oh, right, in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized, and the vibrational are too. But wait, the problem gives the angular frequency for vibration, which is w=4e14 rad/s. So perhaps the transition is a vibrational one, or maybe a rotational one, or both.

Wait, but the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state would be the next energy level, which is the first excited state. I think the energy levels for rotation and vibration are quantized. So the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state could be either v=1 (vibrational first excited state) or J=1 (rotational first excited state).

Wait, but wait: in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized as well. So the energy levels would be E_rot = B * J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. But I also need to consider the vibrational energy, which is E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w. Hmm, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps it's a transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next lowest state, which could be either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). Which of these has a lower energy?

Wait, let me calculate the
