Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem talks about Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Then it reacts with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which is around 4 degrees Celsius, maybe. Then there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and its analog is similar.

Hmm. Okay, let's start by identifying each part.

First, the reaction of X with Y. It's a violent reaction, so maybe something like a metal reacting with an acid. Gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. That suggests W is a molecule where protons equal neutrons. Wait, but gas molecules usually have H, O, N, or maybe something else. Let's think. If W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons, maybe it's something like H2O, but that's not a gas. Wait, maybe W is H2? No, H2 has one proton and one neutron each, so total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. Wait, but the molecule as a whole. So for each molecule, the total number of protons equals the total number of neutrons. So, for example, H2O has 8 neutrons (since O has 8) and 1+1+8=10 protons. No, 8 isn't equal to 10. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is CO2? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe it's something like CH4? No, that's 6 protons and 8 neutrons. Not matching.

Wait, another thought. What if the molecule is H2? Each H has one proton and one neutron. So each H has same, and the molecule has 2 H atoms. So the molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, so equal. That fits. So gas W is H2. But wait, H2 is a gas, but other possibilities? Maybe CO? CO has 7 protons (C=6, O=8?) Wait, no. Carbon has 6 protons, oxygen 8. Wait, CO has
