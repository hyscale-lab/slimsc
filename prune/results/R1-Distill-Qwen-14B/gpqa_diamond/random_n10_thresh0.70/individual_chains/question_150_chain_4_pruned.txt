Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and jot down my thoughts.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's a start. The NMR data is given, which should help figure out the structure. Then, this compound is reacted with three reagents in sequence: first NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, and finally aq. KOH and heat. I need to find out what the final product is from the options given.

Let me start by analyzing the NMR data. The NMR spectrum has several peaks:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

I remember that the proton NMR tells us about the environment of each proton. Let's go through each peak.

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating to 1H. That's a high value, which often corresponds to an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically appear around 9-10 ppm. So maybe there's an aldehyde group in the molecule. But wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me check the degrees of unsaturation to get a sense of the structure.

Degrees of unsaturation calculation: Each degree is a ring or a double bond. Formula is C8H9NO. The general formula is CnH2n+2OxNy. So for C8H9NO, subtracting H: 2*8 +2 =18. Actual H is 9. 18-9=9, then divide by 2: 4.5. But that's not possible. Wait, maybe I should calculate it as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is halogens, but here we don't have any, so X=0.

So, degrees of unsaturation = (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2. Wait, because N contributes +1? Or does it? Let me think. The formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, X=0, N=1. So:

(2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 = (18-9 +1)/2 = (10)/2 = 5 degrees. So five degrees: could be rings and/or double bonds. Five is a lot. Maybe a ring plus a couple of double bonds.

Looking back at the NMR. The 9.72 ppm peak is likely an aldehyde. So the structure probably has an aldehyde group. The aldehyde is an aldehyde proton, which is usually a triplet because of coupling with adjacent protons. Wait, but aldehyde protons are typically deshielded and don't couple much with others unless they're adjacent. Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha proton, like adjacent to a carbonyl. Wait, but 9.72 is more aldehyde-like.

Next, looking at the other peaks. 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets, each integrating to 2H. Those are likely aromatic protons. The 6.98 is probably a pair of protons in a para-substituted benzene ring, perhaps with an electron-withdrawing group. The 6.51 being a doublet could be another set in a similar situation.

The 6.27 peak is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like an -OH proton, but it's 2H. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated diene or something else. But wait, if it's a broad singlet, maybe it's an -OH group in an aromatic ring, like a hydroxyl. But two protons? Hmm, wait, but a hydroxyl is usually a singlet and integrates to 1H. So maybe it's something else.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That's in the range of
