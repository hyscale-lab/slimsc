Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about Michael additions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving possible products for each part. I need to figure out which option correctly lists the products.

Starting with part A: the reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). So, this seems like a Michael addition reaction.

Wait, what's a Michael addition? From what I remember, it's a 1,4-addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile is usually the enolate from another carbonyl compound, like malonate.

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile. It can form an enolate when deprotonated. The base here is NaOEt, which is a strong enough base to deprotonate the malonate. The enolate would attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated ester.

The other reactant, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester. Its structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the substituent being p-tolyl. Wait, no, wait: the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the acrylate part is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the 3 position is the p-tolyl group. So perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Wait, no, wait, the structure of acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR, so 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the central carbon of the acrylate. So, it's (E)-CH2–C(p-tolyl)=CH–OCH3? No, wait. Acrylate is CH₂=CH–COO–R. So
