Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound. Hmm, the target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should probably draw the structures to visualize what's happening. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group attached. The ethynyl group is like a triple bond connected to another carbon, so it's HC≡C- attached to the cyclohexane. The target compound has a cyclohexyl group connected to a hydroxymethyl group, which is further connected to a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Wait, the aldehyde group is part of the cyclohexane ring, right? So, maybe the structure is where the cyclohexane has a substituent that's a hydroxymethyl linked to another cyclohexyl group, and also has an aldehyde group attached.

Wait, no, let me think again. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde part is the main ring with an aldehyde group. Then, at position 1, there's a substituent: a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So that substituent is a methyl group attached to a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. So, it's like the main ring has an aldehyde and a branch that's a cyclohexane connected via a CH2-OH group.

So starting from ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with a triple bond (HC≡C-) group. How to get to the target?

I think the triple bond is a good starting point. Triple bonds can be used in various reactions, like hydrolysis or addition reactions. Maybe we need to convert the triple bond into something else.

Let me think about the steps. Let's imagine the possible steps.

First, perhaps we need to perform a hydration of the triple bond. The triple bond (alkyne) can be converted into a ketone via hydration. Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is HC≡C-cyclohexane, right? So if we add water
