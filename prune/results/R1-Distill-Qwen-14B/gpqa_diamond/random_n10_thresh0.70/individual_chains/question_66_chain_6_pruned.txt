Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are A through D, each combining some of these.

First, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where we write down all possible interactions (operators) consistent with the Standard Model symmetries. So the operators in SMEFT must respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model itself.

Wait, what are the Standard Model symmetries? Well, the Standard Model has gauge symmetries, like SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1), and also other symmetries like Lorentz symmetry. Oh right, because the SM is a relativistic theory, it must respect Lorentz symmetry. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely one that SMEFT operators must obey.

What about Poincare symmetry? Oh, wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Since the SM respects Poincare symmetry, I think SMEFT must as well. But wait, are SMEFT operators allowed to have terms that break Poincare? Or not? I'm a bit confused. I think that in SMEFT, operators are local, so they should respect all the SM symmetries, which include Poincare. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are required.

Next, CP symmetry. The Standard Model doesn't have a global CP symmetry, but some parts may have it. Wait, no, the SM isn't invariant under a global CP symmetry because of things like the CKM matrix having complex phases leading to CP violation. So if the SM doesn't have CP symmetry, then SMEFT operators don't need to respect that. But wait, operators in SMEFT are organized by dimension, and in the absence of explicit breaking, they can violate CP unless the operator itself is CP-even. Hmm, but I'm not sure if all operators must respect CP. Or do they only have to respect the symmetries that the SM already has. Since the SM doesn't have CP symmetry, SMEFT shouldn't impose it either. So operators can violate CP unless the dimension of the operator requires it.

Wait, maybe that's not the right way to think. The question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if the symmetry is part of the SM, then all operators must respect it. Otherwise,
