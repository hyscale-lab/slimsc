Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me see if I can figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a different structure.

First, I'll start by looking at the IR data. The IR spectrum tells us about the functional groups present in the compound. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, and 1450 cm-1.

The broad peak between 3400 and 2500 cm-1 probably indicates an -OH group, maybe an acid or an alcohol. But wait, if it's a strong acid, the -OH would be very broad, like a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, if it's an alcohol, it might be a narrower peak. But another possibility is an amine, but there's no NMR data suggesting amines, so I'll go with -OH for now.

The peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong indication of a carbonyl group. That could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids usually have a peak around 1700 cm-1. But sometimes it can vary. Alternatively, an ester or ketone could fit here too.

Looking at the NMR data next. The 1H NMR shows several signals:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm is very likely an -OH proton, especially for a carboxylic acid. Because in the IR, the broad peak in that range suggests an -OH. So maybe the compound has a carboxylic acid group?
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This is typical for aromatic protons. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. So maybe para-substituted aromatic protons.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, but lower in ppm, which might be adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group like a carbonyl. So perhaps this is the orth
