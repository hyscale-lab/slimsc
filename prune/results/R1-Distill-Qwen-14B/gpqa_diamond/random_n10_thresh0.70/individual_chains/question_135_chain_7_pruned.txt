Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about the decay of a boson. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question is about the interaction Lagrangian given, and the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I need to find the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order.

First, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf fψ̄(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse this more carefully. So, the interaction term looks like λ multiplied by some fermion fields. Let me think about the structure. It's probably something like λ times the product of two fermion fields (like Yukawa coupling), but I'm not entirely sure. But wait, the exact form of the Lagrangian might not be directly needed for figuring out the decay products. Maybe the key part is the mass of X and which fermions are involved.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So, the boson X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. But wait, because in the decay, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion to allow that decay.

So, I think the allowed decays are those where the sum of the masses of the fermion and antifermion is less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because in a decay, the energy and momentum have to allow for the production of the particles. So, the maximum possible mass for each fermion would be up to 3 GeV, because 2m ≤ 6 GeV → m ≤ 3 GeV.

Now, let's list the known fermion masses. Let's see, the fermions are the quarks and leptons.

Quark masses (in approximate GeV):
- Up (u): ~0.005 GeV (very light)
- Down (d): ~0.008 GeV
- Strange (s): ~0.1 GeV
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top (t): way too heavy, ~173 GeV

Lepton masses (in GeV):
- Electron (e-): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ-): ~
