Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to think through it step by step. I remember that bosons can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, but it depends on the mass of the boson and the masses of the fermions involved.

The problem says the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. Hmm, I think I need to figure out which fermions are light enough that the boson can decay into them. Oh wait, in particle physics, when a boson decays into a fermion-antifermion pair, the rest mass of the fermions must be less than half the mass of the boson, right? Because each fermion would need to have energy equal to their rest mass, so 2*m_fermion ≤ m_X.

So for each fermion, I need to check if 2 times its mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV. Let's list the fermion masses I know:

- Electron (e): about 0.0005 GeV.
- Muon (μ): around 0.1 GeV.
- Tau (τ): around 1.78 GeV.
- Up quark (u): very light, maybe around 2 MeV, so 0.002 GeV.
- Down quark (d): similar to u, maybe 3 MeV, 0.003 GeV.
- Strange quark (s): around 95 MeV, 0.095 GeV.
- Charm qu
