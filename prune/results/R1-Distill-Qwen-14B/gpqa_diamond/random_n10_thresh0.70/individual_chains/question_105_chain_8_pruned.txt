Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. Let me try to wrap my head around it. So, the question is about stars with spots and how they can mimic the signal of an exoplanet. Hmm, I remember that when stars have spots, their brightness can vary as they rotate, and this can sometimes be mistaken for a planet transiting in front of the star.

The problem says that the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. So R_star is the same as the Sun's radius, which is about 7e5 km or 696,340 km. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. Now, one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered, right? So 20% of one hemisphere is covered by spots. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere. But wait, the star's total surface area is 4πR². A hemisphere is 2πR², so 20% of that is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

The spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K. So the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are at 5000 K? Because 6000 minus 1000 is 5000. Or wait, does the problem say the temperature difference is 1000 K? It says the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000 K. Oh, perhaps the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K.

When the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view from our perspective. Since only one hemisphere is spotty, the brightness variations will depend on how much of the spotted area is visible as the star rotates. So the maximum variation would occur when the entire spotted hemisphere is facing us (but wait, since it's one hemisphere, when it's facing us, the spots are all visible. As it rotates, the spots come into view and then go away.)

The problem states that this situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So the brightness dip when the planet transits is similar to the dip caused by the spots. The question is, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet to produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spots.

Wait, the question
