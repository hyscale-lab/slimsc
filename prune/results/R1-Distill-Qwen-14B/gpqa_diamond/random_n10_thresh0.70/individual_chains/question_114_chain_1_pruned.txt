Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these two reactions. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When a ketone reacts with sodium cyanide, I think it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, ketones don't usually react that way under normal conditions. Oh, right! I remember that in the presence of an acid catalyst, the carbonyl can become more electrophilic. So maybe A is an acid. Because in the formation of cyanohydrins, a ketone reacts with a nitrile under acidic conditions. So the reaction is adding cyanide to the carbonyl, with acid as a catalyst. So A should be H3O+ or some other acid.

The second reaction is: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Okay, so the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group adjacent. Wait, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. So the reagent B is probably something that provides water in the presence of acid or base. Since the product is a carboxylic acid, that suggests acidic hydrolysis. Because in acidic conditions, nitriles hydrolyze to carboxylic acids. So B could be HCl, which would provide the acid environment and water.

Looking at the options now. The options are combinations for A and B.

Option A: A is H3O+, B is HCl. Let me think. First reaction: butanone plus NaCN and H3O+ makes the cyanohydrin. That makes sense. Second reaction: B is HCl, which is an acid, so the nitrile would hydrolyze in acidic conditions to the acid. That sounds right.

Option B: A is H3O+, B is CH3COOH. Wait, acetic acid is a weaker acid than HCl. Would that be enough for hydrolysis? I'm not sure. But the product here is a carboxylic acid, so maybe the reaction requires a stronger acid. Or perhaps it doesn't matter, but I'm not certain.

Option C: A
