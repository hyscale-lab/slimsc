Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem about diatomic molecules and the rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it.

The question is about a diatomic molecule consisting of elements X and Y. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch to the next state with the lowest energy. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

First, I remember that in the non-rigid rotor (quantum rotation-vibration model), the energy levels are quantized. I think the energy levels for rotation and vibration are considered together. Oh right, the energy levels for a diatomic molecule can be modeled using both rotational and vibrational contributions.

Wait, the molecule is in the fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be the first vibrational state (v=0) and the ground rotational state (J=0). But wait, no, the ground state for vibration is v=0, and for rotation, J=0 is the lowest. So the fundamental state would be the state with the lowest possible energy, which is v=0 and J=0.

But the problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and it absorbs a photon to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So what's the next state? Oh, I think after the fundamental state comes the first excited state. But wait, in the rotational-vibration model, the energy levels have both J and v. So the next state would likely involve a change in either v or J.

Wait, the question says 'next state with the lowest possible energy.' So the molecule
