Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams and moving glass. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with light and moving media, like glass that's moving, the speed of light as observed can be tricky. 

Wait, the question says the glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and towards the observer. Oh right, because the lab is the observer's frame, and the glass is moving through it.

I think the key here is understanding how the refractive index affects the speed of light. Oh wait, the speed of light in a medium is given by v = c/n, where c is the speed in vacuum and n is the refractive index. But wait, the glass is moving, so does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, but in the lab frame, the glass is moving. So the light is propagating through the glass, which itself is moving. So I need to consider the relative motion between the light and the glass.

Wait, let me think about it. If the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, which is also moving towards the observer. So from the lab frame, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. Hmm.

I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't add linearly due to the velocity addition formula. But wait, wait, this is a problem about light in a moving medium. Oh, but the speed of light in a medium is c/n, but that's in the rest frame of the medium. When the medium is moving, how does that change?

Wait, the speed of light in the medium when the medium is moving. So maybe it
