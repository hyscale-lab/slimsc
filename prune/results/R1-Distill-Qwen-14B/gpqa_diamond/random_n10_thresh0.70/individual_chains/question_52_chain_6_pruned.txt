Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, so the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main point of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. The question is asking by what factor the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Ã…, which I think is in the near-ultraviolet or maybe the visible range. And the photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can probably use some standard formulas from that.

Hmm. Okay, so I need to find the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels. In LTE, the ratio is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2-E1)/(k*T)), where g2 and g1 are the statistical weights, E2-E1 is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So, the effective temperature of the photosphere as a whole is lower. But how does that affect the energy levels in the photosphere where the Ti atoms are?

Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, 40% of the surface is covered. So the effective temperature is lower, but what's happening with the individual regions? The spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere, right? But the problem says that when the surface isn't covered by spots, the Teff is 6000 K. But wait, that's the effective temperature. The effective temperature is the blackbody temperature averaged over the star's surface. So when spots are present, the overall emitted flux is lower because some areas are cooler.

Wait, but for the photosphere, the effective temperature is the average, but the local temperature might vary. Wait, the question says that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K when 40% is covered. Hmm, but the problem is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels. So, does the ratio depend on the local temperature of the photosphere, or the overall Teff?

Wait, the question says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. But the Ti atoms are in the photosphere. If the spots are cooler, but the surrounding areas are at 6000 K, but 40% is spots. Does the photosphere's temperature change locally, or is the overall effective temperature what matters?

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the Teff is 5500 K. So perhaps the entire photosphere is now at 5500 K? Or is the average effective temperature 5500 K, but the actual photosphere has regions at different temperatures?

Wait, but the question says that when the surface is not covered by spots, the Teff is 6000 K. So in that case, the entire surface is at 6000 K. When 40% is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So, perhaps the star's surface is now a combination of areas at 6000 K (60%) and cooler spots. But wait, the problem says that the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the star's total emitted flux is lower because of the spots.

But the problem is about the photospheric effective temperature. So when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. Does that mean that the photosphere as a whole is at 5500 K, or that it's an average of the hotter and cooler regions?

Wait, I think the effective temperature is calculated as the average over the entire surface. So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, which are cooler, the overall effective temperature (the star's Teff) drops to 5500 K. So the star's photosphere isn't uniform; it has some regions at a lower temperature (the spots) and the rest at 6000 K. But when the problem talks about the photosphere, are we considering the entire photosphere as a mix, or each region separately?

But the question is specifically about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. So in the photosphere, which is in LTE, the local temperature would affect the excitation of the atoms.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps the spots and the surrounding areas each have their own temperatures, but the average is 5500 K.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the star's effective temperature is 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered by spots. But the spots themselves are cooler. So the photosphere isn't at 5500 K everywhere. Only 60% is at 6000 K, and 40% at a lower temperature (the spots), say T_spot. The overall effective temperature would be a weighted average based on the areas.

Wait, but the problem says the photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K when the star has spots. So perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500 K? That can't
