Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question has two reactions, and I need to choose the correct reagents A and B from the options provided. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is between 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, let's think about each reaction step by step.

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN, reagent A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is methylacetone. When ketones react with CN- (from NaCN), I remember that it's a nucleophilic addition. The mechanism typically involves the formation of a cyanohydrin. So, the product would be a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached.

Wait, but the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw its structure. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. Wait, no. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When you add CN- to the carbonyl, the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Oh wait, no. Wait, butan-2-one has the structure CH3-CO-CH2-CH3? No, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO—that's correct, it's acetone when the carbonyl is on the second carbon of a four-carbon chain. So, when the ketone reacts with NaCN, which provides the cyanide ion, the addition would form a cyanohydrin. The product would have both an -OH and a -CN group attached to the same carbon where the ketone was.

So, butan-2-one after adding CN- would form (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's see: butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the substituents matter. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would add to the carbonyl, so the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, that's a four-carbon molecule. Let me count:

The original molecule is (CH3)2CO, which is three carbons with the ketone in the middle. Adding CN- would add to the carbonyl carbon, so the structure becomes (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but that would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. But the product given is butanenitrile, which is four carbons. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH2)2CO? No, butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH3? No, wait, perhaps. Wait, no. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is three carbons in the chain. Adding a cyanide would give a four-carbon molecule? Wait, no, because the ketone has three carbons. Oh, wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, butanenitrile is four carbons in total. Let me see: butane is four carbons, nitrile at the end. So, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would have the structure CH2CN-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2- something? Wait, maybe the structure is (CH2CH2CN)C(OH)(CH3). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is a condensation. Alternatively, maybe it's an addition reaction where the nitrile is added to the carbonyl group, forming a new carbon-carbon bond.

Wait, regardless of the structure, the key point is that the reagent A is involved in the formation of this cyanohydrin. So, for the formation of cyanohydrin from a ketone, the reaction typically uses an acid catalyst. Because the mechanism involves the protonation of the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, then the CN- attacks.

So, the reagent A is probably an acid, like H3O+ or HCl. But looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, options C and D have A as NaHSO3. Hmm. So, the first step is acid catalyzed addition of NaCN to the ketone.

Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN-; in acidic conditions, perhaps it's protonated? Or maybe the acid is just to help protonate the carbonyl. So, the first reaction requires an acid catalyst, so reagent A is an acid. Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, which is a strong acid. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3, which is a weaker acid—HSO3- is a weaker acid than H3O+.

So for the first reaction, the correct reagent A is an acid, probably H3O+ or something like that. Let's hold onto that thought.

Now, looking at the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, which probably has the structure where the central carbon has a hydroxyl group, a nitrile group, and two other substituents, one of which is a 4-benzylphenyl group.

The product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutano
