Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I need to figure out the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. So, they're moving in the same direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

First, relative speed. Wait, in classical mechanics, if two objects are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is just the difference in their speeds. But wait, this is at relativistic speeds, so I can't use the classical formula. Oh right, I remember that at speeds close to the speed of light, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is v = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Wait, but wait, because both are moving in the same direction, so I think the correct formula would be the difference. Or wait, let me get it right. The formula depends on how you're adding or subtracting. So if object A is moving at u and object B at v, then the relative speed of A with respect to B would be (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²).

Let me plug in the numbers. So astronaut A has mass 2m moving at 0.6c, astronaut B is 3m moving at 0.5c.
