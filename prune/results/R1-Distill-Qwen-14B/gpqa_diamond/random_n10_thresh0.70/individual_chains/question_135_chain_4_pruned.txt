Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about the decay of a boson X, and I need to determine which decay channels are kinematically allowed. 

Alright, the given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f f-bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse this correctly. Hmm. Oh, perhaps it's written as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Or maybe it's more like the interaction term is -λ f (some fermion fields) multiplied by X. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key here is that the boson X interacts with fermions, right? So the boson X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So when it decays, the total energy of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of X. Because in particle physics, the minimum energy required for a decay into a pair of particles is twice the rest mass of the particles. So each fermion pair must have a combined rest mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

So I need to list all possible fermions that have a rest mass such that 2m_fermion ≤ 6 GeV. Because each decay would produce a fermion and an antifermion, each with mass m. So 2m ≤ 6 GeV → m ≤ 3 GeV.

Wait, what's the mass of each known fermion? Let me think. The masses vary, but here's a quick list:

Electron (e): about 0.0005 GeV (since 1 GeV is about 10^3 MeV, so 0.5 MeV is 0.0005 GeV). So 2m_e is negligible, way below 6 GeV.

Muon (μ): around 0.1 GeV. 2m_μ is 0.2 GeV, which is also much less than 6.

Tau (τ): about 1.78 GeV. So 2m_tau is around 3.56 GeV. Wait, that's more than 3 GeV. But wait, 3 GeV is the max because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV per fermion. So if a fermion is 1.78 GeV, 2*1.78 is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6, but greater than 3 GeV? Wait, no, 3.56 GeV is more than 3 GeV. So 2m_tau would be 3.56 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV, so that's over the limit. Wait, but the X is 6 GeV, which is an even higher mass. So wait, 3.56 GeV is less than 6 GeV, so the decay could happen if the sum is less than 6 GeV.

Wait, I think I got confused. The condition for a decay X → f f-bar is that the sum of the rest masses of f and f-bar must be less than or equal to the mass of X. Since f and f-bar each have mass m, the sum is 2m. So 2m ≤ 6 GeV → m ≤ 3 GeV.

So any fermion with mass ≤ 3 GeV can be produced in pairs by X.

Let me list the known fermion masses:

Electron: ~0.0005 GeV → yes.

Muon: ~0.105 GeV → yes.

Tau: ~1.78 GeV → 2m=3.56 GeV → which is less than 6 GeV, so yes, but wait, 3.56 is less than 6, so 2m is 3.56, which is less than X's mass of 6. So X can decay into tau pairs.

What about the quarks? The masses are a bit tricky because they're in the hadrons, and the current quark masses are lower, but in practice, when considering decay products, you have to consider the rest mass of the quark. Wait, but quarks are confined, so they can't exist freely. So the decay into quark-antiquark pairs is possible only if the quarks are light enough and if the process is allowed by some other factors like charge conservation.

Wait, but in the problem, the X is a boson that interacts with fermions, so perhaps the decay X→ q q-bar is possible if the quark mass is low enough. So let me think about the current quark masses.

Up quark (u): about 2 MeV → 0.002 GeV. So 2m_u is 0.004 GeV, which is way under 6. So u can be produced.

Down quark (d): about 4-5 MeV → 0.004-0.005 GeV. 2m_d is ~0.01 GeV. So yes.

Strange quark (s): around 95-100 MeV → 0.095-0.100 GeV. 2m_s is ~0.2 GeV. So yes, way under.

Charm quark (c): about 1.2-1.5 GeV. 2m_c would be ~2.4 to 3 GeV. Wait, 3 GeV is exactly the limit, right? Because 6 GeV / 2 is 3 GeV. So if m_c is 1.5 GeV, 2m_c is 3 GeV, which equals 3 GeV. So 3 GeV ≤ 3 GeV, so yes, allowed.

Bottom quark (b): around 4.1-4.7 GeV. 2m_b would be around 8.2-9.4 GeV. But X is 6 GeV, so 8.2 >6 GeV, which is not allowed. So X can't decay into b b-bar.

Top quark (t): way heavier, around 173 GeV. That's way beyond, so no.

So the quarks that X can decay into are u, d, s, c. But what about their antiquarks? Well, in decay, the fermion and antifermion are produced, so for quarks, it's q and q-bar.

But wait, the Lagrangian
