Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically dealing with a rhombohedral crystal. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees each. They're asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that interplanar distance is calculated using something called the Bragg equation, but more importantly, for crystals, the formula for interplanar spacing (d) depends on the lattice parameters and the Miller indices of the plane.

For a cubic crystal, the interplanar distance is given by the formula d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), where a is the lattice parameter and (hkl) are the Miller indices. But wait, this is a rhombohedral crystal, which isn't cubic. So the formula must be different because the angles aren't 90 degrees.

Rhombohedral systems have all sides equal (a = b = c) but the angles can be different. In this case, all angles are 30 degrees. So the general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system must involve the angles somehow.

I think the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos gamma) - 2(hl cos beta) - 2(kl cos alpha) ) )

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's better to use the more general formula that includes the angles. Let me think. The general formula for interplanar spacing in any crystal system is derived using the unit cell vectors.

Wait, another approach: The interplanar distance d for a plane (hkl) in a crystal can be found using the formula:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (2hk cos gamma)/(a²) - (2hl cos beta)/(a²) - (2kl cos alpha)/(a²)

Wait, no, I think that might not be the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

d² = (a² b² c²) / ( (h b c sin gamma)² + (k a c sin beta)² + (l a b sin alpha)² ) 

But that's getting complicated. Maybe another approach is better. Alternatively, for a rhombohedral system, since a = b = c
