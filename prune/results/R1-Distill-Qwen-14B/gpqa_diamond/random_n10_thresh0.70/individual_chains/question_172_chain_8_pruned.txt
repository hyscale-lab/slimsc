Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the photosphere is the part of a star where light is emitted, and in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the conditions there can be described using certain equations.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, I think this relates to the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the distribution of particles in different energy states.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, that number looks familiar. Oh yeah, 1.38 is the Boltzmann constant, k, which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So the energy difference ΔE is k multiplied by the temperature factor, right?

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_i / n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where n_i and n_j are the number densities of atoms in two energy levels, g is the statistical weight. But in this case, since we're comparing the same transition for two different stars, maybe the statistical weights are the same for both stars, so they cancel out. So n1/n2 would be proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )?

Wait, no, wait. The problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So I think the ratio of the excited states in star_1 to those in star_2 is 2. So (n1/n2) = 2. But wait, actually, let's be precise. The excitation is in a specific energy level. So maybe the ratio of the populations in that level for the two stars is 2.

Wait, but the Boltzmann equation relates the populations of two specific energy levels. Let me denote the two energy levels as level i and level j, where level i is higher than j. So the ratio (n_i/n_j) for each star would be proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E_i - E_j.

So for star_1, (n1_i / n1_j) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2, (n2_i / n2_j) = exp( -ΔE/(k
