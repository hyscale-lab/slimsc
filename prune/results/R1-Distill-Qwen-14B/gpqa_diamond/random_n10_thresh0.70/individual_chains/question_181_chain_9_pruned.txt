Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the effect of stopping a particular branch of solar reactions. Hmm, let me think through this.

First, the question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, that's the time it takes for sunlight to reach Earth, right? So if the core reaction stops, the Earth would notice the change in neutrino flux after about 8.5 minutes because that's the light travel time from the Sun's core to us.

But the question is about the ratio of fluxes in two specific energy bands, 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). I need to find flux1/flux2.

Right, solar neutrinos are produced by different reactions. The main ones are the proton-proton (pp) chain and the CNO cycle. The pp-III branch is part of the pp chain, I think. Oh wait, the pp chain has several branches. Let me recall: the pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches. Each produces different neutrinos.

The pp-III branch is the dominant one in the Sun because it's more efficient at higher temperatures and densities, which is the case in the solar core. So, if the pp-III branch stops, what happens?

Neutrinos from the pp chain mainly produce electron neutrinos (ν_e). The pp-III branch produces more ν_e compared to other branches because it involves more beta decays. So stopping pp-III would mean a significant drop in ν_e flux, but wait, the question says all other reactions remain the same. Hmm, no, wait: the question says all other reactions remained as they were. So only pp-III stopped. Oh wait, no, the question says, 'the pp-III branch suddenly stopped', while other reactions (like pp-I, II, and the CNO cycle) continue as usual. So the other branches of pp and CNO are still producing neutrinos.

Wait, but what neutrinos does each branch produce? The pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos compared to pp-I and pp-II. Because in the pp-III, two protons fuse into a helium-4 nucleus through a chain that includes a boron-8 intermediate. Boron-8 decays into Be-8, which captures a proton to form lithium-7, but I think the neutrinos come from the beta decays in these
