Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, very rigid, with four cyclohexane rings fused together. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on opposite bridges, I think.

Heating it with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1. The NMR and IR data are provided. The IR shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I recall is typically a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe an elimination reaction happened, forming a ketone?

Looking at the NMR spectrum for product 1. The peaks are at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). The 4.79 ppm is likely an -OH proton, but wait, KOH is strong base. Oh wait, wait, maybe it's an alcohol, but under basic conditions, perhaps it's an epoxide or something else. Wait, but the IR has a carbonyl. So perhaps elimination occurred, dehydrohalogenation. 

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines adjacent on the adamantane structure. When treated with a strong base like KOH, it might eliminate HBr twice, forming an epoxide? No, wait, elimination usually forms alkenes. Wait, but maybe it's a di-elimination, forming a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is eliminated, but since they're on adjacent carbons, maybe it forms a bridgehead double bond? Oh, but adamantane is already a fused structure, so maybe each elimination forms a bridgehead, but that's unlikely because bridgehead double bonds are not common due to Bredt's rule. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another thought: when two adjacent bromines are treated with a strong base, perhaps it leads to a dehydrohalogenation twice, forming an oxide. Alternatively, maybe each bromide is replaced by an -OH group? That would form 1,3-diol. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that's probably not it.

Wait, maybe the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. But given the structure, perhaps the two eliminations lead to a ketone. Wait, but how? Let me think about the structure. Adamantane is a four-fused cyclohexane structure, so if the two Br are on adjacent bridgehead carbons, then eliminating HBr from each might form a bridgehead double bond. But bridgehead double bonds are generally not allowed because of the strain and angle strain. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination leads to the formation of an epoxide. Wait, no, epoxide is O connecting two adjacent carbons. Alternatively, perhaps the two eliminations form a ketone. Wait, but how? Let me think of the mechanism.

Wait, maybe each Br is on a bridgehead, and when KOH is used, each Br is replaced by an -O⁻, which then forms an oxide. So, perhaps the product is 1,3-dioxy adamantane? But then the IR would show an O-H
