Okay, I have this problem about crystallography, specifically dealing with a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

So the question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using the formula derived from the unit cell dimensions and the Miller indices of the plane. Oh right, the formula involves the reciprocal of the plane's indices and the lattice parameters.

Wait, the crystal is rhombohedral, which means all the edges are of equal length, but the angles between them are equal too. Oh right, in a rhombohedral structure, a = b = c, and all angles α, β, γ are equal. In this case, each angle is 30 degrees. Interesting.

The interatomic distance given is 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance in a crystal—oh, that's probably the lattice parameter a, right? Because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance would be the edge length. So maybe a = 10 Å here.

But wait, rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal crystal system? Or no, wait, no, rhombohedral is part of the cubic system. No, no, wait, rhombohedral is one of the seven crystal systems. It has a = b = c, but all angles are equal but not 90 degrees. So it's a special case where the unit cell is a rhombohedron.

The interplanar distance formula for any plane (hkl) is given by the reciprocal of the square root of (h
