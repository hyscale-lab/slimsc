Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. It's about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question says the operator is P, and we're looking for its eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like spin have eigenvectors corresponding to their eigenstates. Since this is a muon, which is like a lepton, similar to an electron in terms of spin properties. So the spin operator here is represented by components P_x, P_y, P_z.

The given components are all 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, the operator vector P is along direction n, which is in the x-z plane. That means the direction has components (x, 0, z). So, the operator we need is the dot product of P with n, which would be P · n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Because the y-component of n is zero.

Wait, but n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² =1. Let me define n as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), since in x-z plane, polar angle θ from z-axis. Or maybe the other way around? Oh right, in spherical coordinates, θ is from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ cosφ, but here since it's in x-z, φ is zero or 180, so n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ. Wait, no, wait. If the direction lies in the x-z plane, the angle φ (azimuthal) would be 0 or π, so cosφ is ±1. So n would be (n_x, 0, n_z), with n_x² + n_z² =1. Hmm, but for the operator, perhaps it's sufficient to represent it as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. So the operator along n would be:

P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Let me plug in the matrices.

n_x P_x = (sinθ)(ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]
n_z P_z = (cosθ)(ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Adding them together:

P_n = (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ * 1, sinθ * 1 ], [ sinθ * 1, -cosθ *1 ] ]

So the matrix becomes:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ], 
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, that's the matrix representation of P_n. Now, to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, the eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = λ |v>, where λ is the eigenvalue. So the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2
