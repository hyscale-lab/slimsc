Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about angular momentum operators. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator A_y, which is given as c multiplied by a matrix S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π), right? And S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row being (0, -i) and the second row (i, 0).

Wait, I remember that the angular momentum operators like S usually have specific commutation relations. But maybe I don't need that right now. Let's focus on the matrix given.

So, the operator A_y is c*S. Since c is a scalar, multiplying S by it. Let's write out the matrix form of A_y.

The matrix S is:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

So, S would look like that. Then c is h/(4π). So A_y is c times S, which would be:

[ 0*c   -i*c ]
[ i*c    0*c ]

Which is:

[ 0   -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))   0 ]

Hmm, okay. Now, we need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix A_y. The eigenvalue equation is A_y |φ> = a |φ>, where a is the eigenvalue.

Since A_y is a 2x2 matrix, it should have two eigenvalues. Let me think, how do I find eigenvalues? I remember that the eigenvalues are solutions to the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0.

So, the matrix (A_y - a I) is:

[ -a    -i c ]
[ i c   -a ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - (i c)(i c) = a² - (i^2 c^2). But wait, i squared is -1, so it becomes a² + c². Setting this equal to zero: a² + c² = 0. So a² = - c². Hmm, but that would imply a is imaginary... wait, no, no, wait. Wait, wait a second. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here.

Wait, the determinant is ( -a )*( -a ) - ( -i c )*( i c ), because the
