Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. The question asks about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Oh right, I've studied about titration curves before, but let me think through the steps.

First, I need to find out what happens when we dilute the acetic acid. The initial volume is 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20.00 cm³ of water. Diluting it would reduce the concentration. Oh wait, because when you mix two solutions, the total volume increases, so the concentration decreases.

So, the initial moles of acetic acid would be volume (in liters) multiplied by molarity. Wait, volume is 20 cm³, which is 0.02 liters. So moles = 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. Oh wait, no, 0.05 M is 0.05 moles per liter, so 0.02 L * 0.05 = 0.001 moles. Right.

After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³, or 0.04 L. So the new concentration would be moles / volume. 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So initially, we had 0.001 moles of acetic acid. So moles of NaOH needed is 0.001. The volume of NaOH can be found since concentration is 0.1 M. Volume (L) = moles / conc = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added. But the question isn't about that yet; it's about 25% titration and the equivalence point pH.

Wait, 25% titration means 25% of the equivalence point volume has been added. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at this point, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added.

But wait, the acetic acid solution was diluted to 40 cm³. So the total solution volume at 25% titration is 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³. Hmm, but maybe I can approach it in terms of moles.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So moles of NaOH added is 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025
