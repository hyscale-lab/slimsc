Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to think through it. So the question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y)(υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). 

Wait, I remember that in particle physics, the interaction Lagrangian tells us how particles couple. So X is a boson field interacting with fermion fields ψ_f. The term here looks like it's a Yukawa coupling because it's a scalar (X) multiplied by the fermion fields. 

The general form of a Yukawa interaction is something like L = g ψ̄ ψ X, where g is the coupling constant. So in this case, X is coupling to fermions of type f. The mass term would come from the υ term, maybe υ is the vacuum expectation value, but I'm not entirely sure. 

Now, the boson X is a scalar (since it's a boson field, and in the Lagrangian it's multiplied by the fermion fields, which are spin-½). So when X decays, it can decay into pairs of fermions because it's a spin-0 particle. The decay must conserve energy and momentum, so the fermion pair must have a combined mass less than or equal to the mass of X.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So I need to find all the fermion pairs that can sum up to less than or equal to 6 GeV. But wait, each fermion has its own mass, but when considering pair production, the combined mass (2m, since the pair has two particles each of mass m) must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. 

Wait, but wait. Fermions come in generations with different masses. Let me list the masses of the known fermions (excluding the top quark which is way heavier than 6 GeV):

- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. But top is ~173 GeV, way too heavy. So let's see the others.

Up quark (u): about 2 MeV (0.002 GeV)
Down quark (d): ~3-5 MeV (0.003-0.005 GeV)
Strange quark (s): ~95-105 MeV (0.095-0.105 GeV)
Charm quark (c): ~1.2-1.5 GeV
Bottom quark (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV

Wait, so the b quark is about 4.5 GeV each. So a pair would be 9 GeV, which is way over 6. So X can't decay into b quarks. Wait, but wait, another thought. The X is a boson, and the fermions are in the loop or something? Or does the coupling matter? Hmm.

Wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So when X decays, it can produce a pair of fermions if their combined mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV. So each fermion's mass must be less than or equal to 3 GeV because 2m ≤6 → m ≤3 GeV. 

Wait, but that's not accurate because when you create a pair, the combined rest mass is 2m, but in the decay, the X is at rest, so the pair can have any energy, but their invariant mass must be at least 2m. So for the pair to be kinematically allowed, the threshold is when the two fermions are produced at rest, meaning their combined mass must be ≤ 6 GeV. 

So looking at each fermion:

Electron (e): 2m ~0.001 GeV → way below 6.
