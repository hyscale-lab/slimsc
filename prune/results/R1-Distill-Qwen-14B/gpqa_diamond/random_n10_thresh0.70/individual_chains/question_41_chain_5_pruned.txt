Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab.

Wait, right. So the glass is moving, and the light is going through it. The speed of light in the glass is usually c/n when it's at rest, but now the glass is moving. How does that affect the observed speed?

I remember something about the addition of velocities in special relativity. Oh wait, but this is about light, which complicates things because light speed is constant in all inertial frames according to relativity. But wait, no, that's in vacuum. The medium is moving, so maybe things are different.

Wait, in the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at c/n. But when the glass is moving, how does the observer in the lab perceive it?

I think I should apply the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²). But wait, in this case, what's u and what's v?

Let me think. From the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed u = c/n towards the direction of motion. Because the glass is moving towards the observer, the lab frame sees the light's speed as u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, no wait. When the glass is moving towards the observer, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So in the lab frame, the light's speed would be higher than in the glass's frame.

Wait, but in special relativity, the speed of light in a medium at rest is c/n. But when the medium is moving, do we just add the velocities? Or is it more complicated?

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the frame transformation. The glass's frame is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So in the glass frame, the light's speed is c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion.

So to find the speed in the lab frame, I can use the velocity addition formula.

So u = c/n (since in glass's frame, light moves at c/n), and the frame is moving at v with respect to the lab.

So using the formula: u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c² )

Substituting u =
