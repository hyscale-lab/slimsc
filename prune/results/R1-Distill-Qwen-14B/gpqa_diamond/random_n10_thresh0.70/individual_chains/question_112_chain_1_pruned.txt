Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me try to understand it step by step. The question involves an electron state and some operator whose matrix representation is given. Hmm, I remember from my notes that when you have a state vector, the probabilities of measuring certain eigenstates are given by the squared magnitude of the corresponding components. But wait, there's also an operator involved. Oh right, the operator's eigenstates are what we're measuring here, so I think I need to find how the given state projects onto the operator's eigenstates.

Let me break down the problem. The state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I should probably normalize this state to find the exact coefficients. Because to get probabilities, the state needs to be normalized, right? The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i), so the normalization factor will be the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of these coefficients.

Wait, the magnitude of (1+i) is sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2). So the square is 2. Similarly, (2-i) has magnitude sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 +1) = sqrt(5). So the square is 5. Adding those gives 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ].

But wait, the question says the state is proportional to that, so the actual state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> multiplied by 1/sqrt(7), since the coefficients' squares add up to 7. So the state is normalized now.

Now, the operator in question has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix. Let me think: in the computational basis |up> and |down>, the operator looks like a matrix with zero on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. So the matrix is:

[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0    ]

Wait, no. Because A_ij = hbar/2 when i != j. So when i=1,j=2 and i=2,j=1, those elements are hbar/2. The diagonal elements (
