Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about a star with spots and how that affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, let's see. I remember that in stellar atmospheres, when stars have spots, it can change their overall temperature, which in turn affects the ionization and excitation states of the elements in their photosphere.

So the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, but when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, no, wait. No, wait. The problem says when 40% is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff decreases. Oh, because spots are cooler regions. So the star's average temperature goes down.

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels, levels 1 and 2. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 is lower than when it doesn't. And we're to find the factor by which this ratio changes. So the factor is (N1/N2)_no_spots divided by (N1/N2)_with_spots.

But wait, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So the ratio without spots is higher. So the factor is (N1/N2)_no / (N1/N2)_with = some number greater than 1.

The transition between these levels is at 1448 Å. I think that's in the near-ultraviolet or maybe far-UV. But for the purpose of this problem, I think the wavelength is given because it relates to the energy of the transition. The energy E can be calculated using E = hc/λ. But I'm not sure if I need that right now.

Since the photosphere is in LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium), the ratio of populations in two energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio N2/N1 is proportional to (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, no, because the Boltzmann factor is for the energy difference. Let me get the formula right. The ratio of populations is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(
