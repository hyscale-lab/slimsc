Okay, so I'm looking at this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question is about how the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when a star has spots versus when it doesn't. 

Alright, first, let's understand the scenario. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. But when it's not covered by spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So, the presence of spots lowers the effective temperature of the photosphere.

Wait, but wait. I think I should clarify what these spots do. Sunspots are cooler regions on the Sun's surface, right? So when they cover part of the star, they make the overall average temperature lower. But how does that affect the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in different energy levels?

The problem mentions the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the photosphere. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Oh, right, the ratio is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(kT) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, wait. The problem gives us the transition wavelength of 1448 Angstroms. So that's in the near-ultraviolet range, I think. For such transitions, the energy difference can be calculated using E = hc/λ. 

Let me think. So E is proportional to 1/λ. So higher energy (bluer) photons correspond to higher E. So the energy difference between levels 2 and 1 is E2 - E1 = hc/(λ). Let me calculate that.

But wait, perhaps I don't need the exact value since it might cancel out. Let me see. The ratio n1/n2 would be (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ). 

But wait, when the star has spots, the photospheric temperature is lower. So T is lower, which affects the exponential term. Let me denote T1 as 6000 K (no spots) and T2 as 5500 K (with spots). 

Wait, but wait. Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So when 40% of the surface is covered, the average Teff drops. But the star isn't uniformly at 5500 K. I think the spotted regions are cooler, but the unspotted regions are at 6000 K, right? Or wait, maybe the Teff is an average, so perhaps the effective temperature of the whole star is 5500 K when 40% is spotted. But wait, the question says that the photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500
