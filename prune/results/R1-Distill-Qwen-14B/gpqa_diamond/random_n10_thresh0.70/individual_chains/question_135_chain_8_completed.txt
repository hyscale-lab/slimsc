Okay, so I've got this physics problem about particle decays. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question gives me a Lagrangian for the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf times ψ_f bar times (v + X(y)) times ψ_f(y). Wait, boson X interacting with fermions... I'm assuming this is a Yukawa-like interaction, right? Like how the Higgs field interacts with fermions.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So I need to figure out which fermion pairs X can decay into.

First, what's the general rule for a boson decaying into fermions? For a spin-0 boson (assuming X is a scalar here), it can decay into a pair of fermions if the interaction term allows it. The mass of the boson has to be at least twice the mass of the fermions it's decaying into because of energy conservation. So, m_X must be ≥ 2m_f, where m_f is the mass of each fermion in the pair.

Wait, but what fermions are we talking about here? The problem mentions things like b, s, u, d, tau, e, c, mu, etc. Each of these has different masses.

Let me list out the approximate masses of the fermions:

- e (electron): ~0.0005 GeV
- mu: ~0.105 GeV
- tau: ~1.78 GeV
- u: around 2-4 MeV (so about 0.002-0.004 GeV)
- d: ~3-5 MeV (0.003-0.005 GeV)
- s: ~95-105 MeV (0.095-0.105 GeV)
- c: ~1.2-1.5 GeV
- b: ~4.1-4.7 GeV
- t: way too heavy, like 173 GeV.

Wait, but wait, in the Lagrangian, it's written as λf ψ_f bar X ψ_f. So for each fermion species f, the interaction term is present. So the boson X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair allowed by the Lagrangian and kinematics.

So the possible decay products are any pairs (ff̄) where the total energy is ≤ m_X, and the individual fermion masses are less than m_X/2.

So m_X is 6 GeV. So each fermion in the pair must be less than 3 GeV. Let's check each fermion:

- e: 0.0005 GeV → way below 3 GeV. So e+ e- is allowed.
- mu: ~0.1 GeV → allowed.
- tau: ~1.78 GeV → allowed.
- u: ~0.003 GeV → allowed.
- d: ~0.005 GeV → allowed.
- s: ~0.1 GeV → allowed.
- c: ~1.25 GeV. 1.25 *2=2.5 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV, so c and cbar is allowed.
- b: ~4.5 GeV. 4.5 *2=9 GeV, which is way more than 6 GeV. So b and bbar can't be produced because 4.5*2=9 >6. So X can't decay into b bbar.

Wait, but wait another thing. The decay into a pair requires the mass of each fermion to be less than m_X/2. So for b, which is 4.5 GeV, 4.5 *2=9 GeV, which is way more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar. So options that include b bbar are incorrect.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau tau-, e+ e-. So this includes b bbar. Since m_X is 6 GeV, which is less than 2m_b (which is about 9 GeV), this decay is not allowed. So option A is wrong.

Option B: X→ c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau tau-, mu+ mu-. So it includes c cbar. Since 2m_c is about 2.5 GeV, which is less than 6, so this is allowed. Also, mu is allowed. So this looks possible.

Option C: Includes c, s, u, d, t. Wait, t is top quark, which is 173 GeV. 2m_t is 346 GeV, way bigger than 6. So t can't be produced. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: X→ b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. Again, includes b bbar, which is not allowed. So option D is wrong.

So the only options without b bbar are B and C. Wait, no, looking again, option B doesn't have b, but includes c, which is allowed. Option C has c, but includes t, which is not allowed.

So which option is correct?

Wait, option B includes c cbar, which is allowed. It doesn't include t, so that's good. What about the other fermions?

The decay products in option B: c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau tau-, mu+ mu-, and e+ e-. All of these fermion pairs have 2m_f less than 6 GeV.

What about the charm quark? m_c is ~1.25 GeV. So 2m_c is ~2.5 GeV, which is less than 6. So X can decay into c cbar.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B includes c cbar. So that's fine.

But I also need to think about whether the interaction term allows X to interact with these fermions. The given Lagrangian is -λf ψ_f bar X ψ_f. So for each fermion f, there is an interaction term. So X can decay into any fermion pair that it can interact with, provided the mass allows it.

So, which fermions can X interact with? All the ones in the Lagrangian's term. The problem states "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions" given by that term. So unless there's a reason a particular fermion isn't included, I think the interaction exists.

But wait, the fermions in the Lagrangian are written as ψ_f, implying that this is for any fermion f. So all fermions have this interaction, but then in reality, perhaps only some are present. Wait, no, the problem statement says "the interaction between X and fermions", so I think that the Lagrangian includes all possible fermions, but in reality, the decay is limited by mass.

Wait no, the Lagrangian in the problem is written as L(y) = -λf ψ_f bar (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, no, lambda is multiplied by f? Or is lambda a coupling for each fermion? Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the notation. Alternatively, perhaps each fermion has its own coupling, but perhaps I don't need to worry about that for this question. The question is about possible decays, so I should focus on kinematics.

So, the fermions that X can decay into are those where 2m_f ≤ m_X (6 GeV), and the interaction is allowed.

So let's list the possible fermion pairs:

Electron: m_e ≈ 0.0005 GeV → 2m_e ≈ 0.001 <<6 → allowed.

Mu: ~0.1 GeV → 0.2 <6 → allowed.

Tau: ~1.78 → 3.56 <6 → allowed.

u quark: ~0.003 → 0.006 <6 → allowed.

d quark: ~0.005 → 0.01 <6 → allowed.

s quark: ~0.1 → 0.2 <6 → allowed.

c quark: ~1.25 → 2.5 <6 → allowed.

b quark: ~4.5 → 9 >6 → not allowed.

t quark: way too heavy, 173 GeV → way over.

So possible fermion pairs are:

e+ e-,

mu+ mu-,

tau+ tau-,

u ubar,

d dbar,

s sbar,

c cbar.

Wait, so all these are allowed except for b and t.

So looking back at the options, which option includes all these except b and t?

Option A includes b, so it's wrong.

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's all except b and t. So option B includes c cbar, which is allowed, and others.

Option D includes b, which is not allowed, so it's wrong.

So the correct decay options are the ones that include all the above except b.

Looking at option B:

c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau, mu, e.

Yes, that's all allowed.

Wait, what about the top quark? No, because m_t is way higher than 3 GeV, so not allowed.

So the correct answer would include all the fermion pairs except those with b or t.

So the correct options are c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau, mu, e.

Looking at the options, option B is exactly that. So the answer should be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. The interaction term allows \( X \) to decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, but the decay is only possible if the total mass of the fermion pair is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq m_X \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mass of \( X \):** The mass of \( X \) is 6 GeV. Therefore, the maximum mass of a single fermion in a decay pair is \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

2. **Fermion Masses:** The approximate masses of the fermions are:
   - \( e \) (electron): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - \( \mu \) (muon): \( \sim 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - \( \tau \) (tau): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - \( u \) (up quark): \( \sim 0.002 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - \( d \) (down quark): \( \sim 0.005 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - \( s \) (strange quark): \( \sim 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - \( c \) (charm quark): \( \sim 1.25 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - \( b \) (beauty quark): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - \( t \) (top quark): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

3. **Allowed Fermion Pairs:** For \( X \) to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the condition \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \) must be satisfied. This allows the following pairs:
   - \( e^+ e^- \): \( 2m_e \sim 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - \( \mu^+ \mu^- \): \( 2m_\mu \sim 0.21 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - \( \tau^+ \tau^- \): \( 2m_\tau \sim 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - \( u \bar{u} \): \( 2m_u \sim 0.006 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - \( d \bar{d} \): \( 2m_d \sim 0.01 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - \( s \bar{s} \): \( 2m_s \sim 0.21 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - \( c \bar{c} \): \( 2m_c \sim 2.5 \, \text{GeV} \)

   The decays into \( b \bar{b} \) and \( t \bar{t} \) are not allowed because \( 2m_b \sim 9 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( 2m_t \sim 346 \, \text{GeV} \), both of which exceed \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

4. **Option Analysis:**
   - **Option A:** Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect.**
   - **Option B:** Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. **Correct.**
   - **Option C:** Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect.**
   - **Option D:** Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect.**

### Conclusion:
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), as listed in **Option B**.

**Answer: B**
