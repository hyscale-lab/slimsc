Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact structure. 

Wait, the question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms, and all angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. So it's a rhombohedral structure with a cubic-like setup but with angles different from 90 degrees. 

I think the formula for the interplanar distance (d) in a crystal is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of the squares of the Miller indices multiplied by some factors involving the lattice parameters and the angles. Oh wait, the general formula for interplanar spacing is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + ... something with the angles). 

Wait, more specifically, I recall that for a cubic system, it's d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But for non-cubic systems, like rhombohedral, this gets more complicated because the angles aren't 90 degrees. 

The formula I think is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) ) ), but wait, not sure about the signs. Oh wait, or is it the dot product terms? Maybe the formula involves the cosines of the angles between the axes.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system is given by:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2(hk cos γ)/(a²) - 2(hl cos β)/(a²) - 2(kl cos α)/(a²)

Oh wait, no, I think I might have it wrong. Another way to think about it is using the relation for the reciprocal lattice vectors. But maybe I should look up the formula for a rhombohedral lattice.

Alternatively, I remember that the general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

where θ is the angle between the axes. Wait, in rhombohedral systems, all
