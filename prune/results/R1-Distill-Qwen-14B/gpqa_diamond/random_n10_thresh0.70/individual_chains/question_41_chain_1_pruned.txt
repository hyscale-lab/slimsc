Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about a light beam propagating through glass that's moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are A to D, each with a different formula.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with light moving through a medium, the speed depends on the medium's refractive index. Oh right, the speed of light in a medium is c divided by n, where c is the speed in a vacuum. So normally, if the glass is stationary, the speed would just be 1/n because c is given as 1 here.

But wait, the glass is moving. This must involve some kind of relativity effect. Oh wait, but wait, isn't the speed of light constant in any inertial frame? Or does that apply only in a vacuum? Because in a medium, light's speed can change, but when you have the medium moving, how does that affect it?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. From the perspective of someone in the lab, the glass is moving. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the light's speed relative to the lab would be different.

But according to special relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c in any inertial frame, regardless of the motion of the source or the observer. But this is in glass, not a vacuum. So in this case, the medium (glass) is moving, so maybe the speed isn't necessarily c.

Wait, but wait. The glass is moving, so we're dealing with a scenario where the medium itself is moving relative to the lab frame. How does that affect the light's speed?

Let me try to break it down. In the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at speed v_light = 1/n (since c=1). Now, when the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, we need to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab.

This sounds like a problem involving the addition of velocities in special relativity. Because the glass is moving, we have to apply the velocity transformation. Wait, but when the medium is moving, does that affect the light's speed? Or is the speed of light in the medium the same in all frames?

Wait, that's confusing. In a vacuum, the speed is always c. But in a medium, the speed is lower, and when the medium is moving, does the speed of light in the medium change as observed
