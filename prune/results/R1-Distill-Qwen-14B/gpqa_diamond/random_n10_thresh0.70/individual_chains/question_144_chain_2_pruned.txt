Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember that mesons are particles, but I'm not entirely sure about the details. Let me think. The question is about finding the mean decay distance. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, all with numbers around 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters.

Wait, I think the mean decay distance has something to do with the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like c multiplied by the lifetime. But wait, particles that decay quickly have a shorter mean path. So the mean decay distance L is c multiplied by the proper lifetime τ. But how do I find τ?

I remember that the lifetime is related to the width Γ. The uncertainty principle tells us that Γ is the total decay width, and the mean lifetime τ is inversely proportional to Γ. Specifically, τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I have to be careful with units here. Because Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is usually in units of GeV·s or something like that.

Wait, okay, let me get the units straight. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and I remember ħ is around 6.58e-25 GeV·s. So if Γ is in GeV, then τ =
