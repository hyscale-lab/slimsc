Okay, so I have this organic chemistry question about reaction mechanisms and NMR spectroscopy. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, which is quite rigid and has multiple bridged rings. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane skeleton.

The first reaction is heating it with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination reaction. When vicinal dihalides (halides on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base, they typically undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane—wait, are the bromines on adjacent carbons? Hmm, adamantane's structure is such that the positions 1 and 3 might not be adjacent. Let me think: adamantane is a molecule with four fused cyclohexane rings, so the positions 1 and 3 are on opposite sides perhaps. So if they're on adjacent carbons, maybe. Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is 1,3-dibromo, meaning the two bromines are on carbons that are two apart. Oh wait, maybe I should draw the structure.

Wait, no, adamantane's structure: each bridgehead carbon is connected to three other bridgeheads. So 1 and 3 might be across each other, but maybe in this structure, the two bromines are on adjacent bridgeheads. Or perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Wait, KOH can also perform an elimination if the dihalide is vicinal. So if the dihalide is 1,2-dibromo, elimination would form an alkene. But if it's 1,3, perhaps it's a non-adjacent dihalide. So maybe the structure would eliminate to form a diene or something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution, but with KOH, which is a base, maybe elimination is more likely.

Wait, the product after KOH is a light yellow solid, and the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is around where -OH or ethers might be. Also, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which indicates a
