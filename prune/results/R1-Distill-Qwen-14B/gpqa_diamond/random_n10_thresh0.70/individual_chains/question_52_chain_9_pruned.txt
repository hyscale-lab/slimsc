Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem states that astronomers are studying a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without any spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main point of the question is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels—level 1 and level 2. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the ratio of populations in different energy levels can be explained using the Boltzmann equation under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which is given here. The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann factor is (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) )

Where:
- n_i and n_j are the number of particles in levels i and j.
- g_i and g_j are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of the levels.
- E_i and E_j are the energies of the levels.
- k is the Boltzmann constant.
- T is the temperature.

In this problem, we're looking at the ratio of Ti in two levels, let's say level 1 is the higher energy and level 2 is lower. When the star has spots, the effective temperature decreases, which affects this ratio.

Wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when there are spots. So when T decreases, the ratio n1/n2 (assuming E1 > E2) would decrease. Because the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio would be lower. So when T is lower, the ratio is lower. So the question is, when the star doesn't have spots (higher T), the ratio is higher. So the factor would be (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

But wait, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. I think that's in the near-ultraviolet or far-ultraviolet, but for the Boltzmann factor, the specific wavelength might not be directly needed unless it's about ionizing or excitation energy, but since it's neutral Ti, maybe the energy is based on the transition.

Wait, the transition is between two energy levels in the same ion (neutral Ti), so the energy difference is E = hc/λ. So let's compute that. But perhaps it's easier to relate the ratio using the temperatures and the energy difference.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy can be expressed in terms of the temperature. Let me think.

The energy difference between the two levels is delta E = E2 - E1 (assuming E2 > E1, but wait, no: if level 1 is higher than level 2, then E1 > E2. But in the Boltzmann equation, the exponent is (E_i - E_j)/(kT).

Wait, let's define E1 as the higher energy level. So E1 > E2. So the energy difference is E1 - E2 = ΔE.

So the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

If the temperature decreases, the exponential term becomes smaller. So if T decreases, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. Which is what the problem says: when the star has spots, the ratio decreases.

So the question is, the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

We can write this as:

Factor = [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]
The g factors cancel.

So Factor = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )
Which is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, no, let me re-express. The denominator is exp(-ΔE/(k T2)), so when you take the ratio, it's exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] ) / exp( [ -ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( (ΔE/(k T2)) - (ΔE/(k T1)) ) )

Wait, that's correct. Because [ -a / T1 + a / T2 ] = a (1/T2 - 1/T1) ), where a = ΔE/(k).

So the exponent is (ΔE / (k )) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait no
