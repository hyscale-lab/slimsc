Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about an electron in a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh right, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which is S_z. So the state is a linear combination of these two states.

The first part of the question asks to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij. The rule is that A_ij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so the matrix is 2x2 because we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles, right?

Let me think about what this operator looks like. The diagonal elements are zero because when i equals j, A_ij is zero. The off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So the matrix would be:

[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0     ]

Wait, no—because for a 2x2 matrix, the indices run from 1 to 2. So A_12 and A_21 are hbar/2, while A_11 and A_22 are zero. So the operator is actually (hbar/2)(|up><down| + |down><up|). Oh, wait, that's the same as (hbar/2)(|+><-| + |-><+| ), which is the spin-flip operator, perhaps? Or maybe something else. Oh wait, actually, that's the form of the Pauli X matrix scaled by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if I multiply that by hbar/2, that's exactly what this operator is.

So the operator in question is (hbar/2) X, where X is the Pauli X matrix. So the eigenstates of this operator would be the same as the eigenstates of X, because it's a scalar multiple. The eigenstates of X are the eigenstates of |+x> and |−x>, right? The spin states along the x-axis.

Wait, no, wait. Because X has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So when multiplied by hbar/2, the operator A has eigenvalues (hbar/2)*1 and (hbar/2)*(-1), which are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

But the question is, the operator's eigenstates are |+x> and |−x> (or something similar) because those are the eigenstates of X. So the problem wants the probability of measuring the electron in each of these eigenstates.

But wait the state |alpha> is given in the z-basis. So to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of operator A, I need to express |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A and then compute the squared magnitudes of the coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenstates of A and project |alpha> onto them.

So first, what are the eigenstates of operator A? Since A = (hbar/2) X, the eigenstates are the same
