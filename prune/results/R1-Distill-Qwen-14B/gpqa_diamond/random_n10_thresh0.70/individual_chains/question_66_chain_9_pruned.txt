Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) symmetries. Hmm, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry.

Wait, I remember that SMEFT is built by considering all possible operators that are compatible with the Standard Model symmetries. So what symmetries does the Standard Model have? Well, the SM has Lorentz symmetry, gauge symmetry (like SU(2), SU(3), U(1)), and also some others like charge conjugation, parity, etc.

Wait, but SMEFT is an effective theory, which means it includes all possible higher-dimensional operators that are allowed by the symmetries. So the symmetries that SMEFT respects must be the same as the Standard Model, right? Because if the SM has a symmetry, then SMEFT must also respect it, otherwise those operators wouldn't make sense in the SM framework.

So, Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely one of them. Because the SM is Lorentz invariant, so SMEFT must maintain that. So all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry.

What about Poincare symmetry (option 2)? Wait, Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Oh yeah, because Poincare is the full symmetry of Minkowski spacetime—includes translations, Lorentz transformations, etc. So if the SM respects Poincare, so does SMEFT. So operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So 1 and 2 are both correct.

Wait, but wait—I think SMEFT is built assuming that the SM symmetries are respected, meaning that all operators should be invariant under the SM's symmetry group. Including Poincare, yes. Because the SM is a Poincare-invariant theory, so all interactions in SMEFT must also respect that.

Then CP and CPT symmetry (3 and 4). The SM isn't CP symmetric, because processes like kaon mixing violate CP. So SMEFT doesn't have to respect CP symmetry. So operators in SMEFT might violate CP, depending on the operator. So option 3, CP symmetry, doesn't have to be respected by all operators. So option 3 is incorrect.

CPT symmetry is different. I remember that in quantum field theory, all theories must respect CPT symmetry. Because it's a fundamental symmetry that comes from the principles of quantum mechanics and relativity. So even if the SM doesn't have CP symmetry, it must respect CPT. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 is correct.

So the symmetries that must be respected by all operators are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but wait a minute—Poincare includes translations. Are the SMEFT operators translationally invariant? Because operators in the effective theory are local, built from fields and derivatives, so yes, they must be translation invariant. So SMEFT operators respect Poincare symmetry.

Wait, but the question is asking which must be respected by all operators. So options 1 and 2 are correct, and 4 is correct. So the correct group would be 1,2,4.

Looking at the options:

A) 1,2 → includes Lorentz and Poincare, but not CPT. But wait, if all operators must respect CPT, then A isn't correct.

C)
