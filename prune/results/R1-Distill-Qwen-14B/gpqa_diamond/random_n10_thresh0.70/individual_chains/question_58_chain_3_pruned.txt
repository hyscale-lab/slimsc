Okay, so I need to figure out which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A through D, and I'm a bit rusty on my theories, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let me remember what regularization means. From what I recall, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are situations where calculations give infinite results, which obviously don't make physical sense. Regularization introduces a temporary 'cutoff' or some other method to make the infinities manageable, and then you remove the cutoff in the end, hopefully getting finite results.

Now, let's look at each option.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a quantum theory, so it's a type of quantum field theory but in a higher-dimensional space. Wait, but string theories are supposed to be finite, right? Because they don't have the same types of divergences as in other quantum field theories. In superstring theory, all interactions are determined by string diagrams which might lead to better behavior. Or wait, do they require regularization? I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe string theories inherently avoid these divergences because they are background-independent or something, so they don't need regularization. Or perhaps they still do, but it's handled differently.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to Yang-Mills. I remember that in QCD, calculations often require a lot of regularization because of the strong coupling. Wait, but wait. At high energies, QCD becomes weakly coupled because of asymptotic freedom. Oh, right, asymptotic freedom is when the coupling constant decreases at high energies, so perturbative methods work better. But does QCD require regularization? Well, in perturbative calculations, you often deal with loop integrals that can be divergent. So you need to regularize them. So yes, QCD requires regularization, especially when dealing with renormalization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-understood, renormalizable theory. I remember that QED does require regularization because loop diagrams (like the electron self-energy) have divergences. So you need to regularize them before renormalization. So QED uses regularization techniques like cutoff, dimensional regularization, etc. So it requires regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh, wait, classical theories don't involve quantization. So in classical electrodynamics, you don't have the same issues with divergences that quantum theories have. For example, in Maxwell's equations, you don't have renormalization because there's no concept of charge or current densities that need renormalizing. So in classical ED, you don't need regularization because regularization is a quantum field theory concept. So this theory never requires regularization at high energies because it's classical.

Wait, but let me make sure. The question is about which theory never requires regularization. So if a theory isn't a quantum field theory, it doesn't need regularization. Because regularization is for dealing with infinities in quantum calculations. So classical theories don't have those infinities in the same way.

So looking back:

A) Superstring Theory: Quantum theory, may require regularization but perhaps not? Or maybe it doesn't because it's a different setup. Wait, I'm not too sure about string theory
