Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this neutrino flux problem. Hmm, let's start by understanding what the question is asking. The question is about the Sun's neutrino production when the pp-III branch suddenly stops in the core, and we need to find the ratio of the flux between two energy bands.

Wait, what's the pp-III branch? I remember that the proton-proton chain is the primary source of energy in the Sun. There are different branches, right? The main pp-I branch produces helium-4, and there are other branches like pp-II and pp-III. Oh wait, I think the pp-III branch involves reactions that produce beryllium-7, which then goes on to form carbon and eventually helium. Oh yeah, and the pp-III branch is one of the contributors to the neutrinos, especially the high-energy ones.

So the question says that the pp-III branch stops. That would mean that a significant source of neutrinos is suddenly cut off. But, what kind of neutrinos are we talking about? Solar neutrinos are mostly from the pp chain, and specifically, the pp-III branch produces high-energy neutrinos because of the beta decay steps involved.

Wait, so neutrinos are produced in the Sun through the decay of beryllium-7, which is part of the pp-III process. When the pp-III branch stops, the production of these neutrinos would stop. But how does this affect the flux in different energy bands?

The question asks about the flux in two bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to figure out how the flux in each band is affected when the pp-III branch stops.

Before the pp-III stopped, the flux would have contributions from both the pp-III branch and other processes. But if pp-III stops, I should think about which neutrino energies are affected.

Wait, I think the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are higher energy. Because pp-III involves the decay of Be-7, which emits a neutrino when it turns into Li-7. That neutrino is a high-energy one. So band 2 (800-900 keV) would be more affected than band 1 (700-800 keV).

Wait, but what about the other branches? Like the main pp-I branch. The main pp-I produces two protons and a helium-4 nucleus, right? But wait, no, the main pp chain produces He-4 via the pp-I and other steps, but the neutrinos are from the side reactions. Like, in the pp-I, you have the initial stages where a proton captures a proton to form a diproton, which then splits into two protons and a positron and a neutrino. So those neutrinos are lower energy, typically around 200 keV to maybe a few hundred keV. Wait, but I'm not certain.

So the main pp-I branch produces lower-energy neutrinos. The pp-III branch, on the other hand, contributes to higher-energy neutrinos because of the Be-7 decay. So if the pp-III branch stops, the higher-energy neutrinos (like in band 2) would decrease, while the lower-energy ones (like band 1) would still be produced as before, assuming the pp-I and other branches are unaffected.

Wait, but aren't there multiple sources of
