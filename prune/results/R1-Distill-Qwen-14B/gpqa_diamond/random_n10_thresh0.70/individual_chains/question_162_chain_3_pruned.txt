Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let's try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a 2-dimensional metric. Oh right, because it's in terms of dx and dy, so maybe this is in 2D spacetime or something. But wait, pseudosphere... Oh yeah, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. I remember that in hyperbolic geometry, surfaces have negative curvature, like the tractricoid, which is a classic example.

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. So I need to figure out the area using the given metric. Wait, how does the metric relate to the area? Oh right, the metric determines the volume (or area in 2D) element. So in 2D, the area element would be sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor.

Wait, the metric here is written in a way that's symmetric. So the metric tensor components are g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and the off-diagonal terms are zero. So the determinant of g would be (g_xx * g_yy - 0) = (32/(4 - x² - y²))². So the square root of that is 32/(4 - x² - y²).

So the area element dA is (3
