Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question asks about selecting suitable reagents for two reactions. The reactions are:

1. Butan-2-one (which I think is also called methylacetone) reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.
2. Then, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options given for A and B are a combination of H3O+, NaHSO3, HCl, and CH3COOH.

Alright, let me break this down. I think the first reaction is a nucleophilic substitution or maybe some kind of addition. Butan-2-one is a ketone, so maybe it's undergoing some kind of addition reaction.

I remember that when a nitrile group is added to a ketone, it's typically via a cyanide ion. But wait, in the presence of an acid catalyst. So, perhaps it's a case of acid-catalyzed addition of CN- to the carbonyl group.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN? But the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The product structure is CH(CH2CN)(OH)CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, butanenitrile is four carbons with a nitrile. 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When you add HCN to a ketone, you get a cyanohydrin. I think the reaction is called the cyanohydrin formation, which involves a ketone reacting with HCN in the presence of an acid catalyst. So the reagent A here is probably an acid, like H3O+.

So for the first reaction, NaCN is providing the cyanide ion. But wait, in aqueous solution, HCN is weakly acidic. So maybe to drive the reaction,
