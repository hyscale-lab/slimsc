Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that astronomers are observing a star similar in radius to the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, when the star rotates, the brightness variations observed (the light curve) can resemble those caused by an exoplanet transiting in front of the star.

The question is asking: to produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve (assuming no spots), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the star's radius (Rpl/Rstar)?

Hmm. So essentially, when the star has spots, the brightness changes due to spots as it rotates. But the problem says that without the spots, the same brightness variation amplitude would require what size planet?

Wait, I think I might have misread that. Let me check again. Oh, no, the situation is that the star with spots produces a brightness variation that looks like a planet. So, the star's spots cause the same dip in brightness as a planet transiting would. So, the question is, what planet size would cause the same dip as these spots do.

Wait no, the question says to produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve if it wasn't covered by spots. So, if the star had no spots, what planet would cause the same brightness variation as the spots do when the star is spotted.

Wait, perhaps I should model the problem. When the star has spots, as it rotates, different fractions of the spots come into view, which change the observed brightness. The maximum variation in brightness (the amplitude) depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference relative to the rest of the star.

When a planet transits the star, the dip in brightness is the area of the planet's disk over the star's disk. So, the dip is proportional to (Rpl/Rstar)^2. But this problem is about the spot-induced variation, and we need to compare that dip to the one caused by a planet.

Wait, but when the star has spots, it's not a simple dip. The brightness variation is more complicated because as the star rotates, different parts of the spotted hemisphere come into view. The observed brightness is a function of the spot coverage and their temperature.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as a rotational modulation. The star is losing brightness because one hemisphere has spots. But wait, the spots are cooler, so when that hemisphere is facing us, the star appears dimmer. The brightness variation depends on the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots and the temperature difference.

So the maximum dip occurs when the entire spotted hemisphere is facing us. Or wait, when the star is rotating so that the spotted side is facing us, the brightness would be lower because those spots are cooler.

Alternatively, since the spots are on one hemisphere, the brightness variation will be periodic due to rotation. The variation amplitude depends on the effective area of the spots and their temperature difference.

Wait, let's think about the scenario without the spots first. The star's brightness is uniform. If a planet transits (covers a part of the star), the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2, because the area blocked is pi Rpl^2, and the star's area is pi Rstar^2, so
