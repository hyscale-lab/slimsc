Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method looks for shifts in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is, I think.

The problem says there are two stars with the same mass, each having a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. I need to find how many times longer Planet #2's orbital period is compared to Planet #1's.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact RV formula. I think the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us. The formula I remember relates the velocity semi-amplitude (K) to the planet's mass (M_p), the star's mass (M_s), the orbital period (P), and the distance between the star and planet (a). Oh right, the formula is K = (v) = (G * (M_p) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(1/3) )) ) * (1/( (P)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) )) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that part is 1.

But wait, since M_p is much smaller than M_s (Neptune's mass is about 17 Earth masses, and the Sun is much bigger), M_s + M_p is approximately M_s. So the formula simplifies. Let me write this down.

K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_s^(1/3) * P^(1/3)). Wait, no, I think I messed up the exponents. Let me think again.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_s + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/( (P * (1 - e^2))^(1/2) )) * (1 / (2π * c))

Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula. Oh wait, I can't look it up, but I think the correct formula is K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_s + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 /
