Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let me read it again.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form a carboxylic acid, specifically 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, which I think is a nucleophilic substitution reagent. But wait, butan-2-one is a ketone, so maybe it's undergoing a substitution where the carbonyl group is replaced. Or wait, perhaps it's a nucleophilic addition? Wait, no, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So in a ketone, the carbonyl is electrophilic. So the mechanism would be nucleophilic addition.

Wait, no, maybe it's a substitution. Because in some cases, like the formation of cyanohydrins. Oh right! A cyanohydrin is formed when a ketone reacts with cyanide ion. So the reaction is a nucleophilic addition, where the CN- adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen gets a proton, maybe from the solvent or another source. But wait, in the product, the structure is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no, wait. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure is CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CN? Wait, perhaps it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, butanenitrile is four carbons. Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, perhaps I should count the carbons. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is 3 carbons.
