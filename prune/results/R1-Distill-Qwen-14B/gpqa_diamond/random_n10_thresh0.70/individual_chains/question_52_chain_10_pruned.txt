Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels changing when a star has spots. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, so the star has some characteristics. Without spots, its effective temperature is 6000 K, and when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but wait—how does that work? Because if part of the surface is cooler (the spots), the overall emission would be less. But the effective temperature is given as 5500 K when 40% is covered. So I guess the star's average temperature is lower.

But the question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So the ratio is higher without spots. We need to find the factor by which it changes.

I remember that in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the number of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio n1/n2 is proportional to (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (like the degeneracy) and E is the energy difference.

The transition corresponds to about 1448 Å, which is in the near UV or visible range. The energy difference ΔE can be calculated using the wavelength. The formula is ΔE = hc/λ. Let me compute that.

H is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. C is speed of light, 3e8 m/s. λ is 1448 Å, which is 1.448e-7 meters.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) = let's see. 6.626e-34 *3e8 is 1.9878e-25. Divided by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.372e-18 J per photon.

But wait, we can also express this in terms of energy per atom. But for the Boltzmann factor, I think we need the energy difference in units of k*T, where k is Boltzmann's constant (1.38e-23 J/K).

So let's compute the energy difference in terms of k*T. So, (ΔE)/(k*T) = (hc/(λ k T)).

Wait, another approach: the ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )^{-1}, right? Because it's n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), assuming E2 > E1.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The Boltzmann distribution is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if E2 is higher than E1, then
