Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along the x-axis in a tube. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the particles, none were found at x < 1 or x >3. So the particles are only between x=1 and x=3. I need to find the value of 'a' from the options given.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the probability of finding a particle in a region is given by the integral of the square of the absolute value of the wave function over that region. Since the particle was only found between x=1 and x=3, that means the wave function must be zero outside this interval. But wait, the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. That's a complex function.

Wait, the wave function is complex, so the probability density is the square of its absolute value. The absolute value of (a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i) would be the square root of ( (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 ), right? Because for a complex number a + bi, the absolute value squared is a² + b².

But for the wave function to be normalizable, the integral of the probability density from x= -infinite to infinite must be 1. But in this case, the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. So the integral from 1 to 3 of |psi|^2 dx must equal 1.

Wait, but the given wave function doesn't look like it's zero outside 1-3. Because if x is less than 1, 1+x is positive, so sqrt(1+x) is real, so psi is a complex number but not zero. Similarly, for x greater than 3, same thing. So that can't be right because the problem states that no particles were found outside 1-3. So perhaps the wave function as given is only valid in that region, and zero elsewhere.

Wait, but the problem says each particle can exist in a part of space where the wave function is as given. So probably, this wave function is the one that's non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. So perhaps the wave function is actually:

psi(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, for 1 <= x <=3,

and zero otherwise.

But wait, the way the question is phrased, the wave function is as described in the part of space where the particle can exist. So perhaps the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. So the integral of |psi|^2 from 1 to 3 must be 1.

So, to find 'a', I need to compute the integral of |psi(x)|^2 dx from 1 to 3 and set it equal to 1.

Let me compute |psi(x)|^2. So,

psi(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i.

So the absolute square is [a^2 / (1 +x) ] + (0.5)^2.

Because (a/sqrt(1
