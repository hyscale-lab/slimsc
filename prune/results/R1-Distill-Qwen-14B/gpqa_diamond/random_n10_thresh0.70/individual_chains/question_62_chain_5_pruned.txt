Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reaction mechanisms yet. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about synthesizing a specific compound: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, starting from ethynylcyclohexane. The options are four sequences of reagents, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I need to figure out what the target molecule looks like. The name is a bit complicated. Let me parse it. The main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which means a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl (aldehyde) group attached. Then, the substituent is at position 1, which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. Wait, so that's like a CH2 group attached to both a hydroxyl (OH) and a cyclohexyl group, and all that is attached to the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde ring.

Hmm, so the structure is something like a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group. Attached to one carbon (position 1) is a CH2-OH and a CH2-cyclohexyl. So, the molecule has two cyclohexane rings connected via a CH2 group, which also has an OH group.

Now, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond, so like CH2-C≡CH) attached. So the structure is cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡CH substituent.

I need to figure out the steps to convert this into the target molecule. Let me think about what transformations are involved.

The target molecule has an aldehyde group, which suggests oxidation. But wait, how do I get an aldehyde from an ethynyl group? Well, maybe through some kind of oxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group can be converted into an aldehyde via a series of reactions. But wait, the starting compound is ethynylcyclohexane, so perhaps I need to first functionalize that triple bond.

Another thought: maybe the triple bond can be used in a way to form a carbonyl group. For example, via hydration or other addition reactions. Wait, but the product has an aldehyde group, not a ketone. So maybe the triple bond is at a position that could be oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, meaning the triple bond is between two carbons, but attached to the cyclohexane. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. So the triple bond is between two CH2 groups? No, wait, ethynyl is CH2-C≡CH. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group attached. Wait, no, ethynyl is CH2-C≡CH? Or is it C≡C-CH2- attached? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think: ethynyl
