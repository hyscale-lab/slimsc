Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer in the lab. The options are A to D, with B being 1. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is given by c divided by n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. So in this case, c is given as 1. So the speed inside the glass would be 1/n, right? But wait, that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. But here, the glass is moving.

Oh, right! This is a scenario involving relative velocities. I think I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just add velocities classically. But wait, glass moving at velocity v—how fast is that? The problem says it's moving at velocity v, but doesn't specify how big v is. So I guess I have to consider the relativistic approach.

The velocity addition formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²). But wait, what's u here? Because the light's speed in the glass's frame is 1/n. So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at 1/n. So from the lab frame, where the glass is moving at velocity v, we need to find the
