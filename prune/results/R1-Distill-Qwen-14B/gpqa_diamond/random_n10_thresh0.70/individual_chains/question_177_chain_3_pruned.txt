Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. 

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their properties are given, and we need to find out by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. 

First, let me list the given information:

- Radius of Star_1 (R1) is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R2). So R1 = 1.5 * R2.
- Mass of Star_1 (M1) is also 1.5 times M2. So M1 = 1.5 * M2.
- The wavelengths at which they appear brightest (their peak emission wavelengths) are the same. Hmm, that's interesting.
- Radial velocities are 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Wait, radial velocity is the speed at which they're moving towards or away from us. But I'm not sure how that affects luminosity yet.
- We're told to assume the stars radiate as black bodies. So I can use the black body radiation formulas.

Luminosity of a star is the total energy it emits per unit time. The formula for luminosity in terms of black body radiation is the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

But wait, the problem says both stars have the same peak emission wavelength. Oh, right! Blackbody radiation has a peak wavelength that depends on the temperature. The peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature. The formula I remember is λ_max * T = constant (Wien's Law), so λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K).

Since both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ1 = λ2, so T1 = T2. Because if λ_max is same, then T is same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but how about the Doppler shift? Because Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Oh right! Because if a star is moving towards us, the light gets blueshifted, and if moving away, redshifted.

So the observed wavelength λ_observed is different from the emitted λ_emitted. The formula for Doppler shift is λ_obs = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), but wait, this is only an approximation for when v_r is much smaller than the speed of light. Or is it the other way around? Wait, the relativistic Doppler formula is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), where v is the radial velocity. But I'm not sure if I need to consider this for this problem.

Wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So λ1_emit = λ2_emit? Or is it that after considering Doppler shift, the observed λ_max is the same? Hmm, the question says, "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same
