Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The given concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, okay, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, meaning it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The formation constant, K, tells us how stable the complex is. A higher K means the complex is more stable.

So, the problem is about the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. The complex dissociates into calcium ions and EDTA ions. The formula for the formation constant is K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca][EDTA]). But wait, I think I might have to flip that because sometimes it's written as the reverse reaction. Let me think. The formation reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. So the formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So in this case, Kf is 5e10.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So that's the concentration of CaEDTA^2- ions. Let me denote that as S, so S = 0.02 M.

When the complex dissociates, each mole of CaEDTA^2- releases one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-. So, the dissociation is: CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

Assuming the dissociation is small because K is large, so S is much larger than the amount dissociated. Let me let x be the concentration of Ca²+ at equilibrium. So, the concentration of Ca²+ is x, and the same for EDTA^4- because for each mole of complex dissociated, you get one mole each of Ca and EDTA.

But wait, wait a minute. EDTA is a polydentate ligand, and in solution, it exists in different protonated forms depending on pH. The problem says the pH is
