Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I need to figure out which theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. Let me think about each option.

First, what is regularization? From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are infinities that pop up in calculations, making the math messy. Regularization introduces a temporary momentum cutoff or some other method to make the integrals finite, and then you remove the cutoff later, hopefully getting finite results after renormalization.

So the question is asking which theory doesn't need this regularization when energies are high. Let me go through each option.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I know string theory is an attempt to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity. It deals with particles as strings vibrating at different frequencies. I've heard that string theories are different because they don't have the same kind of divergences as point particle theories. Wait, because they're dealing with extended objects, maybe they don't require as much regularization? Or perhaps they are finite? I remember that superstring theory, specifically, is a candidate for a theory of everything. Oh, and I think string theories are "UV finite," meaning they don't have the same high-energy divergences that other quantum field theories do. So they might not require regularization.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-Abelian gauge theory with the SU(3) symmetry. I know that QCD does require regularization because of things like the running coupling constant. At high energies (or equivalently, at short distances), the coupling becomes weaker (asymptotic freedom), and the theory is perturbative. But wait, does that mean it's free from divergences? No, because you still have loop diagrams that can lead to divergences. So regularizations like lattice QCD or using a cutoff are used. So B requires regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a U(1) gauge theory. I remember that QED does have divergences, but it's renormalizable. That means you can absorb the infinities into a few parameters (like mass and charge) and get finite results after renormalization. But before that, you need to regularize the divergent integrals. So you have to use methods like introducing a cutoff, dimensional regularization, etc. So C requires regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, classical theories don't deal with quantum effects, so they don't have the same issues with divergences. Classical E&M uses Maxwell's equations. While there are some issues in the classical theory, like the infinite self-energy of a point charge, but those are handled differently. I don't think regularization is a concept in classical theories because they don't involve the same divergent integrals in the same way as quantum field theories. So classical E&M doesn't require regularization. But wait, the question is about high energies. Does classical E&M even apply at high energies? Well, high energies correspond to short wavelengths, where quantum effects are dominant. So perhaps the question is about which theory among the options inherently doesn't need regularization because it's a classical theory or because it's a theory that doesn't have the same divergences.

Wait, but the question is about which theory never requires regularization. If the theory
