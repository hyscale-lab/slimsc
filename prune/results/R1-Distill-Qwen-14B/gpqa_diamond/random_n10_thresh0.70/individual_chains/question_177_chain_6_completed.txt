Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to unpack it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, right? 

So, the setup is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, so same scale for both radius and mass. But wait, how does that tie into luminosity? I remember that luminosity depends on radius and temperature somehow. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law. 

The question says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, wait, the peak wavelength is the same. That's from Wien's law, right? Wien's displacement law states that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature of the black body. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2. That makes things easier because temperature is a common factor.

So, the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since both stars have the same temperature, the luminosity ratio will be (R1/R2)² times (T1/T2)^4. But since T1 equals T2, that term is 1. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2.

Given that R1 is 1.5 times R2, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that would point towards option A, which is ~2.25. But wait, the options include B, C, D which are close, so maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2's is 700 km/s. Hmm, does radial velocity affect luminosity? I think not directly. Luminosity is intrinsic brightness, but apparent brightness (like apparent magnitude) would be affected by distance. But the problem says they computed the luminosities, so I don't think radial velocity affects luminosity itself because luminosity is an intrinsic property. Unless the Doppler effect affects the observed temperature or something else. Wait, but no, because the peak wavelengths are the same. Oh wait, if a star is moving towards or away from us, there's a Doppler shift. But in this case, Star_1 has zero radial velocity, so no shift. Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s. But the peak wavelengths observed are the same. So the intrinsic peak wavelengths must be different. Wait, this is getting a bit complicated.

Wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. But for Star_2, because it's moving away, there's a redshift. So if both have the same observed λ_max, but Star 2 is moving away, its intrinsic λ must be shorter. Because redshift makes λ longer. So if λ_observed for both is the same, then λ_intrinsic for Star_2 would be shorter than for Star_1.

Wait, let me think. Wien's law says λ_max * T = constant. So T = constant / λ_max. If Star_2 is moving away, its light is redshifted. So the observed λ_max is longer than the intrinsic λ_max. Similarly, Star_1 is not moving, so observed λ_max equals intrinsic. But the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same. 

So let's model this. For Star_1: observed λ_max_1 = intrinsic λ_max_1 (since radial velocity is zero). For Star_2: observed λ_max_2 = λ_max_2 * (1 + v_r/c), where v_r is the radial velocity. Since Star_2 is moving away, v_r is positive.

Given that observed λ_max_1 equals observed λ_max_2, so:

λ_max_1 = λ_max_2 * (1 + v_r2/c)

So, λ_max_2 = λ_max_1 / (1 + v_r2/c)

But using Wien's law, λ_max = b / T. So,

b/(T2) = (b/(T1)) * (1 + v_r2/c)

Wait, no, because for Star_2, λ_max_2 = b / T2. But the observed λ_max is (b/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c). And this equals λ_max_1 which is b / T1.

So,

b/(T1) = (b/(T2)) (1 + v_r2/c)

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v_r2/c)

Which rearranges to T2 = T1 (1 + v_r2/c)

So T2 is higher than T1 by a factor of (1 + v_r2/c). Wait, but that can't be right because if a star is moving away, its observed features are redshifted, implying lower temperature. Hmm, perhaps I should think again.

Wait, when a star is moving away, the wavelength is longer, which would imply a lower temperature if λ_max is longer. But in this problem, the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So Star_1's λ is not shifted, so it's λ1_max = b / T1. Star_2's observed λ is λ2_obs = λ2_max * (1 + v_r/c). But λ2_obs equals λ1_max. So:

λ2_max * (1 + v_r/c) = λ1_max

But λ2_max is b / T2, and λ1_max is b / T1.

So,

(b / T2) * (1 + v_r/c) = (b / T1)

Cancel b,

(1 / T2) (1 + v_r/c) = 1 / T1

So,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r/c) / (1) )

Wait, so T2 is T1 multiplied by (1 + v_r/c). But v_r is positive, so T2 is higher? That seems counterintuitive because if Star_2 is moving away, its light is redshifted, which would make it appear cooler, so lower T. But according to the equation, T2 is higher than T1. That must mean I've messed up the equation.

Wait, maybe the Doppler effect formula is different. The Doppler shift formula for receding objects is λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c). So if Star_2 is moving away, its emitted λ_max is shorter than the observed λ_max. Because when moving away, the wavelength stretches, so observed λ is longer.

But in the problem, the observed λ_max of Star_2 is the same as that of Star_1, which isn't moving. So:

λ1_max (no shift) = λ2_obs (shifted red by 700 km/s)

Which is λ1_max = λ2_max * (1 + v_r2/c)

So, λ2_max = λ1_max / (1 + v_r2/c)

But using Wien's law, λ_max = b / T. So,

λ1_max = b / T1
λ2_max = b / T2

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2/c)

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v_r2/c)

Multiply both sides by T2*T1,

T2 = T1 (1 + v_r2/c)

So, T2 = T1 * (1 + 700e3/(3e5)) 

Because v_r is 700 km/s. Let's compute that: 700e3 m/s divided by 3e5 m/s (approx speed of light). 7e5 / 3e5 is about 7/3 ≈ 2.333. So 1 + 2.333 = 3.333. So T2 = T1 * 3.333. 

Wait, that can't be right. Because if Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer, which would imply lower temperature. But according to the equation, T2 is higher than T1? That seems contradictory. Hmm, perhaps I have the Doppler shift direction wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, when a star moves away, the observed wavelength is longer. So if the star emits at λ2_max, we observe λ2_obs = λ2_max * (1 + v_r/c). So λ2_obs is longer than λ2_max.

But in this problem, the observed λ of Star_2 is equal to that of Star_1. So λ1_max = λ2_obs.

But λ1_max is emitted by Star_1, and λ2_obs is the observed wavelength from Star_2.

So, λ2_obs = λ2_max * (1 + v_r2/c) = λ1_max

So,

λ2_max = λ1_max / (1 + v_r2/c)

But λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So,

1/T2 = (1/T1) / (1 + v_r2/c )

So,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c )

So, T2 is greater than T1 by a factor of (1 + v_r2/c )

Hmm, so even though Star_2 is moving away, its temperature is higher? That seems contradictory, but the math says so.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler shift formula. Let me think: the Doppler shift formula for a source moving away is λ_obs = λ_source * (1 + v_obs/c). So if the source is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer. So, if Star_2 is moving away, the wavelength we observe is longer than its emitted wavelength. But in this problem, the observed wavelengths are the same as Star_1. So, λ1_max = λ2_obs. So, λ2_obs = λ2_max * (1 + v_r2/c ) = λ1_max.

Therefore, λ2_max = λ1_max / (1 + v_r2/c )

But λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So,

λ1_max / T1 = λ2_max / T2

Wait, no: λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So,

λ1_max = b / T1

λ2_max = b / T2

So,

λ1_max = (b / T1) = λ2_obs = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

So,

1 / T1 = (1 / T2 ) (1 + v_r2/c )

Thus,

T2 = T1 (1 + v_r2/c )

So, T2 = T1 (1 + 700e3 / 3e5 )

Compute 700,000 / 300,000 = 7/3 ≈ 2.333.

So,

1 + 2.333 = 3.333.

So T2 = T1 * 3.333.

Wait, so Star_2 is hotter than Star_1. But Star_1 has a larger radius and larger mass. Hmm, but mass isn't directly linked to temperature in this context. So, now, how does this affect luminosity?

Luminosity is given by L = 4π R² σ T^4.

So, the luminosity of each star:

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4

We need L1/L2.

Given R1 = 1.5 R2, T2 = (1 + 700e3/3e5 ) T1 = (7/3 +1 ) T1 = (10/3) T1? Wait, no. Wait, 700e3 is 7e5 m/s. 3e5 is speed of light. 7e5 /3e5 is 7/3 ≈ 2.333. So 1 + 2.333 = 3.333, which is 10/3 (since 10/3 is ≈3.333). So T2 = (10/3) T1.

Wait, no, the calculation was (1 + 700e3/3e5) = 1 + (7e5)/(3e5) ) = 1 + 7/3 = 10/3 ≈3.333.

So, T2 = (10/3) T1.

So, L1/L2 = [ (R1^2 T1^4) ] / [ (R2^2 T2^4) ]

R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1^2/R2^2 = (2.25)

T1^4 / T2^4 = [ T1 / ( (10/3) T1 ) ]^4 = (3/10)^4.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * (3/10)^4

Compute (3/10)^4: 3^4=81, 10^4=10000. So 81/10000 = 0.0081.

So,

2.25 * 0.0081 = ?

2.25 * 0.008 = 0.018. 2.25 * 0.0001 is 0.000225. So 0.018 + 0.000225 = 0.018225.

Wait, that can't be right. Because 2.25 * 0.0081 is 0.018225. So L1/L2 is 0.018225. So L1 is less than L2? But that contradicts earlier thoughts because R1 is 1.5 R2, which should make it more luminous, but T2 is higher.

Wait, that makes sense. If T2 is much higher, despite R being smaller, it could offset the radius. Let me compute the numbers again.

Wait, let me recompute L1/L2.

L1 = π R1² σ T1^4

L2 = π R2² σ T2^4

So the ratio is (R1² T1^4 ) / ( R2² T2^4 )

Given R1=1.5 R2, so R1²/R2² = (2.25)

T2 = (10/3) T1. So T2^4 = (10/3)^4 T1^4.

So,

T1^4 / T2^4 = (1) / ( (10/3)^4 ) ) = (3/10)^4 = 81/10000 = 0.0081.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.0081 = 0.018225.

So L1 is about 0.0182 times L2. That would imply L2 is much more luminous than L1. But the problem states that the computed luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2. So that's a problem. Because according to this, L1 is less than L2. But the question says they computed L1 to be greater than L2 by a factor. So perhaps I have a miscalculation.

Wait, maybe I messed up the Doppler shift formula. Let me reconsider. Suppose Star_2 is moving away, so its light is redshifted. So the observed λ is longer. But the problem says that the observed λ for both stars is the same. So Star_2's observed λ is longer than its emitted λ, but Star_1's λ is as emitted. So if both observed λ are same, then Star_2's emitted λ must be shorter than Star_1's emitted λ. Because Star_2's observed λ is λ2_emit*(1+v/c) = λ1_emit.

So, λ2_emit = λ1_emit / (1 + v/c).

But from Wien's law, λ_max = b / T. So:

λ1_emit = b / T1.

λ2_emit = b / T2.

So,

b/T2 = (b/T1) / (1 + v/c )

So,

1/T2 = 1/(T1 (1 + v/c ) )

Which gives T2 = T1 (1 + v/c )

So T2 is higher than T1 by (1 + v/c ). So star 2 is hotter.

So, back to the luminosity ratio. So L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4 ) / (R2^2 T2^4 )

Substituting:

R1=1.5 R2 → R1^2/R2^2 = 2.25.

T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c ) → T2^4 = T1^4 * (1 + v/c )^4.

So, L1/L2 = (2.25) * ( T1^4 ) / ( T1^4 * (1 + v/c )^4 ) ) = 2.25 / (1 + v/c )^4.

Wait, that's a key point I missed earlier. Because the ratio is (T1/T2)^4, which is [1/( (1 +v/c )) ]^4.

So, let's compute (1 + v/c ). v =700 km/s. c is 3e5 km/s. So v/c = 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333.

So 1 + v/c = 1.023333.

(1.023333)^4 ≈ ?

Let me compute it step by step. Let me use (1 + x)^4 where x is 0.023333.

(1.023333)^2 ≈ 1.023333 * 1.023333. Let me compute:

1.023333 * 1.023333:

= 1 + 2*(0.023333) + (0.023333)^2

≈ 1 + 0.046666 + 0.000544 ≈ 1.04721.

Then square that to get to the 4th power: (1.04721)^2.

1.04721 * 1.04721 ≈ 1 + 2*(0.04721) + (0.04721)^2.

≈ 1 + 0.09442 + 0.002229 ≈ 1.09665.

So (1.02333)^4 ≈ 1.09665.

So now L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.09665 ≈ ?

Let me compute 2.25 / 1.09665.

1.09665 * 2 = 2.1933.

Which is about 2.1933. 2.25 is 0.0567 higher than 2.1933.

So 2.25 / 1.09665 ≈ approx 2.05.

But wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

1.09665 × 2.05 → 2.05 * 1.09665.

2 *1.09665 = 2.1933

0.05 * 1.09665 = 0.0548325 → total 2.1933 + 0.0548325= 2.24813.

That's very close to 2.25. So 2.05 is approximately the factor.

Wait, but this is getting a bit messy. Let me compute 2.25 / 1.09665 numerically.

Compute 2.25 ÷ 1.09665:

1.09665 × 2 = 2.1933. 2.1933 is less than 2.25.

Difference is 2.25 - 2.1933 = 0.0567.

So 0.0567 / 1.09665 ≈ 0.0517.

So the total is approximately 2.0517.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.05.

Wait, but the options are A)2.25, B)2.32, C)2.35, D)2.23.

But none of the options are around 2.05. Hmm, perhaps my approximation was wrong. Let me compute (1 + v/c )^4 more accurately.

v =700 km/s, c=3e5 km/s → v/c=700/3e5 = 0.00233333.

So 1 + v/c = 1.00233333.

Compute (1.00233333)^4.

First, compute ln(1.00233333) ≈ 0.002328 (since ln(1+x) ≈x - x^2/2 + x^3/3 - ... )

But for more accuracy, perhaps use the expansion:

(1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + nx + (n(n-1)/2) x² + (n(n-1)(n-2)/6)x³ + ...

n=4, x=0.0023333.

So,

1 +4x +6x² +4x³ +x⁴.

Compute each term:

4x =4*(0.0023333)=0.009333.

6x² =6*(0.0023333)^2 =6*(0.000005444)≈ 0.00003266.

4x³=4*(0.0023333)^3≈4*(1.288e-8)≈5.15e-8.

x^4≈ (2.333e-3)^4≈ about 2.9e-10.

So sum all terms:

1 + 0.009333 = 1.009333.

Add 0.00003266 →1.00936566.

Add 5.15e-8 → ~1.009365667.

Add x^4 → negligible.

So (1.0023333)^4 ≈1.0093657.

So,

L1/L2= 2.25 / 1.0093657 ≈ ?

Compute 2.25 /1.0093657.

Well, 1.0093657 is approximately 1 + 0.0093657.

So 2.25 / (1 + 0.0093657 ) ≈2.25*(1 - 0.0093657 + (0.0093657)^2 ... ) using the approximation 1/(1+x) ≈1 -x for small x.

But let me compute 2.25 / 1.0093657.

Calculate 1.0093657 × 2.23 → 2.23 *1.0093657.

1.0093657 *2=2.0187314.

0.23 *1.0093657 ≈0.232154.

So total ≈2.0187314 +0.232154=2.250885.

Which is just over 2.25. So 2.23 *1.0093657 ≈2.2508, which is just above 2.25.

So 2.23 *1.0093657 ≈2.2508 → so if 2.23 is the numerator, the result is 2.25. Therefore, 2.25 /1.0093657 ≈2.23.

So L1/L2≈2.23, which is about option D.

Wait, that can't be right because earlier calculation with the wrong Doppler approach gave me a lower ratio. But using the correct approach, it's about 2.23, which is option D.

Wait, let me recheck my steps. So when I considered the Doppler shift, I had to correct the temperature of Star_2. Because Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer, but since both observed wavelengths are same, Star_2's emitted wavelength must be shorter, meaning higher temperature.

So with T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c ), which for v=700 km/s, gives T2 = T1 *1.0023333.

Wait, no, earlier calculation was (1 + v/c ) where v is 700 km/s, but c is 3e5 km/s. So v/c is 700/3e5 = 0.0023333333.

Ah, wait, no! Wait, 700 km/s divided by 3e5 km/s is 700/(3e5) = 0.002333333.

So 1 +v/c = 1.002333333.

So T2 = T1 *1.00233333.

So earlier when I thought T2 was 3.333 * T1, that was a mistake. I think I messed up the calculation earlier when I thought (1 +v/c ) was 7/3, which it's not. 700e3 is 7e5 m/s, 3e5 m/s → 7e5 /3e5 = 7/3 ≈2.333. So 1 +v/c is 3.333? No, that can't be right because 700,000 m/s is 7e5, 3e5 is 3e5. 7e5/3e5 is 7/3=2.333, but v is 700 km/s, which is 7e5 m/s, and c is 3e5 km/s, which is 3e8 m/s. Wait, wait, I think I messed up the units.

Wait, velocity in Doppler shift formula as a fraction of c. c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So 700 km/s is 700/(3e5) = 0.00233333.

Ah, yes. So 1 +v/c =1.00233333.

So, T2 = T1 *1.00233333.

So, (T1/T2)^4 = (1/(1.00233333))^4 ≈ (0.997666667)^4.

Compute this, perhaps using the approximation (1-x)^n ≈1 -nx.

(1 -0.00233333)^4 ≈1 -4*(0.00233333) =1-0.0093333 ≈0.9906667.

So, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2 * (0.9906667).

1.5^2 is 2.25.

2.25 * 0.9906667 ≈2.25 *0.9906667.

Compute 2.25 *0.9906667:

2.25 *0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 *0.0006667 ≈0.0015.

Total ≈2.2275 +0.0015=2.229.

So, approximately 2.23.

Which is option D.

Hmm, that makes sense. So the correct answer is D) ~2.23.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Relating the radii
The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2:

\[
R_1 = 1.5 R_2
\]

Thus, the ratio of the radii squared is:

\[
\frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Relating the temperatures
The problem also states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. From Wien's law, the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} \propto \frac{1}{T}
\]

For Star_2, which has a radial velocity of \(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s}\), the observed wavelength is redshifted. The Doppler shift formula relates the observed wavelength to the intrinsic wavelength:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \cdot (1 + v_r/c)
\]

Since the observed wavelengths for both stars are the same, the intrinsic wavelength of Star_2 is shorter than its observed wavelength. Using Wien's law, this implies that Star_2 is hotter than Star_1. The temperature ratio is:

\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + v_r/c)
\]

Substituting \(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s}\):

\[
\frac{v_r}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} = 0.002333
\]

\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + 0.002333) = T_1 \cdot 1.002333
\]

Thus, the temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1.002333}
\]

### Step 3: Calculating the temperature term
The fourth power of the temperature ratio is:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{1}{1.002333}\right)^4
\]

Using the approximation \((1 + x)^n \approx 1 + nx\) for small \(x\), where \(x = 0.002333\):

\[
\left(\frac{1}{1.002333}\right)^4 \approx 1 - 4 \cdot 0.002333 = 0.990667
\]

### Step 4: Calculating the luminosity ratio
Substituting the values into the luminosity ratio formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = 2.25 \cdot 0.990667
\]

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.23
\]

### Final Answer:
The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately **2.23**.
