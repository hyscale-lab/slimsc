Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. They also give me the components of the operator P (Px, Py, Pz) as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, so first, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and their eigenvectors represent the possible states when a measurement is made. The eigenvalue here is +ħ/2, which I think corresponds to spin-up in the direction of n.

The operator P is a vector operator, so I think it's similar to the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, the components Px, Py, Pz are given in terms of 2x2 matrices. Let me write them down.

Px is (ħ/2) multiplied by matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. That's the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix. And Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix.

Right, so the operator P is a vector operator made up of these components. The direction is given by a unit vector n in the x-z plane. So n can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but wait, since it's in the x-z plane, φ would be 0 or π/2. Wait no, angle φ is the azimuthal angle. Since it's in x-z, φ is 0 or π, because the y-component is zero. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) if θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, right?

Wait, but the problem says n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so θ and φ are such that n is in x-z plane. So perhaps n is (cosθ, 0, sinθ), but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's (sinθ, 0, cosθ), with θ measured from the z-axis. Hmm, I think I should just denote the unit vector as n = (a, 0,
