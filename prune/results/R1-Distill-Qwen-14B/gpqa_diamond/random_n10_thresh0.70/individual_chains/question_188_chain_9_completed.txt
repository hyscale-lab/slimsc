Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solid-state chemistry, but let's think it through.

The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that rhombohedral structures have all sides equal and all angles equal. So, in this case, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees each. They're asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane.

Wait, interplanar distance... Oh right, that's the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula for calculating the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of the squares of the Miller indices times the structure factors, but wait, structure factors for a rhombohedral... Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me get this straight.

I think the formula is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) * ( (cos α)^2 + (cos β)^2 + (cos γ)^2 ) / ... no, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, another approach: for a cubic system, the formula is simple, but for rhombohedral, it's more complex.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2/a^2) + (k^2/b^2) + (l^2/c^2) - 2(hk cosθ)/(a b) - 2(kl cosφ)/(b c) -2(lh cosψ)/(a c) )) ), but that's for a general triclinic system. Oh, but in our case, it's a rhombohedral, so a = b = c, and all angles are equal. So maybe the formula simplifies.

In rhombohedral systems, since a = b = c = a0 (let's say), and angles alpha = beta = gamma = theta, then the formula might be more manageable.

I recall that for a rhombohedral crystal, the interplanar spacing for (hkl) planes is given by d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - (h² + k² + l²)( (cos α)^2 + (cos β)^2 + (cos γ)^2 ) / 3 )? Wait, no, that doesn't ring a bell. Alternatively, another approach: perhaps using the relation between the unit cell and the reciprocal lattice.

Wait, the general formula is d = (1/√( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2hk cos α - 2kl cos β - 2lh cos γ )) ) * (a^2/(a^3 * ... )) Hmm, maybe I'm getting the terms wrong. Alternatively, in a cubic system, it's simply a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but in non-cubic systems, you have to adjust for the angles.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (h² + k² + l²) * ( (cos α + cos β + cos γ ) / 3 )) )? No, that doesn't sound correct either.

Wait, maybe the formula is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) * (cos α + cos β + cos γ ) / 3 ) )? Hmm, I'm not confident. Maybe I should look for the formula specific to rhombohedral systems.

Alternatively, I remember that in a rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - hk( cos α ) - kl( cos β ) - lh( cos γ ) )

But wait, in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and all angles are the same. So for the (111) plane, h = k = l = 1.

So substituting, we get d = a / sqrt(1 + 1 + 1 - (1*1 cos α + 1*1 cos β + 1*1 cos γ) )

Since all angles are 30 degrees, cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So let's compute the denominator:

1+1+1 = 3

Then, 1*1 cos(30) = cos(30) ≈ 0.8660 for each term. So three terms would sum to 3 * 0.8660 = 2.598.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the formula is 3 minus (sum of the cos terms) multiplied by 1, since h=k=l=1.

Wait, no: in the formula, it's sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - hk cos α -kl cos β - lh cos γ )

So for h=k=l=1, it's sqrt(3 - [cos(30) + cos(30) + cos(30) ] )

Which is sqrt(3 - 3 * cos(30) )

So cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660254.

So 3 * cos30 ≈ 3 * 0.8660254 ≈ 2.5980762.

So 3 - 2.5980762 ≈ 0.4019238.

Then, sqrt(0.4019238) ≈ sqrt(0.4019) ≈ 0.634.

So d = a / 0.634.

Wait, a is given as 10 Angstroms.

So d = 10 / 0.634 ≈ ?

Let me calculate that: 10 / 0.634 ≈ 15.773... Wait, that can't be right because the options are around 9 to 10.5.

Wait, that can't be. So I must have made a mistake in my formula.

Wait, maybe the formula isn't correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for d is [a/(sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (h² +k² +l²)(1/3)(cos α + cos β + cos γ )) )] ?

Wait, that might not fit either. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation involving the reciprocal lattice.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - (h² + k² + l²) ( (cos α + cos β + cos γ) / 3 ) )

Wait, let's try that. So, for (111), h=k=l=1.

Then,

Denominator inside sqrt: 3 - 3*( (3 cos30) /3 )

Wait, 3*( (3 * cos30)/3 ) = 3 * cos30.

So, the denominator is sqrt(3 - 3 * cos30 )

Which is the same as before. So same result. But that gives d ≈15.77, which is way larger than any options given.

Hmm, that can't be right because the interatomic distance is 10, and the interplanar distance shouldn't be larger than that. So I must have messed up the formula somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell parameters are a, α, etc. But perhaps I'm confusing a with the interatomic distance.

Wait, wait. Wait, wait. Wait a second. The interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice, which in a simple cubic structure is the same as a. But in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps the 'a' is the lattice parameter, which is the edge length. So if the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, that's the edge length, a.

So a =10 Angstrom.

Wait, but perhaps in some cases, for example, in a face-centered cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a√3/4, but that's for different structures. Wait, but in this question, it's a simple rhombohedral structure, so perhaps the interatomic distance is simply 'a'.

Wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So a =10.

Wait, but when I compute d as 10/0.634 ≈15.77, that would be way too big. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe I should be using the inverse. Let me think: the formula for d is 1/(sqrt( (h/a)^2 + (k/b)^2 + (l/c)^2 - ... )) ), but since a=b=c, it's 1/(sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2)/a^2 - (2hk cos α)/(a^2) - ... )) ), which would be a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2hk cos α - ... ), but since all angles are same, and h=k=l=1, this becomes a / sqrt(3 - 2 cos30 - 2 cos30 - 2 cos30 ), which is a / sqrt(3 - 6 cos30) ?

Wait, wait, no. Let me re-derive the formula correctly.

The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal lattice is given by:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2/a^2) + (k^2/b^2) + (l^2/c^2) - 2 hk cos α/(a b) - 2 kl cos β/(b c) - 2 lh cos γ/(a c) ) )

But for a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0, and all angles are equal (alpha = beta = gamma = θ). So substituting:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²)/a0² - 2 hk cosθ/(a0²) - 2 kl cosθ/(a0²) - 2 lh cosθ/(a0²) )

Simplifying, factor out 1/a0²:

d = 1/( (1/a0) * sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2hk cosθ - 2kl cosθ - 2 lh cosθ ) )

Which is d = a0 / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2 hk cosθ - 2 kl cosθ - 2 lh cosθ )

So for (111), h=k=l=1.

So denominator becomes sqrt( 3 - 2*(1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30) )

Which is sqrt(3 - 6*(cos30) )

Wait, cos30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So 6 * 0.866 ≈5.196.

So 3 -5.196 = -2.196.

Wait wait, that's a negative number inside the square root. That can't be right, as square roots of negatives aren't real. That suggests something's wrong with the formula or the approach.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the formula. Maybe the formula doesn't have all those terms because when h=k=l=1, the angles sum up to make the denominator negative, which isn't possible. So maybe the formula is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2 hk cos α + 2 kl cos β + 2 lh cos γ )

Wait, but I thought it was minus... Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should check a reference. Oh, but I can't do that right now. Let me think differently.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance can be computed using the relation between the Miller indices and the vectors. In a crystal, the lattice vectors are a, b, c. The planes are defined by their intercepts. The interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the norm of the reciprocal lattice vector.

The reciprocal lattice vector for (hkl) is (h/a, k/b, l/c) multiplied by 2π. But the interplanar distance d is given by 2π divided by the magnitude of the reciprocal vector. So:

d_{hkl} = 2π / sqrt( (h/a)^2 + (k/b)^2 + (l/c)^2 )

Wait, but if the crystal is not cubic, this would only be true in the case of a simple cubic structure. Or is it a different formula?

Wait no, I'm getting confused. Another approach: the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2 hk cos(alpha) + 2 kl cos(beta) + 2 lh cos(gamma) )

Wait, no, that would give a different result. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula from the structure of a rhombohedral crystal. The interplanar distance for (hkl) is given by d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + kl + lh) cos(alpha) )

Wait, but with all angles being alpha=30 degrees.

So for (111):

d = a / sqrt(3 - (1 +1 +1) cos30 )

Which is a / sqrt(3 - 3*(sqrt(3)/2) )

Compute the denominator:

3 - 3*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈3 - 3*(0.8660) ≈3 -2.598 ≈0.402.

So sqrt(0.402) ≈0.634.

a is 10, so d=10/0.634 ≈15.77 Angstroms. But that's way larger than any of the options, so I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) * ( cos^2 alpha + cos^2 beta + cos^2 gamma ) /3 )

No, that might not be correct either.

Wait, another thought: in a rhombohedral system, the volume of the unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - cos^2 alpha - cos^2 beta - cos^2 gamma + 2 cos alpha cos beta cos gamma ) ) / something? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the metric tensor. The lattice parameters can be represented by the metric tensor g, where the diagonal elements are a², b², c², and the off-diagonal elements are a b cos gamma, etc.

Wait, but for rhombohedral, a = b = c = a0, and angles are all theta. So the metric tensor g is a0² [ 1            cos theta      cos theta
                    cos theta      1            cos theta
                    cos theta      cos theta      1 ]

So the matrix is:

[ 1        cosθ      cosθ
  cosθ     1         cosθ
  cosθ     cosθ      1 ]

With θ = 30 degrees.

The reciprocal metric tensor g^(-1) would then have elements that can be used to compute the reciprocal lattice vectors.

The reciprocal lattice vector for (hkl) is (h, k, l) multiplied by the elements of g^(-1).

The interplanar distance d is 2π divided by the norm of the reciprocal vector.

Hmm, but maybe that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, the interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/a² - 2(hk cosθ + kl cosθ + lh cosθ)/a²

So,

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cosθ - 2kl cosθ - 2 lh cosθ )

Wait, that's the same formula as before. So for h=k=l=1, that's:

d = a / sqrt(3 - 6 cosθ )

But wait, cos(theta) is cos(30) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So 3 -6*(0.866) = 3 -5.196= -2.196.

Hmm, that's negative. So square root of negative. That can't be. So that suggests that the formula I'm using is incorrect, or perhaps the (111) plane doesn't exist in this structure? Or perhaps I have the wrong sign in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula should have a plus instead of a minus. Let me try that.

d = a / sqrt(3 + 6 cosθ )

With cosθ = 0.866.

3 +6 *0.866 =3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=approx 2.863.

So d=10 /2.863 ≈3.49 Angstroms. But that's much smaller than the options, which are around 9. So that can't be correct either.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think differently. Perhaps I made a mistake in the formula's sign.

Wait, in the formula for interplanar distance, the denominator is sqrt( terms ). So if the terms inside become negative, that suggests the plane doesn't exist, which isn't possible.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2 [hk cos α + kl cos β + lh cos γ] )

Wait, let me plug in the numbers again.

h=k=l=1, so denominator is sqrt(3 + 2 * [cos30 + cos30 + cos30] ) = sqrt(3 + 6*(0.866)).

Which is sqrt(3 +5.196)=sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.863.

So d=10 /2.863 ≈3.49, which is too small.

Hmm. Neither sign seems to give a plausible answer. So maybe I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, another approach: think of the unit cell. In a rhombohedral system with a=10, and angles 30 degrees, what is the interplanar distance for (111)?

Alternatively, perhaps using the relation between the d-spacing and the atomic radius or something else. Wait, but the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So a is 10.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - (h² cos^2 α + k² cos^2 β + l² cos^2 gamma ) )

No, that doesn't seem right. Maybe that's for a different structure.

Alternatively, I found this formula somewhere: for a rhombohedral crystal, the interplanar spacing is given by:

d_{hkl}=a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2hk cos alpha )

But wait, that seems too simplified, as it ignores the other angles.

But with all angles alpha=30, and perhaps the formula for a general rhombohedral is more complex.

Wait, but maybe for a rhombohedral, the formula simplifies because all angles are the same.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² + 2(hk + kl + lh) cos theta )

Where theta is the angle between the axes.

Wait, let's try that. For (111):

h=k=l=1.

Then,

3 + 2*(1+1+1)*cos30 =3 + 6*(0.866) = 3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=~2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom. Still too small.

Wait, perhaps the formula has a minus sign. Let me try:

3 - 6 *0.866=3-5.196= -2.196. No, that's negative.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the interatomic distance with the lattice parameter. If the structure is a simple cubic, then a = interatomic distance. But in a rhombohedral structure, maybe the lattice parameter is different. For example, in a hexagonal close-packed structure, the lattice parameter a is related to the interatomic distance, but it's not the same.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So in a simple cubic structure, a would be 10. But in a rhombohedral structure, if the atoms are at the corners and the center, perhaps the relationship is different.

Wait, no. Wait, in a simple cubic structure, the atoms are at the corners, and the interatomic distance is a√1, because the nearest neighbors are along the edges. So a=interatomic distance.

But in a BCC structure, the interatomic distance is a√3/2. But this is for specific structures. In our case, the question says it's a rhombohedral crystal, but I don't know the type of stacking. So perhaps I should assume that the interatomic distance is a, the lattice parameter.

So a=10 Angstrom.

Wait, but then the formula seems to give d=15.77, which is not in the options. So perhaps I'm wrong about the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral is given by d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2 (h k + k l + l h) cos(theta) )

Wait, so using the same numbers:

3 + 6 * 0.866 ≈3 +5.196=8.196.

d=10/sqrt(8.196)≈10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom, again way too small.

This can't be. The options are around 9 Angstroms.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2 (h k +k l + l h) cos(theta) )

So for (111), that's 3 -6*(0.866)=3-5.196=-2.196. Negative again.

Hmm, what's another approach? Maybe using the volume.

Wait, the volume of the unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 theta + 2 cos^3 theta ). For theta=30 degrees,

Compute 1 -3*(0.866)^2 + 2*(0.866)^3.

0.866^2≈0.75, 0.866^3≈0.6495.

So 1 -3*(0.75)=1-2.25= -1.25.

Plus 2*(0.6495)=1.299.

So total: -1.25 +1.299≈0.049.

So volume is a^3 * sqrt(0.049)=10^3 * 0.221≈22.1.

Not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance can be found via the atomic positions.

Wait, maybe the (111) plane's spacing is determined by the positions of the atoms in the lattice.

In a rhombohedral structure, the atoms are at the points (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), etc., but the positions are more complex due to the angles.

Alternatively, perhaps using the plane equation.

Wait, the (111) plane has intercepts at (a,0,0), (0,b,0), (0,0,c). But in rhombohedral, a=b=c, so (a,0,0), (0,a,0), (0,0,a).

The distance from the origin to the plane is d = a/(sqrt(1+1+1)) )= a/sqrt(3) ≈10/1.732≈5.77 Angstroms. But that's not the interplanar distance. Wait, no, the interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes. So in a cubic system, the (111) planes are spaced at a/sqrt(3). But the given options are way larger than 5.77, so that's not matching.

Wait, but in the cubic case, a is the lattice parameter, which is the same as interatomic distance. So if a=10, then the interplanar distance is about 5.77. But in the options, the closest to that isn't present. So perhaps the formula isn't the same as cubic.

Wait, but in the question, the structure is rhombohedral, not cubic. So the interplanar distance formula must account for the angles.

I'm clearly missing something here. Maybe the formula I'm using is incorrect, and there's a different approach.

Wait, another thought: the interplanar distance is given by d = (a)/(sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (h² + k² + l²) * [ (cos alpha + cos beta + cos gamma)/3 ] )) )

So, for (111), h=k=l=1,

d = a / sqrt( 3 - 3 * [ (3 cos30 ) /3 ] ) = a / sqrt(3 -3 cos30 )

Which is same as previous approach. So same result, leading to 10 / sqrt(3 -3*(0.866))=10/sqrt(3-2.598)=10/sqrt(0.402)=10/0.634≈15.77. But that's not among the options, so I must have the formula wrong.

Hmm, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2 (h k cos alpha + k l cos beta + l h cos gamma) )

Wait, that's with a plus sign. For (111), that would be 3 + 2*(3 * cos30) = 3 +6*(0.866)=3+5.196=8.196.

d=10/sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.49. Still too small.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think about the general case of interplanar distance.

In a general hexagonal system, the formula is different, but rhombohedral is a special case.

Wait, I found a formula online (but I can't access it now) that for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos alpha + 2kl cos beta + 2lh cos gamma )

Wait, but all angles are 30 degrees.

So for (111), that's 3 + 2*(3 * cos30 )=3 +6*(0.866)=3+5.196=8.196.

So d=10/sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.49. Again, same as before.

Hmm, but the options are about 9. So perhaps I should think that the formula in the question is different.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is not the same as the lattice parameter 'a'?

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is along a different direction, not along the lattice vectors. For example, in a simple cubic, the interatomic distance is 'a'. But in a rhombohedral, perhaps the interatomic distance is along the (111) direction or something else. But the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So that's the distance between adjacent atoms.

Wait, maybe the 'a' is not the lattice parameter, but the interatomic distance. So in a simple cubic, a = interatomic distance. But in a rhombohedral structure, 'a' is the lattice parameter, and the interatomic distance along the edges is a. So 'a' is 10.

But that brings me back to the same problem as before.

Wait, perhaps the formula I'm using is for the spacing of the planes in the reciprocal lattice, but no, that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I'm probably going about this the wrong way. Perhaps I should try a different approach.

Wait, another approach: The interplanar distance d for (111) in a rhombohedral structure can be found using the formula d = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2 (hk +kl + lh) cos(theta) )

Wait, with theta =30 degrees.

So denominator is sqrt(3 + 6 * 0.866 )=sqrt(3+5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstroms. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2*(hk +kl + lh) cos(theta) )

So denominator is sqrt(3 -6 *0.866)=sqrt(-2.196). Which isn't possible.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing an exponent or a factor. Let me think: perhaps the formula has a denominator of (h² +k² +l²) multiplied by something.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) * (1 - cos^2 theta) )

But for (111), that would be 3*(1 - 0.75)=3*(0.25)=0.75. sqrt(0.75)=~0.866. So d=10/0.866 ≈11.547. Which is larger than the options.

Hmm, but the options are around 9. So perhaps that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / something.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2*(hk +kl + lh) cos(theta) )

We tried that, but it gives 3.49.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me consider that the correct answer might be option A) 9.08.

But how?

Wait, another approach: think about the volume and the density, but the question doesn't mention density, so that's not helpful.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe I should look for an alternative formula or check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps the formula I should use is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2 (h k +k l + l h) (cos alpha) )

Which would give denominator sqrt(3 -6*0.866)=sqrt(-2.196), which is imaginary. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula has a plus instead of a minus, leading to sqrt(8.196)=2.863, d=3.49.

No, that's not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the spacing using the unit cell dimensions but perhaps using the cell's volume or something else.

Wait, another idea: Perhaps the formula for interplanar distance is d = a / (sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) * cos(alpha) ) )

No, that's probably not correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) * (1/3)(cos α + cos β + cos γ )) )

Wait, for (111), that would be 3 - (3 * (3 * cos30)/3 )=3 - (3 * cos30) =3 - 3*(0.866)=3 -2.598=0.402.

So sqrt(0.402)=0.634. Thus, d=10 /0.634≈15.77, which again is not any of the options.

This is frustrating. I'm probably missing something fundamental here. Maybe the formula I'm using is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking about the interatomic distance in the (111) direction, not the interplanar distance. But the question explicitly says interplanar distance.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the angles are all 30 degrees, but in the formula, the angles are the angles between the axes, which in rhombohedral are all equal, but perhaps I'm using the wrong angle in the formula.

Wait, maybe the formula uses the angle between the lattice vectors, which for rhombohedral is 180-30=150 degrees. Because in crystallography, the angles between the axes can be the supplementary angles. Hmm, no, I think that's incorrect.

Wait, no, in the metric tensor, the angles used are the angles between the vectors, which are the same as given in the problem: alpha=30 degrees.

Hmm. I'm at a loss. I think I need to take a different approach. Let me try to calculate using the given options. Suppose the correct answer is option A:9.08.

What would that imply?

If d=9.08, then:

d= a / sqrt(3 -6 cos30 )

Wait, 3-6*(0.866)=3-5.196≈-2.196, which is impossible. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d= a / sqrt(3 +6 cos30 )=10/sqrt(8.196)=3.49.

Which is option not in the choices.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) * ( (cos alpha)^2 + (cos beta)^2 + (cos gamma)^2 ) /3 )

So for (111):

Denominator sqrt(3 -3*( (3*(cos30)^2 ) )/3 )=sqrt(3 - (3*(0.75))/3 )=sqrt(3 -0.75 )=sqrt(2.25)=1.5.

So d=10/1.5≈6.666... Still not matching the options.

Hmm. Another idea: perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2*(hk + kl + lh) (cos theta) )

Wait, that's 3 + 6*(0.866)=8.196, sqrt=2.863, d=3.49.

Nope.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) * (1 - cos theta )

So for (111), denominator is sqrt(3) * (1 -0.866).

sqrt(3)=1.732; 1-0.866=0.134.

So denominator=1.732 *0.134≈0.232.

d=10/0.232≈43.1. No, that's way off.

Hmm. I'm clearly not getting anywhere with this approach. I think I'm going to have to make an educated guess based on the options and possible miscalculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the angle. If the angles were 60 degrees instead of 30, perhaps.

cos(60)=0.5.

So for (111):

d= a / sqrt(3 -6*0.5)= a/sqrt(3-3)= a/sqrt(0)= undefined. No.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2*(hk +kl + lh) cos(theta) )

Which would give for (111) d=10/sqrt(8.196)=3.49.

But that's not in the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2*(hk +kl + lh) ) * cos(theta) )

No, that would be 10/sqrt( 3 + 6 *0.866 )=same as before.

Hmm.

Well, maybe I've messed up the formula and the correct answer is option A)9.08.

But without knowing the correct formula, I can't be sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, perhaps the lattice parameter a is not 10 Angstroms, but something else. Because the interatomic distance is given as 10, perhaps a is different.

Hmm, but I thought a is the lattice parameter, which would be the same as the interatomic distance in a simple cubic structure.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) * (1 - cos^2 theta) )

So for (111):

denominator = sqrt(3*(1 - (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ))= sqrt(3*(1- 3/4 ))= sqrt(3*(1/4))= sqrt(3/4)= sqrt(0.75)= ~0.866.

So d=10/0.866≈11.547 Angstrom. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's 1/(sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) * (1 - cos^2 theta) )) )

No, that would be a different formula.

Hmm, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) * sqrt(1 - cos^2 theta)

Which is 10/sqrt(3) * sqrt(1 - (3/4))=10/(1.732) * sqrt(1/4)=5.773 *0.5=2.886. No, that's too small.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities and can't find a way to get an answer matching the options. Perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, but I'm not sure. Based on the options given, I'll have to make an educated guess.

Wait, another idea: Perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (h² +k² +l^2) * ( (cos α + cos β + cos γ) ) )

So for (111):

3 -3*(3 *cos30) =3-9*(0.866)=3-7.794≈-4.794. Negative again.

No.

I think I'll have to concede that I can't figure this out correctly. But given the options, perhaps option A)9.08 is the intended answer. But I have no idea how to get there.


The problem involves calculating the interplanar distance \( d_{hkl} \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with lattice parameter \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \). The interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral crystal is given by:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2(hk \cos \alpha + kl \cos \beta + lh \cos \gamma)}}
\]

For the (111) plane, \( h = k = l = 1 \), and since \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula simplifies to:

\[
d_{111} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{3 - 6 \cos 30^\circ}}
\]

Substituting \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \), the denominator becomes:

\[
\sqrt{3 - 6 \cdot 0.866} = \sqrt{3 - 5.196} = \sqrt{-2.196}
\]

This results in a negative value under the square root, which is unphysical. This suggests either an issue with the formula or the interpretation of the problem. Alternative approaches were considered, including different sign conventions, but none yielded a plausible result consistent with the given options.

Given the options provided, the closest plausible answer based on the calculations and assumptions is **A) 9.08 Å**, even though the exact derivation remains unclear due to inconsistencies in the formula or interpretation.
