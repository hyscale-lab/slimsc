Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is asking which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergencesâ€”those are the infinities that pop up in calculations. So the question is about which theory doesn't need this process at high energies. I think regularization is used when the theory has divergences, especially in loop calculations. So if a theory is free of such problems, it might not require regularization.

Let me go through each option. Starting with option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, classical theories don't really deal with quantum effects, so when would they need regularization? Regularization is a quantum field theory concept. So maybe classical E&M doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory. But wait, do any classical theories have issues with divergences that need handling? Like in electromagnetism, you have point charges, and their fields might have singularities, but I think those are handled differently, maybe through renormalization concepts but in a different way.

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). I know QED is a well-established quantum field theory. It does have renormalization, which deals with infinities. So regularization is a part of the process to handle these infinities. So QED probably does require regularization, which means it's not the correct answer.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, and it's known for having things like asymptotic freedom. But wait, doesn't QCD require regularization as well? Because even though it's a different force, it's a quantum field theory and loop integrals can diverge. So regularization is needed, making B not the correct answer.

Option A is Superstring Theory. Hmm, superstring theory is a type of string theory, which is a candidate for a theory of everything, combining gravity with quantum mechanics. String theories are background-dependent and are supposed to be finite, meaning they don't have the same kind of divergences that QFTs do. Wait, because string theories (like superstring theory) are higher-dimensional and have a different structure, maybe they avoid the need for regularization. Or perhaps regularization isn't necessary because the theory is inherently finite
