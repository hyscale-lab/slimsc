Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data and then predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

First, I'll look at the spectroscopic data given. The IR shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1. That broad range usually suggests an O-H stretch, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But wait, in the IR, there's also a peak at 1720 cm-1. Oh, that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which is typical for a carboxylic acid or an ester. So maybe the compound has a carboxylic acid group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which is likely the -OH proton of a carboxylic acid. Because alcohols usually have broad signals, and at around 1-5 ppm, but carboxylic acids are more upfield? Wait, no, I think carboxylic acids have their protons around 10-12 ppm. So that fits. So the compound is a carboxylic acid.

Other peaks:
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This suggests aromatic protons, maybe a para-substituted benzene ring. The doublet indicates coupling with one neighboring proton. So if it's para-substituted, each proton has one neighbor, hence a doublet.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another set of aromatic protons. So if there are two doublets, maybe the substituents are in the para positions. So perhaps it's a benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 and 4. Wait, but the substituents could vary—maybe a substituent at 4, and another at 1?

Wait, no, for a para-substituted benzene, the neighboring protons would be two doublets. So let's think about it: if the substituent is at position 4 (like a methyl group), then the adjacent H's would be at 2 and 6 positions. Each would be coupled with their neighbors. So
