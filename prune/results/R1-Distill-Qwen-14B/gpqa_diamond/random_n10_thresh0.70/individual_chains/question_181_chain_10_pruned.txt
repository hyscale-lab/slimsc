Okay, so I'm trying to solve this neutrino flux problem. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino physics, but I'll try to remember what I know.

The question is about the Sun's core reactions and how stopping a specific branch affects the neutrino flux in certain energy bands. The pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago, and I need to find the ratio of fluxes between two bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2).

Wait, what's the pp-III branch again? Oh right, in the proton-proton chain, there are different branches. The pp-I branch is the main one, producing helium-4, and the pp-II involves boron-8. The pp-III branch, I think, produces something else, maybe like carbon or oxygen? Or perhaps it's a specific part of the chain. Oh wait, pp-III might involve the triple-alpha process, but I'm not sure. Or maybe pp-III is a different pathway in the proton-proton chain?

Wait, more accurately, I think the pp chain has a main branch (pp-I) which is the dominant one, and then the pp-II and pp-III are minor branches. The pp-I is about 85% of the reactions, leading to He-4, and the others produce different isotopes. But the exact details might not matter here.

So the pp-III branch stops. So all other reactions continue. But neutrinos are produced in various ways. The main solar neutrinos come from the proton-proton chain, specifically the pp-I branch. Wait, the pp-I branch produces He-4 and emits positrons and neutrinos. Oh right, the neutrinos are produced when a boron-8 (from pp-II) decays into carbon-8, which emits a positron and a neutrino. Or maybe I'm mixing this up.

Wait, neutrinos in the Sun are mainly produced via the pp chain. The main source is the decay of boron-8, which comes from the pp-II branch. Because in the pp-I branch, the main pathway doesn't produce boron-8. Oh wait, maybe the pp-III is another branch that does produce boron-8? Or perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch is responsible for a specific part of the neutrino emission. Wait, I think the main neutrino emission from the
