Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. So the question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic scenario. 

Wait, in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator's maximum speed is given by v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), right? But here, it's relativistic, so I guess we need to consider relativistic effects. So the speed can't be more than the speed of light, I suppose. But how does that change the formula?

Oh, right, in relativity, as an object's speed approaches c, the mass increases due to relativistic mass. The relativistic mass is gamma times the rest mass, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So maybe that plays a role here.

The system is a 1D oscillator obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. So the force is the same as in the classical case, but the mass is relativistic. Hmm, but wait, how does the frequency change in relativity? Or does it even? Or perhaps the equation of motion is modified.

Wait, the equation of motion for a classical harmonic oscillator is F = m d²x/dt² = -kx. So, in the relativistic case, if the mass depends on velocity, the equation might change. Or perhaps the effective mass increases with speed. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure about the setup.

Wait, maybe I should think about energy. In the classical case, the total energy is (1/2)kA², and at maximum displacement (x=A), all energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic, so (1/2)mv² = (1/2)kA², leading to v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But that's the classical result.

In the relativistic scenario, maybe the kinetic energy is different. Because relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc². Hmm, but wait, in this problem, the mass m is the rest mass, I think. So when the oscillator is moving at maximum speed, all the energy would be kinetic, perhaps? Or does the potential energy still play a role?

Wait, no, because when the oscillator is at x=0, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum. But in relativity, the total energy is the sum of rest
