Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let me look at the metric given. It's written as ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) multiplied by (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a line element from a 2D space, but it's written in terms of x and y. So maybe this is a 2-dimensional metric, like a surface in 3D space or something else. 

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere. Pseudosphere is a term I remember from hyperbolic geometry. Oh right, a pseudosphere has a constant negative curvature. But wait, isn't a pseudosphere a surface in 3D? Then why is the metric written in 2D terms (dx, dy)? Or maybe this is a metric in 2D space with a certain curvature.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a 2D spacetime metric. Well, but the question is about area, which suggests it's a spatial metric, so maybe it's a 2D surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space.

Wait, the form of the metric is (something) times (dx² + dy²). So it's conformally flat. Conformal metrics have the form ds² = f(x,y) (dx² + dy²). The function f(x,y) here is 32/(4 - x² - y²). 

So, the area of a surface in such a metric would be the integral over
