Okay, so I need to figure out the allowed decay products of the boson X. The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is provided, and I think it's key to determining what X can decay into.

First, looking at the interaction term: L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully. Oh, the term is -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. So actually, it's written as a Yukawa-like coupling. Wait, maybe it's written as λ times f times \bar{ψ}_f times (ῡ + X) times ψ_f. So perhaps the interaction is between the fermion ψ_f and the boson X, with a coupling proportional to the fermion mass, which is m_f = λ f. Because in Yukawa theory, the mass term is m ψ ψ, and the coupling would be m = λ f.

So the Lagrangian is L_int = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f X ψ_f. Wait, because the term given is (ῡ + X), but usually that would be (ῡ + X) acting as a scalar. Wait, perhaps I should consider that the interaction is between X and ψ_f fermions. So each X boson couples to a fermion ψ_f. So the interaction is X ψ_f ψ_f, as in a Yukawa coupling.

So the vertex would be X coupling to two ψ_f fermions. So when X decays, it can decay into two fermions of type ψ_f, provided the energy allows it.

But wait, the question is about the possible decay products. So for X to decay into two particles (like a fermion and its antiparticle), the sum of their rest masses must be less than or equal to the mass of X.

X's mass is 6 GeV. So each fermion must have a mass less than 3 GeV, because 2m < 6 GeV → m < 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait: the rest mass of each fermion must be less than half of X's mass. Because the decay products need to be able to have enough energy. So each fermion can't have a mass exceeding 3 GeV.

So let's list the known fermion masses:

Electron (e): ≈0.0005 GeV
Muon (μ): ≈0.105 GeV
Tau (τ): ≈1.777 GeV
Up (u): ≈0.003 GeV (but in real life, up quark is around 2 MeV)
Down (d): similar, about 0.004 GeV
Strange (s): ~0.095 GeV
Charm (c): ~1.275 GeV
Bottom (b): ~4.13 GeV
Top (t): way heavier, about 173 GeV.

Wait, but in the Standard Model, quarks have masses (current quarks). But in this problem, perhaps the fermions considered are the charged leptons and the quarks, but maybe the quarks are considered as if they are free particles, which they're not—because in reality, quarks are confined. So when considering decay products, for a boson to decay into quarks, you have to consider that they come in pairs, and perhaps we can think of it as a quark-antiquark pair.

But when a spin-0 boson decays, it must produce particles with a total spin that can add up. But perhaps for the purpose of this question, the spin details aren't important, as it's about the kinematics (allowed by mass and charge conservation).

So, X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where each has a mass less than 3 GeV. Let's list possible fermions:

Leptons:
- e: mass ~0.0005 GeV → yes.
- μ: ~0.105 GeV → yes.
- τ: ~1.777
