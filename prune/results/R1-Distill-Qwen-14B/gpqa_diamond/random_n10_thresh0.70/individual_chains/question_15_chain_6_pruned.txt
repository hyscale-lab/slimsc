Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, I need to figure out which planet has a higher chance of transiting so the researchers should observe that one. Both planets have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different, and their host stars have different masses but the same radii. 

Wait, transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. Oh right, and the orbital period affects how often we can observe transits, but the question is about the probability of a transit occurring when we look, not the frequency. So the main factors for transit probability are the size of the planet and the size of the star. Also, the planet's orbital distance probably matters because a closer-in planet has a higher chance of transiting.

Wait, no, the probability of transit is actually calculated based on the geometry of the system. The formula I remember is P = (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But since both planets are Earth-like, their radii are similar, so maybe we can approximate R_planet as the same for both. Alternatively, it's more like P is proportional to (R_star / a), since the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's. 

But wait, another way I've heard it is that the probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. The formula is P = (R_*/a) * (something else?), but I'm a bit hazy. Alternatively, I recall that the probability is roughly (R_*/a), but I might be mixing it up.

Wait, no, the correct formula for the transit probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately R_star / a. So the probability is higher when the star is larger or the planet is closer (smaller a). 

So let's get the details from the problem:

Both planets are Earth-like, so R_planet is about the same for both. The host stars have the same radii, so R1 = R2. So R_star is the same for both. 

So the only thing that affects the transit probability in this case is the semi-major axis a. Because P ∝ 1/a. So a planet with a smaller semi-major axis (closer to the star) will have a higher probability of transiting.

Wait, but how is the semi-major axis related to the orbital period? Using Kepler's third law, which says that (a^3)/(T^2) = constant, where T is the period. The constant depends on the mass of the star and such. 

So for each planet, the semi-major axis a is determined by their orbital period T and the mass of their host star. 

Given that both planets have the same minimum mass (but that's their mass, not the star's), but the stars' masses are different. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. 

So, Kepler's third law is (a^3)/(T^2) = (G(M_star + m_planet))/(4π²). But since the planet mass is much smaller than the star, we can ignore it. So a^3 = (G M_star) (T^2) / (4 π²). 

So a is proportional to (M_star)^(1/3) * T^(2/3). 

Wait, let me write that properly: a ∝ (M_star)^(1/3) * T^(2/3). 

So for each planet:

a1 ∝ (M1)^(1/3) * (T1)^(2/3)
a2 ∝ (M2)^(1/3) * (T2)^(2/3)

Given that Planet_1 has a period T1 = T2 /3 because it's three times shorter. The mass of Planet_1's star is M1 = 2 M2. 

So substituting:

a1 ∝ (2 M2)^(1/3) * (T2/3)^(2/3)
a2 ∝ (M2)^(1/3) * (T2)^(2/3)

Let me compute the ratio a1/a2:

= [ (2)^(1/
