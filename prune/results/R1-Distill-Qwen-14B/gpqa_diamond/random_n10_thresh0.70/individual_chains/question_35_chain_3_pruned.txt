Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator. Let me take it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says that the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A_y, is represented by a 2x2 matrix. The operator is given as A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a specific matrix. The first row of S is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0].

Wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices are 2x2 and used in spin-1/2 systems. Let me recall: The Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Oh, so S must be the Pauli Y matrix here. So S = Y.

Then, A_y would be c multiplied by Y. So first, let's write down the matrix A_y.

c is h/(4π), so:

A_y = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

But wait, wait. Actually, when we have angular momentum operators, the spin matrices are multiplied by ħ/2. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think. The spin operator S for each component (like Sx, Sy, Sz) is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So Sy would be (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. But in this problem, A_y is given as c·S, and c is h/(4π). Let me compute what A_y is.

Wait, h is Planck's constant, and ħ is h/(2π). So h/(4π) would be (1/(2π)) * (h/(2π)) * 2π... Wait, perhaps it's better to compute numerically. Wait, c is h/(4π). Let me calculate that in terms of ħ.

Since ħ = h/(2π), then h = 2π ħ. So h/(4π) = (2π ħ)/(4π) = ħ/2. So c = ħ/2.

So A_y is (ħ/2) * S, where S is the Pauli Y matrix. So A_y is equal to (ħ/2) multiplied by [[0, -i], [i,
