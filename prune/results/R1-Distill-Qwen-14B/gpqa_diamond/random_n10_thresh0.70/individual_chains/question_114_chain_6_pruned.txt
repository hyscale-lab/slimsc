Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. Let's see... The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Hmm.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with a reagent A, and it produces 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Oh wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when a ketone reacts with something like NaCN, I remember that maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. Oh wait, yeah, the cyanide ion (CN-) could attack the carbonyl group. But wait, in ketones, the carbonyl is more reactive than aldehydes, but the mechanism is similar.

So, the product is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached. Wait, no, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure. So the main chain is four carbons, and the second carbon has both an OH and a CN group. So the structure would be (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, no, wait. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would add to the carbonyl carbon. So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons. Butanenitrile is four carbons with a nitrile group.
