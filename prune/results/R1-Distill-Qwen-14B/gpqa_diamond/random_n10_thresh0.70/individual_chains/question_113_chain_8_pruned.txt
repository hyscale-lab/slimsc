Okay, let's try to figure out the structure of this compound based on the given data. So, the question gives me information from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. I'll need to go through each of these and see what they tell me.

First, the FTIR spectrum. There's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. That usually corresponds to O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a broader and stronger peak around 3000, so maybe it's an -OH group, like an alcohol or phenol. Then there are peaks at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 peak is a strong one, which could be a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a conjugated carbonyl. The 1650 peak is a bit lower than 1700, which makes me think it's possibly a conjugated carbonyl, like in a ketone with adjacent double bonds (maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone) or perhaps an amide, but amides usually have lower carbonyl peaks. Alternatively, 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds (like in an aromatic ring causing C=C stretching). Hmm, but if there's a carbonyl at 1700, maybe it's an ester or ketone.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound has at least one double bond. Maybe it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl system, which fits with the IR data.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z 45. What fragments have a mass of 45? I remember that CH3O (methoxy) is 31, but that's not 45. Wait, 45 could be (CH3)2CHO- maybe, but more likely, it's something like a ketene ion or perhaps a fragment with a -CH2CHO group. Alternatively, 45 is the molecular weight of CH3CO (acetate) which is 45 (12*2 + 1*4 +16=44? Wait, 2 carbons:
