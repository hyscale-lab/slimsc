Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. So the question is about a star with some specific parameters and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels.

Alright, let's start by parsing the problem. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but wait, how does that work? Because when part of the surface is cooler (spots), the overall observed temperature changes. But I think the way it's given here is that the effective temperature of the entire photosphere becomes 5500 K when 40% is spotted. Or is that the case? Or maybe the observed Teff is a combination of the spotted and unspotted regions?

Wait, the problem says that when 40% is covered, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So the star's average Teff is now lower. Hmmm, so the effective temperature is the sum of all the flux contributions, weighted by their areas.

But wait, maybe it's more about the fact that when the spots are present, the effective temperature decreases, which would affect the ionization balance in the photosphere. Because the photosphere's temperature is what's governing the excitation of atoms.

The main point is about the ratio of the number of neutral
