Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. The question is asking about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in the qubit space. The options are four points in 3D space, so I guess each coordinate corresponds to some property of the density matrix.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices represent the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. Since this is a mixture of |0> and |1>, each with equal probability, I think this is a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. 

Wait, what's the structure of a density matrix for a single qubit? A general 2x2 density matrix can be written in terms of Bloch vector coordinates. Oh right! The Bloch sphere representation. The density matrix can be expressed using the Bloch vector r and the identity matrix. The formula is something like ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a 3D vector (x, y, z) with magnitude ≤ 1.

Let me write that down. So ρ = (I + xσx + yσy + zσz)/2. Comparing this with the given ρ, which is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Wait, |0><0| is a diagonal matrix [1,0; 0,0], and |1><1| is [0,0; 0,1]. Adding them gives [1,0; 0,1], which is the identity matrix I. So the given ρ is (I + 0)/2, because there's nothing else. So that would mean that the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0).

So in the Bloch sphere picture, this state is at the origin. Because the density matrix is just the maximally mixed state, which is the center of the Bloch sphere. So the geometrical position would be r=(0,0,0). Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0).

Wait, let me double-check. The Bloch vector components are linked to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. For a mixed state like this, the expectation values of X, Y, Z are all zero because the state is completely mixed. So x = <X>, y =
