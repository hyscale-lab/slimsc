Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Let me read the question again.

So, there are two astronauts. Their masses are 2m and 3m. They're moving in the positive x-direction at speeds 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Hmm, right. I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally because of the speed limit c. So for relative velocity, I can't just subtract the two speeds. I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Wait, wait, no, wait. Let me get that right. Oh yeah, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). But wait, actually, I think the formula is ( (v1 - v2) ) / (1 - (v1 v2)/(c²) ). So let me plug in the values.

v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So substituting, v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me compute the numerator first: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c, which is about 0.14c. So that's the relative speed. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So I can eliminate A and B.

Now for the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has relativistic energy, so their energies are gamma*m*c². So I need to compute the energy for each and sum them.

For the first astronaut, mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v1²/c²)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E1 = gamma1 * (2m) c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.25)) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. Let me compute that accurately. sqrt(0.75) is sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660. So 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

So energy E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 *3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 mc².

Wait, let me double-check. 2.5 plus 3.464 is indeed 5.964, which is about 5.96. So the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking back at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc^2, and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc^2, which is lower. So the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\):

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut (\(m = 2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (\(m = 3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Step 3: Match with Options
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\).
- The total energy is \(E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96m c^2\).

Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\).**
