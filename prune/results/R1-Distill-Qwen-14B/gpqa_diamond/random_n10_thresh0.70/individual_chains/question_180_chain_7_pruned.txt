Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, it's about electric potential energy in an isolated system of charges. I remember that electric potential energy between point charges is a big topic. Let me try to break this down step by step.

So, the problem says there are 13 identical particles. Each has a charge of 2e, and their mass is negligible. Oh, right, e is the elementary charge, about 1.6 x 10^-19 coulombs. But wait, 2e would be double that, so 3.2 x 10^-19 C each.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The thirteenth charge is fixed at P. So, the setup is that one charge is at point P, and the other twelve are each 2 meters away from P.

The question asks for the minimum energy of this system. Oh, right, in electrostatics, the potential energy depends on the configuration. Since the charges are fixed (I think), the energy is probably the sum of the potential energies between each pair.

Wait, but wait. How's the system arranged? The 13th charge is fixed at P, so each of the 12 others is at 2 meters from P. So, each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from the fixed charge at P.

But how are the 12 charges arranged relative to each other? Are they all at the same point? Or placed in some configuration around P? Hmm, the problem says they're '
