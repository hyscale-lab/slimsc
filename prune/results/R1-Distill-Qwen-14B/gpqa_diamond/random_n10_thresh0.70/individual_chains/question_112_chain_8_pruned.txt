Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question involves an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> states are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. Then, we're supposed to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator whose matrix representation is given by Aij. The matrix A has elements where Aij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j and 0 otherwise. We also need to find the average value of that operator.

First, I'll break this down into smaller parts. Let me start by understanding the initial state |alpha> and normalize it if necessary.

The given state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, it's a linear combination of the spin-up and spin-down states. To find the actual state, I think we'll need to normalize it. The normalization condition is that the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients equals 1.

Let's compute the coefficients:

Coefficient for |up> is (1 + i). The absolute square is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2, but wait, that's if it were a real and imaginary part each being 1. Wait, wait, actually, |a + ib|^2 is a^2 + b^2. So (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Coefficient for |down> is (2 - i). The absolute square is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5.

So the total squared magnitude is 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, but the question says it's proportional to that. So the actual state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Next, the operator whose matrix A has elements Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Hmm. Let me figure out what this matrix looks like in the computational basis (which is |up> and |down> here, I think).

Since there are two basis states, the matrix is 2x2. So, for a
