Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is a measure of distance to stars. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh wait, right, the formula for distance in parsecs is 1 divided by the parallax (plx), so distance d ≈ 1/plx. So if plx increases, the star is closer because the denominator is bigger, making the distance smaller.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit change in parallax. So if I consider a range of parallaxes, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range?

I think this has to do with the distribution of stars in space. Since stars are spread out, the number density (stars per unit volume) probably decreases with distance. But how exactly?

Wait, stars are in the galaxy, and the galaxy's structure might mean that the number of stars per unit volume doesn't change much with distance, but how does that translate into parallax?

Alternatively, maybe it's more about how the volume element works in three dimensions. If I imagine a shell at a certain distance d with thickness dr, the volume is 4π d² dr. So as d increases, the volume of the shell increases with d squared.

But since parallax plx is 1/d, substituting d = 1/plx. So plx is inversely proportional to d. Let me express dr in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, dr = -1/(plx²) dplx. Hmm, the negative sign indicates that as plx increases (d decreases), dr is negative, but maybe I can ignore the sign for now as we're considering magnitude here.

The number of stars in a shell depends on the volume and the number density of stars. Assuming number density (n) is roughly constant (since stars are uniformly distributed), the number of stars in the shell would be n * 4π d² dr.

Substituting d = 1/plx and dr = (1/plx²) dplx (ignoring the negative sign), the number becomes n *4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, that's n*4π*(1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars per unit plx (dplx) would be proportional to 1/plx⁴. Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So if I have a unit change in plx (dplx=1), the number would be proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number decreases with plx^4.

But wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, the number of stars per plx interval could depend on how the volume element changes with plx. So since the volume element scales as 1/plx^4, the number of stars per unit plx should increase as 1/plx^4. Wait, no, because higher plx means closer stars, but if the number of stars in a given volume is constant, then as d increases, the same number of stars are spread over a larger volume, meaning fewer stars in a shell at larger d.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's approach it differently. Let's consider the number of stars in a small range of plx. Let's say from plx to plx + dplx.

The distance corresponding to plx is d = 1/plx. The distance for plx + dplx is d + dd, where dd = -dplx/(1/plx^2) )? Wait, maybe I should use calculus. The number of stars N in a small range dplx is proportional to the volume between d = 1/plx and d = 1/(plx + dplx). But for small dplx, this is approximately the volume element at d, multiplied by the number density.

Wait, the volume element between d and d + dd is 4π d² dd. Now, since dd = -d (dplx), because d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So substituting, the volume element is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx, but wait, wait: because dd is negative, but when plx is increasing, d is decreasing. So the absolute volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 (dplx/(plx²)), because we take the absolute value of dd. So the volume element is proportional to (1/plx²) * (dplx / plx²) ) = dplx / plx^4.

So the number of stars would be n * (4π) * (1/plx^4) dplx. So the number of stars per unit plx (dplx=1) is proportional to 1/pl
