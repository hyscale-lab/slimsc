Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The options are A to D with some percentages.

Wait, right, the stability constant (β) tells us how stable a complex is. A higher β means the complex is more stable. Each β corresponds to a different complex. For Co(II) with thiocyanate, the complexes would probably be [Co(SCN)_n]^2- where n is 1,2,3,4. But wait, I should be precise about the charge. Let's think.

Cobalt in +2 charge. SCN- is a monodentate ligand. Each SCN- contributes a -1 charge. So the complexes would be:

n=1: [Co(SCN)]^+ (since Co is +2, plus 1 SCN- gives +1 overall charge)
n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (Co +2 plus 2 SCN- gives 0)
n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^−1 (Co +2 plus 3 SCN- gives -1)
n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^−2 (Co +2 plus 4 SCN- gives -2)

Wait, but the problem mentions dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato means two SCN groups. So the complex in question here is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, right? So the blue complex is the one with two thiocyanate ligands.

So the problem is asking for the percentage of Co(II) in this [Co(SCN)_2]^0 form compared to all possible cobalt species. The other species would be the free Co^2+ ion and the other complexes with 1, 3, or 4 SCN- ligands.

Stability constants are given for each complex. The β values are for the formation of each complex from Co^2+ and SCN-.

The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each species using the stability constants and the given concentrations.

I remember that the fraction of each species can be calculated using the formula:

f_n = (β_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n) / (Σ (β_k [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^k) for k=0 to 4)

Wait, wait. Wait, [Co^2+] is the concentration of the free ion, but [SCN^-] is the total concentration of SCN- including that bound in complexes. But wait, in the problem, [SCN^-] is given as 0.1 M. But when we form complexes, the free SCN- would decrease. Hmm, this complicates things because the total concentration of SCN- is
