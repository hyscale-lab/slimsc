Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that both of these are high-resolution spectrographs but have different capabilities in terms of the brightness of the stars they can observe.

Let me read the question again. They say that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, while HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 V mag. So, wait, lower magnitude numbers mean brighter, right? Because in astronomy, the magnitude scale is a bit counterintuitive. So a star that's magnitude 16 is brighter than 17. So for HIRES, it can detect stars that are up to 16.5 mag? Or wait, no, the question says "brighter than 17 mag with ESPRESSO" and "brighter than 16 V mag with HIRES." So any star with V mag ≤ 16 can be seen by HIRES, and ≤17 by ESPRESSO.

Wait, no, wait. If a star is brighter than 17, that means its V magnitude is less than 17. Because the scale is such that lower magnitudes are brighter. So for ESPRESSO, they can observe stars with V mag less than or equal to 17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with V mag less than or equal to 16.

Wait, but sometimes the phrasing is tricky. The question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Wait, no, actually, the question says that "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Because in astronomy, the brightness is measured such that lower magnitude means brighter. So a star with magnitude 17 is fainter than one with magnitude 16. Oh wait, no, that's right. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that means it's magnitude is less than 17? Wait, no. Wait, no. I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's think. If a star is at magnitude 3, it's brighter than a magnitude 5 star. So "brighter than 17" would mean magnitude is less than 17. Because
