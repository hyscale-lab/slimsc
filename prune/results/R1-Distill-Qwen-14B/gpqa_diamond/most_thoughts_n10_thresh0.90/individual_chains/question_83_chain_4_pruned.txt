Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so the reaction should produce acetate ions and water.

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid and dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, first, let's think about the initial solution when we mix the acetic acid with water. So, when you mix equal volumes of acid and water, the concentration should decrease by half because the volume doubles. So initial concentration of acetic acid before titration would be 0.05 M / 2 = 0.025 M.

Then, when we titrate, the NaOH will react with the acetic acid. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of CH3COOH. Let me calculate the moles initially.

Moles of acetic acid initially: M = 0.025 M, volume is 40 cm³ (since 20+20=40). Wait, wait, no. Wait, the initial solution (after dilution) is 20cm³ +20cm³=40 cm³. So moles = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, the initial solution is made by mixing 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40 cm³. So the concentration is (0.05 M * 0.02 L) / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Right.

So moles of acetic acid would be 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate. So the solution will have CH3COO^- in solution. Since NaOH is a strong base, it will completely dissociate, so the solution will contain Na+ and acetate ions. The acetate will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic.

Wait, so to find the pH at equivalence point, I need to calculate the concentration of acetate and then use the Kb to find OH- concentration.

But first, let's think about the equivalence point. The moles of NaOH added will be equal to moles of acetic acid. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume of NaOH needed for equivalence is (moles NaOH)/(concentration NaOH) = (0.001 mol)/(0.1 M) = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

Wait, so when 25% titration is done, that means 25% of the acetic acid has reacted. So 25% of 0.001 mol is 0.00025 mol of NaOH added. Wait, but it's 25% of the way to equivalence, so the volume of NaOH added is 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about the 25% titration. Oh, right, 25% titration means 25% of the equivalence point volume has been added. So the volume of NaOH added is 2.5 cm³. So moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

So, at 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized. Let's find the concentrations.

The total volume of solution at 25% titration is initial 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, so 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So, moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 mol. Moles reacted: 0.00025 mol. So moles remaining: 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate formed: 0.00025 mol.

So the solution at 25% titration is a buffer solution of acetic acid and acetate. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa is given by -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(5.405e4) ≈ 4.73.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 1.85e-5 is 1.85 × 10^-5. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let's compute that. 

Log(1.85) is approximately 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733, approximately 4.73.

At 25% titration, the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3. So log(1/3) is log(0.333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 + (-0.477) = 4.253, which is approximately 4.26.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the exact concentrations.

The total volume is 42.5 mL. So [A^-] is (0.00025 mol)/(0.0425 L) ≈ 0.005882 M. [HA] is (0.00075)/(0.0425) ≈ 0.017647 M.

So the ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.3333, which confirms the earlier calculation. So pH is 4.73 + log(0.333) = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253.

So approximately 4.26, which is option A's first value.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. The moles are 0.001 mol of acetate, and the total volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ (since 10 cm³ of NaOH is added) = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L. So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C.

So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb = 5.405e-10.

We can set up the expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming that x is the [OH^-], we approximate:

5.405e-10 ≈ (x)(x) / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So equation becomes x² / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x² = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3
