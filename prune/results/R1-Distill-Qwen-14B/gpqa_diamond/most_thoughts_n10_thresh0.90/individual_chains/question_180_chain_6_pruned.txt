Okay, let's tackle this physics problem step by step. So the question is about finding the minimum energy of a system of charges. Hmm, I need to remember the concepts involved here.

So, the setup is an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. Oh wait, but one of them is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are constrained to stay 2 meters away from P. So all the 12 are at the same distance from P, which makes me think of Coulomb's law for potential energy between point charges.

Wait, energy in such systems... right, the potential energy of a system of point charges is the work done to assemble them. Since the system is isolated, we're probably dealing with electrostatic potential energy here.

So the total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. But wait, how does that work when one charge is fixed and others are around it?

Let me think. The 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from the 13th. So the potential energy between each of these 12 and the fixed charge should contribute to the total.

But wait, what about the potential energy between the 12 moving charges themselves? Because they are each 2 meters from P, but I don't know if they're arranged in a particular way. Oh wait, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. I think that implies they are all at the same distance, so maybe they form a spherical shell around P. But their exact positions relative to each other might not matter if they're each at radius 2 m.

Wait, but when calculating the potential energy of the system, you have to consider each pair. So the total U is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.

But since the system is isolated and the charges are identical, we can calculate the potential energy contributed by each pair.

Let me structure this. The total potential energy U is the sum over all pairs of (k * q1 * q2) / r. But since all charges are the same and in a symmetric arrangement, maybe we can find an easier way.

So, the 13th charge is fixed, let's call it Q. Each of the other 12 charges, q, is at a distance r = 2 meters from Q. So the potential energy between Q and each q is U = k * Q * q / r.

Wait, but for each of the 12 charges, the potential energy due to Q is (k * Q * q)/r. Since all 12 are identical, the total contribution from Q to each q would be 12 * (k * Q * q)/(r).

But wait, no. Because the potential energy is calculated for each pair. So each of the 12 charges interacts with Q. So for each of the 12, we have a pair with Q. So the total for these pairs is 12 * (k * Q * q) / r.

But also, each of the 12 charges interacts with each other. So we have to calculate the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

Wait, but how many pairs are there among the 12? Let me recall: for n objects, the number of unique pairs is n*(n-1)/2. So for 12 charges, it's 12*11/2 = 66 pairs.

Each pair contributes (k * q * q) / r. But wait, what's the distance between each pair of the 12 charges? Oh, wait, no. The problem says each of the 12 is constrained to stay 2 meters from P, but nothing about their distance from each other. Hmm, that complicates things. Because without knowing their arrangement, I can't find the distance between each pair. Or can I make an assumption?

Wait, if all 12 are at the same distance from P, but their exact positions are not fixed relative to each other, it might be possible that their mutual distances vary, but perhaps the problem is assuming they are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are equal, like on a sphere. Or maybe since they're constrained to 2 m from P, but their positions are otherwise free, perhaps they are arranged on a sphere of radius 2 m, but the exact positions are arbitrary. Hmm, but without knowing the exact positions, I don't know their mutual distances, so perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy from the fixed charge and each of the moving charges, but not between the moving charges themselves.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the system's potential energy as the sum of the potential energies of each charge due to all the others. But that would include all pairs, which complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are fixed at their positions, so their mutual distances are fixed. But the problem statement
