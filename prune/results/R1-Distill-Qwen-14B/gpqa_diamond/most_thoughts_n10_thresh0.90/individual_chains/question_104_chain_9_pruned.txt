Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think this through.

Alright, the setup: Two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. They're using the RV method to detect them. Both planets are in circular orbits. 

The question is about comparing the orbital periods of the two planets. The clue given is the periodic shift in the spectral lines. Planet #1's shift is 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's is 7 milliangstroms. The options are multiples of each other, so I need to find how much longer Planet #2's period is than Planet #1's.

Wait, I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines as the planet orbits. The shift depends on the star's velocity towards or away from us. The bigger the shift, the higher the velocity. 

The formula I think is involved here is the one that relates the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) to the orbital period (P). Oh wait, the formula for K is K = (V) where V is the star's velocity. But how does that relate to the planet's orbital period?

I recall that the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, and the orbital period. Let me try to remember the exact equation.

The formula is K = ( (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(2π)) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, maybe another approach. Oh right, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ ( (27 * pi) / (2 * c^3) ) ] ^(-1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3)) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) )

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the formula that connects K with the orbital period. I remember that the formula for K (the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity) is:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(2/3) ) * (1/( ( (2 pi) / P )^(1/3) )) ) / (1 AU)^{1/3} ) )

Wait, maybe a better approach would be to use the relation between the velocities of the star and the planet, and their orbital periods. Since the star and planet orbit their common center of mass, their orbital periods are the same.

Wait, but the star's velocity is given by K, the semi-amplitude. So, for each planet, the star's velocity K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) P^(1/3)) ) or something like that.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/( 2 pi )) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So, that simplifies to K ≈ ( (G M_p) / (M_*^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(2 pi)) ) * (1/P^(1/3) )

Wait, but G is the gravitational constant, M_p is the planet mass, M_* is the star mass, and P is the orbital period.

Alternatively, I think another form is K = (v_0) = ( (27 * pi ) / (2) )^(-1/3) ) * ( (G M_p ) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the equation that relates K to the orbital period when the masses are similar. Let me try to find the relation between K and P.

I remember that for the same star mass and planet mass, K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3). Wait, no, because K is v, which is proportional to (M_p / M_*) * (1 / (M_*))^(1/3) * (1/P)^(1/3).

Wait, perhaps a better approach: since both stars have the same mass (M_*) and both planets have the same mass (M_p), the only varying factor here is the orbital period. So if we set up the ratio of K1 and K2, we can find the ratio of their periods.

So, K1 / K2 = ( (P2 / P1) )^(1/3) ) / ( (something else? )

Wait, no. Wait, K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

Wait, let me consider the formula:

K = [ (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * ( 1/(2 pi c ) ) * ( 1/ (P)^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = [ (v) ] = ( (G * P )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (2 pi (M_* + M_p) )^(2/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps that's an alternative form.
