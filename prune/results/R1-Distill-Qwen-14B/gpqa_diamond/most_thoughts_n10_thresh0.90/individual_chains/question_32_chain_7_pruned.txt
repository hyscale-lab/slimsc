Okay, so I have this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and I need to find the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that RHIC accelerates heavy ions to very high speeds, close to the speed of light. The problem says the speed is 0.96c. I need to find the energy, so I think about relativistic mechanics here.

The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li usually has 3 protons because it's lithium-6 or something. Wait, no, Li is element 3, so normal lithium has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that would make it lithium-6 (3 protons + 3 neutrons). Oh wait, no: 3 protons plus 3 neutrons is 6 nucleons, so the isotope is Li-6. But wait, actually, the number of neutrons is 3, so the mass number A is 3 (protons) + 3 = 6. So the nucleus is ^6Li.

So the mass of the nucleus is important. The rest mass energy of the nucleus is needed. But wait, wait—another approach: perhaps I should think in terms of the rest mass of the ion, which is the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons, but that's more accurate.

Wait, but maybe I can approximate the mass of the nucleus as just the mass number times the mass of a nucleon, since protons and neutrons are similar in mass. But to be precise, perhaps I should calculate the exact rest mass of ^6Li.

Alternatively, I might find the rest mass energy of the ^6Li nucleus. The atomic mass unit (u) is about 931.5 MeV/c². So, let's find the mass of ^6Li in u.

Wait, the atomic mass of ^6Li is approximately 6.015 u, because I remember that the mass of a proton is about 1.007 u and a neutron about 1.0087 u. So for ^6Li, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons:

3 * 1.007 = 3.021 u (protons)
3 * 1.0087 = 3.0261 u (neutrons)
Total mass: 3.021 + 3.0261 = 6.0471 u. But wait, isotopes have a precise mass, and I think the exact value might be different. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the mass number as an approximation, so 6.015 u is a commonly cited value for ^6Li. But perhaps I should look for the exact value. Alternatively, maybe I can use the molar mass as given by the periodic table.

Wait, the standard atomic weight for Li is about 6.94 g/mol, but that's for the common isotope, which is mostly ^7Li (with 3 protons and 4 neutrons, so A=7). Oh, but the question specifies ^6Li, which is less common. So for ^6Li, the exact atomic mass is about 6.01512 u. Let me confirm that. I think the exact atomic mass is approximately 6.01512 u, which is about 6.01512 * 931.5 MeV/c².

So the rest mass energy of the nucleus is m = 6.01512 u * 931.5 MeV/u. Let me compute that:

6.01512 * 931.5 ≈ let's calculate step by step.

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV
0.01512 * 931.5 ≈ 14.01 MeV (since 0.01 *931.5=9.315, 0.00512 *931.5≈4.77 MeV)
So total is around 5589 +14.01 ≈ 5603 MeV, which is 5.603 GeV.

Wait, wait, no, 931.5 MeV/u, so 6.01512 u would be 6.01512 * 931.5 MeV. Let me compute this precisely.

6.01512 * 931.5 = ?

Let me compute 6 *931.5 =5589. 0.01512 *931.5 is 14.01 (approx). So total is 5589 +14.01=5603.01 MeV. So about 5.603 GeV.

Wait, but if the charge is +3, but that's protons, but I'm considering the nucleus as a whole. But in any case, for the purpose of relativistic calculations, it's the mass of the nucleus that matters.

Wait, but the problem is about the kinetic energy or the total energy? Wait, the question says, "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)" such that the speed is 0.96c. So the energy here is the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. Or is it the kinetic energy? Hmm. Well, typically, when we talk about the energy of a collider, it's the total energy, which is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

Wait, no: the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c², and the total energy is gamma m c². So the collider's energy would be the total energy, which is gamma times the rest mass energy.

So the problem is asking for the total energy of the nucleus, which is gamma * m c².

So I need to compute gamma when v =0.96c.

The gamma factor is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me plug in v=0.96c.

v =0.96c → v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 (since 0.28^2=0.0784). So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) =0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, 1/0.28 is 3.57142857... So gamma ≈3.5714.

So the total energy is gamma * m c².

Earlier, I calculated m c² as about 5.603 GeV.

So total energy E = 3.5714 *5.603 GeV.

Let me compute that: 3 *5.603=16.809 GeV, 0.5714 *5.603.

0.5 *5.603=2
