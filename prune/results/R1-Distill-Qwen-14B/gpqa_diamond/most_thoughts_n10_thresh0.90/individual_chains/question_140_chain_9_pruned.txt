Okay, let's try to figure out this chemistry problem. Hmm, it's a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step.

So, the question is about Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K. Also, the product of a keto acid reacting with X has 2 oxygen atoms. Plus, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analogs.

I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options are A to D, with numbers around 25-35.

First, let's break down each part.

1. **Gas W**: Its molecule has same protons and neutrons. So each atom in W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. The most common such atom is deuterium (H²), but wait, that's a single atom. Alternatively, maybe it's something like CO2? Wait, no. Oh, wait, if W is a molecule, maybe it's something like CO because C has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (if ¹²C is used). Or wait, maybe W is water? Let me think. Wait, no. Let me think about the isotopes.

Wait, the question says W's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So each molecule has, for example, 1 proton and 1 neutron? No, that's just for a single atom of deuterium. But a molecule would be made of atoms. So perhaps a molecule like H2O? No, because H2O has H and O. No, wait. If W is a molecule where each atom has equal protons and neutrons, like CO would be problematic because C has 6 protons, O has 8. Wait, maybe W is carbon monoxide? No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's CH4? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe W is NH3? No, the protons and neutrons in each atom would have to be equal.

Wait, another approach: the molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. So, for example, if W is CO2, then each molecule would have (6+8)*2 = 28, but that's not the same as the count. Alternatively, perhaps W is a molecule where each atom has the same number of protons and neutrons. So like, carbon-12, which has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. So if W is CO, each molecule would have C (6p,6n) and O (8p, 8n?), but wait, O-16 has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So CO would have each atom with equal p and n. So CO could be a candidate. But earlier, when I thought of H2O, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps W is H2O. H has 1 proton (and 0 neutrons), O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So in H2O, each H has 1p, 0n, and O has 8p,8n. The total protons in the molecule would be 2+8=10. Neutrons would be 0+8=8. But that doesn't match. So that's not equal. So perhaps W is something else.

Wait, another possibility: W is CH4. Then, C has 6p and 6n (if it's C-12), H has 1p and 0n. So each CH4 molecule would have: total protons =6+4(1)=10; neutrons would be 6+4(0)=6. Not equal. Hmm.

Wait, what about W being CO2? Each CO2 molecule has C (6p,6n), O (8p,8n). So total protons: 6 + 2*8=22. Neutrons:6 + 2*8=22. Oh! Wait, 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So each molecule has equal number of protons and neutrons. So W is CO2. That makes sense. So gas W is CO2.

Wait, but the problem says that when X reacts with Y, it releases gas W. So maybe Y is water? Or maybe another liquid. Alternatively, Y could be something else.

Wait, let's think about the reaction. X reacts violently with Y, releasing CO2, and forming precipitate G. If X is a carbonate, maybe reacting with acid. Alternatively, if X is a metal carbonate reacting with acid.

Wait, but X is a substance that reacts violently with a liquid. Violent reactions could be metals with acids, or maybe something like a carbonate reacting with strong acid.

Wait, the product of a keto acid (like a carboxylic acid) reacting with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. Hmm. Carboxylic acids (keto acids) would typically react with something like a base or an acid? Wait, perhaps X is a base. For example, something that can deprotonate the acid.

Wait, if the product has 2 oxygen atoms, perhaps it's something like an ester. Wait, but the reaction product is between a keto acid and X. Wait, in the case of an acid and a base, perhaps it's a neutralization reaction, producing a carboxylate. But that would involve deprotonation. Alternatively, if X is something like LiAlH4 (a reducing agent), it might reduce the acid.

Wait, but let's think about the precipitate G. When X reacts with Y, it forms G, which upon heating gives B. B has a melting point close to 277 K. 277 K is about 4°C. What substance has a melting point near that? Hmm. Wait, maybe B is ammonium chloride? No, its melting point is higher. Or perhaps something else. Wait, another common substance with a low melting point around 4°C—wait, maybe something like NaOH? No, that's solid at room temp. Alternatively, perhaps B is a carbonate or bicarbonate.

Wait, another approach: B is the product when G is heated. So G could be a carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes into CO2 and a metal oxide. But then, the decomposition produces CO2, which aligns with the earlier part.

Wait, but let's think about the elements in X. The question mentions that X incorporates a heavier isotope. So perhaps X is a compound that includes an element with a common heavy isotope. Like chlorine (has Cl-35 and Cl-37), or maybe something like sulfur, which has multiple isotopes.

Wait, also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. So maybe it's something like THF (tetrahydrofuran), but no, that's more of a solvent. Or maybe it's a base like sodium hydride, but that's a reagent. Alternatively, X could be something like LiAlH4 (a strong reducing agent), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: If X is a heavy isotope-containing compound, perhaps it's something like D2O (deuterated water), but I'm not sure if that's a common reagent. Alternatively, perhaps X is NaOH·H2O (hydrated sodium hydroxide), but I'm not certain.

Wait, let's think again about the reaction:

X + Y → G (precipitate) + W (CO2 gas) → when G is heated, gives B.

So, perhaps X is a carbonate. For example, if Y is an acid, then X (carbonate) reacting with Y (acid) would produce CO2, water, and a precipitate. Wait, but if X is a carbonate and Y is an acid, the reaction would be:

Metal carbonate + acid → salt (precipitate?) + CO2 + H2O.

Wait, but if Y is a strong acid, like H2SO4, then the reaction would produce a salt. For example, CaCO3 + H2SO4 → CaSO4 (precipitate) + CO2↑ + H2O.

In that case, G would be CaSO4·2H2O (gypsum), which when heated (calcined) would decompose into CaSO4 (anhydrous) and water. Wait, but the product B would be CaSO4. But CaSO4's melting point is around 1450°C, which is way higher than 277 K (4°C). Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps B is another compound. Let me think about possible B.

Wait, the melting point of B is close to 277 K. 277 K is 4°C. So what substances melt around that temperature? Maybe something like ammonium nitrate? No, that's higher. Wait, perhaps something like ice? No, ice melts at 0°C. Another thought: maybe B is a carbonate. Wait, sodium carbonate has a melting point of around 850°C, which is much higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps B is ammonium chloride. Its melting point is around 334 K (61°C), which isn't close enough. Alternatively, maybe it's something else.

Wait, another approach: think about the elements in X. Since W is CO2, the reaction likely involves carbonate and acid. So if X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid, then the reaction produces CO2 and a salt. The salt (G) is a precipitate, which upon heating gives B.

Wait, but when a carbonate is heated, it typically decomposes into CO2, CO3, etc., but that's not right. Wait, no, heating carbonate might not do much unless it's a particular condition. Alternatively, perhaps G is a hydroxide, and when heated, it loses water. For example, heating copper hydroxide gives copper oxide and water.

Wait, but if G is a carbonate, heating might not change it. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a bicarbonate. Reacting with an acid could produce CO2 and a salt. Let's say X is sodium bicarbonate, Y is H2SO4; reaction would produce Na2SO4, CO2, and H2O. Then G is Na2SO4, which when heated doesn't change. But that doesn't fit with B being a different product.

Wait, perhaps X is a carbonate, and Y is water. But that doesn't make sense because X is reacting violently with a liquid, which would be more like an acid.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a strong base. Then X is an acid, and the reaction produces a precipitate. But that would require X to be something like a phosphate or another acid.

Wait, another angle: The product of a keto acid with X has 2 O atoms. So, if the keto acid is, say, acetic acid (CH3COOH), and X is something that reacts with it. Maybe X is a base, and the product is a salt with 2 O atoms. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe X is an alcohol. If a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol, it forms an ester. For example, acetic acid + ethanol → ethyl acetate. The product ethyl acetate has 2 O atoms (from the ester group -O-C-O-). So, in that case, X could be ethanol.

But then, what about the rest of the problem? Let's see.

If X is ethanol, reacting with a liquid Y. What would Y be? Maybe Y is a strong acid, like H2SO4
