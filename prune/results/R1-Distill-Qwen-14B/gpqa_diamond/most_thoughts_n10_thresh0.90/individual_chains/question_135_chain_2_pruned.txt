Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me take it step by step. 

The question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, wait, I'm a bit confused about the notation here. Maybe it's written as L = -λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f? Or perhaps it's something else. Hmm, maybe I should just focus on what the interaction is between the boson X and the fermions.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So, I need to find out which fermions it can decay into, considering the conservation laws and kinematics.

First, let's recall that for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of each fermion in the pair. Because energy and momentum must be conserved, the rest mass of the boson must equal the sum of the rest masses of the decay products (if the decay products are at rest). So, for each fermion pair, I'll need to check if 2*m_fermion ≤ m_X.

What fermions are available? Let's list the known fermions and their masses. The fermions include quarks (up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top), leptons (electron, muon, tau), and their corresponding anti-particles.

So, let's list approximate masses in GeV:

- Up quark (u): about 2 MeV (0.002 GeV)
- Down quark (d): ~4-5 MeV
- Strange quark (s): ~100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): ~173 GeV (way too heavy)
- Electron (e-): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ-): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ-): ~1.777 GeV

Wait, but wait. If X has a mass of 6 GeV, then for each fermion f, 2m_f must be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let me calculate 2m_f for each possible fermion pair:

- u quark: 2 * 0.002 ≈ 0.004 GeV → way below 6 → allowed
- d quark: 2 * 0.005 ≈ 0.01 GeV → allowed
- s quark: 2 * 0.1 → 0.2 GeV → allowed
- c quark: 2 * 1.5 = 3 GeV → allowed
- b quark: 2 * 4.5 = 9 GeV → 9 >6 → not allowed
- t quark: 2 *173 = 346 → way too big, not allowed

Leptons:

- e-: 2 * 0.0005=0.001 GeV → allowed
- μ-: 2 *0.105=0.21 GeV → allowed
- τ-: 2 *1.777≈3.554 GeV → allowed

So, the fermions that X can decay into would be those where 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

So, in terms of quarks:

u, d, s, c

But the problem is whether the Lagrangian allows these interactions. Wait, the given Lagrangian is L = -λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Hmm, wait, that might be a typo. Maybe the interaction term is something like L = -λ X ψ_f ψ_f, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the term is L = -λ X ψ_f ψ_f, which would imply that X couples to fermion-antifermion pairs.

Wait, the given Lagrangian is written as \mathcal{L}(y) = -λ f \bar{\psi}_f (y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe the interaction is L = -λ X (ψ_f ψ_f), because the term (ῡ + X) is acting as a mass term perhaps. Wait, maybe the interaction is of the form X ψ_f ψ_f, so X is a scalar (boson) that couples to the product of a fermion and its own anti-fermion (so a mass-like term). So, the interaction would allow X to decay into ψ_f and ψ_f̄. Or wait, perhaps it's a Yukawa coupling where X is a scalar coupling to the fermion.

Wait, perhaps the interaction is that the boson X couples to the fermion in a Yukawa fashion. So, the interaction term would be something like L_int = -λ X ψ_f ψ_f.

Wait, but the given expression is L = -λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Hmm, maybe the expression is L = -λ ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Wait, perhaps the term is a mass term where the fermion mass comes from the Higgs VEV (ῡ) plus the X field. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating
