Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

So, the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet, both similar to Neptune in mass. Both planets are in circular orbits. The detection method is the radial velocity (RV) method, which I remember looks at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravity making the star wobble.

The question is about the orbital periods of the two planets. Planet #1 caused a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's shift is 7 milliangstroms. We need to find how many times longer Planet #2's period is compared to Planet #1's.

Wait, the RV method measures the velocity of the star towards and away from us. The amplitude of this velocity is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I vaguely recall is something like the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (P/(2π)) * (1/(a(1 - e²)^0.5)), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero. So maybe it simplifies.

Wait, actually, the RV formula is K = (v) = (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^0.5 * (1 - e²)^0.5 * (2π/P)^0.5 )) )^(1/3) )? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the relation between the velocity shift and the orbital period.

I think the key is that the RV shift depends on the velocity of the star in its orbit. The star's velocity is given by v = (2π G M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^0.5 * P^(1/3) ) ). But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune vs Sun-like star), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So M_p is about the same for both planets (Neptune mass), so maybe that can be ignored. 

Wait, but the problem says both planets have masses similar to Neptune. So M_p is the same for both. And the stars are
