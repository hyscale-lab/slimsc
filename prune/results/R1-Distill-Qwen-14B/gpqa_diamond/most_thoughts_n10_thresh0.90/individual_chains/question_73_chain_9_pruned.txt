Okay, so I've got this physics problem about astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical addition. Right, I think I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula for the relative speed.

Wait, the problem says the two astronauts are moving in the positive x-direction. So, does that mean they're moving in the same direction or opposite? Oh, the problem states both are moving in the positive x-direction, so their velocities are in the same direction. But wait, how do I calculate the relative speed between them when they're moving in the same direction?

Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity. It's (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²), where u and v are the velocities of the two objects relative to the same frame. But wait, in this case, each astronaut is moving at a different speed, so I need to find the relative speed of one with respect to the other. Let me think: if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So the relative speed of A as seen from B's frame would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

Calculating numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c.
Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.
So relative velocity is 0.1c / 0.7 = approximately 0.1428c. Hmm, that's about 0.14c. So looking at the options, I see options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c, which matches this calculation. So that's probably the relative speed.

Now for the total energy. Each astronaut has relativistic mass, so their energies are given by gamma * m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. The masses are 2m and 3m, but wait, wait. Wait, I think I might be getting confused here. Because in relativity, mass increases with velocity. So the rest mass is m, and the relativistic mass is gamma * m. But when the problem says their masses are 2m and 3m, does that mean their rest masses or their relativistic masses?

Wait, the problem states, "Two astronauts of masses 2m and 3m..." So I think here, in the problem, the rest masses are 2m and 3m. Because usually, when we talk about mass in relativity, it's the rest mass. So their rest energies are 2m c² and 3m c². But wait, their kinetic energy would be (gamma - 1) m c². But the question is about the total energy of the system, which includes both their rest mass energies and their kinetic energies.

Wait, no, wait. The total energy would be the sum of their individual energies. So each astronaut's total energy is gamma * m_i c², where m_i is their rest mass. So for the first astronaut, mass 2m, moving at 0.6c: gamma1 is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = gamma1 * (2m) c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma2 is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² = 3.464 m c².

So total energy E_total = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc^2, and option D says E=5 mc². So option C's E matches this. The relative speed we found was approximately 0.14c, which is in both C and D. So the correct option is C, since it has both v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc².

Wait, let me double-check the relative velocity calculation. Oh wait, the two astronauts are moving in the same direction. So the
