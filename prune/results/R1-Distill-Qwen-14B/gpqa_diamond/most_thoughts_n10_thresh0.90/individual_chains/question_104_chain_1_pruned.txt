Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I need to figure out how much longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1. Let me try to break this down.

Alright, the question says that both stars have the same mass, similar to the Sun, and each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. The RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull.

So, the key here is understanding how the Doppler shift relates to the orbital period. Oh wait, I remember that the RV method detects the star's wobble. The shift in the spectral lines is proportional to the star's velocity towards or away from us.

Wait, but how does the velocity relate to the orbital period? Oh right, the star and planet orbit their common center of mass. The star's velocity (v) is related to the planet's orbital period. But since both stars have the same mass, the velocity of the star should depend on the mass of the planet and the orbital distance.

Wait, but in this case, both planets have similar masses to Neptune, so the mass ratio between the planet and star is the same for both systems. So the velocity of the star (v) should be the same for both planets, right? Or wait, no. Because the question says the Doppler shifts are different. One is 5 milliangstrom, the other 7.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The RV method measures the star's velocity. So the velocity semi-amplitude K is what we measure. The formula for K is something like K = (v) which depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital distance and period.

Wait, remember the formula: K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ) * ( (1) / ( ( (P) * (1 day) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(2/3) ) )

But wait, since M_p is much less than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So the formula simplifies. Let me think. The simplified formula for K is:

K = ( (2πG) / (c P) )^(1/
