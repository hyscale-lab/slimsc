Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. But let's take it step by step.

So the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, and the radial velocities are different: Star_1 has 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. The question is about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

The options given are A to D, with numbers around 2.2 to 2.35. Hmm, so the factor is somewhere in that range.

Wait, the problem says to assume the stars radiate as black bodies. I remember that the luminosity of a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So to find the luminosity ratio, I need to find (L1)/(L2) = (R1² T1⁴)/(R2² T2⁴).

But wait, I don't know the temperatures directly. Hmm. The peak wavelength is the same for both stars. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K). So if λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same. Because T = b / λ_max. Wait, but wait a second, that can't be right. Because if their peak wavelengths are the same, then their temperatures are the same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait again. Because the problem says that through spectroscopy, the astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. Oh, so λ_max is same for both. So that implies T1 = T2, because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So if λ_max is same, T must be same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but that seems a bit odd. Because if their temperatures are the same, then the luminosity would be based on radius only. But the problem mentions that the radial velocities are different. Hmm, wait, but radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift. Oh, right, this is probably about the Doppler effect. So the observed wavelength (what we measure) might be different from the emitted wavelength. But the problem says that the peak wavelengths are the same. Oh wait, no, the problem says that the peak at which they appear brightest is the same. But the actual emitted wavelength depends on their temperature, but the observed wavelength (due to radial velocity) could be different.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let's clarify. The problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So when observed, their λ_max is the same. But the actual emitted λ_max depends on their temperature. However, if a star is moving towards or away from us (due to radial velocity), there's a Doppler shift in the wavelengths. So the observed λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. Wait, but wait, I should be careful with the direction. If the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), and if moving towards us, shorter (blueshifted).

But the problem states that the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So for Star_1, v_r is 0, so no Doppler shift. So λ_max1_observed = λ_max1_emitted. For Star_2, v_r is 700 km/s. So λ_max2_observed = λ_max2_emitted * (1 + (v_r2 / c)). But according to the problem, λ_max1_obs = λ_max2_obs. So λ_max1 = λ_max2 * (1 + (v_r2/c)).

Wait, but λ_max is given by Wien's law as λ_max = b / T. So if the stars' temperatures are different, then their emitted λ_max would differ. But the observed λ_max for both is same because of the Doppler shift on Star_2.

So, let's write this out:

Star_1: v_r1 = 0, so observed λ_max1 = λ_max1_emitted = b / T1.

Star_2: v_r2 = 700 km/s. Observed λ_max2 = λ_max2_emitted * (1 + v_r2 / c) = (b / T2) * (1 + 700e3 / c).

But we're told that observed λ_max1 equals observed λ_max2.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + 700e3 / c).

We can cancel b from both sides:

1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * (1 + 700e3 / c).

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + 700e3 / c).

Wait, is that correct? Let me think again.

Wait, Star_2's observed λ_max is (λ_max2_emit) * (1 + v_r2 / c). Because when moving away, the wavelength is stretched. So:

λ_max2_obs = λ_max2_emit * (1 + v_r2 / c).

But λ
