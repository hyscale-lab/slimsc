Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I'm a bit new to the subject, but let me try to think it through. The question is about which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences or infinities that pop up in calculations. Without regularization, these infinities can make the theory non-predictive. So the idea is that some theories might not need this because they're already finite or have some built-in way to handle these issues.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a bit different because it's a theory of everything, trying to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity. Strings vibrate at different frequencies, and these correspond to different particles. I remember that string theory is supposed to be finite, meaning it doesn't have the same divergences as other quantum field theories. So maybe it doesn't require regularization. But wait, I'm not entirely sure if that's the case. Do string theories require any form of regularization? I think when they calculate loop diagrams, they might still have divergences, but perhaps string theory handles them differently, like through the concept of the string tension or other mechanisms. So maybe they don't need regularization as in other QFTs.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD has something called asymptotic freedom, where quarks behave as nearly free particles at high energies (or short distances). But when it comes to regularization, I think QCD calculations, especially in perturbation theory, do involve divergences. So they must use regularization methods like dimensional regularization or lattice regularization. So QCD does require regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I know that even though it's a well-behaved theory, it still has issues with divergences, like in calculating the electron self-energy or the photon propagator. Renormalization is a process used in QED where you absorb these infinities into counterterms. But renormalization often goes hand in hand with regularization. So yes, QED does require regularization techniques like cutoff regularization or the more sophisticated methods.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, this is the classical version, not the quantum one. Classical theories don't involve the same kind of divergences because they don't deal with the same mathematical structures as quantum field theories. In classical electromagnetism, even though you might have things like infinite charge densities at point charges, these are handled differently. But wait, do the Maxwell equations require regularization? I don't think so. In classical theory, you don't have the same loop integrals leading to infinities that necessitate regularization. So maybe classical electrodynamics doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory. 

Wait, but the question is about which theory "never requires regularization" at high energies. So the options are quantum theories except for option D, which is classical. Since regularization is a quantum field theory technique, option D wouldn't use it. So the answer might be D.

But wait, the question
