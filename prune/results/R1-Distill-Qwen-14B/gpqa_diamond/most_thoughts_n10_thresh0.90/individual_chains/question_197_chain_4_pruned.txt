Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem is about identifying a final product after a reaction. The starting material is Compound X, which has given IR and NMR data. The reaction conditions are with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus with HI is typically used for the hydrolysis of an ester. Oh wait, no, wait. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines, right? Or maybe it's for eliminating a leaving group... Wait, no, another thought: I think when you have a nitrile and treat it with red phosphorus and HI, it converts the nitrile into an amine. Because the nitrile group (RC≡N) reacts with red phosphorus and HI to form RCH2NH2. Wait, but sometimes it can also lead to iminophosphorane intermediates. So, perhaps the reaction is converting a nitrile to an amine, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

But wait, the problem says Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. So first, I need to figure out what Compound X is. The question gives the IR and NMR data of Compound X.

Looking at the IR data: peaks at 3400-2500 cm^-1, which is a broad region, likely due to O-H or N-H stretching. Oh, but wait, that's a broad peak, so maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe an amine? But other peaks are at 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm^-1. 

The 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But the 1610 and 1450 cm^-1 are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So maybe the compound has an aromatic ring with substituents.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data of Compound X:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. Could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm and can be a triplet or something else. Alternatively, maybe an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the proton would be a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. But wait, the IR didn't show a strong peak around 2500-3000 cm^-1 which is typical for O-H in a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde.

Wait, but the IR has a peak at 1720 cm^-1 which could be a ketone or an ester. Wait, a carboxylic acid would have a broad O-H peak, but the IR data given doesn't mention such a peak. Wait, no, the IR says 3400–2500 cm^-1, which is a broad region, which might
