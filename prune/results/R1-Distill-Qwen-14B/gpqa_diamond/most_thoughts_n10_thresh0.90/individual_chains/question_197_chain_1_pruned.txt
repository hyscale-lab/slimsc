Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the options given. The data provided includes IR and 1H NMR spectra.

First, I should analyze the IR and NMR data to figure out what Compound X is. Once I know that, I can determine what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Starting with the IR data:
- 3400â€“2500 cm-1: This broad region usually indicates O-H stretching. But wait, sometimes it can also be N-H or maybe even an alkyne. But looking at the other peaks, maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. The 3400 region could be O-H or N-H. But I'll look at the other peaks for more clues.
- 1720 cm-1: This is a strong peak, often indicative of a carbonyl group. So maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would show up in the IR in the 3000-2500 region because it's a broad peak. But wait, the 1720 is a bit lower than a typical carboxylic acid carbonyl which is usually around 1700 cm-1, but it can vary. Alternatively, ester carbonyls are around 1720-1740. So maybe an ester or a ketone? Hmm, wait, but let's also think about the NMR data.

Looking at the NMR:
1H NMR:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A singlet around 10.5 ppm. That's very high. Common regions for protons: aldehyde protons are around 9-10 ppm as a triplet or something. But an aldehyde would be a triplet if adjacent to CH2. Wait, but this is a singlet. Another possibility is an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid. The proton would be a broad singlet, which matches. So maybe the compound has a carboxylic acid group. But wait, if the IR shows a peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl. So if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is at 1720. Alternatively, if it's an ester, maybe, but then the O-H would be at around 10.5.

Wait, but if the IR has a peak at 1720, and the NMR has a singlet at 10.5, that makes sense for a carboxylic acid. So, perhaps the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking at the other NMR signals:
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This is in the aromatic region. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring H. So maybe a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, the two H's on one substituent are equivalent and each couple with the adjacent H, leading to a doublet. Wait, but for a para-substituted benzene, each proton would have two neighbors, but in some cases, like when there's a substituent that deshields them, perhaps it could be a doublet. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a substituent with two H's, like a CH2 group attached to the ring.

Wait, perhaps the aromatic region tells me about substitution. Let me think. If the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, and each is a doublet with 2H each, that suggests that the ring has two substituents in the para positions, each with two H's. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is at para, and another is somewhere else.

Wait, maybe the structure is a para-substituted benzene with another substituent. Like, perhaps, a substituent at the para position which has two H's. Or perhaps a substituent that's a group with two H's attached to the ring.

Alternatively, looking at the 1H NMR, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 (m,2H), 1.4 (d,3H), 0.9 (t,3H). Hmm. Let's think about these.

The 1.4 ppm doublet (d,3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH that's split into a doublet. That's typical of an isopropyl group. Wait, the isopropyl group is CH(CH3)2. So, the methyl attached to the CH would show as a doublet at around 1.4 ppm. So maybe a CH2CH(CH3) group.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a multiplet, perhaps a CH adjacent to another CH2. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be a CH2 group near the CH.

Putting this together: perhaps a substituent on the benzene ring that's a chain like CH2CH(CH2CH3) or something similar.

Wait, wait. Let me think of possible structures. The NMR has a singlet at 10.5, which I thought might be a carboxylic acid. But wait, another thought: if the compound is an aldehyde, the proton would be a triplet around 9-10 ppm, but here it's a singlet. Alternatively, maybe an acidic proton like a phenol? But phenol's O-H is broad, but around 5 ppm usually, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester, but I don't see the ester O-H in the NMR; esters don't have O-H protons because the O is connected to two R groups. So that might not fit. So more likely, the 10.5 is a carboxylic acid's -OH.

So, if we have a benzoic acid derivative, perhaps the substituent is an alkyl group on the benzene ring. Let's see the rest of the NMR.

Looking at the aromatic protons: 8.0 (d,2H) and 7.2 (d,2H). So, in a para-substituted benzene, the substituent would cause the ring protons to split into two doublets. For example, in p-methylbenzoic acid, the two protons ortho to the substituent would be at a higher ppm, and the two meta would be lower. Wait, but in p-methylbenzoic acid, the ring would have two H's next to the substituent (the COOH group) and two H's opposite. The substituent is in the para position.

Wait, but in that case, the two H's adjacent (ortho) to the substituent would be deshielded and appear at higher ppm. So the 8.0 ppm could be those, and 7.2 the other two. So that fits.

So, the benzene ring is para-substituted with a group. The substituent is the carboxylic acid group. But wait, the substituent in para might not be the COOH. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ethyl group or something else. Let me think.

Wait, but the IR also shows a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1. These are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So that supports the presence of a benzene ring.

Putting it all together, perhaps the structure is something like 4-(something)benzoic acid.

Now, looking at the NMR for the substituent. The substituent on the benzene ring is likely a group with a chain.

Looking at the NMR shifts:

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): This is a CH group adjacent to other CH groups. Maybe a CH2CH2 group.

- 1.7 ppm (m,2H): Probably a CH2 adjacent to another CH2.

- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): This is a methyl group attached to a CH, like in an isopropyl group.

- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): A terminal methyl group, like in an ethyl chain.

Putting this together: the substituent on the benzene ring is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group? Or perhaps a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group. Let me think. An isobutyl group has a structure like CH2CH(CH2CH3). The NMR would show a triplet for the CH3 at the end (0.9 ppm, t, 3H), a quartet (if attached to the CH), but looking at the data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (d,3H), which would make sense for a CH(CH3)2 group.

Wait, maybe it's a sec-butyl group. A sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3) but attached at the secondary carbon. So the structure would be CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-.

Wait, let me try to map the NMR:

The 1.4 ppm, d, 3H: this is a methyl group attached to a CH group that's split into a doublet. So perhaps a (CH2) group connected to a CH(CH3)2.

Wait, the CH(CH3)2 would have the central CH showing up as a septet if connected to two CH3 groups, but here we have a triplet or something else. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propan-2-yl group (isopropyl), but that would be just two CH3 groups attached to a CH.

Wait, in the NMR, the 1.4 is a d (doublet) of 3H. That suggests that the methyl is attached to a CH group which is split into a doublet. So if the structure is CH(CH3)2, the CH would be connected to two CH3 groups, so the protons on that CH would be split into a septet. But in this case, it's a doublet, so maybe the CH is connected to only one CH3 group, and another group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a CH2 group next to the benzene. So for example, the substituent is benzene-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2 or something else.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H; that could be a CH group next to a CH2.

So perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH2 group attached to the benzene. Let me think about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH2CH2 group, but that's not matching the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an isopropyl group attached to a CH2 group attached to the benzene. So, benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)2. Then, the CH2 would cause the neighboring CH to split.

Wait, let's think about the substituent.

If the structure is benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking again at the NMR:

- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): This is a methyl group attached to a CH, which is split into a doublet. So perhaps it's a CH(CH3) group attached to another CH2.

The 2.9 ppm (m,1H): That's a CH group, perhaps connected to a CH2 or another CH.

The 1.7 ppm (m,2H): a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 or CH.

0.9 ppm (t,3H): terminal methyl, like in an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with branching. Maybe it's a sec-butyl group.

Wait, a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). The structure would be: benzene ring attached to CH2, which is attached to CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, but let me think about the NMR of a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene.

The CH2 attached to the benzene would have two H's. Then, the next CH (the one attached to the ethyl group) would have two
