Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies. The question is asking about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in the qubit space. The matrix provided is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). And the options are different points in 3D space labeled A to D.

Wait, I remember that a qubit density matrix can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. For a pure state |ψ>, the density matrix is |ψ><ψ|, and it's located at some point on the unit sphere. But here, ρ isn't a pure state because it's a mixed state. Let me see, the given ρ has two terms each with |0> and |1> in their outer products. So each term is a projector, and the density matrix is their average.

Oh right! The density matrix ρ = (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2 is a completely mixed state. Because it's a maximally mixed state, it's the maximally uncertain state. So in Bloch sphere terms, the mixed state is at the origin, because any direction is equally probable. Wait, wait, how does that work?

The Bloch vector for a density matrix ρ is given by (x, y, z) where x = Tr(ρ X), y = Tr(ρ Y), z = Tr(ρ Z), with X, Y, Z being the Pauli matrices. Let me compute each component.

The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and Z is [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So, ρ is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1| ). Expanding that, |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]] and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them, we get [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then ρ is (1/2) * I, so ρ = (1/2) I.

Now, let's compute the expectation values for X, Y, Z.

Tr(ρ X) = Tr( (1/2 I) X ) = (1/2) Tr(I X) = (1/2) Tr(X). Now, the trace of X is 0 since the diagonals are 0 and 0. Similarly for Y and Z. Because Tr(X) is 0, Tr(Y) is 0, and Tr(Z) is 0.

Wait, let me double-check. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements. X has 0s on the diagonal, so Tr(X)=0. Same for Y: the diagonal entries are 0 and 0. Z has 1 and -1, so Tr(Z) is 0 as well. So all three components x, y, z are zero. Therefore, the Bloch vector is (0, 0, 0), which is the origin.

So the geometrical position is (0,0,0), which corresponds to option C. 

Wait, but the options given are A: (1,1,0), B: (0,0,1), C: (0,0,0), D: (1,1,1). So the correct answer is option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state, which corresponds to the origin on the Bloch sphere. To confirm this, the Bloch vector components are calculated using the expectation values of the Pauli matrices \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\). The density matrix \(\rho\) is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{2} I\), where \(I\) is the identity matrix. 

- The trace of \(\rho X\) is zero because the trace of \(X\) is zero.
- Similarly, the traces of \(\rho Y\) and \(\rho Z\) are also zero because the traces of \(Y\) and \(Z\) are zero.

Thus, the Bloch vector is \((0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to the origin in qubit space. This matches option C.

Answer: C
