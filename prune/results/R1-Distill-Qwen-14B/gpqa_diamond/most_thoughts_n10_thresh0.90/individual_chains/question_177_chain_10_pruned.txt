Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question involves the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and the same goes for their masses. Both stars appear brightest at the same wavelength, which probably means they have the same temperature since black body radiation peaks at a wavelength inversely proportional to temperature. Oh wait, the black body radiation peak wavelength equation is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. Since their lambda_max are the same, their temperatures must be the same.

Wait, but wait a minute—do I really need to think about the radial velocities here? Because the problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2. But how does that relate to luminosity? Hmm, perhaps it's a red herring or maybe it's part of the reasoning. Alternatively, maybe it's about Doppler shift affecting the observed wavelengths but not the emitted ones. Since the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same, that would imply that the emitted wavelengths are the same, which would mean their temperatures are the same regardless of any Doppler shifts. Because if Star_2 is moving towards or away from us, its observed wavelength would shift, but the problem says the observed wavelengths are the same. So regardless of their velocities, their actual emission peaks are same. So maybe the velocities don't directly affect the temperature calculation here. So perhaps I can ignore the velocities for the luminosity calculation.

So, moving on. The question is about comparing their luminosities. The luminosity of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. So L is proportional to R squared multiplied by the temperature to the fourth power.

We know that R1 is 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. Since their temperatures are the same, T1 = T2. So the ratio of L1 to L2 would be (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴). Since T1 = T2, the T terms are 1. So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So you'd think the answer is A) ~2.25.

Wait, but wait again. The problem says that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor. So the ratio L1/L2 is 2.25, which is option A.

But wait, why are the options including other numbers like ~2.32 or ~2.23? Did I miss something? Maybe I'm supposed to consider the Doppler effect from the velocities? Because the stars are moving, could that affect the observed luminosity or temperature?

Wait, but the problem states that the stars radiate as black bodies, and the astronomers computed their luminosities. So I think the velocities might not affect the calculation of luminosity based on their actual parameters. Because the observed wavelengths might be affected by Doppler shift, but since the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same, that implies that the intrinsic temperatures are the same. So the observed wavelength is lambda_observed = lambda_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) } or something similar, but that's relativistic and for non-relativistic velocities, we can approximate it. However, if the apparent lambda_max is the same for both, then their intrinsic lambda_emitted must be the same because the shifts would be different if their velocities were different. But wait, Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so its lambda_emitted is lambda. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, which is a large velocity. Let's see.

Wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed wavelengths are the same. So if Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s, perhaps towards us, it would have a blueshift, making its observed lambda shorter than its emitted lambda. But Star_1 isn't moving, so its observed lambda is the same as emitted. So in order for both to have their observed lambda_max the same, Star_2 must have a higher emitted lambda (i.e., lower temperature) but shifted to match Star_1's observed lambda. Wait, that complicates things.

Wait, let me think again. Let's say Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s. So the light is blueshifted. Suppose Star_2's emitted lambda is lambda2, but due to the velocity v, the observed lambda would be lambda2 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ), where beta is v/c. But since
