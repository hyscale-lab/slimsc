Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about the density matrix of a qubit. The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I need to determine its geometrical position in the qubits space from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. For a qubit, the state can be represented as a point in a 3-dimensional space using the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation where pure states lie on the surface and mixed states are inside.

Wait, so the general form of a qubit density matrix is ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ| when it's a pure state. But in this case, the given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. That looks like a mixed state because it's a statistical mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩.

Let me write out the matrix form of this ρ. The |0⟩ and |1⟩ are the standard basis states. So |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix with 1 at (1,1) and 0 elsewhere, and similarly |1⟩⟨1| is a matrix with 1 at (2,2) and 0s elsewhere. Adding them and dividing by 2 gives a diagonal matrix with 1/2 in both diagonal elements.

So ρ is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. I think this is the maximally mixed state for a qubit. It represents a classical mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩, meaning the qubit is in a completely mixed state, with equal probability for both states.

Now, how does this correspond to the Bloch sphere representation? On the Bloch sphere, the state is represented as (x,y,z), where x, y, z correspond to the components of the qubit state. For a pure state |ψ⟩ = cos(θ/2)|0⟩ + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|1⟩, the Bloch vector is (x, y, z) = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ).

But wait, for a mixed state, the density matrix can be written as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector. Let me check that.

The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. The Pauli matrices are σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So r·σ would be r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz.

So the general form when ρ is a mixed state is:

ρ = (I + r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz) / 2.

Comparing that with our given ρ matrix:

Our ρ is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

Let me compute (I + r·σ)/2:

I is [[1, 0],[0,1]], so (I)/2 is [[0.5,0],[0,0.5]]. Now, adding the other terms:

r·σ would contribute r_x σx/2 + r_y σy/2 + r_z σz/2.

So the entire ρ would be:

[ [0.5 + (r_z)/2 , (r_x - i r_y)/2 ],
  [ (r_x + i r_y)/2 , 0.5 - (r_z)/2 ] ].

Wait, because σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so when multiplied by r_z and added to I, it contributes (1 + r_z)/2 for the (1,1) element and (1 - r_z)/2 for the (2,2) element. Wait, no, let me recalculate:

Wait, no. The full expression is (I + r·σ)/2. So each term is (1/2) times the matrices.

So,

I/2 = [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]

r·σ /2 = (r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz)/2.

Each Pauli matrix multiplied by r_i and divided by 2.

So σx/2 is [[0, 0.5], [0.5, 0]]. So when multiplied by r_x, it becomes [[0, 0.5 r_x], [0.5 r_x, 0 ] ].

Similarly, σy/2 is [[0, -i 0.5], [i 0.5, 0]], so when multiplied by r_y, it becomes [[0, -i 0.5 r_y], [i 0.5 r_y, 0 ] ].

σz/2 is [[0.5, 0], [0, -0.5 ]], so when multiplied by r_z, it becomes [[0.5 r_z, 0], [0, -0.5 r_z ]].

Adding all these together:

The (1,1) element is 0.5 (from I/2) + 0.5 r_z (from σz/2 * r_z) = 0.5(1 + r_z).

Wait, no. Because I/2 is 0.5 in (1,1) and (2,2), and σz/2 is adding 0.5 r_z to (1,1) and -0.5 r_z to (2,2). So the (1,1) element is 0.5 + (r_z * 0.5), and (2,2) is 0.5 - (r_z * 0.5).

The (1,2) element comes from σx and σy terms. Let me compute that.

The σx part contributes (0.5 r_x) in the top right and same in the bottom left (since σx is symmetric). Similarly, the σy part contributes (-i 0.5 r_y) in the top right and (i 0.5 r_y) in the bottom left.

So the (1,2) element is (0.5 r_x) + (-i 0.5 r_y) = (0.5)(r_x - i r_y).

Similarly, the (2,1) element is (0.5 r_x) + (i 0.5 r_y) = (0.5)(r_x + i r_y).

Putting this all together, the density matrix ρ is:

[ [0.5(1 + r_z), 0.5(r_x - i r_y) ],
  [0.5(r_x + i r_y), 0.5(1 - r_z) ] ]

Now, comparing this to our given ρ matrix:

Given ρ is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

So the (1,1) and (2,2) elements are 0.5, so:

0.5 (1 + r_z) = 0.5 → 1 + r_z =1 → r_z=0.

Similarly, 0.5 (1 - r_z) =0.5 → same result.

The off-diagonal terms are 0, so 0.5 (r_x - i r_y) =0 and 0.5 (r_x + i r_y) =0.

Which implies that r_x =0 and r_y=0.

So our Bloch vector r is (0,0,0), since r_x=0, r_y=0, r_z=0.

Wait, but wait. The Bloch vector is (x,y,z). So in this case, r would be (0,0,0), which is the origin.

So the geometrical position is the origin in the 3D space. So looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0).

Option B is (0,0,1), which would be the north pole of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to |0⟩ state. But our state is a mixed state, so it's at the origin.

Wait, but wait a second. The maximally mixed state is indeed the completely depolarized state, which in the Bloch sphere is at the origin, because any direction has equal probability. So yeah, that makes sense.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a qubit, as it is an equal mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix of a qubit can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector that determines the position of the state in the 3D qubit space.

For the given \(\rho\), the matrix form is 

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix}
0.5 & 0 \\
0 & 0.5
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this to the general form \(\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2}\), we find:

1. The diagonal elements of \(\rho\) are \(0.5(1 + r_z)\) and \(0.5(1 - r_z)\). Setting these equal to \(0.5\), we solve \(1 + r_z = 1\) and \(1 - r_z = 1\), which gives \(r_z = 0\).
2. The off-diagonal elements of \(\rho\) are \(0.5(r_x - i r_y)\) and \(0.5(r_x + i r_y)\). Setting these equal to \(0\), we solve \(r_x = 0\) and \(r_y = 0\).

Thus, the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), which corresponds to the origin in the 3D qubit space. This is consistent with the maximally mixed state, which lies at the center of the Bloch sphere.

From the given options:

- **A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the origin.
- **B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to the \(|0\rangle\) pure state at the north pole.
- **C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\):** Correct, as this is the origin, representing the maximally mixed state.
- **D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the origin.

The correct answer is **C**, as the maximally mixed state lies at the origin in the qubit space.

Answer: C
