Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about particle physics, specifically the decay modes of a boson. Let's see what I can remember.

The problem says the interaction Lagrangian is given by L(y) = -λf ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, that looks a bit confusing. Oh wait, I think it's written as L = -λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Wait, maybe it's something else. Oh wait, perhaps it's a Yukawa coupling term. So the boson X is interacting with fermions via a term like ψ_f X ψ_f, which would imply that the boson X can decay into two fermions of the same type, like fermion-antifermion pairs.

So the question is about the possible decay channels of the boson X. The mass of X is 6 GeV. I need to figure out which fermion pairs are kinematically allowed.

First, I need to remember the masses of the known fermions. Let's list them:

- Electron (e-): very light, about 0.0005 GeV.
- Muon (μ-): ~0.1 GeV.
- Tau (τ-): ~1.78 GeV.
- Up quark (u): around 2.2 MeV (so ~0.002 GeV).
- Down quark (d): ~4.7 MeV (~0.0047 GeV).
- Strange (s): ~95 MeV (~0.095 GeV).
- Charm (c): ~1.28 GeV.
- Bottom (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV (depending on source).
- Top (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV.

Wait, the boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. So when it decays into two fermions, the sum of their rest masses must be less than 6 GeV. But for fermions, each in the pair, their rest mass would be twice the single mass (since it's a particle and antiparticle pair). So 2m_fermion < m_X.

So let's check each fermion:

1. e+ e-: each e- is ~0.0005 GeV. 2 * 0.0005 = 0.001 GeV << 6 GeV. So yes, allowed.

2. μ+ μ-: 2 * 0.1 GeV = 0.2 GeV < 6. Allowed.

3. τ+ τ-: 2 * 1.78 = 3.56 GeV <6. Allowed.

4. u u_bar: 2 * 0.002 = 0.004 GeV. Allowed.

5. d d_bar: 2 * 0.0047 ≈ 0.0094 GeV. Allowed.

6. s s_bar: 2 * 0.095 = 0.19 GeV. Allowed.

7. c c_bar: 2 *1.28 = 2.56 GeV <6. Allowed.

8. b b_bar: 2 *4.1 ≈8.2 GeV. Oh wait, 8.2 is bigger than 6. So 8.2 >6, so this decay would not be allowed. So X cannot decay into b b_bar.

9. t t_bar: 2 *173 GeV >>6 GeV. So no way.

So the allowed fermions are e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c. So for the decay channels, X can decay into any of these fermion pairs except for b and t.

Wait the options are given. Let's look at the options:

Option A) X → b bbar etc. No, because b is too heavy.

Option B) Includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Wait, let me see. Option B: c cbar, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's all except b and t. But wait, does it include top? No, because top is way too heavy. So in the options, the correct decay modes would include all except for those with m_fermion > 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait, the boson X's mass is 6 GeV. Each fermion in the pair must have m_f < 3 GeV. Because 2m_f <6 GeV. So m_f <3 GeV.

So let's see the fermion masses again:

- e, mu, tau: m <3 GeV.

Wait, tau is about 1.78 GeV, which is less than 3. So allowed.

Charm is about 1.28 GeV: allowed.

What about bottom? 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3. So 2*4.5=9 GeV >6 GeV. So b is not allowed.

So the possible decay channels are into any fermion pair where each fermion has mass less than 3 GeV. So that includes e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

So looking at the options:

Option A) Includes b and s, etc. But since b is excluded, A is wrong.

Option B) Includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So missing b and t, which is correct.

Option C) Includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e, but adds t and b. Wait, no. Option C lists c, s, u, d, t, tau... Wait no, let me check. Option C says X→ c cbar, sbar, u, d, t tbar, tau, mu, e. But t is way too heavy, so t is not allowed. So option C is incorrect.

Option D) Includes b, which is not allowed.

So the correct option is B.

Wait, let me make sure. So the allowed are all the fermions except those with m_f >3 GeV. Which fermions are those? b, t, and maybe others?

Wait, what about the top quark? It's way heavier, so even more so. But the other quarks are up, down, strange, charm, bottom. So bottom is excluded.

So the allowed fermion pairs are:

e+, e-,

mu+, mu-,

tau+, tau-,

u and anti-u,

d and anti-d,

s and anti-s,

c and anti-c.

So the decay modes are X → e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-, uū, dđ, sī, and c c̄.

Looking at the options, option B includes all of these except for b and t. Option B is:

B) X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's exactly the list.

So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decay modes of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. The boson \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, and the decay is allowed if the total rest mass of the fermion pair is less than the mass of \( X \). This means \( 2m_f < 6 \, \text{GeV} \), or equivalently, \( m_f < 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

The rest masses of the fermions are as follows:
- Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( \sim 0.002 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( \sim 0.0047 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( \sim 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.28 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.1 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

From these, the fermions with \( m_f < 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are \( e, \mu, \tau, u, d, s, c \). Therefore, the allowed decay modes of \( X \) are:
\[
X \rightarrow e^+ e^-, \, \mu^+ \mu^-, \, \tau^+ \tau^-, \, u \bar{u}, \, d \bar{d}, \, s \bar{s}, \, c \bar{c}.
\]

The decay modes into \( b \bar{b} \) and \( t \bar{t} \) are not allowed because their rest masses exceed 3 GeV, violating the kinematic condition \( 2m_f < 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Lists \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), which matches the allowed decay modes. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**.

Answer: B
