Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read through it again to make sure I understand everything.

The question talks about Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Another clue is that the product of a keto acid reacting with X has 2 oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it's similar to another substance. We need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down into parts.

First, let's think about the reaction between X and Y. Violent reaction suggests something reactive, maybe an acid-base reaction or a redox reaction. The product includes gas W, which has equal protons and neutrons. Oh wait, if a molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons, that's interesting. Let's think about possible gases. For example, H2O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons? No, wait. H2O has H (1 proton each, 0 neutrons) and O (8 protons, 8 neutrons? Wait, oxygen has 8 protons, and a common isotope is O-16, which has 8 neutrons. So H2O has 2 H (each with 1p, 0n) and one O (8p, 8n). So total in the molecule: protons would be 2 +8=10, neutrons would be 0 +8=8. Oh, but the question says the gas has same number of protons and neutrons in its molecule. So 10 protons and 8 neutrons doesn't match. Hmm.

Wait, maybe another gas. What about CO2? Carbon has 6 protons, oxygen has 8. CO2 has one C (6p, 6n typically) and two O (each 8p, 8n). So total protons: 6 + (2×8) = 22. Neutrons: 6 + (2×8) = 22. Oh! So 22 protons and 22 neutrons. That fits. So gas W is CO2.

Alternatively, could it be something else? Like O2? O2 is O2, each O has 8 protons. So molecule has 16 protons. Neutrons: each O is 8, so 16. So 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That also fits. So W could be O2.

But the reaction is violent. So perhaps it's a carbonate reacting with acid? Let me think. Carbonate (like in liquid Y) reacting with an acid (like X) would produce CO2, water, and the corresponding salt.

Another possibility: if Y is a carbonate, and X is an acid, the reaction
