Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about boson decay. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by this Lagrangian term. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and the question is about the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order.

Wait, the Lagrangian is given as L = -λ_f fψ̄ f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). I remember that in interactions, the terms in the Lagrangian dictate the possible interactions. So, X is interacting with fermions of different flavors because it's coupling to ψ_f, which I think represents different fermion species.

So, looking at the Lagrangian, it looks like X is a scalar boson because it's just X(y) without any derivatives or anything. The interaction term is like X times the product of left-handed and right-handed components, probably, which suggests that X can be emitted or absorbed by fermions. So X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs.

Now, the mass of X is 6 GeV. To find the allowed decay products, I need to consider the rest mass of the boson and what fermions can have a combined mass less than or equal to that. Because for decay to be possible, the sum of the masses of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of the boson. That's the basic kinematic condition.

So, I need to list all possible fermion pairs and check their combined masses.

Wait, but which fermions are available? The fermion field is ψ_f, so f could be any of the known fermions, right? Like quarks and leptons. But the problem probably assumes that X can couple to all fermions, unless specified otherwise. But maybe the coupling is only to certain fermions based on the model. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify any restrictions, so I'll assume X can couple to all possible fermions.

Now, let's list the masses of the fermions:

Leptons:
- Electron (e): about 0.511 MeV
- Muon (μ): about 105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): about 1777 MeV (1.777 GeV)

Quarks:
- Up (u): ~2.2 MeV
- Down (d): ~4.7 MeV
- Strange (s): ~95 MeV
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV (1500 MeV)
- Bottom (b): ~4.7 GeV (4700 MeV)
- Top (t): ~173 GeV (way too heavy compared to X mass)
- Top is way heavier than 6 GeV, so X can't decay into top quarks.

So, the possible fermions X can decay into are all except top quarks. Now, for each fermion pair, I need to check if twice the fermion mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let's calculate 2m_f for each:

Electron: 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV << 6 GeV → allowed.
Muon: 2 * 105.7 MeV = 211.4 MeV << 6 GeV → allowed.
Tau: 2 * 1.777 GeV = 3.554 GeV < 6 GeV → allowed.
Up quark: 2 * 2.2 MeV = 4.4 MeV → allowed.
Down quark: 2 * 4.7 MeV = 9.4 MeV → allowed.
Strange quark: 2 * 95 MeV = 190 MeV → allowed.
Charm quark: 2 * 1.5 GeV = 3 GeV < 6 GeV → allowed.
Bottom quark: 2 * 4.7 GeV = 9.4 GeV > 6 GeV → Not allowed. So, X can't decay into b b-bar.

Wait wait, no! Because the mass of X is 6 GeV. The sum of the masses of the decay products must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. But for fermion pairs, each has mass m, so total is 2m. So for X → b b-bar, 2m_b = 2*4.7 = 9.4 GeV, which is way bigger than 6 GeV. So that decay is not allowed.

So which decay channels are allowed?

Looking at each option:

A) X → b b-bar,... so not allowed because 2m_b=9.4 GeV>6 GeV.

B) X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-, mu+ mu-.

Wait, but in option B, I don't see any b b-bar. So it's allowed because X can't decay into b quarks.

Wait, looking at the options again.

Option A includes b and s, u, d, tau, e. But b is not allowed.

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So let's check each:

c c-bar: 2 * 1.5 GeV = 3 GeV <=6. Allowed.

s s-bar: 2 * 0.095 GeV ≈ 0.19 GeV. Wait, no—wait, s quark mass is about 95 MeV, so 0.095 GeV. 2 * 0.095 = 0.19 GeV. So yes, allowed.

u and d are even lighter, so 2* their masses are negligible. Tau: 2 * 1.777 GeV = 3.554 GeV <6 → allowed.

Tau, mu, e: their 2m are all way below 6 GeV. So option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's correct.

Option C includes t quarks, which are too heavy. So C is out.

Option D includes b quarks, which is not allowed.

So the correct answer is B. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options:

Option B: X→c c̄, s s̄,u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−.

Wait, but why does B include c and s but not b? Because 2m_b is too big.

So the allowed decay modes include all fermion pairs except those where the sum is over 6 GeV. So, not b, but all others are allowed.

So the correct answer would be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction term in the Lagrangian indicates that \( X \) can couple to fermions, allowing it to decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The kinematic condition for a decay \( X \to f\bar{f} \) is that the total mass of the decay products, \( 2m_f \), must be less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses (in GeV):
- **Electron (\( e \))**: \( m_e \approx 0.000511 \), \( 2m_e \approx 0.001022 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- **Muon (\( \mu \))**: \( m_\mu \approx 0.1057 \), \( 2m_\mu \approx 0.2114 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- **Tau (\( \tau \))**: \( m_\tau \approx 1.777 \), \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.554 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- **Up quark (\( u \))**: \( m_u \approx 0.0022 \), \( 2m_u \approx 0.0044 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- **Down quark (\( d \))**: \( m_d \approx 0.0047 \), \( 2m_d \approx 0.0094 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- **Strange quark (\( s \))**: \( m_s \approx 0.095 \), \( 2m_s \approx 0.19 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- **Charm quark (\( c \))**: \( m_c \approx 1.5 \), \( 2m_c \approx 3.0 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- **Bottom quark (\( b \))**: \( m_b \approx 4.7 \), \( 2m_b \approx 9.4 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed)

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b = 9.4 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Rejected**.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \). All these decays satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Accepted**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), but the top quark mass is \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), making \( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \), which is far greater than \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Rejected**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed for the same reason as in Option A. **Rejected**.

### Conclusion:
The only kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are those listed in **Option B**.
