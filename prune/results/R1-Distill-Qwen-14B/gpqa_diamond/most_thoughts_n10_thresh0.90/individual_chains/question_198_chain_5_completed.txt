Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure I understand. The stability constants (β) indicate how stable the complexes are. A higher β means the complex is more stable. So the complexes are CoSCN, Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3, and Co(SCN)_4. The question is asking about the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which I think is [Co(SCN)_2]^- or maybe [Co(SCN)_2]^n-? Hmm, I might need to think about the charges.

But I'm more concerned with the calculation part. Since all the Co is in solution as some complex, the total concentration is the sum of all the possible complexes. The problem is about calculating the fraction of the [Co(SCN)_2]^- complex.

I remember that for such problems, the fraction of each species can be found using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand. I think we can model this using the formation of each complex step by step.

The general approach is to consider the formation of each complex from the previous one, using the stability constant. The fraction of each complex depends on the β values and the ligand concentration.

So, let's denote the complexes as:

- Co^2+ (free ion)
- Co(SCN)^(n-) → Let's see, Co^2+ has a charge of +2. Each SCN- is -1. So for [Co(SCN)]^+, β1 =9. But wait, β is the formation constant, which is [Co(SCN)]^+ / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]).

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused about the charges. Let me make a table:

Complex | Formula | Charge | β
--- | --- | --- | ---
1 | CoSCN | +1 (since Co^2+ + SCN^- → charge is 2-1=+1) | β1=9
2 | Co(SCN)_2 | 0 (2*-1 + 2=0) → neutral | β2=40
3 | Co(SCN)_3 | -1 | β3=63
4 | Co(SCN)_4 | -2 | β4=16

Hmm, okay. So the complexes have varying charges, which probably affects their concentrations in solution, especially since the solution's charge must balance. But I'm not sure if that's a factor here because the problem doesn't mention any counterions or other charged species besides SCN-.

But perhaps for the purposes of this problem, we can ignore charge balance issues because SCN- is in excess. Wait, the concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M, which is much higher than the Co concentration of 1e-2 M. So perhaps the ligand is in excess, and the complexes form stepwise with each step having a certain fraction.

In that case, the fraction of each complex can be determined by the stepwise formation constants.

Alternatively, log K or stepwise stability constants. Wait, stability constants can be expressed either as cumulative (overall) or stepwise.

Wait, the given β's are the cumulative stability constants. For example, β1 is the formation constant for CoSCN^+ from Co^2+ and SCN^-.

So the formation reactions are:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ CoSCN^+ → β1 = [CoSCN^+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]) = 9

Then, CoSCN^+ + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)_2 → β2 = [Co(SCN)_2]/([CoSCN^+][SCN^-}) =40

Similarly, for β3 and β4.

But wait, no, I think β2 is the formation constant for the second step. So the cumulative β for the n-th complex is the product of β1 through βn.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The cumulative β (K) is the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands. So for [Co(SCN)_n]^m, the cumulative β is β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's see: for the second complex, Co(SCN)_2, which would be formed by adding another SCN- to [Co(SCN)]^+.

So the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_2] would be β1 * β2, because it's the product of the two stepwise constants.

Similarly, the formation constant for [Co(SCN)_3] would be β1 * β2 * β3, and for [Co(SCN)_4], β1*β2*β3*β4.

But I need to find the fraction of each complex in the solution. The total concentration of all Co species is the sum of each complex's concentration plus the free Co^2+.

Wait, but in this problem, the total cobalt concentration is given as 1e-2 M. So [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4] = 1e-2 M.

But calculating each of these fractions might be tricky. Alternatively, I can use the fact that the fraction of each complex is determined by the stepwise formation constants and the ligand concentration.

The fraction of each complex can be calculated using the stepwise formation constants and the ligand concentration. The formula for the fraction is given by:

f_n = (β1 β2 β3 ... βn) / (1 + β1 + β1β2 + β1β2β3 + ... + β1β2β3β4 )

Wait, but I think for a general case, the fraction of [Co(SCN)_n] is (β1 β2 ... βn) / (sum of all possible β products up to n=4).

Wait, maybe it's better to model it step by step.

Let me denote the free Co^2+ concentration as [Co^2+] = a.

Then:

[CoSCN^+] = β1 * a * [SCN^-] = 9 * a * 0.1 = 0.9 a

[Co(SCN)_2] = β2 * [CoSCN^+] * [SCN^-] = 40 * (0.9 a) * 0.1 = 40 * 0.09 a = 3.6 a

Wait, no, wait. Because [Co(SCN)_2] is formed from [CoSCN^+] and another SCN^-.

So [Co(SCN)_2] = β2 * [CoSCN^+] * [SCN^-}.

But [CoSCN^+] is β1 a [SCN^-}.

So [Co(SCN)_2] = β2 * β1 a [SCN^-]^2.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_3] = β3 * [Co(SCN)_2] * [SCN^-} = β3 * β2 * β1 a [SCN^-]^3.

And [Co(SCN)_4] = β4 * [Co(SCN)_3] * [SCN^-} = β4 β3 β2 β1 a [SCN^-]^4.

Wait, but that's the cumulative approach. Because the overall formation constant for each complex would be the product of β1 to βn.

Alternatively, perhaps the concentrations can be expressed in terms of a and [SCN^-].

So:

[Co^2+] = a

[CoSCN^+] = β1 a [SCN^-} = 9 a (0.1) = 0.9 a

[Co(SCN)_2] = β2 [CoSCN^+] [SCN^-} = β2 * (0.9 a) * 0.1 = β2 * 0.09 a

Wait, but that's not the same as β1*β2*a [SCN^-]^2, because [CoSCN^+] is β1 a [SCN^-}.

So, [Co(SCN)_2] = β2 * β1 a [SCN^-}^2.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_3] = β3 β2 β1 a [SCN^-}^3.

And [Co(SCN)_4] = β4 β3 β2 β1 a [SCN^-}^4.

So each subsequent complex's concentration is the previous multiplied by βn and [SCN^-}.

So let's compute each term:

Let me compute the terms:

Term1: [Co^2+] = a

Term2: [CoSCN^+] = β1 a [S] = 9 a (0.1) = 0.9 a

Term3: [Co(SCN)_2] = β2 * Term2 * [S] = 40 * 0.9 a * 0.1 = 3.6 a

Wait, that's the same as β1 β2 a [S]^2 → 9 *40 = 360 → 360 a (0.1)^2 = 360 a * 0.01 =3.6 a.

Yes, same result.

Term4: [Co(SCN)_3] = β3 * Term3 * [S] = 63 *3.6 a *0.1 = 22.68 a

Term5: [Co(SCN)_4] = β4 * Term4 * [S] = 16 *22.68 a *0.1 = 36.288 a

So, all the terms:

Term1: a

Term2: 0.9a

Term3: 3.6a

Term4:22.68a

Term5:36.288a

Wait, but wait. Summing all terms:

Sum = a (1 + 0.9 + 3.6 + 22.68 +36.288 )

Compute 1 +0.9=1.9; 1.9+3.6=5.5; 5.5+22.68=28.18; 28.18+36.288=64.468.

So Sum = a * 64.468 = 1e-2 M (given total cobalt concentration).

So a = (1e-2) /64.468 ≈ 1.551e-4 M.

Wait, but let me compute that more accurately.

1e-2 = 0.01 M.

So a = 0.01 / 64.468 ≈ 0.0001551 M.

But I need the fractions of each term relative to the sum.

Wait, but each term is in terms of a, so the fractions would be:

Fraction of Term1: (a) / (Sum) → a/(a * 64.468) )= 1/64.468 ≈ 0.01551 or 1.551%.

Fraction of Term2: 0.9 /64.468 ≈ 0.014, which is about 1.4%.

Wait, but wait, wait.

Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because in reality, the sum of all terms equals the total Co concentration, which is 1e-2 M. So a is the free Co^2+ concentration.

But the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the [Co(SCN)_2] species. So the fraction would be [Co(SCN)_2] / (total Co) = (3.6a) / (0.01) → since 3.6a is the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex.

But wait, let me think again. The sum of all terms is a*(1 + 0.9 + 3.6 +22.68 +36.288 )= a*(64.468)=0.01.

So a = 0.01 /64.468 ≈ 0.0001551 M.

So [Co(SCN)_2] =3.6 a =3.6 * 0.0001551 ≈ 5.5836e-5 M.

So the fraction is (5.5836e-5) / (0.01) = 0.0055836 or 0.55836%.

Wait, that's about 0.56%, which isn't any of the options. Hmm. That can't be right, because the options are all around 16-42%.

So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I shouldn't model each step using the stepwise β's but instead use the cumulative formation constants.

Wait, the problem states that the stability constants (β) are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I think these are the overall formation constants, not the stepwise ones.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

In stability constants, the βn is the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2], etc.

So the formation reactions are:

Co^2+ + SCN^- → CoSCN^+ ; β1=9

Co^2+ + 2 SCN^- → Co(SCN)_2; β2=40

Co^2+ + 3 SCN^- → Co(SCN)_3; β3=63

Co^2+ +4 SCN^- → Co(SCN)_4; β4=16

So in this case, the overall βn for each complex is given. Therefore, the concentration of [Co(SCN)_n] is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n

But wait, because each βn is for the complex with n SCN- ligands. So for example,

[CoSCN^+] = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-}

[Co(SCN)_2] = β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2

[Co(SCN)_3] = β3 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3

[Co(SCN)_4] = β4 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4

But then the total cobalt concentration is:

[Co^2+] + β1 [Co^2+][S]^1 + β2 [Co^2+][S]^2 + β3 [Co^2+][S]^3 + β4 [Co^2+][S]^4 = c

Which can be written as [Co^2+] (1 + β1 [S] + β2 [S]^2 + β3 [S]^3 + β4 [S]^4 ) = c

Wait, but that makes sense. So the free [Co^2+] can be solved, and then each complex's concentration can be found.

So, with [S] = 0.1 M, let's compute each term βn [S]^n.

Compute each term:

Term1 (n=0): 1

Term2 (n=1): β1 [S] = 9 *0.1 = 0.9

Term3 (n=2): β2 [S]^2 =40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4

Term4 (n=3): β3 [S]^3=63*(0.001)=0.063

Term5 (n=4): β4 [S]^4=16*(0.0001)=0.0016

So sum all terms:

1 + 0.9=1.9

1.9 +0.4=2.3

2.3 +0.063=2.363

2.363 +0.0016=2.3646

So the sum is 2.3646.

Then, [Co^2+] = c / sum = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈0.004224 M.

Now, the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2] is β2 [Co^2+][S]^2 =40 * 0.004224 * (0.1)^2 =40 *0.004224 *0.01.

Let me compute that step by step:

0.004224 *0.01=4.224e-5.

40 *4.224e-5 = 1.6896e-3 M.

So [Co(SCN)_2] is approximately 0.0016896 M.

The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, so the fraction is (0.0016896 / 0.01) *100% =16.896%.

Wait, that's approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, the options are:

A)42.3% B)25.6% C)38.1% D)16.9%

So D is 16.9%. So the answer should be D.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Compute each term again:

beta1 * [S] =9 *0.1=0.9

beta2 * [S]^2=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4

beta3 * [S]^3=63*(0.001)=0.063

beta4 * [S]^4=16*(0.0001)=0.0016

So sum is 1 +0.9=1.9; +0.4 →2.3; +0.063 →2.363; +0.0016→2.3646.

So [Co^2+]=0.01 /2.3646≈0.004224.

Then, [Co(SCN)_2] =β2 [Co][S]^2=40 *0.004224 *0.01.

Wait, wait, [S]^2 is (0.1)^2=0.01.

So 40 *0.004224 *0.01 → 40 *0.00004224=0.0016896 M.

So the fraction is (0.0016896 /0.01)*100 =16.896%, which is about 16.9%. So option D.

But wait, in my initial approach when I considered stepwise formation, I got a different (and much lower) fraction. So why is this approach correct?

Ah, because I think I confused the stepwise and cumulative β's earlier. Here, using the correct approach where each βn is the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands, the sum is as calculated. So the correct fraction is D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2], among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants and the given concentrations. The total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16.

### Key Steps:
1. **Stability Constants and Complex Formation**:  
   The stability constant βₙ represents the overall formation constant for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]. The concentration of each complex can be expressed as:  
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}_n] = \beta_n [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^n
   \]
   where \( [\text{Co}^{2+}] \) is the free cobalt ion concentration and \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \).

2. **Total Cobalt Concentration**:  
   The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all cobalt species:  
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] + \beta_1 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^1 + \beta_2 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 0.01 \, \text{M}.
   \]
   Factoring out \( [\text{Co}^{2+}] \), we get:  
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] \left( 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 \right) = 0.01.
   \]

3. **Compute Terms**:  
   Using \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \), calculate each term:  
   - \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \),  
   - \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4 \),  
   - \( \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063 \),  
   - \( \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016 \).  

   Summing these terms:  
   \[
   1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.
   \]

4. **Free Cobalt Ion Concentration**:  
   Solve for \( [\text{Co}^{2+}] \):  
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] = \frac{0.01}{2.3646} \approx 0.004224 \, \text{M}.
   \]

5. **Concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]**:  
   Using the formula for [Co(SCN)_2]:  
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}_2] = \beta_2 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot 0.004224 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.0016896 \, \text{M}.
   \]

6. **Fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]**:  
   The fraction of [Co(SCN)_2] is:  
   \[
   \text{Fraction} = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)}_2]}{\text{Total Co}} = \frac{0.0016896}{0.01} \cdot 100\% \approx 16.9\%.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2], among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.  

Answer: D
