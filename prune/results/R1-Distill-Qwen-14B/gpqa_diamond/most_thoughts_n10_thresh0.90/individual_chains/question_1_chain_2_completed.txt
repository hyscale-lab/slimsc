Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish the two levels. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. 

Wait, but in this case, the lifetimes given are the lifetimes of each state. So each state has its own lifetime. I think the time uncertainty Δt for each state is the lifetime itself. So for E1, Δt would be 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, it's 1e-8 seconds. 

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. So the energy difference ΔE must be such that the uncertainty in energy (from each state's lifetime) is smaller than the actual energy difference. Otherwise, the two states might not be distinguishable. 

So, the uncertainty in energy for each state would be ħ divided by the lifetime. Let me calculate that. The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. 

For E1: ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J. To convert that into eV because the options are in eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602176634e-19 joules. So, 1.05e-25 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV = approximately 6.56e-7 eV. So about 6.56e-7 eV uncertainty for E1. 

Similarly, for E2: τ2 is 1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J. Converting to eV: 1.05e-26 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 6.56e-8 eV. So about 6.56e-8 eV uncertainty for E2. 

Wait, but what's the total uncertainty in the energy difference between E1 and E2? Hmm, I think when considering the energy difference, it's the uncertainty in each state that contributes. So the total uncertainty in ΔE would be the sum of the individual uncertainties, because for each state, their energy is uncertain by their own ΔE. Or maybe I should think about the uncertainty in the difference, which would be the maximum of the two? Or perhaps the sum? 

Wait, no, actually, the energy difference is E2 - E1. The uncertainty in that difference would be ΔE2 + ΔE1, because if E2 is uncertain by ΔE2 and E1 by ΔE1, their difference's uncertainty is the combination. Because when you subtract two independent uncertainties, the maximum possible is the sum. So ΔE_diff ≈ ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So plugging in the numbers: 6.56e-7 eV + 6.56e-8 eV. Let's see, 6.56e-7 is 65.6e-8, adding 6.56e-8 gives us about 72.16e-8 eV. So roughly 7.2e-7 eV. 

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's exactly correct. Another thought: perhaps the energy difference's uncertainty is the smaller of the two, because if the lifetimes are different, the more precise measurement comes from the longer lifetime. Or wait, no. Each state's lifetime contributes to the uncertainty of their own energy. So when considering the difference, the uncertainty in the difference would be the sum of the individual uncertainties. Because each energy has its own uncertainty, and when you take the difference, the maximum possible uncertainty is the sum. So I think that's correct.

So for the energy difference ΔE to be clearly distinguishable, it should be greater than the uncertainty in ΔE. So ΔE > ΔE_diff. 

So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than 7.2e-7 eV. Let's look at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV → way less than 7e-7. So too small.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller, no.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4, which is 1e4 times larger than 7e-7. So that's way bigger than the uncertainty. So yes, definitely distinguishable.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV. Hmm, 1e-8 is 0.1e-7. The required ΔE is about 7.2e-7, which is 7.2e-7. So 1e-8 is smaller, so not enough.

Wait, but wait, the options given are: 

C is 1e-4 eV, which is much bigger than our calculated uncertainty. So that would mean that the energy difference is clearly distinguishable. So the correct answer is C. 

But wait, let me think again. Wait, the question is about which energy difference would allow the two levels to be clearly resolved. So the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty. So the correct answer is the one where the energy difference is greater than the uncertainty. 

In our case, the uncertainty is about 7.2e-7 eV. So any ΔE larger than that would suffice. Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 → 0.001e-6 → 1e-9 is 0.001e-6, which is 1e-9. Less than 7.2e-7. So no.

B) 1e-11 → even smaller.

C) 1e-4 → 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4, which is 1e4 times larger than 7e-7. So yes, clearly bigger.

D) 1e-8 → 0.00000001 eV. 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, which is less than 7e-7. So no.

So the correct answer is C.

Wait another thought: isn't the uncertainty in the energy difference (ΔE) actually the maximum of the two uncertainties? Or perhaps the minimum. Because if one state has a longer lifetime, its energy uncertainty is smaller. So perhaps the uncertainty in the energy difference is the maximum of the two, so the larger of ΔE1 and ΔE2.

Wait, so for E1, the energy uncertainty is about 6.56e-7 eV, and for E2, it's about 6.56e-8 eV. So when you take E2 - E1, the maximum uncertainty would be the sum, but perhaps it's the maximum of the two. Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the uncertainty in the energy difference as the sum of the individual uncertainties. Because each energy has its own uncertainty, their difference would have an uncertainty that's the root sum square, or perhaps the sum. But for small numbers, the sum is easier.

Wait, perhaps I should model the uncertainty in E as the average or the maximum. Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to consider that the uncertainty in the energy difference is the sum of the individual uncertainties. Because when you have two independent uncertainties, the uncertainty in their difference is sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ), which in this case, since ΔE1 is 1e-7 and ΔE2 is 1e-8, the sum would be about 1.01e-7, which is roughly 1e-7. Not exactly 7e-7 as I calculated earlier, but similar magnitude.

So in any case, the required ΔE for the energy levels to be distinguishable must be larger than the uncertainty in ΔE.

So for example, if the energy difference is 1e-4 eV (option C), which is 1e-4 eV, that's 1e4 times larger than 1e-8 eV (the larger of the two uncertainties). So it would easily be distinguishable.

Looking at the options again, the only option with a difference larger than the uncertainty is option C.


To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) that allows them to be clearly distinguished, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) and the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) is approximately \( \hbar/2 \), where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant. For a quantum state with lifetime \( \tau \), the energy uncertainty is given by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{\hbar}{\tau}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties for each state
- For \( E_1 \) with \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}.
  \]
  Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

- For \( E_2 \) with \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
  \]
  Converting to electron volts:
  \[
  \Delta E_2 \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the uncertainty in the energy difference
The energy difference between the two states is \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \). The uncertainty in this difference is the sum of the individual uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{diff}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 6.56 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \approx 7.2 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Compare the energy differences to the uncertainty
For the two energy levels to be clearly distinguishable, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than the uncertainty \( \Delta E_{\text{diff}} \). Evaluating the options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 7.2 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the states cannot be distinguished.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so the states cannot be distinguished.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is \( 1 \times 10^{3} \) times larger than \( 7.2 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the states can be clearly distinguished.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 7.2 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the states cannot be distinguished.

### Conclusion
The only energy difference that ensures the two states can be clearly resolved is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).
