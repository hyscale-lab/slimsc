Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

Alright, the problem says we have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. And its mass is also 1.5 times bigger. Wait, but the problem isn't about mass directly, I think. It's about luminosity. Oh, right, the question is about the luminosity ratio.

They used spectroscopy to find the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest, and they're the same. Hmm, the wavelength of maximum brightness is given by Wien's Law, right? Wien's Law says lambda_max * T = constant (approximately 2.898×10^-3 m·K). So if the max wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because if lambda is the same, then T is the same. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but I should make sure. Because sometimes when you shift the spectrum, like with Doppler shifts, the observed max wavelength could change. Oh wait, the problem says they found that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest were the same. So the observed wavelengths are same. But wait, the Doppler shift comes into play because they have radial velocities.

Oh! Because Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, which is moving towards or away from us. So that would affect the observed wavelength. Let me think: the stars' own temperatures determine their emission, but their motion affects the observed wavelengths.

Wait, but the problem said the observed maxima are the same, right? So perhaps the Doppler shift is already accounted for. Or maybe the temperatures are the same in their rest frames, but when the star is moving, the observed wavelength is shifted. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Let me reevaluate. The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So, the observed lambda_max is the same for both. But each star has a temperature, and the lambda_max depends on their temperature. So, if their observed lambda_max is same, that would imply that their temperatures are same when considering their velocities. Wait, that's getting a bit complicated.

Wait, no. Because the star's own emission has a certain lambda_max based on its temperature, but if it's moving towards or away from us (radial velocity), that would shift the observed wavelength. So the observed lambda_max = (rest lambda_max) * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) )? No, wait, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength is lambda_observed = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ), but I'm not sure if that's the relativistic formula or not. Alternatively, the non-relativistic approximation is lambda_observed = lambda_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity (positive for moving away). But wait, I think for small velocities, the approximation holds. But 700 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light, which is about 3e5 km/s. So 700 is about 0.0023 times c, which is small, so maybe the non-relativistic approximation is okay.

Wait, but the problem says that Star_1 has radial velocity 0 km/s, so it's not moving towards or away from us. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Wait, but if Star_2 is moving towards us, the observed wavelength would be blueshifted, meaning shorter. If moving away, redshifted, longer wavelength. So the problem states that the observed wavelengths where the stars are brightest are the same. So that implies that the rest frame lambda_max of Star_2 is different from Star_1.

Wait, no. Because the observed lambda_max is same. So Star_1's rest frame lambda_max would be affected by any velocity, but Star_1's radial velocity is zero. So the observed lambda_max for Star_1 is same as
