Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance based on their parallax. Hmm, okay, I remember that parallax is related to distance, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

The question says that in a specific region, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the formula would be something like N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Wait, right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. Oh right, because closer stars have larger parallaxes. So if distance is r, then plx is proportional to 1/r. So plx = k/r, where k is some constant.

Wait, so if plx = 1/r, then 1/plx would be r. So plx is inversely proportional to r. So if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, substituting plx with 1/r, that would make N proportional to (r)^5? Because 1/( (1/r)^5 ) is r^5. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. So substituting plx = 1/r, that becomes N ∝ 1/( (1/r)^5 ) = r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So the number of stars increases with r^5. But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit range. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". So it's looking for how the number changes with r, so like the derivative of N with respect to r, perhaps? Or maybe just the relation N(r) as a function of r.

Wait, let's clarify. The number of stars as a function of distance. Suppose you have a volume element, or a shell at radius r with thickness dr. How many stars are in that shell? The total number of stars up to a distance r would depend on the density and the volume, but here the relation is given as N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, which we've transformed into N ∝ r^5.

Wait, wait, maybe I need to think about it in terms of differential
