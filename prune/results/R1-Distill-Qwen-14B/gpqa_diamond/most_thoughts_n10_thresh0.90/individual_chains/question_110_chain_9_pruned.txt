Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand the capabilities of each spectrograph. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag in V, and HIRES can observe up to 16 mag. So, any star with V magnitude less than or equal to 17 can be seen by ESPRESSO, and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem states that both can detect stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO, and brighter than 16 for HIRES. Oh, wait no, wait. No, wait: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed." Wait, but apparent magnitude is such that lower numbers are brighter. So, if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that means its apparent V magnitude is less than 17. Because higher magnitudes mean dimmer. So, for example, magnitude 16 is brighter than 17. So, a star that is 16 mag would be brighter than 17 mag. So, to be detectable by both, the star's apparent V mag must be <=16, because that's the stricter condition. Because if it's brighter than 17 (so <=17), but to be detectable by HIRES, it needs to be brighter than 16 (so <=16). So stars must have apparent V mag <=16 to be seen by both.

Wait, but let me think again. What's the condition for each instrument:

- ESPRESSO: apparent V mag ≤17. Because "brighter than 17" means the magnitude is less than 17. Since magnitude is lower for brighter objects. So if a star is 16 mag, it's brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can detect it. Similarly, HIRES can detect stars brighter than 16, so apparent V mag ≤16. So a star must be ≤16 to be detectable by both. Because if it's 17 or higher, it's only detectable by ESPRESSO, but not by HIRES. So to be detectable by both, the apparent V mag must be ≤16.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. So, brighter than 17 implies V < 17. But for HIRES, "brighter than 16 V mag" can be observed, so V <16. So for a star to be detected by both, it must have V <16. Because that's the stricter condition. So any star that has V mag ≤16 can be detected by both. If V is 16.5, it would be <17, so ESPRESSO can observe it, but HIRES can't because it's 16.5 which is not less than 16. So only stars with V ≤16 can be seen by both. So that's a key point.

Now, let's look at each star.

Star1: RA 15 deg, DEC -75, absolute V=15.5, distance 10 pc.

Wait, how do you find apparent magnitude? The formula is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d) where d is distance in parsecs.

So for Star1: M=15.5, d=10 pc.

m = 15.5 +5 +5*log10(10)
log10(10) is 1, so 5*1=5. So m = 15.5 +5 +5 = 25.5.

Wait
