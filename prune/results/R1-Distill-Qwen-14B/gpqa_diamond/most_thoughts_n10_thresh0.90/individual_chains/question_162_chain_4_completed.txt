Okay, so I've got this question about general relativity or differential geometry, I think. The question provides a metric and asks about the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a 2-dimensional metric. So maybe this is a 2D spacetime? Or perhaps it's embedded in some higher dimension? I'm not sure, but let's focus on the area part.

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere. Pseudosphere is a term I remember from geometry; it's like a sphere but in a space with constant negative curvature. But wait, I'm probably mixing things up here. Or maybe it's a sphere in a space with a different metric.

Wait, the term pseudosphere can sometimes refer to the tractricoid, which is the surface of constant negative curvature. But in this context, maybe it's just a sphere in the given metric. Or wait, maybe the question is referring to a sphere in this 2D space, like a circle but in this metric.

Wait, the metric is in terms of dx² and dy², so it's a 2-dimensional metric. So the "pseudosphere" here is probably a 2D surface with this metric. Alternatively, maybe it's a 2-sphere embedded in some higher-dimensional space, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem says the pseudosphere has radius r=2. So I need to find its area. Normally, the area of a sphere in flat space is 4πr². But this is a curved space, so it's different.

But wait, in 2D, the area of a circle (which is a 1-sphere) in a metric with curvature would be different. Or wait, no—wait, the term "pseudosphere" might imply a 2D surface with negative curvature. Alternatively, perhaps in this metric, the space is a sphere with some radius. Let me think.

The given metric: ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Let's see, the denominator is 4 - x² - y². That looks like the equation of a circle with radius 2, because x² + y² < 4 for the denominator to be positive. So the domain of x and y is a disk of radius 2.

Wait, so the metric is defined when 4 - x² - y² > 0, which implies x² + y² <4, so the region is a disk of radius 2. So perhaps this is a model of hyperbolic space? Or maybe it's a sphere?

Wait, another approach: the metric looks similar to the metric of a sphere in some coordinates. Wait, the standard metric for a sphere is usually written in terms of angles, like r² (dθ² + sin²θ dφ²) or something like that. But this metric is in terms of x and y, so maybe it's conformally flat.

Hmm, the metric is conformally flat because it's a multiple of (dx² + dy²). So the conformal factor is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element would be based on that.

Wait, to find the area of a pseudosphere (maybe a sphere in this metric), I think I need to compute the area in this space. But wait, the metric given is for a 2D space, so the pseudosphere is a 2D surface? Or perhaps it's a 2-sphere embedded in this space. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the area enclosed by a specific curve in this metric. Maybe the pseudosphere here is the entire space represented by the metric? But the metric is defined on a disk of radius 2, so perhaps the total area is finite.

So the area in this metric would be the integral over the region x² + y² <4 of the determinant of the metric. But since it's a 2D metric, the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy. The metric here is diagonal, so det g is (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2. So the area element is (32/(4 - (x² + y²))) dx dy.

Wait, so to find the area of the pseudosphere (maybe the entire space), I would integrate this over the entire allowed region, which is x² + y² <4. So the area A is the double integral over x and y of 32/(4 - (x² + y²)) dx dy, but with x² + y² <4.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the area of a sphere (circle) in this space with radius r=2. Wait, but if the radius is 2, that would take us to the boundary of the allowed region, where 4 - x² - y² approaches zero. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm mixing up the radius in the embedding space with the radius in the metric.

Wait, let me think. If the pseudosphere has radius r=2, perhaps it's a circle in this metric whose radius in the embedding space (like the usual x-y plane) is such that when you compute its circumference or area, it's radius is 2 in some sense.

But perhaps I should just compute the area of the region x² + y² <4, using this metric. Because the pseudosphere might refer to the whole space.

So the area A is the integral of dx dy * (32)/(4 - (x² + y²)), over x² + y² <4.

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Let me switch to polar coordinates because the domain is a circle. So x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy becomes r dr dθ.

Then the integral becomes ∫ (from r=0 to 2) ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So the integral is 32 * ∫ (0 to 2π) dθ ∫ (0 to2) [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

Let me compute that. First, the θ integral: ∫0 to 2π dθ = 2π.

Then the r integral: ∫0^2 [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. r=2 → u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of (1/u) * (-1/2) du.

Which is (-1/2) ∫4^0 (1/u) du → (1/2) ∫0^4 (1/u) du.

Wait, but ∫ (1/u) du is ln|u|, so this becomes (1/2)(ln4 - ln0).

Wait, ln0 is undefined, it approaches negative infinity. So this integral diverges to positive infinity? Because as r approaches 2, u approaches 0, so 1/u approaches infinity.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, because when r approaches 2, the denominator approaches 4 -4 =0. So the integrand becomes 1/0, which is infinite. So the integral would actually diverge. Therefore, the area is infinite.

Wait, but that can't be. The metric is defined for x² + y² <4, which is a finite disk. But the area in this metric might be infinite because the conformal factor blows up at the boundary.

Wait, in this case, the area element is (32/(4 - r^2)) r dr dθ. When r approaches 2, the factor becomes very large, so even though the radial integration is from 0 to 2, the area element becomes infinite near r=2. So the total area would be infinite.

So the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

Looking at the options, option D is +infinity.

So the answer should be D.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

and the question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). The metric is defined for \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), which corresponds to a disk of radius 2 in the \( x \)-\( y \) plane. The area element in this metric is proportional to \( \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \), which diverges as \( x^2 + y^2 \to 4 \). 

To compute the total area, we integrate the area element over the region \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \). Switching to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \)), the area element becomes:

\[
\text{Area element} = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 \cdot r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \( \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi \). For the radial integral \( \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \), we use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), which transforms the integral into:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

As \( u \to 0 \), \( \frac{1}{u} \to \infty \), causing the radial integral to diverge. This implies that the total area diverges to \( +\infty \). Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere in this metric is infinite.

From the options provided:

- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **B) \( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \)**: Incorrect, as this does not represent the area in the given metric.
- **C) \( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \)**: Incorrect, as this is not relevant to the area calculation.
- **D) \( +\infty \)**: Correct, as shown by the divergence of the integral.

Answer: D
