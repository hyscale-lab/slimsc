Okay, so I have this question about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The question says the solution has 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions.

Wait, right. The formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA^4- combine to form the Ca-EDTA complex. The reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2-.

The formula for Kf is [CaEDTA^2-] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ). So, because the solution is 0.02 M in the complex, that means the concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M. 

But wait, is there any assumption I can make about the dissociation of the complex? Since Kf is really large (5e10), that means the complex doesn't dissociate much. So the concentration of free calcium ions should be very low. 

But wait, I might have to set up an equation. Let me think. Let's denote the concentration of the complex as [CaEDTA] = 0.02 M. Let [Ca²+] be x. Then, the EDTA comes from two sources: the free EDTA and the complex. But wait, I think in this case, all the EDTA is tied up in the complex because the solution is stoichiometric. Hmm, no, wait. No, because in a solution, some EDTA may dissociate from the complex, but with a large K, the dissociation is minimal.

So, assuming that the concentration of free EDTA is approximately equal to the concentration of Ca²+ because the reaction is 1:1. So if [CaEDTA] is 0.02 M, then the dissociation would produce some x of Ca²+ and x of EDTA^4-.

Wait, the initial setup: the total concentration of EDTA is the sum of free EDTA and the complex. But if the solution is stoichiometric, which I think it means that the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are the same because they form a 1:1 complex. Wait, but the question says the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, so maybe the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are zero, and they form the complex. Or perhaps not, because maybe the solution is prepared by adding Ca²+ and EDTA in stoichiometric amounts.

But in any case, the problem is to find [Ca²+], which is x. The Kf expression is [CaEDTA]/( [Ca²+][EDTA] ) = Kf.

But since the complex is 0.02 M, and assuming that the dissociation is minimal (because Kf is large), then [CaEDTA] ≈ 0.02 M.

So, [Ca²+] and [EDTA] are both x. So Kf = 0.02 / (x^2) = 5e10.

Wait, solving for x: x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) 

Hmm, 0.02 is 2e-2. So x^2 = 2e-2 / 5e10 = 2e-13 / 5. So 2/(5) is 0.4, so x^2 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Wait, wait, wait, let me compute that again.

0.02 is 2e-2. Divided by (5e10) is 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12.

So x squared is 4e-13? Wait, 0.4e-12 is 4e-13? Oh yeah, because 0.4 is 4e-1, so 4e-1 * 1e-12 is 4e-13.

So x^2 = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7.

Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2, right? Because (1e-6.5)^2 = 1e-13. So sqrt
