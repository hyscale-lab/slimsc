Okay, so I have this question about identifying an unknown compound using different spectroscopic techniques. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, the question gives me the results from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. My task is to determine the chemical formula from the options provided.

Starting with the FTIR data. The peaks are at 3000 (very broad), 1700, and 1650 cm^-1.

I remember that a broad peak around 3000 is typically from O-H stretching. That could indicate the compound has either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid group, or maybe something else with an -OH. But wait, a broad peak might also be from an -OH in an alcohol, but if it's a carboxylic acid, that peak is usually even broader and maybe a bit lower, like around 2500-3300. Hmm, but this is a very broad peak, so maybe it's an -OH group.

The peak at 1700 is a strong absorption. That's a strong indicator for a carbonyl group. Carbonyls like ketones, aldehydes, esters, amides, or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700, but the O-H would be a very broad peak. But then the 1650 peak comes in. What's that? Another carbonyl? Or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation or something else. Oh wait, maybe it's an ester or a conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, the 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like in a ketone with some conjugation, or maybe an aromatic ring.

Wait, another thought: if the 1700 is a carbonyl, then the 1650 might be an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, which absorb around that region. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl and an aromatic ring? Or maybe one of the other groups.

Looking at the 1H NMR: they observed peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound must have a double bond, probably an alkene. That's a key point.

Now the mass spec shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, 45 is a common mass. What fragments give m/z 45? Well, maybe a CH3CO+ ion (45), or something like that. Alternatively, an ethyl group with a charge? Wait, CH3CO+ is 45 (12+1+12+16 =45? Wait, no. Carbon is 12, hydrogen 1, oxygen 16. So CH3CO+ is C2H3O+ → 2*12=24, 3*1=3, 16=16. 24+3+16=43. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I'm thinking of the wrong fragment.

Wait, another common fragment is the tropylium ion, which is C7H7+, but that's m/z 91. Hmm. Or maybe a CH2CH2O group? Not sure. Alternatively, the mass 45 could be from (CH3)2COH, but wait, that's maybe 45? Let me think: (CH3)2COH would be (2*(15)) + 16 + 1 = 30 +16 +1=47. Hmm. That's not right. Maybe the fragment is a ketone group? Or maybe it's a methoxy group attached to something else.

Wait, perhaps the 45 is the molecular ion for something. Hmm, but the options are either C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O, or C6H12O2. So the molecular formulas are all C6, but varying in H and O.

Let me think about each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: each degree is a ring or double bond. For C6H12O2:

Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, so (2*6+2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2 =1. So one degree of unsaturation. So that could be one ring or one double bond. But from the NMR, there are vinyl hydrogens, implying a double bond. So maybe one double bond and perhaps an oxygen-containing group.

Option B: C6H10O. Degrees of unsaturation: (14 -10)/2=2. So two degrees. That could be one double bond and one ring, or two double bonds, or two rings. Since the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, that's a double bond, so another degree would be a ring or another double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (14-10)/2=2. So two, same as B.

Option D: C6H12O. Degrees of unsaturation: (14-12)/2=1. So one double bond or ring.

So the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so at least one double bond. So options A and D have one, B and C have two.

Looking back at FTIR: the peaks at 1700 and 1650. Let me think about what functional groups could give that.

If the 1700 is a carbonyl (like ester, ketone, aldehyde, etc.), the 1650 could be something else. If the compound has two carbonyl groups, then perhaps an ester and a ketone? But that might be a stretch.

Alternatively, the 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugation. So maybe the compound has a carbonyl and an aromatic ring.

Wait, or maybe it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. That would have conjugated double bonds, which might lower the carbonyl absorption to around 1700-1680 or so. So perhaps the 1700 is a carbonyl, and the 1650 is the conjugated double bond.

In that case, the structure could have both a carbonyl and an alkene group, which is consistent with the NMR showing vinyl hydrogens.

So let's think about possible structures. For example, a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond? Or something else.

Now, the mass spec fragment at 45. Another approach is to think about the possible molecular formulas and their possible fragments.

Looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight is (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16)=72+12+32=116. So the molecular ion would be at m/z 116. But the fragment is at 45. So what could fragment to 45?

If the molecular formula is C6H12O2, perhaps the structure is something like a cyclic ester with an alkene. Maybe a gamma-lactone, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, suppose the structure is methyl vinyl ether something. Wait, perhaps it's an ester. For example, methyl acrylate has the formula C4H6O2, but that's smaller than the options given. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a diester, but that's getting more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a ketene, but that's a different story.

Wait, another approach: considering the molecular formula, perhaps the 45 is a fragment like (CH3CO) or similar.

Wait, for option C: C6H10O2. Molecular weight is (6*12)+(10*1)+(2*16)=72+10+32=114. So the molecular ion is at 114. What could fragment to 45?

If the molecule is something like an ester, perhaps the ester group could break off. For example, in an ester, the R-O-C-O-R' could cleave, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if the compound has a six-membered ring with an ester group and a double bond, perhaps a gamma-lactone with an alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from a part of the molecule with two carbons. Let me think: 45 is 45 g/mol. Let's see what compounds have a molecular weight of 45. Well, but since it's a fragment, maybe it's a small fragment.

Wait, the molecular formula for the fragment would be CxHyOz, where x + y + z*16 =45. Let's see:

Possible combinations:

- C3H7O: 3*12 +7 +16=36+7+16=60. No.

- C2H5O2: 24 +5 +32=61.

- C2H3O: 24+3+16=43. Close but not 45.

- C3H5O: 36 +5 +16=57.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2=CH-O group. Wait, the mass of that group is 44 (for CH2=CHO-) because that's (12*2 +1*4 +16) =24+4+16=44? But the fragment is 45. Not matching.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a ketene ion, which is R-C=O+, but I'm not sure.

Another idea: the 45 could be a CH3CH2O+ group. Let me calculate: 2 carbons, 5 hydrogens, 1 oxygen: 24 +5 +16=45. Oh! Because 2*12=24, 5*1=5, 16=16. So 24+5=29+16=45. So that's (CH2CH2O)+? No, wait, CH2CH2O is (CH2)2O, but that's not a common structure. Alternatively, it's CH3CH2O+ which is an ethyl group attached to an oxygen, like in an ether.

So if the fragment is CH2CH2O+, that would explain the 45. So perhaps the compound has an ethoxy group or something that could fragment to form that.

Alternatively, maybe it's a different structure. Let me think about each option.

Option D is C6H12O. Molecular formula with 6 carbons and 12 hydrogens and one oxygen. What functional groups could that be? It could be an alcohol with a ring or a double bond. For example, cyclohexanol (which has formula C6H12O). The FTIR would show a broad peak for the -OH, which fits. But in the FTIR, there's a 1700 peak, which would imply a carbonyl group, but cyclohexanol doesn't have that. So that can't be right.

So D is unlikely because the FTIR shows a carbonyl peak.

Option B: C6H10O. So formula is C6H10O. Degrees of unsaturation 2. So perhaps a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds or rings.

If it's a cyclic ether with a double bond, such as cyclohexene oxide. But cyclohexene oxide would have an epoxide group. The FTIR of an epoxide would have a peak around 1250-1050 cm^-1 for the C-O-C. But the given IR shows peaks at 1700 and 1650. So maybe not.

Alternatively, the compound could be a cyclic ketone with a double bond. Like cyclopentenone. Let me think, cyclopentenone would have a carbonyl group (so IR peak at ~1700), and a double bond (so maybe the 1650 is the conjugated double bond). Also, the NMR would show vinyl hydrogens. But then what about the broad peak at 3000? Cyclopentenone doesn't have an -OH group. So the broad peak would suggest an -OH, which cyclopentenone doesn't have. So that's a problem.

Wait, maybe the compound is an α,β-unsaturated ketone with an adjacent -OH group. For example, something like cyclohexenone with a hydroxyl group. Wait, but then the formula would have more oxygen. Let me see: cyclohexenone is C6H10O. If it has another -OH, that would make C6H10O2. But option B is C6H10O, so that might not fit.

Option A: C6H12O2. So that's 6 carbons, 12 hydrogens, two oxygen. Degrees of unsaturation: 1. So one double bond or ring.

If the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. For example, gamma-butyrolactone is a five-membered ring ester. Let me think about its structure. Gamma-butyrolactone is a cyclic ester with a four-membered ring (but that's not six carbons). Wait, but the formula is C6H12O2. So perhaps a delta-lactone, which is a five-membered ring? Wait, delta would be six-membered. So a six-membered ring ester.

But would that have a carbonyl group? Yes, the ester carbonyl. And the NMR would have vinyl hydrogens, but a lactone doesn't have a double bond unless it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated lactone.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like a substituted cyclohexene with an ester group. So, for example, a cyclohexene ring with an ester substituent. That would account for the double bond (vinyl H in NMR) and the carbonyl (IR at 1700). Also, the O in the ester would give another O, making it O2. Wait, ester is O-C-O, so that's two oxygens. So the formula would be C6H10O2? Or depends on substitution.

Wait, let me think about the molecular formula again. Let's say the structure is a cyclohexene ring with an ester group.

The general formula for an ester is R-O-CO-R'. If the ring is six-membered, say, then maybe the ester is attached as a substituent. Let me count the H.

But perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let's go back to the mass spec.

If the fragment is 45, which is CH2CH2O+, which is C2H5O+. So maybe the compound has an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3). So which options have an ethoxy group? Let's see. For example, ethyl something.

But the options are C6H...O or O2. So the compound could be something like methyl vinyl ether (but that's C3H6O), but perhaps a larger structure.

Wait, another angle: the mass of 45 could correspond to (CH3)2CO+ (acetone ion), which is (3*12)+(6*1)+16 = 36 +6 +16=58? No, that's not right. Wait, (CH3)2CO+ would be (3*(CH3)) plus CO. Oh, wait, (CH3)2CO+ is (2*12 + 6*1) + 12 + 16. Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated.

Alternatively, the 45 could be the result of a McLafferty rearrangement, which is common in mass spec for ketones with allylic positions. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think of the possible molecular formulas and see which one can lose a fragment of 45.

Option A: C6H12O2. The molecular weight is 116. So if the molecule loses something that's 45, what's left is 71 (116-45=71). 71 is a possible mass, but I'm not sure what would produce that.

Option C: C6H10O2. Molecular weight 114. 114-45=69. 69 is a possible mass for a fragment, but again, I'm not certain.

Option B: C6H10O. Molecular weight 98. 98-45=53. 53 is a possible fragment. But what would that be?

Option D: C6H12O. 100 (6*12=72, 12 H=12, O=16; 72+12=84+16=100). 100-45=55. 55 is possible, like C3H7N, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a larger part of the molecule, but I'm not getting it.

Let me try another approach. Let's think about the functional groups again.

The FTIR has a broad peak at 3000 (OH), strong at 1700 (carbonyl), and 1650 (maybe conjugated double bond or something else). The NMR has vinyl H, so double bond. The mass has peak at 45.

So possible structures: perhaps a diol with a carbonyl group? Or an ester with a hydroxyl group.

Wait, the compound could be an ester with a conjugated double bond. Let me think of something like methyl vinyl benzoate, but that's more complex.

Alternatively, the structure could be an α,β-unsaturated ester. Such as something like CH2=CHCOO-R. That would have the conjugated double bond, the carbonyl, and the ester. The IR would show peaks at ~1700 (ester carbonyl) and ~1650 (conjugated double bond). The OH peak would come from the ester's oxygen, but wait, esters don't have OH groups. So that's a problem.

Wait, but the FTIR has a broad peak at 3000. That's more indicative of an -OH group. So perhaps the compound has both an ester group and an -OH group.

Wait, that's possible. For example, a compound with both an ester and an alcohol group. Like a glycolic ester or something similar.

But then, the formula would have two O's from the ester and one from the alcohol, making O3. But the options don't have O3. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe the compound is a hemiacetal or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the broad peak isn't from an -OH but from an aromatic C-H stretch. Wait, aromatic C-H stretches are usually around 3000-3100, but they are typically not as broad as an -OH. So if the FTIR shows a very broad peak, it's probably -OH.

So the compound must have an -OH group. Also, a carbonyl group, and a double bond.

Let me think about possible functional groups: maybe an allylic alcohol with a carbonyl. For example, something like cyclohexenol with a ketone group. But that would require two oxygen atoms: one from the alcohol and one from the ketone. So the formula would be C6H10O2.

Looking at option C: C6H10O2. So degrees of unsaturation 2. So one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds.

So cyclohexenol with a ketone substituent: like cyclohex-2-en-1-one-ol. That would have a ring (six-membered), a double bond (cyclohexenone), and an -OH group.

But would that fit the IR? The carbonyl in the ketone would absorb at ~1700. The conjugated double bond would be around 1650. And the -OH would be a broad peak around 3000. That seems to fit.

Now, the NMR: vinyl hydrogens would be present because of the double bond. The structure would have protons on the double bond, which would show up as a peak around 5-6 ppm, perhaps as a multiplet.

The mass spec: the fragment at 45. If the molecule is cyclohexenol with a ketone, perhaps the structure is not that. Wait, maybe the structure is an ester with an -OH group. Wait, no, that would require three oxygens.

Alternatively, maybe it's a diol with a carbonyl group. But that would again require more oxygens.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a substituent that has an -OH. But the formula would be C6H10O2. Wait, a lactone is an ester, so O2 is correct. If the lactone has a substituent with -OH, perhaps that's the case.

But then, how would the mass spec fit in? Let's say the molecular formula is C6H10O2. The molecular weight is 114 (6*12=72, 10 H=10, 2 O=32; total 72+10+32=114). If the molecule fragments in a way that a 45 mass is detected, then the rest is 69.

Hmm, what could have a mass of 69? Maybe a cyclopentyl group or something else. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 45 is from a CH2CH2O+ group. So if the molecule has an ethoxy group, that could fragment.

Wait, but the options don't have an ethoxy group necessarily. Unless it's part of an ester.

Wait, let me think about another angle. The molecular formula C6H10O2. That could be an ester, perhaps with a benzene ring. But the presence of a benzene ring would show up in the IR as a peak around 1450-1600 cm^-1, but the given IR doesn't show that. So maybe no aromatic ring.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester with a double bond. For example, something like CH2=CHCOO-R. But formula would vary.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula C6H10O2 would have a molecular weight of 114. If the mass spectrum shows a peak at 45, which is 45, then perhaps the molecule lost a fragment of 69 (114-45=69), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the 45 could be a fragment that comes from a ketone group. Wait, methyl ketone is (CH3)CO- which is 58 (12*2 + 1*3 + 16 = 24 +3 +16=43? No, wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Another thought: maybe the mass 45 is from a (CH2)2O group. Which would be (2*12) + (4*1) +16 =24 +4 +16=44. Close but not 45. Alternatively, something like CH3CH2O+ (45) as I thought earlier.

But how would that fit into the molecular formula? Let's say the compound is something like ethyl something with an ester group and a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is ethyl acrylate. But then the formula is C4H6O2. Not matching the options.

Hmm, maybe the answer is option C: C6H10O2.

Putting it all together:

- FTIR: -OH (3000, broad), carbonyl (1700), conjugated double bond (1650).

- NMR: vinyl H → double bond.

- Mass: 45 → possibly CH2CH2O+.

If the compound is a cyclic ester like delta-valerolactone, but that's five-membered. Alternatively, a substituted cyclic ester with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is cyclopentanone with an ester group and an -OH. No, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diester, but that would require more oxygens.

Wait, another approach: think about the options and what their spectral data would look like.

Option A: C6H12O2.

Degrees of unsaturation =1. So a ring or a double bond.

If it's a ring (like cyclohexane) and an ester group, but then where's the double bond? Because the NMR shows vinyl H. So if it's a ring and a double bond, that would be two degrees of unsaturation, but the degrees for this option is one. So that can't be. So maybe it's a ring and no double bond, which would conflict with the NMR.

Wait, perhaps it's a single double bond (so one degree) and the ring (another). Wait, no, the degrees of unsaturation for option A is (14-12)/2=1. So only one degree, which can be a ring or double bond. So if it's a ring and a double bond, that would require two degrees.

So option A is unlikely because the NMR shows vinyl H (needs a double bond). So the double bond is present, so it must contribute to the degree of unsaturation. So the other degree would have to be a ring or another double bond.

Wait, but option A only allows one degree. So that can't be.

So perhaps the correct option is C: C6H10O2.

Degrees of unsaturation: 2. So one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds.

Since the NMR shows vinyl H, it has a double bond. So the other is a ring.

So the structure could be a cyclic diol with a carbonyl group. Wait, but that would have more O's.

Alternatively, a cyclic ester with a double bond. Which would fit the O2, double bond, and the ring.

For example, a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond in the ring. Like a substituted δ-lactone with a double bond.

In that case, the FTIR would show the ester carbonyl (around 1700), the conjugated double bond (around 1650), and maybe an -OH if it's an open ring. Wait, but lactones are cyclic esters, so they don't have an -OH group. So that's a problem.

Wait, but the FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000, which indicates an -OH group. So the compound must have an -OH, which would require that the structure isn't a lactone but perhaps a diol or an alcohol with another functional group.

Wait, if the structure has both an -OH and an ester group, that would require three oxygens. But the options only have O2, so that's not possible.

Hmm, maybe the structure is an alpha-hydroxy ester. For example, a substituted hydroxy ester with a double bond.

But then the formula would have two oxygens. Let's see: suppose it's something like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH2OH. Wait, that's more than six carbons. Let me count: CH2-CH2 is two, COO is two more, and then CH2CH2OH is two. That's six carbons? No, it's 2 (from CH2CH2) + 2 (from COO) + 2 (CH2CH2OH) = 6, but the formula would be C6H10O3, which isn't an option. So no.

Another idea: the compound is a substituted cyclohexanol with a ketone group. So cyclohexanol has a ring and an -OH. If there's a ketone substituent, that would add another O. So the formula would be C7H12O2, which is beyond the options.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a bicyclic structure. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted cyclopentene with an ester group and an -OH. But I'm getting stuck.

Wait, maybe the structure is a diethyl maleate or something similar. No, that's probably not.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like a substituted butyrolactone with an -OH group. But that would require another O.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclic hemiacetal with a double bond. But hemiacetals have two O's.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diethyl acetyl ester with a double bond elsewhere, but I'm not making progress.

Let me try to think again.

The mass fragment at 45 is likely to be CH2CH2O+ (45). So the molecule must have an ethoxy group. So which options include an ethoxy group?

Looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2 → could have an ethoxy group if part of an ester.

Option C: C6H10O2 → could have an ethoxy as part of ester.

So, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester with an ethoxy group and a double bond.

Wait, but I'm not getting the exact structure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a simple diol with a conjugated ester group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a substituted acetoxy group attached to a diene. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the molecular formula for each option and what functional groups they can have.

Option C: C6H10O2. So two oxygen atoms. That could be an ester (O2) with an -OH group, but that would require three oxygens. So that can't be. So the -OH must be from somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a ketone and an ester. But that would require another O.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a cyclic ester with a substituent that's an -OH. But that would require three O's, which isn't the case.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to make a decision.

The FTIR has a carbonyl (1700), a conjugated double bond (1650), and an -OH (3000). The NMR has vinyl H. So the structure must have an -OH, a carbonyl, and a double bond.

So, the formula must have O2 as in option C or A.

Wait, option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation 2. So perhaps a ring and a double bond.

So, a six-membered ring with a double bond and an ester group. Or a six-membered ring with a double bond and a ketone group, plus an -OH.

Wait, but that would require three O's. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a di-substituted cyclohexane with a carbonyl group and a double bond.

Wait, another approach: the mass fragment at 45 is CH2CH2O+. So if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, and the molecular ion is 114, then losing a 45 fragment would leave 69. What could 69 be? Let's see: 69 could be C5H7, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, 69 could be a benzene ring fragment (77 for toluene, but that's higher). Alternatively, 69 could be C3H7O (3*12=36 +7 +16=69? 36+7=43+16=59. No, that's 59. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment isn't from the main molecule but comes from a side chain. I'm not making progress here.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from the cleavage of an ester group. For example, in an ester, the O-CO could break, leaving an alkyl group. For example, ethyl acetate would break into CH3CO+ (43) and OCH2CH3 (73, but that's not 45). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from a ketene ion, which is R-C=O+, which would have a mass of (12 +16) =28, but that's not 45.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group with some oxygen. Wait, the fragment 45 is 45, which is close to the molecular weight of CH3CH2O (45). So that's (12*2 +1*5 +16)=24+5+16=45. So the fragment is CH2CH2O+, which would be part of an ethoxy group.

So the molecule must have an ethoxy group, hence the O in the formula. So among the options, options A and C have two O's.

So, if the structure is an ester (like ethyl something), then the formula would be something like RCOOCH2CH3. For example, if R is CH2CH=CHCH2, that would make the formula C6H10O2. Let me count:

RCOOCH2CH3 → R is CH2CH=CHCH2. So R is C4H7 with a double bond. Wait, no, R would have to be C4
