Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and take notes.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because the star is rotating, these spots modulate the brightness we observe, making the light curve vary periodically. The problem says that this situation can look similar to the presence of an exoplanet. Now, they're asking, if the star wasn't spotted, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet needed to produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve. So, the exoplanet's radius over the star's radius (Rpl/Rstar) is the target.

Hmm, okay. I think I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of that dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. The formula for the transit depth is (Rp / Rstar)^2, right? Because when a planet transits, the area blocked is the area of the planet's disk divided by the star's disk.

But wait, in this case, the star has spots, so the observed brightness variation isn't exactly the same as a planet transit. The spots cause the star's brightness to dip as they rotate into and out of view. The filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. Here, the filling factor is 20%, or 0.2. So the spots cover 20% of the star's surface, but since the star is a sphere, only one hemisphere is spotty. Wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered in spots. So in a full view, when the star isn't rotating, maybe half of the surface is covered? Or wait, no. The star is rotating, so as it spins, the spotted hemisphere comes into view and then goes away, causing the brightness to dip each half rotation.

Wait, but the problem says the spots are in one hemisphere, so when that side is facing us, we see the spots, and the other side is normal. So as the star rotates, we see a varying amount of spotted area. But the problem is about the amplitude of the brightness variation. So, when the star is viewed from Earth, the spots cause a dip in brightness because the spots are cooler and emit less light.

I think the key here is to find the equivalent dip as produced by a planet transit. But wait, the dip from the spots is not exactly the same as a planet's transit. Because the planet blocks the light entirely (assuming it's in front), but the spots only reduce the emitted light from that part of the star.

So, first, I need to calculate the brightness variation caused by the spots. Then, set that equal to the variation caused by a planet transit, and solve for the planet's radius.

Let me outline the steps.

1. Find the total change in brightness due to the spots as the star rotates.

2. Compare this change to the change from a planet transit.

3. Equate the two and solve for Rpl/Rstar.

So, starting with the brightness variation due to the spots.

The star's effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. The spots are cooler by 1000 K, so their temperature is 5000 K.

The flux from a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σ T^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

The star's total flux without any spots would be F0 = σ (6000)^4. But with spots, part of the surface emits less.

The filling factor (f) is 0.2, so 20% of the star's surface is spots. But wait, the problem says only one hemisphere is covered. So, wait, when the star is viewed from Earth, only half the surface is visible at any time. But the spots are on one hemisphere, which is half the star's surface. But the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface? Or is it 20% of the hemisphere?

Wait, the question states "a hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." Hmm. So, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's surface that is covered by spots. So the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. So total spots on the star's surface would be 0.5 (hemisphere) multiplied by 0.2 (filling factor) = 0.1 or 10% of the entire star's surface.

Wait, no. Wait, a hemisphere is half the surface. If the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere, that means 20% of the hemisphere's area is spots. So the total area covered by spots is 0.5 (hemisphere) * 0.2 (filling factor) = 0.1, so 10% of the star's total surface is spots.

So when the star rotates such that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots cover 10% of the star's total surface. So the observed flux would be the normal flux (100%) minus the flux from the spots.

Wait, but when the star is not rotating, perhaps the spotty hemisphere is either facing us or not. Wait, in reality, the star is rotating, so the spots come into view as the star spins, which would create a periodic brightness variation.

Wait, let me think again. The star has one hemisphere covered in spots. So when we view the star, as it rotates, the spots will come into view. So, the maximum area covered (when the spotty hemisphere is facing us) is 10% of the star's surface. When the other hemisphere is facing us (the non-spotty), zero spots are visible. So the brightness variation would be between when 10% of the spots are visible and when none are.

Wait, no. Because the star is a sphere, when we look at it, the visible surface is a hemisphere. So when the spotty hemisphere is on the far side, the spots are not visible. When it's on the near side, the spots are visible. But the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots occupy 20% of the visible hemisphere. So the visible area of spots is 0.2 * (π R² / 2) (since hemisphere area is 2π R² / 2 = π R²?), wait, wait. Wait, the area of a sphere is 4π R². So a hemisphere is 2π R². So the spotty area per hemisphere is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². But wait, the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere's surface. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the area covered by spots is 0.2 * (2π R² / 2) ? Wait, no. Wait, the hemisphere's surface area is 2π R². So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the area of spots visible is 0.4 π R².

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Let me simplify.

The star's total surface area is 4π R².

The spotty hemisphere has 20% of its area covered by spots. So the spotty hemisphere has an area of 2π R². 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². So the total area of spots on the entire star is 0.4 π R², because the spots are only on one hemisphere.

Wait, no. The hemisphere is one side of the star. So when the star rotates, if the spotty hemisphere is facing us, we see the spots. So the area of spots visible is 0.4 π R² (20% of the hemisphere's area). But the total area of the star we see is 2 π R² (the visible hemisphere). So the fraction of the visible area covered by spots is (0.4 π R²) / (2 π R²) ) = 0.2 or 20%. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, 20% of the visible area is covered in spots.

Wait, but that's when the entire spotty hemisphere is visible. So the variation in brightness is due to the spots being present (20% of the visible area) when the spotty hemisphere is visible, and not present when the other hemisphere is facing us.

But wait, as the star rotates, the spotty hemisphere comes into view. So the maximum dip in brightness occurs when the spotty hemisphere is fully visible, and the spots cover 20% of the visible area. So the brightness variation is determined by the difference between when the spots are visible (lower brightness) and when they're not.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum brightness occurs when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us (no spots), and the minimum when the spotty one is facing us (spots covering 20% of the visible area). So the change in flux would be the difference between normal and when spots are visible.

Wait, let me model the flux.

The total flux without any spots (F0) is σ Teff⁴ * (4π R²) / (4π d²) ) = σ Teff⁴ (R²/d²) ), but wait, perhaps I should think in terms of flux per unit area. Alternatively, the star's luminosity is L = 4π R² σ Teff⁴. So the flux at Earth (assuming distance d) is F0 = L/(4π d²) )= (4π R² σ Teff⁴)/(4π d²) ) = (R² σ Teff⁴) / d².

But when spots are present, the flux changes. Let's model the change when the spotty hemisphere is visible.

The flux when the spotty hemisphere is facing us:

The star emits normally from 80% of the visible area (non-spots), and less from the 20% covered by spots.

So the flux F is:

F = [ (1 - 0.2) * F_normal + 0.2 * F_spots ] 

Where F_normal is the flux per unit area from the non-spots, and F_spots is the flux per unit area from the spots.

F_normal = σ (6000)^4

F_spots = σ (5000)^4

So:

F = 0.8 * σ (6000)^4 + 0.2 * σ (5000)^4

The change in flux (ΔF) when the spotty hemisphere is visible compared to when it's not is:

ΔF = F - F0, but wait, when the spotty hemisphere is not visible, the flux is F0, which is the normal flux from the entire star. Wait, no. If the spotty hemisphere is not visible, we only see the non-spotty hemisphere. So the flux in that case is F0_non_spots = 0.5 * L = 0.5 * (4π R² σ (6000)^4) ) ?

Wait, maybe a better approach is to calculate the maximum and minimum fluxes.

When the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

F_spotty = (Area_visible_non_spots * F_normal + Area_visible_spots * F_spots) / (Area_visible_total)

But the area_visible_total is the area of the hemisphere we see, which is 2π R².

The area_visible_non_spots is 80% of that hemisphere, so 0.8 * 2π R² = 1.6 π R².

Wait no: the spotty hemisphere's visible area is 20% spots, so the non-spotty part is 80% of the hemisphere. So area_visible_non_spots = 0.8 * 2π R² = 1.6 π R².

Area_visible_spots = 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So the flux from the visible hemisphere when it's spotty is:

F_spotty = (1.6 π R² * σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² * σ (5000)^4) / (2π R²) )

Simplify denominator:

= [ σ (6000^4 * 1.6 + 5000^4 * 0.4 ) π R² ] / (2 π R² )

The π R² cancels, so:

F_spotty = σ [ (1.6 * 6000^4) + (0.4 * 5000^4) ) ] / 2

When the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

F_non_spotty = [ (2π R²) * σ (6000)^4 ] / (2π R²) ) = σ (6000)^4.

Wait, no. Because when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, the entire visible area (2π R²) is at 6000 K. So F_non_spotty = σ (6000^4).

But when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is less because some parts are cooler.

So the change in flux (ΔF) is F_non_spotty - F_spotty.

Wait, no. Because when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotty, which is less than F_non_spotty, which is when the non-spotty is visible.

So the maximum flux is F_non_spotty = σ (6000)^4.

The minimum flux is F_spotty = [1.6 * (6000^4) + 0.4 * (5000^4)] / 2 * σ.

Wait, no, let me compute that again.

F_spotty = [1.6 * 6000^4 + 0.4 * 5000^4] / 2 * σ.

Wait, but wait, the denominator is 2, because when you have 2π R² as the area, you're dividing by 2π R². So the division by 2 comes from that.

So compute the terms numerically.

Compute 6000^4: 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

Similarly, 5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12 = 6.25e14.

So:

1.6 * 6000^4 = 1.6 * 1.296e15 = 2.0736e15.

0.4 * 5000^4 = 0.4 * 6.25e14 = 2.5e14.

Sum: 2.0736e15 + 0.25e15 = 2.3236e15.

Divide by 2: 2.3236e15 / 2 = 1.1618e15.

Multiply by σ: F_spotty = σ * 1.1618e15.

F_non_spotty = σ * 1.296e15.

So the dip in flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is F_non_spotty - F_spotty = σ (1.296e15 - 1.1618e15) = σ (1.342e14).

So the relative change in flux is (ΔF) / F_non_spotty = (1.342e14) / (1.296e15) ≈ 0.1036, or about 10.36% dip.

Wait, that's when the spotty hemisphere is facing us. So the maximum dip is about 10.36% of the normal flux.

But wait, when the star isn't spotty, the dip would be due to a planet transit. So the planet transiting would cause a certain dip, which we can compute.

The dip when a planet transits is (Rp / Rstar)^2. Because the area blocked is the area of the planet, so (π Rp²) / (π Rstar²) ) = (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So if the planet causes a dip equal to the spotty dip, which is about 0.1036, then:

(Rp / Rstar)^2 = 0.1036.

So Rp / Rstar = sqrt(0.1036) ≈ 0.322.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32, which is close.

Wait, but another thought: the brightness variation due to the spots might not be exactly that. Because as the star rotates, the spots come into view and then leave. The maximum dip is when the spotty hemisphere is directly facing us. But perhaps the variation is symmetric, but the maximum dip is 10.36%.

Wait, but the question states that the brightness variation is due to the rotational modulation of the spots. So the amplitude would correspond to the maximum dip, which is what I calculated. So the planet's transit would have to produce the same amplitude in the light curve.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: perhaps the brightness variation is the difference between when the spots are on the near side and when they're on the far side. So the maximum dip is 10.36%, and the maximum brightness is when no spots are visible. So the amplitude is 10.36% of the star's flux.

Wait, but the planet would cause a dip of (Rp/Rstar)^2, so setting that equal to 0.1036.

So Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.1036) ≈ 0.322, which is approximately 0.32. So option D is ~0.32.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, when I computed 1.6 * 6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4, let me re-calculate the numbers.

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = 5^4 * 1e12 = 625 * 1e12 = 6.25e14.

So 1.6 * 1.296e15 = 2.0736e15.

0.4 * 6.25e14 = 2.5e14.

Adding them: 2.0736e15 + 2.5e14 = 2.3236e15.

Divide by 2: 1.1618e15.

So F_spotty = 1.1618e15 * σ.

F_non_spotty = 1.296e15 * σ.

ΔF = 1.296e15 - 1.1618e15 = 1.342e14 * σ.

So relative dip is 1.342e14 / 1.296e15 = about 0.1036, which is 10.36%.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1036 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.322.

So the answer should be D) ~0.32.

Wait, but let me think again. Another approach: perhaps the brightness variation is not the maximum dip, but the depth in the light curve caused by the spots. Maybe when the star is rotating, the spots cause a dip proportional to their area and the temperature difference.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should use the concept of the effective temperature of the spots versus the rest of the star.

Wait, perhaps the change in flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is given by:

Fractional change = [(1 - filling factor) * F_normal + filling factor * F_spots] / F_normal - 1.

Wait, that's another way to model it.

So, [(1 - f) * F_normal + f * F_spots] / F_normal - 1.

Which is (1 - f) + f*(F_spots / F_normal) - 1 = f*(F_spots/F_normal - 1).

So fractional change is f*(F_spots/F_normal - 1).

Wait, substituting:

f = 0.2 (filling factor of the hemisphere when viewed from Earth, not the entire star).

Wait, but earlier I thought f was 0.2 of the hemisphere, which is 0.1 of the star's surface. But perhaps that's not the case. Let me clarify.

The problem says the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So when the hemisphere is facing us, 20% of that hemisphere's area is spots. So the fraction of the star's surface covered when the spotty hemisphere is visible is 0.2 * (2π R²) / (4π R²) ) = 0.2 * (1/2) ) = 0.1, or 10% of the star's total surface. So when the spotty hemisphere is visible, 10% of the star's surface is spots. But wait, the star's entire surface is 4π R², so the spotty area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R², which is 0.4 π R² / 4 π R^2 = 0.1, 10% of the star's surface.

But when the star is viewed from Earth, only a hemisphere (2π R²) is visible. So the spots on the visible hemisphere would be 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². So the fraction of the visible area covered by spots is (0.4 π R²) / (2 π R²) ) = 0.2, 20%.

So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, 20% of the visible area is spots.

So using the formula for fractional change:

ΔF/F = f * (F_spots - F_normal)/F_normal.

Wait, that's another approach. Because F_spots = F_normal * (T_spot / T_normal)^4.

So F_spots = F_normal * (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So F_spots ≈ 0.4823 F_normal.

So the fractional change when the spotty area is visible is:

ΔF/F = f * (F_spots - F_normal)/F_normal.

Wait, but when the spots are visible, the flux is higher when the normal areas are visible. Wait, no, when the spots are visible, the flux is lower.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the flux when the spots are present as F_present = (1 - f) F_normal + f F_spots.

So the fractional change is (F_present - F_normal) / F_normal = [(1 - f) F_normal + f F_spots - F_normal] / F_normal = [ -f F_normal + f F_spots ] / F_normal = f (F_spots - F_normal) / F_normal.

Which is f (F_spots/F_normal - 1).

So since F_spots = (5000/6000)^4 F_normal ≈ 0.4823 F_normal.

So F_spots/F_normal ≈ 0.4823.

So:

ΔF/F ≈ f (0.4823 - 1) = 0.2 * (-0.5177) ≈ -0.1035, which is a 10.35% dip. So the same as before.

So the amplitude is about 0.1035, which is matched by a planet transit depth of (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3218, which is approximately 0.32, so option D.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star with spotty regions, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Same as the Sun, \( R_{\text{star}} \).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The brightness variation arises due to the rotational modulation of the star's surface. When the spotty hemisphere is visible, it causes a dip in brightness because the spots emit less flux.
   - The flux from a surface element is proportional to \( T^4 \) (Stefan-Boltzmann law). Thus:
     \[
     F_{\text{normal}} = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4, \quad F_{\text{spots}} = \sigma T_{\text{spots}}^4.
     \]
   - When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is a weighted average of the normal and spotted regions:
     \[
     F_{\text{spotty}} = (1 - f) F_{\text{normal}} + f F_{\text{spots}},
     \]
     where \( f = 0.2 \) is the filling factor of the spotty region.

3. **Fractional Change in Flux**:
   - The fractional change in flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F} = \frac{F_{\text{spotty}} - F_{\text{normal}}}{F_{\text{normal}}}.
     \]
   - Substituting \( F_{\text{spotty}} \) and simplifying:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F} = f \left( \frac{F_{\text{spots}}}{F_{\text{normal}}} - 1 \right).
     \]
   - Using \( \frac{F_{\text{spots}}}{F_{\text{normal}}} = \left( \frac{T_{\text{spots}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \approx 0.4823 \), we find:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F} = 0.2 \times (0.4823 - 1) = 0.2 \times (-0.5177) \approx -0.1035.
     \]
     This corresponds to a brightness dip of approximately \( 10.35\% \).

4. **Exoplanet Analogy**:
   - The brightness variation caused by a transiting exoplanet is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = \frac{\Delta F}{F}.
     \]
   - Setting \( \frac{\Delta F}{F} = 0.1035 \), we solve for \( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.322.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately \( 0.32 \). This matches option **D**.

ANSWER: D
