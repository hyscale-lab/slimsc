Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about light propagating through a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

The question says: A light beam is moving through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. The options are given as A to D.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, and towards the observer. Wait, same direction as the beam. So if the light is going towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer in the same direction, then the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. Or maybe the light is moving through the glass which is moving towards the observer?

Wait, maybe I should draw a diagram. Let's imagine the lab frame. The observer is at rest. The glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v. The light is propagating through the glass, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. Oh, so the beam is going towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer as well. So the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion.

Wait, but wait, if the light is in the glass, which has an index of refraction n, then normally the speed of light in the glass is c/n, where c is the speed in a vacuum. But since the glass itself is moving, perhaps we need to consider the relative speed of the light as observed in the lab frame.

Wait, but I'm a bit rusty on this. Do we use Galilean transformations here, or maybe consider relativistic effects? The question mentions that the speed of light in vacuum is c=1, so perhaps it's using units where c=1, but I'm not sure about the approach.

Wait, I'm trying to remember. When the medium itself is moving, how does that affect the speed of light in that medium? Let's think about it. The speed of light in a medium depends on the properties of the medium, not on the motion of the medium relative to the observer. So even if the glass is moving, the speed of light within the glass would still be c/n, but perhaps the direction or the observed speed might be affected by the motion of the glass.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem is about the speed, not the direction. So if the glass is moving, does it affect the speed of light in the glass as seen by the lab frame?

I think the key here is whether the speed of light in the medium depends on the velocity of the medium. From what I remember, the speed of light in a medium is given by c/n, which is a property of the medium itself, independent of its motion. So the speed of light in the glass (as measured in the rest frame of the glass) is v_glass = c/n.

But wait, the glass is moving relative to the lab frame. So perhaps we need to consider how the lab measures the speed of the light, which is moving at v_glass in the glass's frame.

So, this becomes a problem of transforming velocities from one frame to another. Since the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, and the light is moving at v_glass in the glass's frame, how is the light's speed seen in the lab frame?

Wait, in the glass's frame, the light is moving at v_glass = c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion. So from the lab frame, which is moving at velocity -v relative to the glass (since the glass is moving at v towards the observer), the velocity of the light would be v_light = v_glass + v, but that's under Galilean addition, which is only accurate at non-relativistic speeds.

Wait, but wait. If the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light, then from the lab frame, the light's speed would be v_light = v_glass (in glass) + v. Because the glass's movement adds to the light's speed.

But wait, that would give v_light = (c/n) + v. But that can
