Okay, so I have this question about neutrino flux from the Sun, and I'm supposed to figure out the ratio between two energy bands after a certain event. Hmm, let me think.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago, and all other reactions are still happening. I need to find the ratio of flux in two bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2).

Wait, first, I should remember what the pp-III branch is. Oh right, the proton-proton chain in the Sun's core. The pp-III branch is a part of that chain where three helium-4 nuclei combine to form carbon-12. So, in the pp-III process, the main reaction is He3 + He3 → He4 + two protons.

Neutrinos are produced in several steps of the proton-proton chain. The main ones are the pep (proton-electron-proton) reaction, the main (pp-I) reaction, and the pp-III as part of the chain. Each of these contributes to the neutrino flux at different energies.

The main neutrinos from the Sun are the electron neutrinos. The flux from the Sun is a combination of different neutrino production processes. The main contributors are the pep, pp-I, and pp-III reactions. Each produces neutrinos at different energies.

For the pp-I branch, the main neutrinos are produced at higher energies, around 862 keV, I recall. Because in the pp-I reaction, a boron-8 nucleus decays into Be-8, which then captures a proton to form B-9, emitting a neutrino. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again. The reaction is: 2 protons + boron-8 → carbon-9, which emits a neutrino in the process. The energy of the neutrino is about 862 keV because that's the Q-value of the reaction.

On the other hand, the pp-III branch produces neutrinos at lower energies. The process is He3 + He3 → He4 + 2 protons. This reaction emits two neutrinos, but each has lower energy, around 600 keV or something like that. Wait, no. Wait, the Q-value for each neutrino in the pp-III reaction is about 370 keV each, but wait, maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, the main pp-I reaction produces high-energy neutrinos around 862 keV. The pp-III reaction is part of the later stages, and the neutrinos from that are lower in energy. So, the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are in the 400-600 keV range, perhaps. Because I think the pp-III reaction emits neutrinos with lower energy than the main pp-I.

So, the main neutrino flux from the Sun comes from the main pp-I process, which produces neutrinos at around 862 keV. The pp-III process contributes neutrinos at lower energies, and the pep process at even lower, around 140 keV maybe.

Now, the question is about the flux ratio when the pp-III branch suddenly stops. So before the stop, the pp-III was contributing neutrinos. After it stops, that contribution is gone, but other branches (like pp-I and pep) continue.

Wait, but the question is about the neutrino flux in two specific energy bands: 700-800 (band 1) and 800-900 (band 2). So I need to figure out which of these bands are affected by the pp-III stopping.

So, the main pp-I neutrinos are around 862 keV. So the band 800-900 keV (band 2) would capture those, because 862 is in that range. The pp-III neutrinos are lower, like around 400-600 keV, so they would fall into the 700-800 keV band? Wait, no. 400-600 is lower than 700. So band 1 is 700-800, which is higher than where pp-III neutrinos are. So the pp-III neutrinos are in a lower energy band than band 1.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if pp-III produces neutrinos at lower energies, then the 700-800 keV band is higher than their energy. So, the pp-III neutrinos would contribute to the lower energy bands than band 1.

Wait, but what about the main pp-I neutrinos? They are at 862 keV, so in band 2 (800-900).

So the question is, if the pp-III branch suddenly stops, what does that do to the neutrino flux in each band.

So, the flux in each band is determined by the contributions from the different reactions. Let's break it down.

Before the pp-III stopped, the Sun's neutrino flux had contributions from:

- pep: low energy (~140 keV)
- pp-I: ~862 keV
- pp-III: lower, maybe 300-600 keV

After the pp-III stops, that contribution is gone.

So, for band 1 (700-800 keV), the main contribution is from the pp-III neutrinos. Because if pp-III neutrinos were in that range, but earlier I thought they were lower. Hmm, perhaps I should double-check the neutrino energies.

Wait, in the proton-proton chain, the main and the other branches produce different neutrinos.

The main pp-I reaction produces a neutrino when a boron-8 nucleus captures an electron to become neutral carbon-9, emitting a neutrino. The energy of this neutrino is about 862 keV.

The pp-III branch involves the fusion of two helium-3 nuclei to form helium-4, which then captures two protons to form carbon-12. The neutrinos in this process come from the decay of beryllium-7, which captures a proton to form boron-8, emitting a neutrino. The energy of these neutrinos is approximately 420 keV. So, the pp-III neutrinos have lower energy than the main pp-I.

So, the pp-III neutrinos are around 420 keV, which falls into the 400-600 keV band. So, band 1 is 700-800 keV, which is higher than that. So, pp-III neutrinos don't contribute to band 1.

Wait, that's confusing. So, if the pp-III neutrinos are around 420 keV, they wouldn't be in the 700-800 keV band. So, the 700-800 keV band would not be affected by the pp-III stopping.

Wait, so if the pp-III contributes neutrinos at 420 keV, then the flux in band 1 (700-800) is not affected, because that's higher than the pp-III neutrinos. So, the flux in band 1 comes from higher energy processes, perhaps from the main pp-I reaction.

Wait, but the main pp-I neutrinos are at 862, which is in band 2 (800-900). So, the flux in band 2 is mainly from pp-I.

So, if the pp-III branch suddenly stops, what happens to the neutrino flux in each band? Well, the pp-III neutrinos were in the 400-600 keV band, but the question is about 700-800 and 800-900.

So if pp-III stops, the neutrinos from that process stop coming in. But since they are at lower energies, this doesn't directly affect bands 1 and 2. So the flux in bands 1 and 2 would remain the same as before, perhaps? But wait, what if there's another process contributing to band 1?

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Could the pp-III branch's neutrinos contribute to band 1? Let me think. No, because 420 is below 700. So, the 700-800 keV band would receive neutrinos from other sources, but if pp-III is stopped, perhaps some other process steps in.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the neutrino flux's dependence on the source. So, when pp-III stops, the only neutrinos that are affected are those from pp-III, which are at lower energies. So, bands 1 and 2 are higher energy and not directly affected.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's approach it differently. The question is what's the ratio of band 1 to band 2 after the pp-III branch stops.

Before the pp-III stopped, the neutrino flux in each band would be:

- Band 1: 700-800 keV. Main contributors: perhaps the pp-III neutrinos? Wait, no, because pp-III is at 420. Are there other processes contributing to 700-800 keV? Or is band 1 getting neutrinos from other reactions?

Alternatively, maybe the main contributions to band 1 are from the main pp-I reaction, but at 862 keV, which is in band 2. So, perhaps the main source for band 1 is the same as for band 2, but at different energies.

Wait, perhaps the question is more about the dependence of the neutrino flux on the source. If the pp-III stops, perhaps the main pp-I is still running, so the high-energy neutrinos (band 2) would still be present, while the lower-energy neutrinos (like band 1) may have less.

But wait, the band 1 is 700-800, which is higher than the pp-III neutrinos. So without the pp-III, does the flux in band 1 drop? Or not, since pp-III doesn't contribute to band 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the band 1 is getting neutrinos from the decay of other particles that are part of the same process as the pp-III. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the main neutrino flux comes from the main pp-I process, which emits at 862 keV (band 2), and the pp-III contributes to lower energy neutrinos not in these bands. So, if pp-III stops, the lower energy neutrinos (which aren't in bands 1 or 2) would drop, but bands 1 and 2 are unaffected.

In that case, the flux in band 1 and band 2 remains the same as before. So their ratio would be the same as before. What was the ratio before?

Wait, the main pp-I neutrinos are in band 2. The band 1 (700-800) mainly has neutrinos from the pp-III, but wait, no, pp-III is 420. So perhaps the only main contribution to band 1 is from another process.

Alternatively, perhaps the band 1 is getting more neutrinos from the same source as band 2, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the main source of neutrinos at 700-800 is from the main pp-I reaction, but that can't be because the main pp-I is at 862, which is in band 2.

Wait, maybe the neutrinos are spread out in a spectrum. So, the main pp-I produces neutrinos at 862 keV, but maybe there is a continuum. So band 2 is capturing the peak at 862, and band 1 captures some lower-energy neutrinos from the same process.

If that's the case, then the pp-III process contributes to lower energies, but perhaps the main pp-I process has a distribution. So, if the pp-III stops, perhaps the main pp-I's flux remains the same, so the ratio between bands 1 and 2 would be the same as before.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the typical solar neutrino spectrum.

The main contributors to the solar neutrino flux are:

1. The pep reaction: produces neutrinos at about 1.4 MeV, but wait, no, the pep neutrinos are lower. Wait, maybe around 1.4 MeV? Or is it lower?

Wait, no, the pep reaction is part of the proton-proton chain. The reaction is p + p + e⁻ → d + ν_e. The Q-value for this reaction is about 1.42 MeV, so the neutrino energy is about 1.42 MeV.

The pp-I reaction: Beryllium-8 captures a proton to become boron-9, emitting a neutrino. The Q-value is about 862 keV, so neutrino energy is around 862 keV.

The pp-III reaction: The neutrino energy is around 420 keV, as I thought earlier.

So the neutrino spectrum:

- pep: ~1.4 MeV

- pp-I: ~0.86 MeV (862 keV)

- pp-III: ~0.42 MeV (420 keV)

So, band 1 is 700-800 keV. The main pp-I neutrino is at 862, so that's in band 2.

Wait, but the pp-I neutrinos are at 862 keV. So band 2 (800-900) captures that. What about band 1? Are there any neutrinos from main pp-I in band 1?

Because the neutrino energies are specific, not a continuous spectrum. So each reaction emits neutrinos at a specific energy. So, for band 1 (700-800), the only possible neutrinos would be from another process.

Wait, maybe the pp-III process produces a neutrino at 420, which is below band 1. So band 1 may not receive any neutrinos from the pp-III.

But wait, maybe the pp-III contributes a distribution. Or perhaps, other processes? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the main pp-I neutrinos are the only ones in band 2, and band 1 has no neutrinos from the pp-III. So, perhaps in band 1, the neutrinos come from another process, like the pep reaction.

Wait, the pep reaction produces neutrinos at about
