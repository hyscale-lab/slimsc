Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should prioritize observing that one. Let me think through the problem step by step.

So, both planets have the same mass. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1 is closer to its star since the orbital period is shorter when you're closer, right? Because of Kepler's third law, which says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So if Planet_1's period is P1 and Planet_2's is P2, then P1 = P2 / 3. 

Now, the host stars have the same radii, but different masses. The star for Planet_1 is twice as massive as the star for Planet_2. So, M1 = 2*M2. But the stars' radii are R1 = R2 because both host stars are the same size. Interesting.

Wait, but when it comes to the transit probability, what factors determine that? I remember that the probability depends on the relative size of the planet's orbit compared to the star's size. The transit probability (P) is approximately (R_planet / R_star)² * (a / (a + R_star))^2, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Alternatively, I think the probability is roughly proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (a / (a + R_star))^2, but maybe I should think in terms of how often the planet's orbital plane aligns with our line of sight.

Wait, another way: the probability of a transit is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter. Hmm, maybe that's not quite right, but let me think. The probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital radius, squared? Or maybe it's (R_planet / R_star) * (R_star / a_planet), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability is given by (R_star + R_planet)^2 / a^2, but that might not be right. Alternatively, the transit probability is (R_planet / a) * (R_star / a), but perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think the geometric probability of a transit is given by (R_star
