Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem, and I'm a bit confused. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium relative to a lab observer. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with light and moving media, things get a bit tricky because of relativity and how different frames perceive things.

So the setup: a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer. The question is, what's the speed of light in the glass as measured by the lab observer?

Wait, I think in the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light would be c/n, right? Because the index of refraction n relates to how much the medium slows the light down. So normally, without any movement, the speed is c/n.

But now the glass is moving. So I need to find the speed from the lab's perspective. This sounds like a problem involving the addition of velocities in special relativity. Oh wait, but the glass is moving at v, which I suppose is much smaller than c, because if v were significant compared to c, the problem would be more complicated. But I don't know if that's the case here. The problem doesn't specify, so I guess I should proceed with the relativistic approach.

Wait, no, in special relativity, the velocity addition formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²), where u is the velocity of the object in the original frame, and v is the velocity of the frame moving relative to the original. But wait, here the glass is moving. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass, so from the lab's perspective, how does that affect the light's speed?

Hold on, in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at c/n. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving at v. So using the velocity addition formula, the lab would measure the light's speed as (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²), where u is the speed of light in the glass's frame, which is c/n.

Wait, but wait a second. I'm mixing up frames here. Let me clarify: the glass's rest frame (let's call it S') is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame (S). The light is moving at u' = c/n in S'. So to find u, the speed in S, I need to apply the Lorentz transformation for velocities.

The formula for adding velocities is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/(c²)).

So substituting u' = c/n, we get u = (c/n + v) / [1 + ( (c/n) v ) / c² ].

Wait, let me compute the denominator. The denominator is 1 + (u' v)/c². Substituting u' = c/n:

Denominator = 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² = 1 + (v/(n c)).

So the whole expression becomes (c/n + v) / (1 + v/(n c)).

Wait, but let's factor that denominator. Let me write it as [ (1) + (v)/(n c) ) ].

So the numerator is (c + n v)/n, because c/n is same as c/(n), and adding v gives c/(n) + v = [c + n v]/n.

Wait no, wait. Let me compute the numerator correctly: (c/n) + v. That's (c + n v)/n.

Wait, that's right. So numerator is (c + n v)/n.

Denominator is [1 + v/(n c)] = [n c + v]/(n c). Because 1 is n c/(n c), so adding v/(n c) gives (n c + v)/(n c).

So now putting it all together, u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ].

Simplify the division: the numerator (c + n v)/n multiplied by the reciprocal of the denominator (n c / (n c + v)).

So:

u = [ (c + n v) / n ] * [ (n c + v) / (n c) ) ].

Wait, wait, wait. Let me see. The denominator of the denominator is (n c + v) over (n c). So when you take reciprocal, it's (n c + v)/(n c) becomes denominator, so reciprocal is (n c) / (n c + v).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the division:

u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v) / (n c) ) ]

Which is equal to [ (c +n v)/n ] * [ (n c) / (n c + v) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator becomes (c + n v) * n c.

Denominator becomes n * (n c + v).

So the n's in numerator and denominator cancel.

So u = (c (c +n v)) / (n c + v).

Wait, that's the same as:

u = c (c + n v)/(n c + v)

But wait, the options don't look like they have c in the numerator. Hmm. The options are all in terms of 1 and n and v.

Wait, the question states to take c=1. Oh, right! Because the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1. So wherever c appears, we can substitute 1.

So let me substitute c=1. So u = [ (1 + n v) / n ] / [ (n * 1 + v ) / (n * 1) ) ]

Wait, that's a bit messy. Let me recompute the expression with c=1.

So after substitution, we have:

u = [ (1 + n v)/n ] / [ (n + v)/n ]

Because the denominator becomes (n*1 + v)/(n*1) = (n + v)/n.

So now u = [ (1 + n v)/n ] * [ n / (n + v) ) ]

The n in numerator and denominator cancels out.

So u = (1 + n v) / (n + v).

Looking at the options, that's option A: (1 +n v)/(n +v).

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because in the glass's frame, the light's speed is c/n, and when the glass moves, we'd apply the relativistic addition. So I think that's correct.

Alternatively, I recall that in some cases, the speed of light remains c in any frame, but that's in a vacuum. But here, the light is in a medium, so its speed is c/n in the glass's frame. But when the glass is moving, the lab would see it moving at a different speed.

Wait, but according to the velocity addition formula, the speed is (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/(c^2)). So when u' is c/n, and c=1: u = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (v/(n)) )

But wait, that would be ( (1 + n v)/n ) / ( (n + v)/n )

Which again gives (1 + n v)/(n + v), same as before.

So the answer should be option A: (1 +n v)/(n +v).

Wait, but I just thought about it again. If the medium is moving at velocity v, and the light is moving in the same direction, so the lab frame would see the light moving at a higher speed than in the medium, but under relativity, the speed can't exceed c. Wait, but here (1 +n v)/(n +v) when v is positive (since the glass is moving towards the observer in the same direction as the beam), so when n is greater than 1 (which it is), and v is positive, the numerator and denominator are both positive.

Wait, but what if v is a significant fraction of c? Let's test for a case where, say, n=1 (vacuum, but glass has higher n, but let's say n=1 for simplicity). Then the speed would be (1 + v)/(1 +v) = 1, which makes sense. Because if the medium is vacuum (n=1), and moving at speed v, then in the lab frame, the light would still be moving at c=1.

Wait, but when n=1, the speed inside the medium is 1, so the velocity addition would give (1 +v)/(1 +v) =1. So that's correct.

Another test: if v is zero, then the speed is (1 +0)/(n +0) =1/n, which is correct.

Wait, but when the glass is moving, according to the velocity addition formula, the speed of light in the lab frame would be ( (u' + v) ) / (1 + (u' v)/c² ). So assuming u' is c/n, substituting c=1, u' is 1/n.

So u = [ (1/n + v) ] / (1 + (v * (1/n) ) )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n:

u = [ (1 + n v) ] / [ n + v ]

Which is exactly option A.

So the answer should be A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \( u' = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( n \) is the index of refraction of the glass and \( c = 1 \) (as given in the problem). The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, towards the observer.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) (since \( c = 1 \)) and \( c^2 = 1 \), the formula becomes:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

To simplify, multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n \):

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches the expression given in option A. Testing edge cases confirms the result:
- If \( v = 0 \), the speed of light in the glass is \( \frac{1}{n} \), which is correct.
- If \( n = 1 \) (vacuum), the speed of light remains \( 1 \), consistent with the invariance of the speed of light in a vacuum.
- If \( v \) is small compared to \( c \), the result aligns with classical velocity addition.

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
\frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Answer: A
