Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to reach a certain speed. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.

The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. And X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So the isotope would be Li-6 because Li typically has 3 protons, and with 3 neutrons, the mass number is 3+3=6. So the nucleus in question is Li-6.

I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle depends on its mass and velocity. Oh right, the formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 - v²/c²). Since the speed here is 0.96c, I need to compute gamma first.

Let me calculate gamma. So v is 0.96c. Plugging into the gamma formula: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). Let me compute (0.96)^2: 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Then the square root of 0.0784 is... let's see, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Wait, 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Hmm, wait, let me double-check that. 0.28 is 28/100, so reciprocal is 100/28. 100 divided by 28 is approximately 3.5714.

So the Lorentz factor gamma is about 3.5714. Now, to find the energy, I need the rest mass of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6; its mass is the sum of the masses of the protons and neutrons. Wait, but actually, it's easier to use the atomic mass. Or perhaps I should look up the mass of a Li-6 nucleus. Oh right, I think the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). Wait, but wait a second: the actual mass of Li-6 is a bit less than 6u because the binding energy reduces the mass. Hmm, but for this problem, maybe I'm supposed to approximate it as 6u. Or perhaps use the exact value.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The question gives X as Li with 3 neutrons, which is Li-6. The mass number is 6, so the nucleus is composed of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u, and a neutron is about 1.008665 u. So let me compute the exact mass.

Mass of 3 protons: 3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828 u.
Mass of 3 neutrons: 3 * 1.008665 = 3.025995 u.
Total: 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 u.

Wait, but the actual mass of Li-6 is slightly less due to the mass defect from binding energy. Oh right, the exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.01345 u. Because when you have a nucleus, the actual mass is less than the sum of its parts. Hmm, so perhaps I should use 6.01345 u for the nucleus mass. Alternatively, I might have to use
