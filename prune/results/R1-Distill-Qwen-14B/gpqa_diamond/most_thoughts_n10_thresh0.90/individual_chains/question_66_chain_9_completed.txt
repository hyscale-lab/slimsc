Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT, and which symmetries the operators must respect. Hmm, I remember from my studies that SMEFT is a framework that extends the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension and the symmetries they conserve.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. Let's think about each one.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I think this is a big one. The Standard Model itself respects Lorentz symmetry, so any effective theory built from it should too. Operators in SMEFT are constructed with Lorentz indices, so they must be Lorentz-invariant. So Lorentz (option 1) is definitely a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, isn't Poincare symmetry a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations? Oh right, because Poincare includes things like momentum conservation. But wait, in SMEFT, we're dealing with effective operators that have higher dimensions. Those operators might not be translationally invariant, but wait no, SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. Wait, but all the operators in SMEFT are local, so they should respect local Lorentz symmetry, which is a part of Poincare. But I'm a bit fuzzy here. Wait, the effective theory is built in a way that respects the same symmetries as the Standard Model, which includes Poincare. So do the operators themselves respect Poincare symmetry? Or is it that the entire theory respects Poincare because the operators are part of a Lorentz-invariant framework? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think again. Poincare includes translations, but in the SMEFT, operators are written as local terms. So each operator is a local Lorentz scalar, so they are Poincare invariant. Or wait, maybe not necessarily? Because effective operators can have higher dimensions, but their form is such that they don't break Lorentz or Poincare. But I'm not 100% confident on whether all SMEFT operators must respect Poincare. Hmm.

Moving on, CP symmetry. I remember that the Standard Model doesn't respect CP symmetry in general. For example, CP violation is observed in certain processes, like in the CKM matrix. So if the Standard Model itself doesn't have CP symmetry, then the effective operators shouldn't necessarily have to respect it either. Unless the operators are constructed in a way to preserve some symmetry. Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if the Standard Model doesn't have CP symmetry, then the SMEFT operators probably don't have to either. So maybe CP symmetry isn't a must. So option 3, CP symmetry, isn't necessarily required.

CPT symmetry. Now, I think CPT is a big one. The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry. C is charge conjugation, P is parity, T is time reversal. CPT is the combination that's a symmetry. Because the theory is Lorentz-invariant, CPT must be respected. Because in a Lorentz-invariant theory, the combination of CPT is a symmetry. So any operator in the SMEFT must respect CPT. So option 4 is definitely required.

Wait, but what about whether operators can violate individual symmetries like C, P, or T? I think they can. For example, the CKM matrix allows for CP violation, so operators can violate CP. But CPT must be respected because the theory is Lorentz-invariant. So all operators must respect CPT.

So let's recap the options. The question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: Yes, because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. Each operator must be a Lorentz scalar.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Not entirely sure. Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. The operators are built in a way that they are part of a Lorentz-invariant theory, but do they each individually respect Poincare? SMEFT operators are local, so they should respect local Lorentz and translation invariance. Wait, but translation invariance usually comes from momentum conservation, which is handled by the derivatives in the Lagrangian. Wait, but each operator is a local term, so they should respect translation invariance. Hmm, perhaps that's correct. So Poincare symmetry (option 2) must also be respected.

Wait, but wait a second. The effective operators are higher-dimensional and are part of the Lagrangian. The entire theory must be Poincare-invariant, but each operator does not necessarily have to be Poincare-invariant on its own. Or do they? Because each operator is a local term, they must be invariant under local Lorentz transformations, but what about translations? Wait, translation invariance is part of Poincare. So each operator must respect translation invariance as well. So yes, each operator must be translationally invariant. Because if you shift the coordinates, the Lagrangian must remain the same. So each operator must respect that.

So then options 1 and 2 are both required.

Wait, but the Poincare group includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. So if the operators are part of a theory that is Poincare-invariant, then each operator should be a Poincare scalar. So yes, each operator must respect Poincare symmetry.

So, putting it together: operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). What about CP (3)? Since the Standard Model doesn't require CP, and SMEFT can include operators that violate CP, so CP isn't a must. So the operators don't have to respect CP.

So the correct symmetries that must be respected are 1, 2, and 4. Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2
B)3,4
C)1,2,4
D)1,3,4

Wait, but earlier I thought that all operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. So that would be 1,2,4. So option C.

Wait, but wait again. Wait, Poincare includes Lorentz, so if operators respect Lorentz, do they automatically respect Poincare? Or are these separate?

Wait, no. Because Poincare includes translations. So operators must respect translations (being part of a translation-invariant theory). So each operator must be translationally invariant. So operators must respect both Lorentz and translation, hence Poincare.

So 1, 2, and 4. So option C is the answer.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think again.

In SMEFT, all operators are constructed as Lorentz scalars. So each operator must transform as a Lorentz scalar. Lorentz symmetry (1) is a must. Poincare symmetry (2) is a combination of Lorentz and translations. Since each operator must be a local scalar, they must also respect translations. So yes, option 2 must be respected.

As for CPT (4), since the theory is Lorentz-invariant, CPT must be a symmetry. So all operators must respect CPT.

CP (3) is not necessarily respected because, as in the Standard Model, you can have CP violation.

So the answer should include 1,2,4. Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4.

Wait, but earlier I thought about the question. The options are 1,2 (A), 3,4 (B), 1,2,4 (C), 1,3,4 (D).

So the correct answer would be option C. But wait, I remember that CPT is a combination of C, P, and T, so you can have operators that violate C, P, or T individually, but their combination must be conserved. So the operators must respect CPT, but not necessarily CP.

So yes, all operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

Wait, but wait again. Isn't Poincare symmetry automatically satisfied if the Lagrangian is Lorentz-invariant and translationally invariant? Since operators are part of the Lagrangian, which is a sum of Poincare scalars, each term must be a Poincare scalar. So yes, each operator must be a Poincare scalar.

So the correct answer is option C: 1,2,4.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed to extend the Standard Model while respecting the symmetries of the Standard Model. Operators in SMEFT are higher-dimensional terms that must adhere to certain symmetries. Let us analyze the given options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, and all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. This is because the operators are constructed as Lorentz scalars, ensuring that the theory remains consistent with special relativity.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translation invariance. Since SMEFT operators are part of a Lorentz-invariant framework and are local terms, they must respect translation invariance as well. Thus, all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model does not respect CP symmetry in general (e.g., CP violation is observed in certain processes). Consequently, SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry. Operators in SMEFT can violate CP individually, as long as they respect other required symmetries.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry, and since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, it must also respect CPT symmetry. This symmetry ensures the combination of charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T) is conserved.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are **Lorentz symmetry (1)**, **Poincaré symmetry (2)**, and **CPT symmetry (4)**. CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily required, as the Standard Model and SMEFT can include operators that violate CP.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
