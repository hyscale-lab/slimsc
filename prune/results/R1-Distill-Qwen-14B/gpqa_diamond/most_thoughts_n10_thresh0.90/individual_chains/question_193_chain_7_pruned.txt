Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So the equation is N ∝ 1/parallax^5, which I can write as N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. 

Wait, but parallax and distance are related. Oh right, parallax (in parsecs) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/distance, or distance = 1/plx. So if I have plx in parsecs, then distance d is in parsecs as well. So substituting that, plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. 

So, the given relationship is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Let me express N in terms of d. Since plx is 1/d, 1/plx would be d. So 1/plx^5 is d^5. So substituting, N ∝ d^5. 

Wait, but the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance r. So it's about how N changes as a function of r. If N is proportional to d^5, then the number increases rapidly as we go further. 

Wait, no, wait. Wait, let me think again. The way the question is phrased is a bit confusing. It says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So when parallax is small (which means distance is large, because plx = 1/d), the number of stars is high. Because if plx is small, 1/plx^5 is large. So high number of stars at larger distances? That seems counterintuitive because I thought stars are more numerous in the direction where we can see more of them (closer). But maybe that's a different consideration.

Wait, but in this question, the number of stars is given as varying as 1/plx^5. So, in the calculation, we found N ∝ d^5. So for each unit increase in distance d, how does the number change? So the number of stars in a region would be proportional to d^5. But wait, the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?"

Wait, perhaps I
