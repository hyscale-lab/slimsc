Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the question says that two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, have been detected via the RV method. So the researchers know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, both have circular orbits. The host stars are interesting: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, but that probably doesn't affect the transit probability directly.

The main point here is the transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. Also, the size of the star plays a big role because a larger star makes the transit less probable if the planet is the same size.

Wait, the formula for the transit probability is something like (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (some function of the orbital parameters). Oh wait, no, that's the depth of the transit. The actual probability of a transit occurring is the ratio of the size of the star's disk to the planet's orbital distance, considering the planet's orbital plane relative to our line of sight.

Wait, more accurately, the transit probability is given by (R_s + R_p) / a, where a is the semi-major axis. But wait, I think it's actually (R_p / a) squared times (something else), but wait no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, maybe I should think geometrically. The probability that a planet transits is the ratio of the area of the star's disk to the area of the orbit's cross-section. Alternatively, it's the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter. Because the chance that the planet's path, when seen edge-on, passes in front of the star.

Wait, more precisely, the transit probability depends on the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. If the planet's orbit is exactly edge-on, then we see the transit. If it's inclined, we don't. So the probability is the fraction of the orbit's possible inclinations that would result in a transit.
