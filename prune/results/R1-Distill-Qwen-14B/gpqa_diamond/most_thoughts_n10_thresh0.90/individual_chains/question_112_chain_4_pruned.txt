Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and figure out what I need to do.

Alright, the question is about an electron's state described by |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> states are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I need to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of that operator has elements A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and zero otherwise. Also, I have to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, let me break this down into steps.

First, I should probably normalize the given state |alpha> because it's given as proportional. So the state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. To find the actual state, I need to divide by the norm.

The norm of a vector |psi> is sqrt( <psi|psi> ). So for |alpha>, the inner product is (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2 -i). Let's compute that.

Wait, wait, no: for a two-component state, when you have |psi> = a|up> + b|down>, the inner product is a* a + b* b. Because |up> and |down> are orthonormal.

So, a is (1+i), so a* is (1 - i). Similarly, b is (2 - i), so b* is (2 + i).

So, |a|^2 is (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1 = 2. And |b|^2 is (2 -i)(2 +i) = 4 +1 =5. So the norm squared is 2 +5=7. So the norm is sqrt(7). Therefore, the normalized state |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Okay, so now I have the normalized state.

Next, I need to find the eigenstates of the operator A. Wait, the operator's matrix is given: A_ij = hbar/2 if i != j, else zero. So in the basis of |up> and |down>, the matrix looks like this:

A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]

Wait, because for a 2x2 matrix, i and j run from 1 and 2. So A_{11}=0, A_{22}=0, and A_{12}=A_{21}=hbar/2.

Hmm, this matrix is actually the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X is [[0 1],[1 0]], so A is (hbar/2) σ_x.

Eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively. So for operator A, the eigenstates would have eigenvalues ± hbar/2.

Wait, because A = (hbar/2) σ_x. So the eigenvalues are (hbar/2)*1 and (hbar/2)*(-1).

So the eigenstates are:

|+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2),

|-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate when in state |alpha>, I need to find the overlap between |alpha> and each eigenstate |+> and |->.

Wait, but wait: the question says "the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator." So for each eigenstate, |+> and |->, we calculate the probability by taking the square of the amplitude.

So, I need to compute the inner products < + | alpha > and < - | alpha >, then square their magnitudes to get probabilities.

Let me write |alpha> normalized:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Expressed as a vector, in the basis |up>, |down>, this is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Similarly, |+> is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 1]^T,

and |-> is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, -1]^T.

So, the inner product < + | alpha > is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 1] multiplied by the vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ].

Wait, but wait: when you take the inner product in Dirac notation, you have to conjugate the first vector. So < + | alpha > is (1/sqrt(2)) [1*, 1*] times the vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ].

Wait, no, wait: In Dirac notation, < + | alpha > is [ <+| ] multiplied by |alpha>.

Since |+> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), then <+| is ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2).

So the inner product would be (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

Because <+| up> = 1/sqrt(2), and <+| down> =1/sqrt(2).

So, let me compute this:

[ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] / sqrt(2) * 1/sqrt(7)

The numerator: (1+i +2 -i ) = 3. So 3/( sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) ) ) = 3 / sqrt(14).

The amplitude is 3/sqrt(14).

The probability is the square of the magnitude: (3^2)/(14) )= 9/14 ≈ 0.642857...

Which is approximately 0.64.

Similarly, for the other eigenstate |->, the inner product < - | alpha > is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7).

Compute numerator: (1+i) - (2 -i) = 1 + i -2 +i = (-1 + 2i).

So the amplitude is (-1 + 2i) / ( sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) ) ) = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.3571.

Wait wait, but wait a second. Wait, let's check that.

Wait, the inner product for |-> is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] * (1/sqrt(7)).

So it's (1+i -2 +i) * 1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

Which is (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14).

The square of the magnitude is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 =1 +4=5, so 5/14 ≈0.357.

Wait, but wait, 9/14 is about 0.64, and 5/14 is about 0.357. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

Wait, but wait, adding them gives 14/14=1, which is correct.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.357.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7.

But 0.36 is 9/25, which is 0.36. Wait 5/14 is ~0.357, which is close to 0.36.

Hmm, so the first two probabilities would fit option A.

But let me also check other options. Option D has 0.61 and 0.29. That doesn't fit. So perhaps option A is the first part.

Now, the next part is finding the average value of the operator A.

The average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is (hbar/2) σ_x, and σ_x has expectation value in the state alpha.

So expectation value is (hbar/2) * <alpha| σ_x |alpha>.

Alternatively, compute <alpha| A |alpha> directly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to write the state |alpha> as a vector and compute A acting on it, then take the inner product.

Wait, let's proceed step by step.

Matrix A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

|alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So A|alpha> is:

First component: 0 * (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (hbar/2) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) = (hbar/2) (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Second component: (hbar/2) (1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0 * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) )= (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7).

So A|alpha> = [ (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7), (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> is the inner product, which is (1/sqrt(7))*(1-i) [ first component ] + (1/sqrt(7))*(2 +i) [ second component ].

So let's compute each term:

First term: (1-i) * (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7) = (hbar/(2 sqrt(7))) ) (1-i)(2 -i).

Second term: (2 +i) * (hbar/2)(1 +i)/sqrt(7) = (hbar/(2 sqrt(7))) ) (2 +i)(1 +i).

Compute each product.

First product: (1-i)(2 -i)= 1*2 +1*(-i) -i*2 +i*i = 2 -i -2i + (-1) = (2-1) + (-i -2i) = 1 -3i.

Second product: (2 +i)(1 +i)=2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i =2 +2i +i + i² = 2 +3i -1= 1 +3i.

So the two terms:

First term: (hbar/(2 sqrt(7))) )
