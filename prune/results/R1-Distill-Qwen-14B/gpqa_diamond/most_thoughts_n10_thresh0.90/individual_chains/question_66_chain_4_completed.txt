Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model (SM) plus higher-dimensional operators to account for beyond the SM physics. These operators are usually classified by their dimension, like dimension six, seven, etc.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these four.

Wait, I should think about what each of these symmetries entails. Lorentz symmetry is about how the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to each other. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations in space and time. So if an operator doesn't respect Poincare, does that mean it's not respecting Lorentz either? Or are they separate?

In SMEFT, all the operators are Lorentz invariant because the SM itself is Lorentz invariant, and SMEFT is built on top of it. So all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. That would make option 1 correct.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes translations. SMEFT operators are written in a way that is Poincare invariant because they are built from the SM fields, which themselves respect Poincare. So I think Poincare is also a symmetry that SMEFT operators must respect. So option 2 is also correct. So the first two symmetries, 1 and 2, are both required.

Wait, but wait a second. Some higher-dimensional operators might involve nonrenormalizable terms, but they're still part of a renormalizable theory when considering the effective approach. So, they should still respect the symmetries of the SM, which include Poincare. So 1 and 2 must be respected.

Then, what about CP and CPT symmetries? The SM has CPT symmetry, but not necessarily CP. For example, the SM doesn't have CP symmetry because of processes like CP violation in the CKM matrix. So SMEFT operators can have CP violation if the SM already does. Therefore, operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 (CP symmetry) is not a must.

But wait, CPT symmetry is a bigger symmetry—combining charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. The SM respects CPT symmetry. So any SMEFT operator must respect CPT symmetry as well. So option 4 is correct.

So putting it all together: which symmetries must all SMEFT operators respect? Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). But wait, wait—does Poincare require all operators to respect it, or is it automatically satisfied?

Alternatively, I might be mixing up Lorentz and Poincare. Because Poincare includes translations. So if you have operators that are Lorentz invariant but not Poincare, would that mean they aren't translationally invariant? But in a QFT, operators should be local, so they should be Poincare invariant because they can be moved around via translations without changing the physics. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about that, but I think that SMEFT operators are built to respect Poincare symmetry because the SM does. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

Wait, the question lists the options as 1, 2, 3, 4, and the choices are which of those must be respected by all operators.

So the correct symmetries are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). So looking at the options:

Option C) 1,2,4 → which would be the correct answer.

But wait, I thought that SMEFT operators are built to respect all symmetries of the SM except perhaps for CP. So if SM has CPT, then SMEFT must too. So 4 is correct.

So the question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So the mandatory ones are 1,2,4. So that's option C.

Alternatively, I might have made a mistake. Let me think again. Do SMEFT operators necessarily respect Poincare symmetry? Because Poincare includes both Lorentz and translations. Well, the SM includes Poincare symmetry, so any operator in SMEFT must also respect that, right? Because, for example, the operators are written in terms of SM fields, which already have Poincare symmetry.

So the correct answer should include 1,2,4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So the answer is option C.


In the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), operators are constructed to respect the symmetries of the Standard Model (SM), which forms the foundation of SMEFT. Here's the analysis of the given symmetries:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The SM is Lorentz invariant, and SMEFT operators are built from SM fields. Therefore, all SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations in space and time. Since the SM respects Poincaré symmetry, SMEFT operators, being extensions of the SM, must also respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM does not necessarily respect CP symmetry (e.g., CP violation occurs in the CKM matrix). Consequently, SMEFT operators do not need to respect CP symmetry either.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM respects CPT symmetry, and since SMEFT is built on the SM, all SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
