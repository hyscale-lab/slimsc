Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying a compound X and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A, B, C, D. 

First, I need to look at the spectral data provided: IR and 1H NMR. Let's start with the IR. The peaks are at 3400–2500, which is a broad range, probably indicating O-H or N-H stretches. But looking further, the strong peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group (C=O), like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. Then there's a peak at 1610 cm-1, which is around where aromatic C=C stretches appear. The 1450 cm-1 peak might be from aromatic ring deformation or possibly a conjugated carbonyl group.

Now, the NMR data. Let's break it down. The peaks are:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 is probably an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, it could be a phenolic OH, but that's usually broader and might not be exactly 10.5. Another possibility is an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. Wait, but a carboxylic acid would typically appear as a broad peak, often around 10-12 ppm. But the integration is 1H here, so maybe it's an aldehyde. Hmm, but then why is it broad? Or maybe it's an -OH group, but not a phenol. Wait, there's also the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 which is a carbonyl, so if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad around 2500-3000, but the IR shows a broad region from 3400-2500, which could include O-H. Alternatively, 10.5 ppm could be an aldehyde. I'll keep this in mind.

Next, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). A doublet in the aromatic region suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. Similarly, 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) is another doublet. This pattern is typical of a para-substituted aromatic ring with two substituents. For example, if there are two substituents in the para positions, each set of protons would be doublets. So, maybe the ring is a benzene with substituents in the para positions, like a methyl and something else.

Looking at the other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) – that's a multiplet, possibly from a CH group adjacent to an electronegative atom or part of a chain. 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be another CH2 group. 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a triplet of three protons, maybe a methyl group attached to something, perhaps a CH2 or a carbonyl. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl group, like from an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, maybe the structure has a benzene ring with substituents. The 8.0 and 7.2 ppm signals suggest four protons in two doublets, so two substituents opposite each other. Let's think of 4-methyl substituents, but wait, the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) could be a CH(CH3) group.

Wait, another approach: the IR shows a carbonyl. So the compound might have a carbonyl group attached to the benzene ring. Like a benzaldehyde or a benzoic acid derivative. The NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm which could be an aldehyde. So perhaps benzaldehyde derivative.

But wait, if it's a benzaldehyde, the aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But in the NMR, it's a broad singlet. Hmm, maybe it's an acidic aldehyde, but that's rare. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, the IR at 1720 cm-1 could also be an ester or a ketone. But considering the NMR, let's think about each possibility.

If the IR has a carbonyl, and the NMR has a peak at 10.5, perhaps it's a ketone. No, a ketone wouldn't have a proton there. Wait, maybe it's a benzaldehyde, but then the aldehyde proton would be in the correct region. But the broadness is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a benzoic acid derivative, but the 1720 could be a carbonyl from a ketone or ester, not an acid.

Wait, the 10.5 ppm peak could be a carboxylic acid proton, which is usually broad and around 10-12. But then, in the IR, a carboxylic acid would have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300 cm-1, which the IR data does show. The 1720 cm-1 would then be the carbonyl (C=O) of the acid. But the problem is that in the NMR, the 10.5 is a singlet, but carboxylic acids usually have broad singlets. So that's possible.

Wait, another point: the IR also has a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which might suggest conjugation. So if the carbonyl is conjugated with the benzene ring, like in a benzaldehyde or benzoic acid, that would fit.

So assuming it's a benzoic acid derivative. Let's see the NMR. The 10.5 is the -COOH proton, which is the acidic one. Then the aromatic protons are in two doublets, so perhaps a para-substituted benzene with another substituent. The substituents could be a methyl and a carbonyl group. Alternatively, perhaps a substituent elsewhere.

Looking at the other NMR peaks: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 (m,2H), 1.4 (d,3H), 0.9 (t,3H). These seem to form a chain. Let's think of a chain like CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)- something.

Wait, 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a methyl group attached to a carbon that's split into a doublet. That suggests a structure like CH(CH3) where the CH is connected to another group. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be that CH group. Then the 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be two protons on a CH2 next to it. The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a terminal methyl group, so perhaps an ethyl chain. So putting this together, maybe -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)- or something like that.

Wait, putting it all together, perhaps the structure is 4-(something)benzoic acid. Let me think. The benzene ring has a substituent and a carboxylic acid group in the para positions. Alternatively, the substituent could be a side chain.

Wait, perhaps the compound is 4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Let me see. The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 (3H), which is probably the end of an ethyl group. So if the structure has a propyl chain, perhaps propionyl attached to the benzene.

Wait, let's imagine the structure. If it's a benzene ring with a substituent at position 4, and a carboxylic acid group at position 1 (assuming numbering). Or maybe the substituent is something else.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Let's see. The substituent would be a sec-butyl group, which is CH2-C(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-? No, wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH2CH3) attached to the ring. No, wait, butyl groups: the substituent would be a butyl group attached via the second carbon.

Wait, let me think about the NMR. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be a CH group adjacent to a branch. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be a CH2. Then, the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a methyl attached to a CH, and the 0.9 (t,3H) is a CH2CH2CH3 group. So perhaps the substituent is a chain like CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-, but that doesn't quite fit.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a propyl chain with a branch. Wait, maybe the substituent is a isobutyl group. Isobutyl is (CH2)2CH2- attached via the middle carbon. No, wait, isobutyl is CH(CH2CH3)2. Wait, no, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a tert-butyl group, but I don't see a triplet for six protons here. Alternatively, maybe it's a sec-butyl group. Let me think: the substituent is a butyl group attached via the second carbon, so the structure would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring. So the protons on the adjacent carbons would have certain splitting.

Wait, the NMR shows a triplet at 1.4 (3H, d), which is a methyl group attached to a CH. So maybe the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring. So the structure would be benzene ring with a substituent at para position, which is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, and a carboxylic acid group at another position. Wait, but the substituents are in the para positions. So the substituents adjacent to the ring would be the carboxylic acid and the butyl group.

Wait, but looking at the NMR again, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H), which suggests that the ring has two substituents in the para positions. So the substituents are on positions 1 and 4, for example. One substituent is a carboxylic acid group (COOH) and the other is a butyl group.

So if the structure is 4-(butyl)benzoic acid, but I need to figure out the exact substituent.

Wait, the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 (3H), which is a terminal methyl. So that would come from a CH2CH2CH2- group. But wait, the substituent is attached to the ring, so perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that would be a butyl group. But the other NMR peaks don't fit a straight butyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let me think: the substituent is (CH2)2CH(CH3), but that would be a pentyl group? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's a propyl group with a methyl branch. Wait, the substituent might be isobutyl. Isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me think about what the NMR is showing for the substituent. The substituent has a CH2 group (1.7 ppm, 2H, m), a CH group (2.9 ppm, 1H, m), and a methyl attached as a doublet (1.4 ppm, 3H, d), and a terminal CH3 (0.9 ppm, 3H, t).

So the substituent could be a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the ring. So that would be a sec-butyl group. Because sec-butyl is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring.

Wait, let me draw this out. The substituent is attached at the benzene ring as a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So the structure would be benzene with a substituent at para position, which is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, and another substituent which is a carboxylic acid group.

So the molecule would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Let me check the NMR for that.

The substituent would be:

- The CH2 adjacent to the ring: that would be the 1.7 ppm (m,2H). The next CH is the 2.9 ppm (m,1H). The CH has a methyl group attached (1.4 ppm, d,3H), which is the CH(CH3) part. Then, the terminal CH2CH3 would be the 0.9 ppm (t,3H). So that seems to fit.

So the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would match the NMR.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That seems to fit.

Now, the reaction part: compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. Wait, but wait, the Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and HCl, but sometimes red phosphorus and HI can also be used for similar reductions, perhaps for esters or other carbonyls.

Wait, in this case, compound X has a carbonyl group. Let me think: if X has a carbonyl group, such as a ketone or an acid. If X is a benzoic acid, then reacting it with red phosphorus and HI might not do much. Wait, no, carboxylic acids are not typically reduced under Clemmensen conditions. Clemmensen usually reduces ketones, aldehydes, and esters.

Wait, but wait, if X is a benzaldehyde, then under Clemmensen, it would reduce to the corresponding benzyl alcohol. But in our case, X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Hmm, but that's a carboxylic acid. Would that react with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, another possibility: maybe the carbonyl in X is an ester. Because esters can be reduced to alkanes. Alternatively, maybe the carbonyl is a ketone.

Wait, going back: the initial compound X has a carbonyl, so if it's an ester, then the reaction would reduce it. But in our case, from the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is possibly a carboxylic acid. So perhaps X is a benzophenone derivative, but that doesn't fit with the NMR.

Wait, perhaps I got the structure wrong. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. If X has an ester group, the O would be there. But the NMR doesn't show an ester oxygen, unless I'm missing something.

Alternatively, if X is a ketone, the NMR would not have a proton at 10.5 ppm. So, perhaps I should reevaluate the structure.

Wait, maybe the 10.5 ppm is not a carboxylic acid but an aldehyde. So, then X would be a benzaldehyde derivative with a substituent.

If X is a benzaldehyde with a substituent, then the IR would show the aldehyde peak at around 1700-1720 cm-1. The 10.5 ppm would be the aldehyde proton.

In that case, the structure would be 4-(something)benzaldehyde.

Looking at the NMR again, the 8.0 and 7.2 ppm would be the aromatic protons, and the substituent would have the same chain as before.

So, substituent: -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring, and the compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde.

Then, reacting with red phosphorus and HI (a Clemmensen-like reduction), the aldehyde group would be reduced to a CH2 group.

So the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl alcohol? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the aldehyde (RCHO) would become RCH2OH? No, wait, no. Clemmensen reduces the aldehyde to a CH2 group. Wait, no, wait, no, Clemmensen reduces RCHO to RCH2OH? No, wait, no. Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, no, the Clemmensen reduction converts ketones to secondary alcohols, aldehydes to primary alcohols. Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, no, wait, no, no. No, wait, no. The Clemmensen reduction converts ketones to secondary alcohols and aldehydes to primary alcohols. Wait, no, wait: no, wait, the Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg) and HCl, which reduces ketones to alkanes, not to alcohols. Wait, wait, no, maybe I'm confusing with the other reductions. Wait, the Clemmensen reduction is for ketones and aldehydes, and it replaces the carbonyl group with a methylene group (CH2). So, RCHO becomes RCH2H (which is R-CH2-). Wait, yes, the aldehyde is converted to a methylene group. So, benzaldehyde would become toluene.

Wait, right. Clemmensen reduction converts aldehydes to CH2 groups. So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde, then the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, but that's not one of the options. Wait, the options are:

Options:
A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Hmm, but if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and if the reaction doesn't involve that group, but reduces another part.

Wait, maybe the initial structure is different. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group and a propyl chain. Let me reevaluate the NMR.

The aromatic protons are two doublets, so two substituents in para positions. So, perhaps the substituents are a methyl group and a propyl chain attached to the ring.

Wait, but the substituent chain in the NMR seems more complex. Let me think of the substituent as maybe a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, another approach: the substituent's NMR
