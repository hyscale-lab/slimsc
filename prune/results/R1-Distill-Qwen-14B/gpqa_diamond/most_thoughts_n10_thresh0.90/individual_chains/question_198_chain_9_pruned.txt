Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

We have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the Co(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, okay. So, first, I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us about the stability of metal complexes. The higher the beta, the more stable the complex is.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the beta values are given for each complex. So Co with different numbers of SCN- ions. Let me think. For transition metals, the complexes can have varying numbers of ligands. For Co(II), which is a d^7 metal, it can form complexes with different ligand numbers.

Wait, the complexes would be Co(SCN)_n^2−n, I think. Because each SCN- is a monodentate ligand. So for n=1, 2, 3, 4, which are the cases here.

The beta values are the formation constants. So β1 would correspond to the complex [Co(SCN)]^+, right? Because Co^2+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+ (charge 2+ + (-1) = +1 overall). Wait, perhaps I should clarify the charge.

Wait, the charge of the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(3−n) perhaps? Because Co^2+ with n SCN^- would be 2+ - n*(−1) = 2+n. Wait, no wait, each SCN- contributes -1. So for each SCN attached, the complex charge would be 2+ + (n * (-1)) = 2 - n. So [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n).

So for β1, which is 9, that's the formation constant for the first complex, [CoSCN]^+ (n=1, charge 2-1=+1). Then β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (charge 2-2=0), β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^− (2-3=−1), and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2− (2-4=−2).

Wait, but wait, the problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So β3 is the highest, so the most stable complex is the [Co(SCN)_3]^− complex. Oh, but the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. Wait, dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands, so that's the n=2 case, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, right?

Wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato (which is the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex). So I need to find the fraction of Co in the form of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 among all possible species.

So the approach is to calculate the distribution of each complex, given the concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN^-.

The total concentration of Co is c(Co) = 1e-2 M. But the total includes all species: Co^2+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^−, [Co(SCN)_4]^2−.

Wait, but the SCN^- concentration is 0.1 M, which is much higher than the Co concentration. So the ligand is in excess, which may mean that higher complexes are favored.

But to find the distribution, I should consider the formation of each complex step by step.

Alternatively, I can model the system using the stability constants and the given concentrations to find the fraction of each complex.

The general approach is to consider the stepwise formation of complexes, using the stability constants. But since the problem provides β1, β2, β3, β4, which are the overall stability constants for each complex, perhaps I should think in terms of the formation of each complex from the previous one.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to model the fraction of each complex using the expression for the fraction of each species in terms of the stability constants and the concentrations.

In general, the fraction f_n of the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) is given by:

f_n = (β1β2...βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n) / Σ (β1β2…βm [Co^2+][SCN^-]^m) for m=0 to 4

Wait, where m is the number of ligands. Wait, but wait, for each complex [Co(SCN)_m]^(2−m), the term is [Co^2+][SCN^-]^m multiplied by the product of the beta's up to m. Wait, not exactly. Because the beta's are the stepwise formation constants.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The stability constant for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) is the overall formation constant, which is the product of the stepwise constants. Wait, no: for each complex, the overall stability constant is the product of the stepwise formation constants up to that point.

Wait, but the problem gives β1, β2, β3, β4 as the stability constants for each complex. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the formation of [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) is a stepwise process, each step adding one SCN-.

Wait, for example, β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^+. β2 is the formation constant for the next step, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which would be K2 = [ [Co(SCN)_2] ] / ( [CoSCN][SCN] )

So the overall stability constant for [Co(SCN)_2] is β1 * β2.

Similarly, β3 is the stepwise constant for forming [Co(SCN)_3]^- from [Co(SCN)_2] and SCN^-.

So the overall stability constant for [Co(SCN)_3]^- would be β1 * β2 * β3.

Wait, but in the problem, the given beta values are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, this could mean that β1 is K1 = [ [CoSCN] ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-] )

β2 is K2 = [ [Co(SCN)_2] ] / ( [CoSCN][SCN^-] )

β3 is K3 = [ [Co(SCN)_3] ] / ( [Co(SCN)_2][SCN^-] )

β4 is K4 = [ [Co(SCN)_4] ] / ( [Co(SCN)_3][SCN^-] )

So the overall stability constants would be:

β1 = K1 = 9,

β1β2 = K1*K2 = 9*40=360,

β1β2β3 = 9*40*63= 9*40=360, 360 *63=22680,

β1β2β3β4=22680 *16= 362880.

Wait, but this is getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, the overall stability constant for each complex is the product of the stepwise beta's up to that point.

So for the [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) complex, the overall beta is product β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

So for n=1: β1=9,

n=2: β1*β2=360,

n=3: 9*40*63= 9*40=36
