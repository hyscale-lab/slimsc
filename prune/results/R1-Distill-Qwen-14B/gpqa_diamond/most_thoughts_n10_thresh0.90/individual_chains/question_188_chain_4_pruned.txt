Okay, I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that the interplanar distance formula for a crystal depends on the lattice type. Since this is a rhombohedral crystal, it's a special case where all the lattice parameters are the same, and all the angles are equal.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance (d) in a crystal is given by 1/d² equals the sum of the squares of the reciprocal of the lattice parameters multiplied by the Miller indices, but I think that's for cubic systems. Oh wait, no, maybe it's more general. Oh right, the formula is 1/d² = (h²)/(a²) + (k²)/(b²) + (l²)/(c²) divided by something... Wait, no, I might be mixing it up.

Wait, wait. I think in a rhombohedral system, which is a type of hexagonal crystal system, but in this case, maybe it's a cubic system with all angles equal? Or is rhombohedral a separate category? I'm a bit confused. Oh right, rhombohedral is a type of Bravais lattice where a = b = c and all angles are equal (but not 90 degrees, so it's not cubic). So the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal would be different from cubic.

I think the general formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral system is given by d = [ (a^2 (1 - cosα)^2 ) / ( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) ) ]^(1/2), but wait, maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, another approach is to use the general formula for any crystal system.

The general formula for interplanar distance for a plane with Miller indices (hkl) is 1/d² = (h²)/(a²) + (k²)/(b²) + (l²)/(c²) + (2hk cosγ)/(a b) + (2hl cosβ)/(a c) + (2kl cosα)/(b c). But wait, this might be for a more general case where a, b, c are not equal.

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and all the angles α, β, γ are equal. So maybe the formula simplifies.

So let's
