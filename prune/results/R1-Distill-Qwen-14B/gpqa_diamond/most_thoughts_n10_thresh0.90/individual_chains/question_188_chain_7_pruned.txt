Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances are related to the unit cell parameters. The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. Right, a rhombohedral crystal has all sides equal and all angles equal, right? So the unit cell is a rhombohedron.

The interatomic distance given is 10 Angstroms, which I think is the lattice parameter 'a'. Oh wait, wait, wait. In a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell has all edges equal, so a = b = c = 10 Angstroms. The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Got it.

The question asks for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. I remember the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by:

d_hkl = a / (sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos beta + hl cos gamma + kl cos alpha) ) )

Wait, but wait. I'm not sure about that formula. Oh right, I think the general formula when the unit cell is not cubic is more complicated. The formula for interplanar distance in a general crystal system is:

d^2 = (a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 a^2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha)) ) / (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)

Wait, no, I think I mixed up the terms. Let me think
