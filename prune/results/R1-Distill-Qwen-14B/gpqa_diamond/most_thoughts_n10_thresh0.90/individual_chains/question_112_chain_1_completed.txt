Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, we're dealing with spin-½ particles, I think. The first part is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator, whose matrix representation has elements A_ij equal to hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Then, find the average value of that operator.

Wait, the A_ij matrix... Let me think. So for a 2x2 system, the matrix would have 0s on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. So it looks like:

[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0 ]

Hmm, that's an interesting matrix. I remember that for Pauli matrices, the X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this looks similar but scaled. Maybe the operator is related to the Pauli X matrix multiplied by some factor.

But wait, the operator's matrix is A_ij = 0 when i=j, and hbar/2 otherwise. So the matrix is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so multiplying by hbar/2 gives the matrix A. So the operator is probably (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

Now, the eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates of this operator, right? So the eigenstates of A would be the same as those of sigma_x, because the scalar multiple doesn't change the eigenstates, just the eigenvalues. So the eigenstates of A are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), correct? Because sigma_x flips the spin in the x-direction, so its eigenstates are the superpositions along the x-axis.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The Pauli X matrix has eigenstates |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2). So yeah, that's correct.

So the problem is asking for the probability of measuring the electron in each of these eigenstates, |+x> and |−x>, when the state is |alpha>. Because the eigenstates of the operator A are these |+x> and |−x> states.

So first, I need to normalize the given state |alpha>, since it's only proportional to that expression. Then, express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A (which are |+x> and |−x>), and find the coefficients. The probabilities would be the square of the magnitudes of these coefficients.

Alternatively, since A is proportional to sigma_x, the observable is sigma_x scaled by hbar/2. So when you measure this operator, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues ± (hbar/2), because sigma_x has eigenvalues ±1. So the operator A would have eigenvalues ± (hbar/2).

But the problem is not about the outcomes of measuring A, but about measuring in the eigenbasis of A. So we need to express |alpha> in that basis.

Wait, let me clarify. The first part of the question is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator A. So that's the probabilities for |+x> and |−x>.

So the steps I need to take:

1. Normalize the given state |alpha>.
2. Express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>.
3. The coefficients' squared magnitudes will give the probabilities.
4. Compute the average value of the operator A.

Let me start with step 1: Normalizing |alpha>.

The given |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. So first, find the normalization factor.

The normalization factor is 1/sqrt(|1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2).

Calculating |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Calculating |2 -i|^2: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5.

So the denominator is sqrt(2 +5)=sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Now, step 2: Express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

We know that:

|up> = (|+x> + |−x>)/sqrt(2)

|down> = (|+x> − |−x>)/sqrt(2)

So substituting these into |alpha>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)(|+x> + |−x>)/sqrt(2) ) + (2 -i)( |+x> − |−x> )/sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(7)

Let me factor out 1/sqrt(2) and 1/sqrt(7):

= [ (1+i)(|+x> + |−x>) + (2 -i)( |+x> − |−x> ) ) ] / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

Let me expand the terms inside:

= [ (1+i)|+x> + (1+i)|−x> + (2 -i)|+x> − (2 -i)|−x> ] / sqrt(14)

Grouping terms for |+x> and |−x>:

For |+x>:
(1+i + 2 -i) |+x> = (1 +2 +i -i) |+x> = (3) |+x>

For |−x>:
(1+i - (2 -i) ) |−x> = (1 +i -2 +i) |−x> = (-1 +2i) |−x>

So putting it all together:

|alpha> = [3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i) |−x> ] / sqrt(14)

Wait, wait, let me re-calculate the coefficients:

Let me recompute the coefficients:

When expanding the numerator:

(1+i)|+x> + (1+i)|−x> + (2 -i)|+x> − (2 -i)|−x>

So for |+x>:

(1+i) + (2 -i) = [1 + 2] + [i -i ] = 3 + 0i =3

For |−x>:

(1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i )= (-1) + (2i) = -1 +2i

So the coefficients are 3 for |+x> and (-1 +2i) for |−x>.

So |alpha> = [3 |+x> + (-1 +2i)|−x> ] / sqrt(14)

Now, to find the probabilities, compute the squared magnitude of each coefficient.

The probability for |+x> is |3|^2 / (sqrt(14))^2 → 9/14.

Wait, wait, wait. Hmm, no. Because the state is expressed as (3 |+x> + (-1 +2i)|−x> ) / sqrt(14). So the coefficients are 3/sqrt(14) and (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

The probability for |+x> is |3/sqrt(14)|² = (9)/14 ≈ 0.642857.

The probability for |−x> is | (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14) |². Let's compute that.

The numerator is (-1 +2i). Its magnitude squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5. So the probability is 5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, and 5/14 is approx 0.35714. Adding them gives 14/14=1, which is correct.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, the coefficients in |alpha> are (3) and (-1+2i). So their squared magnitudes are 9 and 5, respectively. The sum is (9+5)=14, which is correct because 14 is denominator.

Thus, probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.642857 and 5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Looking back at the options, let's check which option has these probabilities. The first option is A) 0.64, 0.36 and ... So that's close to 9/14 (≈0.6428) and 5/14 (≈0.3571), which is approximately 0.64 and 0.36. So option A's probabilities match.

But let me check other options. Option C: 0.28 and 0.72? No, that's 2/7 and 6/7, which isn't matching. Option D: 0.61, 0.29? Doesn't fit. Option B: 0.54 and 0.46, which is approximately 7.5/14 and 6.5/14, but no, not matching.

So the probabilities are about 0.64 and 0.36, which corresponds to option A.

Then, the second part is the average value of the operator A.

The operator A is given by the matrix elements. So A = (hbar/2) * sigma_x, as I thought earlier.

So the average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is expressed in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |−x>, with eigenvalues (hbar/2) and (-hbar/2), respectively.

So the expectation value would be the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

So expectation value = P(+x) * (hbar/2) + P(-x) * (-hbar/2)

We have P(+x) =9/14, P(-x)=5/14.

So expectation = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2 )

= [ (9/14 -5/14) ) ] * (hbar/2 )

= (4/14) * (hbar/2 )

Simplify 4/14 to 2/7.

So expectation = (2/7) * (hbar/2) )= hbar/7.

Wait, that's the expectation value.

So looking at the options, option A says average is hbar/7, which matches.

Wait, but let me compute it another way to confirm.

Alternatively, the expectation value can be calculated using the matrix elements.

Since the operator A has matrix elements [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]], and |alpha> is normalized as [ (1+i) |up> + (2 -i) |down> ] / sqrt(7), we can compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Expressed in the computational basis, |up> is (1,0), |down> is (0,1). So |alpha> is [ (1+i), (2 -i) ]^T / sqrt(7).

Compute <alpha| A |alpha>:

= (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1-i), (2 +i) ] * A * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i), (2 -i) ]^T

Wait, no. Actually, when you compute <alpha| A |alpha>, it's the same as multiplying the conjugate transpose (bra) with A times ket.

So let me write |alpha> as a column vector [ a; b ], where a=(1+i)/sqrt(7), b=(2−i)/sqrt(7).

The matrix A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

Compute A|alpha>:

= [0*a + (hbar/2)*b ; (hbar/2)*a + 0*b ]

= [ (hbar/2) * b, (hbar/2) a ]^T

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> = [ a* , b* ] * [ (hbar/2) b, (hbar/2) a ] = a* (hbar/2) b + b* (hbar/2) a.

Which is (hbar/2)( a* b + b* a )

Because a* b is the conjugate of b* a, so a* b + b* a = 2 Re(a* b).

So let me compute a*b:

a is (1+i)/sqrt(7), b is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

a* is (1 -i)/sqrt(7).

So a* b = [(1 -i)(2 -i)] / 7.

Multiply numerator: (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) 

= 2 -i -2i + i²

= 2 -3i + (-1) → since i²=−1.

= (2−1) −3i → 1−3i.

So a* b = (1 −3i)/7.

Then, b* a is the conjugate, which is (1+3i)/7.

So a* b + b* a = [ (1−3i) + (1+3i) ] /7 = (2)/7.

So <alpha|A|alpha> = (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/7.

So yeah, same result as before. So the average is hbar/7.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, average is hbar/7. So that's option A.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but what about the first part? The probabilities for the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |−x>, are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.6428 and 0.3571, which rounds to 0.64 and 0.36. So option A is correct.

Thus, the answer should be option A.


To solve the problem, we analyze the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), and normalize it. The normalization factor is determined by calculating the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:

\[
|1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5.
\]

Thus, the normalization factor is \( \sqrt{2 + 5} = \sqrt{7} \), and the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right].
\]

Next, we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenstates of \( A \) are \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \). Substituting \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) into \( |\alpha\rangle \), we rewrite \( |\alpha\rangle \) as:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)\frac{|+x\rangle + |-x\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} + (2-i)\frac{|+x\rangle - |-x\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \right].
\]

Simplifying the coefficients for \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \):

\[
\text{Coefficient of } |+x\rangle: \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}},
\]
\[
\text{Coefficient of } |-x\rangle: \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

Thus, the state becomes:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ 3|+x\rangle + (-1 + 2i)|-x\rangle \right].
\]

The probabilities of measuring \( |\alpha\rangle \) in the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:

\[
P(+x) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-x) = \left| \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Finally, the average value of the operator \( A \) is calculated as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = P(+x) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(-x) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Substituting \( P(+x) = \frac{9}{14} \) and \( P(-x) = \frac{5}{14} \):

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{9 - 5}{14} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). These results match option A.
