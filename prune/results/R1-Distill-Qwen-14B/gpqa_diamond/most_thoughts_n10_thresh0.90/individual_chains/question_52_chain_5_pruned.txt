Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to break it down. So, the question is about stars with spots and how they affect the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm.

First, the problem gives some details about the star. It has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but does that mean the star's total luminosity changes? Because spots are cooler regions, so covering part of the surface with them would lower the overall effective temperature.

Now, the main part is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. We have to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. So, the ratio when no spots (R1) divided by the ratio when spots are present (R2) would be the factor.

Oh right, the ratio of populations of two energy levels in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(kT) ). So, if E2 is higher than E1, this ratio depends exponentially on temperature.

Wait, when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower (5500 K instead of 6000 K). But wait, the spots are dark, so they must be cooler than the surrounding photosphere. Oh wait, but the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So, when spots are present, the star's overall emission is lower, so the effective temperature measured is lower. But I'm not entirely sure if the temperature in the photosphere is what's being used here. The problem states that in the stellar photosphere, the ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So the photosphere's temperature is what affects this ratio.

Wait, when the star has spots, the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K. So the temperature we plug into the Boltzmann factor is 5500 K. Without spots, it's 6000 K. So, the ratio without spots (R1) is higher than when spots are present (R2), because higher temperature makes the exponent less negative, so higher ratio. Since the problem states that the observed ratio decreases when spots are present, R1/R2 is greater than 1.

So, the ratio R is n_upper/n_lower. So when T is higher, R is higher. So when there are spots, R decreases.

We need the factor R1/R2. So R1 is when T=6000 K, R2 when T=5500 K.

So, let's compute R1/R2.

R1/R2 = [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Wait, because both levels have the same g2/g1 ratio, right? Because it's the same transition, so the statistical weights cancel out. So R1/R2 simplifies to exp( [ (1/(T1) - 1/(T2)) ] * (ΔE/k) ) ).

Wait, wait, let me think again. The ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Let's denote (E2-E1) as ΔE, which is positive because E2>E1 (since it's an upper energy level). So when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio increases.

So R1/R2 is [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )
