Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, I need to think this through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So a larger parallax means the star is closer, and a smaller parallax means it's farther away.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, uniform distribution in what sense? Uniform in space, I suppose. So if the density of stars is the same throughout the universe, then the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the size of that volume.

But how does parallax factor into this? Let me think in terms of a sphere. Suppose we consider a thin spherical shell at a distance d from us. The thickness of the shell would be a small change in d, say dd. The volume of this shell would be the surface area of the sphere (4πd²) multiplied by the thickness dd. So volume is approximately 4πd² dd.

If stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in this shell would be the volume multiplied by the star density, which I'll call n. So number of stars N = n * 4πd² dd.

But the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let me express d in terms of plx. So plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. Wait, but plx is in arcseconds, so when plx increases, d decreases.

I need to express everything in terms of plx. Let me change variables from d to plx. So d = 1/plx, and dd is the change in d, so let's find dd in terms of plx.

Taking derivative: d = 1/plx → dd = - (1)/(plx^2) * d plx. Hmm, the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, which makes sense. But since we're dealing with absolute changes in volume, maybe I can just take the magnitude.

So, substituting d = 1/plx into the volume:

Volume element dV = 4π d² dd = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - d plx / plx^2 )

Wait, maybe it's easier to express dd in terms of d plx. Let me write dd = (dd plx) * (dd/d plx). Since plx = 1/d, dd/d plx = derivative of d with respect to plx. So, d = 1/plx → dd/d plx = -1/(plx²). So dd = (-1/plx²) dd plx. Hmm, the negative just indicates direction, but when considering small increments, we can take the absolute value.

So, plugging into dV: 4π d² dd = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/(plx²)) d plx ) → 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

Wait, let me make sure. Wait, d² is (1/plx)^2, and dd is (1/plx²) d plx. So when you multiply them together:

dV = 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) d plx = 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number of stars in a small range of plx (d plx) is N = n * 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So N per d plx would be n *4π / plx^4.

So the number per unit plx (d plx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but the options are given as something like ~ 1/plx^something. So the number per unit plx is inversely proportional to plx^4. So the answer should be option A, which is ~1/plx^4.

Alternatively, maybe I got the exponents wrong. Let me double-check the steps.

d = 1/plx → d² = 1/plx².

dd = (dd plx) * (dd/d plx) = (dd plx) * (-1/(plx²)).

So when I substitute into dV:

dV = 4π d² dd = 4π (1/plx²) * ( - 1/(plx²) dd plx )

But since we're considering the magnitude, we can ignore the negative:

dV = 4π (1/plx^4) dd plx.

So number of stars in this volume is N = n * dV → N = (n *4π) / plx^4 * d plx.

So the number per unit plx is (n *4π) / plx^4. So it's proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the correct answer is A) ~1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely related to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a given volume depends on the size of that volume.

Consider a thin spherical shell at a distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \). The volume of this shell is:

\[
dV = 4\pi d^2 dd
\]

If the star density is \( n \), the number of stars in this shell is:

\[
N = n \cdot dV = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 dd
\]

Expressing \( d \) in terms of \( \text{plx} \), we have \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). Substituting this into the volume expression:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 dd
\]

Next, we relate \( dd \) to \( d\text{plx} \). Since \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we find:

\[
dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}
\]

Taking the absolute value (as we are interested in the magnitude of the change), we substitute \( dd \) into the volume expression:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) d\text{plx} = 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}
\]

The number of stars per unit range of \( \text{plx} \) is then:

\[
\frac{N}{d\text{plx}} = n \cdot \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4}
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of \( \text{plx} \) is inversely proportional to \( \text{plx}^4 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
