Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's orbit. The shift tells us about the planet's mass and the orbital period.

So the question says that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected these planets.

Planet #1 caused a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's shift was 7 milliangstroms. The question is, how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1?

Wait, I think the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star. The formula I remember is something like the velocity semi-amplitude (K) is proportional to (M_planet * sin i) / (M_star)^(1/3) * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²))), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that simplifies things. Oh wait, but both planets have similar masses to Neptune, so M_planet is much less than M_star, so (1 + M_planet/M_star) is approximately 1. So K is roughly proportional to (M_planet) / (M_star)^(1/3) * something else.

Wait, but both stars have the same mass as the Sun. So M_star is the same for both. So K should be proportional to M_planet, but wait, M_planet is similar for both Neptune-mass planets. So why is the shift different?

Wait no, no. Wait, the RV method's Doppler shift (the semi-amplitude K) depends on the mass of the planet, the inclination of the orbit (but since it's detected, sin i is close to 1), the mass of the star, and the orbital period and semi-major axis, I think. Let me think. Alternatively, the formula for K is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / (4π² * (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P) ) )^(1/3) ) / (c), but maybe I'm getting the exact formula wrong.

Wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * P ) / (2π c³) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So,

K ≈ ( (G P ) / (2 π c³) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) )

But G is the gravitational constant, c is speed of light, and since both stars are similar to the Sun (M_* same), and M_p is same for both, and sin i is about same (assuming the same inclination, which is a valid assumption since both are detected, meaning they
