Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Hmm, the question is asking about the energy of the collider when the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. Oh wait, and nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Let me think, what's the process here.

First, I need to figure out what the nucleus X is. Li usually has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons is 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, their relativistic mass increases. So the total energy should be the relativistic energy of the nucleus.

The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m_0 * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity v. The Lorentz factor gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

Wait, but wait, I think the energy in particle physics is often given in terms of kinetic energy, but sometimes they refer to total energy. Hmm, the question says the energy of RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c. I think RHIC accelerates ions to a certain kinetic energy, but sometimes people use total energy as well. Oh, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no. In accelerators, the energy usually refers to the kinetic energy. Or maybe it's the total energy? Hmm. Let me think. The energy given in the options is in GeV. So I need to calculate either the total energy or the kinetic energy. But what does the question exactly ask?

The question says, "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So the energy here is probably the kinetic energy. Because the speed is given, and the kinetic energy is the energy imparted by the collider.

Wait, but sometimes the kinetic energy is a part of the total energy. Let me clarify. The total energy E is gamma * m_0 c². The kinetic energy K is (gamma - 1) m_0 c². So if the question is referring to the kinetic energy, then K = (gamma - 1) m_0 c². But I'm not sure. Wait, the question says 'the energy of the RHIC', which is the collider's energy. Typically, when they say the energy of an accelerator, they mean the kinetic energy imparted to the particles. So I think I should calculate the kinetic energy.

But wait, sometimes in physics problems, when they just say 'energy', they mean the total energy. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the options given. The values are in the 20 GeV range, except option A is 18, which is a bit lower. Let me try both approaches and see which option fits.

First, let me compute gamma. Given v = 0.96c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

v = 0.96c, so v²/c² is 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 (since 0.28^2 is 0.0784).

So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

Wait sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is needed. The nucleus has 6 nucleons (3 protons, 3 neutrons). The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². Neutrons are similar, about 939 MeV/c². Let me take an average. Let's say about 938.5 MeV each. So for 6 nucleons, each about 938.5 MeV, so total rest mass is 6 * 938.5 MeV.

Wait, but wait, the exact mass of Li-6 nucleus is a bit different because the binding energy. Oh, but for this problem, I think we can approximate it by using the sum of protons and neutrons, as the problem probably expects that approach.

So m_0 = 6 * 938.5 MeV/c². Let me compute that.

6 * 938.5 = 5631 MeV. So 5631 MeV is the rest mass energy. 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So 5631 MeV is 5.631 GeV.

So m_0 c² is 5.631 GeV.

Now, if we're calculating the kinetic energy (K), it's (gamma - 1) * m_0 c^2.

Gamma is about 3.5714, so gamma minus 1 is 2.5714.

So K = 2.5714 * 5.631 GeV.

Let me compute that. 5.631 * 2.5714.

Hmm, 5 * 2.5714 is 12.857, 0.631 *2.5714 is about 1.623. So total approx 14.48. Wait, that's about 14.48 GeV, but the options are higher. Wait, but that's if K is the energy. But wait, maybe the problem is asking for the total energy E, which is gamma * m_0 c².

So total energy E = gamma * m_0 c² = 3.5714 * 5.631 GeV.

Let's compute that:

3 *5.631 is 16.893, 0.5714 *5.631 is about 3.216. So total is approx 20.109 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. Another option is B) 23.069, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute gamma * m_0 c²:

gamma = 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857...

m_0 c^2 = 6 * 938.5 MeV = 5631 MeV = 5.631 GeV.

So 3.57142857 * 5.631 GeV = ?

Let me calculate 3.57142857 *5.631.

Breaking it down:

3.57142857 * 5 = 17.85714285

3.57142857 * 0.631 = ?

0.631 *3 = 1.893, 0.631 *0.57142857 ≈ 0.631 *0.571 ≈ 0.3625.

So approximately 1.893 + 0.3625 = 2.2555.

So 17.857 + 2.2555 ≈ 20.1125 GeV.

So E ≈20.1125 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So that must be the answer.

Wait, but let me recheck the initial problem. The question says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed..." So is it total energy or kinetic energy?

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the rest mass as the mass of the entire Li-6 atom, which would include electrons as well. Wait, no, because when we talk about ions in a collider, it's the nucleus we're considering. So the mass used is the mass of the nucleus.

But perhaps I should be more precise with the calculation.

Wait, I approximated the mass of each nucleon as 938.5 MeV/c². Let me get more exact numbers. Let me recall that the mass of a proton is approximately 938.272 MeV/c², and the neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So let's compute the exact rest mass of Li-6.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Protons: 3 * 938.272 = 2814.816 MeV.

Neutrons: 3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV.

Total m_0 c² = 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV → 5.633511 GeV.

So more accurately, m_0 c² is 5.633511 GeV.

Now, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/ sqrt(0.0784) = 1/ 0.28 = 3.571428571.

So E = gamma * m_0 c² = 3.571428571 * 5.633511 GeV.

Let me compute this:

3.571428571 *5.633511.

Breaking it down:

3 *5.633511 = 16.900533.

0.571428571 *5.633511 ≈ Let's compute 5.633511 * 0.571428571.

0.5 *5.633511 is 2.8167555.

0.071428571 *5.633511 ≈ about 0.4038 (because 5.6335 *0.0714 ≈ 0.4038).

So sum is approximately 2.8167555 + 0.4038 ≈ 3.2205.

So total E is 16.900533 +3.2205 ≈ 20.1210 GeV.

Which rounds to approximately 20.121 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but perhaps I should do the exact calculation without approximations.

Alternatively, let me compute 3.571428571 *5.633511.

3.571428571 *5.633511 = ?

Let me compute 3.571428571 *5.633511.

Multiply 3.571428571 by 5.633511.

Let me compute it step by step.

3.571428571 *5 = 17.857142855.

Now, 3.571428571 *0.633511.

Let me compute 3.571428571 *0.6 = 2.1428571426.

3.571428571 *0.033511 = ?

Compute 3.571428571 *0.03 = 0.107142857.

3.571428571 *0.003511 ≈ 0.012538 (approx).

So 0.033511 *3.571428571 ≈ 0.107142857 + 0.012538 ≈ 0.11968.

So 3.571428571 *0.633511 ≈ 2.1428571426 + 0.11968 ≈ 2.262537.

So total E =17.857142855 + 2.262537 ≈ 20.11968 GeV.

So 20.11968 GeV. Looking at option C: 20.132 GeV. Hmm, but that's a bit higher than our calculation. Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, let me compute 3.571428571 *5.633511.

I'll break it down into integer and decimal parts.

3 *5.633511 = 16.900533.

0.571428571 *5.633511.

Wait, 0.571428571 is exactly 4/7, because 4/7 ≈0.571428571.

So 4/7 *5.633511 = (5.633511 *4)/7.

5.633511 *4 =22.534044.

Divided by 7: 22.534044 /7 =3.219149142857.

So 3.219149142857.

Thus, E =16.900533 +3.219149142857 = 20.119682 GeV.

So about 20.1197 GeV. If we round to four decimal places, it's 20.1197 GeV. But the options have four decimal places. Option C is 20.132, which is a bit off. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the m_0 calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the mass of Li-6.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus can be found in the mass defect calculations, but perhaps the problem expects us to use the sum of the individual nucleons, but perhaps we should use the actual atomic mass.

Wait, the mass of the Li-6 atom is different from the nucleus. But I think the question is referring to the nucleus.

Wait, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus can be calculated using the mass of the atom minus the mass of the electrons. But that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects an approximate value.

Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.94094 atomic mass units (u). 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.94094 u * 931.5 MeV/u = ?

6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.94094 *931.5 ≈ let's compute:

0.9 *931.5 =838.35.

0.04094 *931.5 ≈ 38.25.

So 838.35 +38.25= 876.6 MeV.

So total is 5589 +876.6 ≈6465.6 MeV → 6.4656 GeV.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because the mass of the nucleus is lighter than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons because of binding energy. Oh wait, no, the mass of the nucleus is actually the mass of the atom minus the electrons. So perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, let me compute the mass of the Li-6 nucleus using the atomic mass. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.94094 u. Each Li atom has 3 electrons. The mass of each electron is about 0.00054858 u. So 3 electrons would be 0.0016457 u. So the mass of the nucleus is 6.94094 u - 3 *0.00054858 u.

Wait, 3 *0.00054858 is 0.00164574 u.

So 6.94094 - 0.00164574 =6.93929426 u.

So the nucleus mass is about 6.93929426 u. Now, converting to GeV/c².

1 u = 931.494 MeV/c² → 0.931494 GeV/c².

So 6.93929426 u * 0.931494 GeV/c²/u = ?

Let me compute that.

6.93929426 *0.931494 ≈ ?

6 *0.931494 =5.588964.

0.93929426 *0.931494.

Wait, 0.93 *0.93 = 0.8649.

But more accurately:

0.93929426 *0.931494.

Hmm, approx 0.9393 *0.9315 = let me compute that.

0.9 *0.9 =0.81.

0.9 *0.0315 =0.02835.

0.0393 *0.9 =0.03537.

0.0393 *0.0315 ≈0.001238.

Adding all:

0.81 +0.02835=0.83835.

+0.03537=0.87372.

+0.001238=0.874958.

So approximately 0.874958.

So 6.93929426 u ≈6 *0.931494 +0.93929426 *0.931494 =5.588964 +0.874958≈6.463922 GeV.

So the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus is about 6.4639 GeV.

Wait, that's higher than the previous calculation. Because earlier with 3 protons and 3 neutrons, I had 5.633 GeV, but using the actual atomic mass, it's about 6.4639 GeV. So which one is correct?

Ah, wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Because the mass of the nucleus is not just the sum of protons and neutrons. It's less due to the mass defect (binding energy). So using the actual mass of Li-6 is better.

So with m_0 c² =6.4639 GeV.

Now, gamma is 3.571428571.

E = gamma * m_0 c² =3.571428571 *6.4639 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3 *6.4639 =19.3917.

0.571428571 *6.4639 ≈.

0.5 *6.4639 =3.23195.

0.071428571 *6.4639 ≈0.4623.

So total for 0.571428571 *6.4639 is approximately 3.23195 +0.4623=3.69425.

So E≈19.3917 +3.69425 =23.08595 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 23.086 GeV, which is very close to option B)23.069 GeV.

Wait, but that's conflicting with the earlier result. So which approach is correct?

I think the confusion arises from whether to use the rest mass of the nucleus as the sum of individual nucleons (which gives around 5.63 GeV) or the actual atomic mass (around 6.46 GeV). But in reality, the correct approach is to use the actual rest mass of the nucleus, which is less than the sum of its nucleons because of the binding energy.

So why the discrepancy in the two methods? Because when you sum the individual nucleon masses, you get a higher value, but the actual nucleus has a lower mass due to the binding energy (mass defect). So the correct approach is to use the actual mass of the nucleus.

But wait, how do I get the actual mass of the nucleus? The problem gives that X is Li with 3 neutrons, which is Li-6. The actual mass can be found from the periodic table.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.94094 u. Each Li atom has 3 electrons. The mass of each electron is about 0.00054858 u, so three electrons would be 0.0016457 u. So the nucleus mass is 6.94094 - 0.0016457 =6.939294 u.

So m_0 c² =6.939294 u * 931.494 MeV/u = appr 6.939294 *931.494 ≈6465 MeV →6.465 GeV.

So using this, E=gamma * m_0 c² =3.571428571 *6.465 GeV.

Compute 3.571428571 *6.465.

3 *6.465 =19.395.

0.571428571 *6.465 =?

0.5 *6.465=3.2325.

0.071428571 *6.465≈0.4622.

So total 3.2325 +0.4622=3.6947.

So E=19.395 +3.6947=23.0897 GeV.

Which is approximately 23.09 GeV. The option B is 23.069 GeV, which is very close. So why the difference? Let's be precise.

Let me compute 3.571428571 *6.465 GeV.

3.571428571 = 25/7 (since 25/7 ≈3.571428571).

So 25/7 *6.465 = (25 *6.465) /7.

25 *6.465=161.625.

161.625 /7 =23.0892857 GeV.

So 23.0892857 GeV ≈23.0893 GeV.

Round to four decimal places: 23.0893 GeV.

Looking at the options, option B is 23.069 GeV. Hmm, that's a bit off. So perhaps I made a mistake in the mass.

Wait, perhaps the actual mass of Li-6 is different. Let me look it up... Wait, I can't actually look it up, but I can recall that the binding energy for light nuclei isn't as significant as for heavy ones. So perhaps the mass of Li-6 is close to 6.94 u, which is about 6.94 *931.5 MeV =6466. So 6.466 GeV.

But wait, using m_0 c²=6.465 GeV, and E=23.089 GeV, but option B is 23.069, which is a bit lower.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me recompute 25/7 *6.465.

25 *6.465 =161.625.

161.625 /7 = 23.08928571 GeV.

Hmm, that's 23.0892857 GeV, which is approximately 23.0893 GeV. But none of the options are exactly that.

Looking at the options:

A)18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

So B is 23.069, which is about 0.02 GeV less than 23.0893. Hmm, that's a discrepancy of about 0.02 GeV, which is 200 MeV. That's quite a big difference, so perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Let me check. If E is the total energy, and K is the kinetic, then K=E -m_0 c².

So K = (gamma -1) * m_0 c².

If m_0 c² is 6.465 GeV, then:

Gamma is 3.571428571.

gamma -1 =2.571428571.

So K=2.571428571 *6.465 GeV.

Compute 2.571428571 *6.465.

2 *6.465 =12.93.

0.571428571 *6.465 = approx 3.6947.

So K=12.93 +3.6947=16.6247 GeV.

Which is about 16.625 GeV, but none of the options are close to that. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe the initial assumption about whether the energy is total or kinetic is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the nucleus as a collection of nucleons, each with their rest mass. So the rest mass is 6 *938.5 MeV =5.631 GeV. So E=gamma *5.631 GeV.

As computed earlier, that gives about 20.12 GeV, which is option C (20.132 GeV).

So why the discrepancy based on whether I use the actual nucleus mass or the sum of nucleons?

Because the actual nucleus mass is about 6.465 GeV, but the sum of nucleons' rest masses is 5.631 GeV. So using the sum would give a lower E, but perhaps the problem expects that approach.

Wait, the question says "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c."

In high-energy physics, the energy of the collider refers to the kinetic energy of the ions. Or is it the total energy? Hmm, sometimes physicists refer to the kinetic energy as the 'energy' in such contexts, but often, the kinetic energy is a part of the total energy. Wait, perhaps the correct formula is to calculate the kinetic energy.

Wait, let's clarify:

The total energy E = gamma m_0 c².

The kinetic energy K = E - m_0 c² = (gamma -1)m_0 c².

Now, the question is about the energy of the collider. RHIC accelerates heavy ions to a certain energy. The energy usually refers to the kinetic energy. So perhaps we should compute K.

But when using the actual nucleus mass, K is about 16.62 GeV, which isn't any of the options. But using the sum of nucleons (5.631 GeV), K = (3.5714 -1)*5.631 =2.5714 *5.631≈14.48 GeV, which also isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total energy. So when using the actual nucleus mass, E=23.09 GeV, which is option B (23.069 GeV), but that's not exact. However, perhaps the problem expects the approach of summing the nucleons' rest masses.

In that case, with m_0 c²=5.631 GeV, E=3.5714 *5.631≈20.119 GeV, which is option C.

But the options given are A)18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

So option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close to our calculation of 20.119 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should carry more precise decimal places in gamma.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2) =1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.571428571428571...

So gamma=3.571428571428571...

So 3.571428571428571 *5.631 GeV.

Let me compute 3.571428571428571 *5.631.

3.571428571428571 =25/7 exactly.

25/7 *5.631 GeV = ?

5.631 *25 =140.775.

140.775 /7 =20.1107142857 GeV.

Hmm, so 20.1107 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. So perhaps the actual calculation would be more precise.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more precisely. Let me compute gamma again.

v=0.96c.

v²= (0.96)^2 c²= 0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28=3.571428571428571...

So gamma is exactly 25/7.

Now, m_0=6 *938.5 MeV =5631 MeV =5.631 GeV.

So E= (25/7) *5.631 GeV.

25/7=3.571428571.

25 *5.631 =140.775.

Divide by 7: 140.775 /7=20.1107142857 GeV.

So 20.1107 GeV.

Now, the options have option C as 20.132 GeV. Hmm, a difference of about 0.021 GeV, which is about 21 MeV. That could come from using more precise values for the rest mass of the nucleons.

Because earlier, when I used more precise nucleon masses (proton:938.272, neutron:939.565), the rest mass was higher.

So let's compute with more precise m_0.

Each proton:938.272 MeV.

Each neutron:939.565 MeV.

So 3 protons:3 *938.272 =2814.816 MeV.

3 neutrons:3 *939.565 =2818.695 MeV.

Total m_0 c² =2814.816 +2818.695 =5633.511 MeV=5.633511 GeV.

So E =gamma * m_0 c² = (25/7) *5.633511 GeV.

Compute 25 *5.633511 =140.837775.

Divide by7:140.837775 /7=20.11968214 GeV.

So approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Which is 20.1197 GeV. The option C is 20.132 GeV. So that's close, but not exact. Perhaps the problem expects this calculation, so the closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the kinetic energy, which would be E - m_0 c^2.

Kinetic energy K= (gamma -1) * m_0 c² = (25/7 -1)*5.633511 GeV.

(25/7 -1) =18/7 ≈2.57142857.

So K=2.57142857 *5.633511 GeV.

Calculate 5.633511 *2.57142857.

5 *2.57142857≈12.85714285.

0.633511 *2.57142857.

0.6 *2.57142857=1.54285714.

0.033511 *2.57142857≈0.08622.

So total 1.54285714 +0.08622=1.629077.

So K≈12.85714285 +1.629077≈14.48622 GeV.

Which is about 14.486 GeV. But this isn't any of the options either.

So perhaps the intended approach is to compute the total energy using the sum of the nucleons' rest masses, leading to option C)20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the actual mass of the nucleus. If the problem uses the sum of the individual nucleons' rest masses, then the correct answer would be option C.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem actually refers to the ion's kinetic energy, but the options don't match either way. So I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, another thought: the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus can be found using the exact atomic mass.

The exact mass of Li-6 is 6.94094 u. But to find the mass of the nucleus, subtract the electrons.

Li has atomic number 3, so each atom has 3 electrons. The mass of each electron is about 0.00054858 u. So 3 electrons:0.0016457 u.

So the mass of the nucleus is 6.94094 -0.0016457=6.939294 u.

Convert to GeV:6.939294 u *931.494 MeV/u =6.939294 *0.931494 GeV.

Compute 6.939294 *0.931494.

6 *0.931494=5.588964.

0.939294 *0.931494.

Let me compute 0.939294 *0.931494.

0.9 *0.9 =0.81.

0.9 *0.031494=0.0283446.

0.039294 *0.9=0.0353646.

0.039294 *0.031494≈0.001240.

Adding these up:

0.81 +0.0283446 =0.8383446.

+0.0353646=0.8737092.

+0.001240=0.8749492.

So total is 5.588964 +0.8749492 =6.4639132 GeV.

So m_0 c²=6.4639132 GeV.

E=gamma * m_0 c²=3.571428571 *6.4639132 GeV=?

3.571428571 *6.4639132.

Compute 3 *6.4639132=19.3917396.

0.571428571 *6.4639132.

0.5 *6.4639132=3.2319566.

0.071428571 *6.4639132≈0.4623.

So 3.2319566 +0.4623=3.6942566.

Total E=19.3917396 +3.6942566=23.0859962 GeV.

Approximately 23.086 GeV. So looking at the options, option B is 23.069 GeV, which is close but not exact.

The discrepancy is about 0.017 GeV, which is 17 MeV. That's small, but perhaps due to rounding in the problem's numbers.

Wait, perhaps the question expects us to use the rest mass of the entire atom, including electrons. Let me compute that.

The atomic mass is 6.94094 u. So m_0 c² =6.94094 *931.494 MeV →6.94094 *0.931494 GeV.

Compute 6.94094 *0.931494.

6 *0.931494=5.588964.

0.94094 *0.931494.

0.9 *0.931494=0.8383446.

0.04094 *0.931494≈0.038298.

So 0.8383446 +0.038298≈0.8766426.

So total m_0 c²=5.588964 +0.8766426=6.4656066 GeV.

E=gamma *6.4656066 =3.571428571 *6.4656066.

3 *6.4656066=19.3968198.

0.571428571 *6.4656066.

0.5 *6.4656066=3.2328033.

0.071428571 *6.4656066≈0.4623.

So 3.2328033 +0.4623=3.6951033.

Total E=19.3968198 +3.6951033≈23.0919231 GeV.

Which is about 23.0919 GeV. Still, option B is 23.069 GeV, which is close but not exact.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the rest mass as the sum of the individual nucleons. Let me redo the calculation with that.

m_0 c²=5.633511 GeV.

E=gamma *m_0 c²=3.571428571 *5.633511 GeV.

As computed earlier, this is approximately 20.1197 GeV, which is option C (20.132 GeV) when rounded to four decimal places.

Wait, but the options have four decimal places. So perhaps the exact calculation would yield 20.132 GeV.

Wait, let me compute 3.571428571 *5.633511 more precisely.

3.571428571 *5.633511.

Let me compute 3.571428571 *5.633511.

Break it down:

3 *5.633511 =16.900533.

0.571428571 *5.633511.

Compute 0.5 *5.633511=2.8167555.

0.071428571 *5.633511.

Compute 0.07 *5.633511=0.39434577.

0.001428571 *5.633511≈0.008062.

So 0.07 calculation: 0.39434577 +0.008062=0.40240777.

So 0.071428571 *5.633511≈0.40240777.

So 0.571428571 *5.633511=2.8167555 +0.40240777=3.21916327.

So E=16.900533 +3.21916327=20.119696 GeV.

So 20.119696 GeV, which is approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Rounded to four decimal places, it's 20.1197, which is 20.1197 GeV. The option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps the calculation in the problem expects the use of gamma=3.5714286 and m_0 c²=6 *938.3 MeV.

Wait, 6 *938.3 MeV=5629.8 MeV=5.6298 GeV.

E=3.5714286 *5.6298 GeV.

3.5714286 *5 =17.857143.

3.5714286 *0.6298= ?

0.5 *0.6298=0.3149.

0.0714286 *0.6298≈0.04514.

So 3.5714286 *0.6298=3.5714286 *0.6=2.14285716 +3.5714286 *0.0298.

Wait, better to compute 3.5714286 *0.6298.

Compute 3.5714286 *0.6 =2.14285716.

3.5714286 *0.0298= approx 0.10658.

So total 2.14285716 +0.10658=2.249437.

So E=17.857143 +2.249437=20.10658 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.1066 GeV. Still not matching option C exactly.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers the nucleus as a single particle with a mass of 6 *938.3 MeV, which gives E=3.5714286 * 5.6298 GeV≈20.1066 GeV. But option C is 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the use of gamma =3.8856 to get an E of about 20.132 GeV. Let me compute 5.631 * gamma =20.132.

Gamma=20.132 /5.631 ≈3.574.

Wait, that's close to our gamma of 3.5714. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the sum of the nucleons and the gamma as calculated, leading to E=20.1197 GeV, which is closest to option C (20.132 GeV). So the answer should be option C.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we calculate the total relativistic energy of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, giving it a total of 6 nucleons. The relativistic energy is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m_0 \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
v^2/c^2 = 0.96^2 = 0.9216, \quad 1 - v^2/c^2 = 0.0784, \quad \sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28, \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

The rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus is approximated as the sum of the rest masses of its nucleons. Using \( m_p \approx 938.272 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) for a proton and \( m_n \approx 939.565 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) for a neutron, the total rest mass is:

\[
m_0 c^2 = 3m_p + 3m_n = 3(938.272) + 3(939.565) = 5633.511 \, \text{MeV} = 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma \) and \( m_0 c^2 \) into the energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:

\[
3 \times 5.633511 = 16.900533, \quad 0.5714 \times 5.633511 \approx 3.219163
\]

\[
E = 16.900533 + 3.219163 = 20.119696 \, \text{GeV}
\]

This result, \( E \approx 20.1197 \, \text{GeV} \), is very close to option C, \( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \). The small discrepancy is likely due to rounding differences in intermediate steps. Based on the calculations, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
