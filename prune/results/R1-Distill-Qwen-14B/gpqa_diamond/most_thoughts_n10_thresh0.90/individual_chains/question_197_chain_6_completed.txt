Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it again. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, then predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of an ester, right? I remember that reaction conditions like that usually lead to the formation of a carboxylic acid from an ester.

Wait, let me think. So the initial compound, Compound X, probably has an ester group because the IR data shows a strong peak around 1720 cm⁻¹. That's characteristic of a carbonyl group, like an ester or maybe a ketone. But wait, if it were a ketone, the IR would be slightly different, maybe around 1700-1750, but esters have similar ranges. So maybe it's an ester.

Looking at the IR data again: 3400–2500 cm-1. That broad region usually indicates O-H stretching, which might be from an acidic proton, like in a carboxylic acid. But wait, if the compound is an ester, it wouldn't have an -OH group. Hmm, maybe the ester is undergoing some reaction. Oh wait, the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which I think is a method for the hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids. So the product would have a -COOH group.

Wait, but the initial compound may have an ester group. So the IR shows 1720 cm⁻¹, which supports that. So let me think about the NMR data.

The 1H NMR data is as follows:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm is probably an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. But wait, if the initial compound X is an ester, then after reaction, it becomes a carboxylic acid. So perhaps in the starting compound X, there was an ester group, and after hydrolysis, the product is a carboxylic acid. But then the initial NMR would have the ester protons, so maybe I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no. Let me re-examine. The NMR is for Compound X, the starting material. So if the NMR shows a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm, that's probably an -OH. But wait, esters don't have -OH groups. So maybe the starting compound isn't an ester. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ isn't an ester. Could it be a ketone? But then where's the O-H? Wait, the IR has a broad region from 3400–2500 cm-1, which might suggest an -OH stretch. But if the compound has a ketone, then why that broad peak? Or could it be an alcohol? But if it's an ester, then maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps it's an aldehyde? But aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet in NMR. But the 10.5 ppm here is a broad singlet, which might not fit. Also, an aldehyde's IR would have a peak around 2820 and 2720 (the aldehyde C-H stretch), but the IR here doesn't show those. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the 10.5 ppm is an acidic proton, like from a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if that's the case, then the starting material is a carboxylic acid, which upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI would do what? No, wait, the reaction conditions would affect the starting material. Wait, if the starting material is a carboxylic acid and you treat it with HI and red phosphorus, maybe it's an elimination reaction or some other process. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, let me think about the reaction. Red phosphorus and HI is commonly used for the hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids. So if the starting compound X is an ester, the product would be a carboxylic acid. Let me look at the options. Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That has a benzoic acid group, so the -COOH would be at position 4 on the benzene ring, and a sec-butyl group at position 4 as well.

Wait, but the NMR for X shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet. Carboxylic acids have broad -OH peaks around 10-12 ppm. But if X is an ester, then the ester's carbonyl would be at 1720 cm⁻¹, which matches the IR. But then in the NMR, we wouldn't see an -OH proton. So that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the IR's 3400–2500 cm-1 isn't O-H. Could it be an -NH stretch? Unlikely because the NMR doesn't show any exchange broadening that would suggest amine protons. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol's O-H. But if X is an ester, then maybe the O-H is from another part, like an alcohol group elsewhere. But looking at the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a singlet, 1H. Maybe it's an aldehyde proton? But aldehydes are usually deshielded and appear around 9-10 ppm. But 10.5 is a bit upfield for an aldehyde, but I'm not certain.

Wait, alternatively, maybe it's an acidic O-H from a phenol group. Phenoxy compounds like phenols have O-H stretches around 3000-3500 cm-1. So if the IR has a peak in that region, it's possible that X has a phenol group. But then, again, would that fit with the 1720 cm-1 IR peak?

Wait, maybe the 1720 is from an ester carbonyl. So X is an ester with a phenol group? That seems less likely. Or perhaps it's a ketone and a phenol. But the NMR doesn't show any peaks that would indicate a ketone, except for maybe the 2.9 ppm multiplet, which could be adjacent to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1720 cm-1 is an ester, and the broad peak is from an -OH of a carboxylic acid. But that would imply that X is a carboxylic acid, which doesn't make sense because esters are usually derived from acids. Hmm, getting a bit stuck here.

Let me look at the NMR again. The peak at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) is likely an -OH proton. So X has an -OH group. The 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests an ester or possibly a ketone. But if X is an ester, then why the O-H? Maybe X is an ester with an -OH group elsewhere, like a phenol.

Wait, the NMR has 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted benzene ring. Because the doublets suggest coupling between two sets of protons, which would be the case for a para-substituted ring. So the benzene has two substituents in para positions. What substituents could that be? Well, if one substituent is an ester group, and another is an ethyl group, perhaps.

Wait, looking at the other NMR peaks: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Let's see. The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) likely comes from a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl chain. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is probably a CH(CH3) group, maybe part of an isobutyl or similar. The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) and 1.7 ppm (2H) could be a CH2CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, maybe part of an ester.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is something like a benzene ring with two substituents: one being an ester group (like OCO-R) and another being a substituent with an ethyl chain, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group and an isobutyl group.

Wait, the options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid → That would be a benzene ring with ethyl at position 4, and a propanoic acid at position 2. But the NMR doesn't show a triplet for an ethyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, no, in option A, the substituents are at positions 4 (ethyl) and 2 (propanoic acid). The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which would correspond to a CH2CH3 group. So the ethyl is part of the substituent on the benzene.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid → So benzene ring with a sec-butyl group at position 4 and a carboxylic acid at position 4 as well? Wait, no, if it's 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, that would mean the carboxylic acid is in position 4, and the sec-butyl is also in position 4? That can't be right because a benzene ring can't have two substituents in the same position. Wait, perhaps I'm misreading the name. Oh wait, '4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid' would mean the carboxylic acid is at position 1, and the sec-butyl is at position 4. Because in benzoic acid, the COOH is at position 1, and the other substituents are numbered accordingly.

So for option C, the benzene would have COOH at position 1 (or position 4?), and the sec-butyl at position 4. Wait, no, benzoic acid has the COOH at position 1. So number the ring such that the COOH is position 1, then the substituent would be at position 4. So the structure would have the COOH in position 1 and the sec-butyl in position 4.

Looking at the NMR data for X, the 10.5 ppm peak would be the COOH proton if X is a benzoic acid. But wait, the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which would hydrolyze an ester to a carboxylic acid. So if X is an ester, the product would be a carboxylic acid.

Wait, let me think differently. Suppose X is an ester, like R-O-CO-Ar, where Ar is an aromatic ring. Then, hydrolysis would yield R-OH and Ar-COOH. But looking at the NMR, if X has an ester group, then the carbonyl would be at 1720, and the ester oxygen would have neighboring CH2 groups.

Looking at the NMR data again: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) might not be from an ester, as esters don't have -OH. So perhaps X is a benzoic acid derivative. Hmm, but then why the 1720 cm⁻¹ in IR?

Wait, another thought: maybe X is an acetylated phenol. So perhaps it's an ester where the phenolic OH is protected. But then the NMR would show the ester protons.

Wait, maybe the IR shows an ester carbonyl (1720 cm⁻¹) and the broad peak around 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is from an -OH group, perhaps a phenol. So X is an ester with a phenol group. But then, after hydrolysis with red phosphorus and HI, the ester would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid, and the phenol would remain.

Wait, that might fit. Let me outline the structure. Suppose the benzene ring has a substituent that is an ester group (OOCR) and a substituent that is a phenol group (-OH). But phenol's OH would typically show as a broad peak around 5-7 ppm, but the data shows 10.5 ppm. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Unless the -OH is part of a carboxylic acid, but then why would X have a carboxylic acid and an ester?

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me consider the reaction. The reaction is between Compound X and red phosphorus and HI. This is a classic method for the hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids. So the product would have a -COOH group.

Looking at the options, options A and C are carboxylic acids, while B and D are substituted benzenes without the acid group. So the product should be either A, C, or another acid.

So, to recap, the product is a carboxylic acid. Let's look at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So if X is an ester, then after hydrolysis, it becomes the acid.

Now, let's think about the NMR of X. Let's reconstruct the structure. The aromatic region in NMR has two doublets, which suggests a para-substituted benzene. So two substituents opposite each other.

The 10.5 ppm peak is a singlet (1H), broad. Probably an -OH, but if X is an ester, that doesn't fit. Unless it's part of another functional group.

Wait, maybe the substituents are an ester group and a group with an -OH. But if X is an ester, how does that fit?

Alternatively, perhaps the IR's 3400–2500 cm-1 is not an O-H but an N-H stretch. But the NMR doesn't show any peaks that would suggest amine protons, so that's unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the IR's peak is from an alkyne or something else. But that might be stretching it.

Let me think about the NMR again. The 1H NMR has peaks at 10.5 (1H, broad), 8.0 (d, 2H), 7.2 (d, 2H). So the aromatic protons are in a para-substituted pattern, with two sets of doublets. That suggests two substituents on the benzene ring in para positions.

So, the substituents could be an ester group and another group, perhaps a methyl group or an ethyl group, but looking at the other NMR signals, there's a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is likely a CH2CH3 group. So perhaps one substituent is an ethyl group, and the other is an ester.

Wait, but if the substituents are an ester and an ethyl group in para, then the NMR would show two sets of aromatic protons, which matches the data.

But then, the NMR also has peaks at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Let's see. The 0.9 ppm triplet suggests a CH2CH3 group, which could be part of an ester's R group.

The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a CH(CH3) group. So maybe the R group in the ester is CH2CH(CH3)2, but wait, that would give more protons. Alternatively, perhaps the R group is CH2CH2CH(CH3) or something else.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) and 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be from a CH2CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl. Let me try to sketch this.

Suppose the ester is O-CO-O-R, where R is a group that connects to the benzene. Wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So perhaps the benzene has an ester group, like O-CO-R.

Wait, but what's R? The other substituent is an ethyl group, so perhaps the benzene has O-CO-R and an ethyl group in para positions.

The R group in the ester would have the structure that gives the NMR signals. Let's see:

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH connected to the carbonyl. Then, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be two CH2 groups. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH(CH3) group. And the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a CH2CH3.

So maybe the R group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH(CH3)-, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a propyl group attached to something else.

Wait, let's think of the R group as CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH3. Wait, that would make the group something like CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH3, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O-CO-R where R is a pentyl group or similar.

Wait, perhaps the R group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-. No, that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, maybe the R group is a secondary butyl group.

Wait, another approach: looking at the NMR shifts. The triplet at 0.9 ppm is likely a terminal CH2CH3 group. The doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H) suggests a CH(CH3) group. The multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H) and 1.7 ppm (2H) could be from a CH2CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl.

Putting this together, perhaps the R group is a butyl group. Let's see: if R is CH2CH2CH(CH3)2, but that would give more protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a 3-pentyl group?

Alternatively, perhaps the R group is a secondary butyl group attached to the carbonyl. So the structure would be O-CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-... Wait, maybe a sec-butyl group.

Wait, so the ester group would be O-CO-CH2-C(CH2CH3)(something). But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Let me think about the possible structures.

Suppose the benzene ring has an ester group O-CO-R and a substituent R' which is an ethyl group. The substituents are para to each other.

In the NMR, the aromatic protons would be as observed: two doublets, indicating para substitution.

The R group in the ester would have the following structure based on the NMR:

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is a CH2CH3 group, which suggests that the R group has an ethyl chain. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is a CH(CH3) group, so that suggests a branching point. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) and 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might come from a CH2CH2 group adjacent to the branching.

Putting this together, R could be an isobutyl group. Wait, but isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2, but then the NMR would show more complexity. Alternatively, maybe it's a sec-butyl group.

The sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me draw it: the structure would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the R group is a CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH3 group. So the ester would be O-CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3.

Wait, that would give an isobutyl group. Then, the ester would be phenyl isobutyrate or something similar.

So, the structure of X could be 4-ethylphenyl isobutyrate. Wait, but let me see.

In that case, the benzene ring has an ethyl group and an ester group in para positions. The ester group is O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, that's not correct. Esters are R-O-CO-R', so in this case, the R would be the benzene ring, and R' is the isobutyl group.

Wait, no, if it's 4-ethylphenyl ester, then the structure would be O-CO-O-Ph, where Ph is 4-ethylphenyl. Wait, that's not right. Let me correct: the ester would be O-CO-O- attached to the phenyl ring. So the structure would be Ph-O-CO-R', where R' is the isobutyl group.

In that scenario, the R' group (isobutyl) would have the following structure: CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH3. But wait, that's a t-butyl group, which is a tertiary butyl. No, wait, the isobutyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)2, which is a secondary butyl group.

Wait, no. The isobutyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)2, which is a secondary butyl group. So, in that case, R' would be isobutyl.

So, the ester would be Ph-O-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)2.

Now, looking at the NMR data for X, the 1H NMR would show the following for the R' group:

The isobutyl group has a CH2 connected to the carbonyl. This CH2 would be split into a triplet or multiplet. The CH(CH3)2 would have a singlet for the two CH3 groups attached to the CH.

Wait, but looking at the NMR data:

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be the CH group in the isobutyl (since it's connected to two CH3 groups and a CH2). The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the CH2 connected to the carbonyl. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be the two equivalent CH3 groups on the CH, but since it's a d (doublet), that suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. Wait, but if it's two CH3 groups, they should be equivalent and give a singlet. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the R' group is a pentyl group, but that doesn't fit the NMR as well.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the R group is a propyl chain with a methyl branch. Let's consider a structure like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But that would be a pentyl group. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the R group is a 3-pentyl group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the R group is a sec-butyl group. Let me think about that. A sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's not correct. Wait, no, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a 2-methylpropyl group, but that's the same as isobutyl.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the structure of R'. Let me try to imagine the NMR of an isobutyl group attached to a carbonyl.

The isobutyl group would have:

- The CH2 next to the carbonyl: this would be a triplet, perhaps around 2.9 ppm.

- The CH group (central carbon in isobutyl): this would be a septet (due to coupling with six protons?), but that doesn't fit the data.

Wait, no, wait. The isobutyl group is CH2-CH(CH3)2. The CH2 group next to the carbonyl would be split into a triplet because it's adjacent to the CH group. The CH group would be a septet because it's connected to two CH3 groups (each with three protons) and the CH2. But in the NMR data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (1H), which could correspond to this CH group, which is connected to three other protons (the two CH3 groups and the CH2). Wait, but the CH group in isobutyl has two CH3 groups attached, so it's connected to 6 protons. So the splitting would be complex, perhaps a septet, but the NMR shows a multiplet. Maybe that's possible.

The CH2 group (next to carbonyl) would be a triplet integrating for 2H, but in the data, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet (2H). That might fit.

The two CH3 groups on the CH would be a doublet of septets or something, but perhaps in the NMR, they would appear as a singlet because they're equivalent. But in the data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which suggests coupling with one proton. That doesn't fit with the CH3 groups in isobutyl, which should be equivalent and give a singlet.

Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong about the structure. Maybe R' is a different group.

Wait, another possibility: R' is a 3-pentyl group. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the R' group is a propyl group with a methyl branch. For example, CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH3. But that would give a different splitting pattern.

Wait, perhaps the R' group is a pentyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the R' group is a secondary butyl group, which would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. But that would have a similar structure to isobutyl but with an ethyl branch.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible products. The options are either benzoic acid derivatives or other substituted benzenes. The reaction is hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid.

So, the product would be a benzoic acid derivative with substituents.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

If X is the ester form of this, then X would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate ester. So, the ester would be something like CH2CH(CH2CH3)COO- attached to the benzene.

Wait, no. The ester of benzoic acid would be PhCOOR. So, if the benzoic acid is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the ester would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate, where R is the alkyl group from the ester.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think: if the ester is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate, then the benzene ring has a COOR group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

Wait, no. Wait, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid would have COOH at position 1 and sec-butyl at position 4. So, the ester would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate ester, where the R in COOR is some group.

Wait, but the problem states that X is the starting material. So, the structure of X is the ester, and upon hydrolysis, it becomes the acid.

So, if X is the ester, then its structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate ester, where the R group is, say, ethyl or something else.

Wait, but looking at the NMR data, the R group in the ester (COOR) must match the signals we see.

The NMR for X has a CH2CH3 group (0.9 ppm, triplet), which would correspond to an ethyl group. So perhaps R is ethyl.

So, the ester would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate ethyl ester.

Wait, but that would mean the structure is PhCOOCH2CH3, where Ph is 4-(sec-butyl)phenyl.

But then the NMR of X (the ester) would show the ethyl group (0.9 ppm, triplet), the CH2 from the ethyl ester group (around 4 ppm as a quartet), but the data doesn't show a quartet near 4 ppm. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the R group is a longer chain. For example, if R is a propyl group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the R group in the ester is a secondary butyl group. So, the ester would be PhCOO-(CH2)2CH(CH3)2, which is a tertiary butyl ester. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the R group in the ester is an isobutyl group. So, the ester would be PhCOOCH2CH(CH3)2.

Looking at the NMR data, the isobutyl group would give a triplet for the CH2 (connected to the carbonyl), a multiplet for the CH, and a singlet for the two CH3 groups attached to the CH.

Wait, but in the NMR data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which suggests coupling with one proton. If the CH3 groups are attached to a CH that's connected to another CH2, then each CH3 would couple with the CH, giving a doublet. So that fits with the 1.4 ppm doublet.

The CH group would be a septet (coupled with the two CH3 groups and the adjacent CH2). But in the data, it's a multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H). That could fit.

The CH2 group between the carbonyl and the CH would be a triplet (since it's next to the CH), but in the data, it's a multiplet at 1.7 ppm (2H). Hmm, maybe it's split into a more complex multiplet because of neighboring groups.

So, putting it all together, the ester group would be COOCH2CH(CH3)2 (isobutyl ester), and the benzene ring would have this ester group and another substituent.

Wait, the benzene ring has two substituents in para positions: one is the ester group, and the other is an ethyl group, as indicated by the triplet at 0.9 ppm.

Wait, no, the NMR shows an aromatic ring with two substituents in para, and the substituents are the ester group and another group. The other substituent may not necessarily be an ethyl group, but the triplet at 0.9 ppm suggests an ethyl group elsewhere.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a methyl group. But the triplet would suggest a CH2CH3 group.

So, if the benzene ring has an ester group (COO-) and an ethyl group in para positions, then the structure would be 4-ethyl phenyl isobutyrate.

But let me think about the NMR again. The aromatic protons would be as observed: two sets of doublets, indicating para substitution.

The ester group would have the following protons:

- The ethyl group (CH2CH3): triplet at 0.9 ppm.

- The isobutyl group (COOCH2CH(CH3)2): the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be a triplet at around 4 ppm, but the data doesn't show a peak there. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, but the data doesn't have a peak around 4 ppm. So perhaps the R group is not ethyl.

Wait, perhaps the R group in the ester is a propyl group. But then the triplet would be at lower ppm.

Alternatively, perhaps the R group is a butyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the R group is a methyl group. But that would give a singlet at around 3 ppm, which isn't present.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Looking at the options again, the product after hydrolysis is a carboxylic acid. The options are A, C, and others. Let's think about the possible product structures.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the benzene ring has a COOH group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

If X is the ester, then X would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate ester. So, the structure would be PhCOOR, where R is some alkyl group.

The NMR of X (the ester) would have the aromatic protons as observed, and the R group's protons as per the NMR data.

The NMR data for X has a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which suggests an ethyl group. So R would be ethyl.

Wait, if R is ethyl, then the ester would be PhCOOCH2CH3.

But then, the NMR for X would show the ethyl group as a triplet at 0.9 ppm, and the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl as a quartet around 4 ppm. But the data doesn't have a quartet around 4 ppm, so that suggests that R is not ethyl.

Hmm, perhaps R is a different group. Let's think about the other NMR signals.

The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) and 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) might come from a CH2CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl. So R could be a pentyl group, but not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the R group is a 3-pentyl group. For example, R is CH2CH2CH(CH3)2. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the R group is a propyl group with a methyl branch, like isobutyl. So R is isobutyl.

In that case, the ester would be PhCOO(CH2)CH(CH3)2.

So the NMR for the R group would show:

- The CH2 next to the carbonyl: triplet around 4 ppm (but not seen in data).

- The CH group: septet around 2.9 ppm (matches the data).

- The two CH3 groups attached to the CH: doublet around 1.4 ppm (matches the data).

- The CH2CH3 group: triplet at 0.9 ppm (matches the data).

Wait, but wait, in this scenario, the R group would be isobutyl, which is CH2CH(CH3)2. So the ester would be PhCOOCH2CH(CH3)2.

Wait, but that would make R = isobutyl, which is a tertiary butyl group. So the ester would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate isobutyl ester? No, wait, the benzoic acid is 4-(sec-butyl), so the ester would have the same substituent.

Wait, no. The benzoate ester would have the substituents on the benzene ring. So if the benzoic acid is 4-(sec-butyl), then the ester would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate, with R being the alkyl group from the ester.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled up. Let me try to outline the structure clearly.

The ester X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate with R being another alkyl group. The R group's structure must account for the NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (1H), 1.7 ppm (2H), 1.4 ppm (3H), and 0.9 ppm (3H).

If I consider R to be a pentyl group with a methyl branch, perhaps it fits.

Alternatively, maybe R is an ethyl group, but that doesn't fit the NMR data.

Wait, perhaps the R group is an ethyl group, and the other substituent is a group that contributes to the NMR signals. But I'm not making progress.

Wait, let's think about the product options. The product after hydrolysis is either option A, C, or another acid. Let's consider option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

If X is the ester of this acid, then X would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate ester. So the structure would be:

PhCOO-R, where Ph is 4-(sec-butyl)phenyl.

So, the ester group is O-CO-O-R attached to the benzene ring, and the benzene has a sec-butyl group at position 4.

The R group in the ester would have to match the NMR signals.

Looking at the NMR data for X, the R group's signals are:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): likely a CH group adjacent to the carbonyl.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): perhaps a CH2 group adjacent to the CH.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a CH3 group adjacent to the CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a CH2CH3 group.

So, putting this together, R could be a 3-pentyl group or similar.

Wait, let me imagine R as CH2CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3. No, that would be a longer chain.

Alternatively, R could be a 2-methylpropyl group, which is isobutyl.

Wait, if R is isobutyl (CH2CH(CH3)2), then the ester would be PhCOOCH2CH(CH3)2.

In this case, the NMR of X would show:

- The CH2 next to the carbonyl: triplet around 4 ppm (not observed).

- The CH group: septet around 2.9 ppm (matches).

- The two CH3 groups on the CH: doublet around 1.4 ppm (matches).

But where is the 0.9 ppm triplet? That would come from an ethyl group. So unless the R group also has an ethyl chain, which it doesn't in this case.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Another possibility is that the R group is a propyl group with a methyl branch.

Wait, perhaps R is a 3-pentyl group, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe R is a cyclopropyl group, but that's not indicated by the data.

Wait, perhaps the R group is a secondary butyl group. So, the structure would be CH2CH(CH2CH3)2.

Wait, but that's not possible, as that would be a tertiary butyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the R group is a 2-methylpropyl group, which is the same as isobutyl.

Wait, but in that case, the ethyl group isn't part of R. So, where does the 0.9 ppm triplet come from?

Ah, wait! The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) could be from another substituent on the benzene ring, not part of the ester group. So, the benzene ring has two substituents: one is the ester group (COOR), and the other is an ethyl group in the para position.

So, the structure would be 4-ethylphenyl isobutyrate.

In this case, the ester group is O-CO-O-isobutyl attached to the benzene, and the benzene has an ethyl group in the para position.

So, the benzene ring substituents are:

- At position 1: O-CO-O-isobutyl.

- At position 4: ethyl group.

Wait, but if that's the case, the NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets (d, each 2H), which matches the data.

The ester's R group (isobutyl) would contribute the peaks at 2.9 ppm (CH), 1.7 ppm (CH2), and 1.4 ppm (CH3), and the ethyl group on the benzene would contribute the triplet at 0.9 ppm.

So, putting it all together, the structure of X is 4-ethylphenyl isobutyrate.

When X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, the ester group is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. So the product would be 4-ethylphenyl isobutyric acid. Wait, no, the product would be the acid, so 4-ethylbenzoic acid with the isobutyl group.

Wait, no. The ester is PhCOOR, so hydrolysis would yield PhCOOH, where Ph is 4-ethylphenyl. But that's not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me clarify.

If X is 4-ethylphenyl isobutyrate, its structure is:

Ph-O-CO-O-R, where R is isobutyl, and Ph is 4-ethylphenyl.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Esters are R-O-CO-R', so in this case, the ester would be Ph-O-CO-R', where Ph is 4-ethylphenyl and R' is isobutyl. So, the structure is 4-ethylphenyl isobutyrate.

Upon hydrolysis with red phosphorus and HI, the ester hydrolyzes to the carboxylic acid. So the product would be 4-ethylbenzoic acid, but I don't see that option.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group at position 4, and the COOH is at position 1.

So, the product would have the COOH at position 1 and a sec-butyl at position 4. So the starting material X would be the ester, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate.

So, if X is the ester 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate, then upon hydrolysis, it becomes 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

But then, the NMR of X would show the ester's R group. Let me check if that fits.

The ester would be PhCOOR, where Ph is 4-(sec-butyl)phenyl, and R is something.

Wait, no. If the ester is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate, then R would be the alkyl group from the ester. The NMR data for X would show the R group's protons.

Looking at the NMR data, the R group's signals are 2.9 ppm (1H), 1.7 ppm (2H), 1.4 ppm (3H), and 0.9 ppm (3H). So R must be a group that has a CH2CH2 and a CH3 group, perhaps a pentyl group.

Wait, perhaps R is a 3-pentyl group. Let me think: R would be CH2CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Hmm, but that's a pentyl group, and the NMR would show more complexity.

Alternatively, perhaps R is a secondary butyl group.

Wait, the R group in the ester would have:

- A CH2 group next to the carbonyl (appearing around 2.9 ppm as a multiplet).

- A CH group (appearing around 1.7 ppm as a multiplet).

- A CH3 group (appearing as a doublet around 1.4 ppm).

- And a CH2CH3 group (appearing as a triplet around 0.9 ppm).

So, the R group would be something like CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3, but that's a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps R is a 3-pentyl group. The structure would be CH2CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe R is an isopropyl group, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should think about the product. The product is either option A or C.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the substituents are COOH at position 1 and sec-butyl at position 4.

If X is the ester, then X would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate ester. The R group in the ester must match the NMR data.

So, R would have:

- A CH2 group next to the carbonyl (appearing as a triplet around 4 ppm, but it's not in the data).

Wait, but the data doesn't show a peak around 4 ppm. So perhaps R is not ethyl.

Alternatively, perhaps R is a group that doesn't have a CH2 next to the carbonyl showing up in the NMR. Maybe R is a cyclopropyl group, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe R is a methyl group, but that would give a singlet around 3 ppm, which isn't observed.

Hmm. Perhaps I should consider that the starting material is not an ester but a different compound. Wait, another possibility: if the IR shows a carbonyl at 1720 cm⁻¹, and the broad peak around 10.5 ppm, maybe it's an acid anhydride. But acid anhydrides typically have two carbonyl peaks, which might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone with an -OH group elsewhere, but that doesn't seem to fit the NMR.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting material is a phenyl acetate derivative. So, the benzene ring has an ester group (OAc) and another substituent.

But then the NMR would show the acetyl group's protons as a triplet around 2 ppm, but the data doesn't show that.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is attached to a branched chain, which explains the NMR signals.

Wait, maybe the ester is 4-(something)phenyl propionate or similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is attached to a benzene ring with another substituent, and the R group is a branched chain.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think differently. The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which suggests a CH2CH3 group. So, there's an ethyl group somewhere.

The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH group, which is attached to another group.

The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) and 1.7 ppm (2H) suggest a CH2CH2 group adjacent to a CH.

Putting this together, the R group is likely a sec-butyl group. So R would be CH2CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, but that would make the ester R group a secondary butyl group.

So, the structure of X would be PhCOOCH2CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, but the NMR data doesn't show a peak for the CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the R group is a 3-pentyl group. But I'm not sure.

At this point, perhaps I should conclude that the correct product is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Because the reaction conditions suggest hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid, and the NMR data for X fits an ester with a branched R group.


The problem involves identifying the final product of a reaction between Compound X and red phosphorus with HI. The IR and NMR data for Compound X suggest it is an ester. The IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbonyl group typical of esters, while the broad peak in the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ region could correspond to an -OH group, possibly from a phenol or alcohol. The NMR data provides further clues about the structure of Compound X.

### Key Observations from the NMR Data:
1. **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: Likely corresponds to an -OH proton, possibly from a phenol group.
2. **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Indicate a para-substituted benzene ring.
3. **2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: Suggest a branched alkyl group, likely a secondary butyl group.

### Analysis of Compound X:
- The para-substituted benzene ring indicates two substituents in opposite positions. One substituent is likely the ester group (-COOR), and the other is a secondary butyl group (-CH2-CH(CH3)2).
- The ester group explains the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, while the secondary butyl group accounts for the NMR signals at 2.9 ppm, 1.7 ppm, 1.4 ppm, and 0.9 ppm.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids. Therefore, the ester group in Compound X will be converted into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The secondary butyl group remains unchanged during the reaction.

### Identification of the Final Product:
After hydrolysis, the product is a carboxylic acid with a benzene ring substituted at position 1 by a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and at position 4 by a secondary butyl group (-CH2-CH(CH3)2). This matches the structure of **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid)**: Incorrect, as the NMR data does not support an ethyl group on the benzene ring.
- **Option B (1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene)**: Incorrect, as it does not contain a carboxylic acid group.
- **Option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid)**: Correct, as it matches the structure derived from the reaction of Compound X with red phosphorus and HI.
- **Option D (1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene)**: Incorrect, as it does not contain a carboxylic acid group.

### Conclusion:
The final product of the reaction is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.
