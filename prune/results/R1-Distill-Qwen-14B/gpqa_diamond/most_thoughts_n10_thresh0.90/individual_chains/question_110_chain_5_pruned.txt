Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, let's break it down. The question gives me five stars with various properties, and I need to figure out which ones are observable by both instruments.

Wait, the key is understanding the magnitude limits. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So, that means any star with a V magnitude less than or equal to 17 is observable, right? Because the brighter the star (lower magnitude), the easier to detect. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So, for HIRES, the apparent V magnitude must be less than or equal to 16 mag.

So each star needs to satisfy both conditions. Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 can be observed. Wait, does that mean observable are those with V ≤17? Because magnitudes work inversely. Brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So, if a star is brighter than 17 mag (which is higher magnitude?), wait, no. Wait, let me read it correctly. Oh wait, I think I got it reversed.

Wait, the question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh wait, no, no. Wait, wait. Wait, the way it's phrased is a bit confusing. Because in astronomy, lower magnitude means brighter. So, if a star has a V magnitude brighter than 17 mag, that's when V is less than 17. Because a V of 5 is brighter than 15.

Wait, the statement says, "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So, if a star is brighter than 17 mag, meaning V <17, then ESPRESSO can observe it. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so V <16.

So, each star's apparent V magnitude must be less than 17 (for ESPRESSO) and less than 16 (for HIRES). So, the star must satisfy V <16 to be observed by both, because HIRES is more restrictive. Because if a star is V=15, it's okay for both. If it's V=16.5, it's not observable by HIRES but maybe by ESPRESSO.

Wait, wait, let's get the exact numbers right. The question says: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed."

Wait, so for ESPRESSO, the apparent V mag must be ≤17. Because "brighter than 17" would be V < 17. Because a brighter star is lower magnitude. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with V <16.

So, for a star to be observed by both, its apparent V magnitude must be less than 16. Because if it's
