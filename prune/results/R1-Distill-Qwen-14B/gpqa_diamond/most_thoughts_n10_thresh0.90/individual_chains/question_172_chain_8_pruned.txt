Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres, specifically about iron atoms being in different energy levels. Hmm, I remember from my studies that the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere relates to the temperature. Oh right, the Boltzmann distribution! That's the one that tells us about the distribution of particles in different energy states based on temperature.

So the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Wait, I should clarify what that means. Oh, right, the number of atoms in a higher energy state compared to a lower one is given by the Boltzmann factor. So, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or another lower state) is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference and T is the temperature.

Wait, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, and k is Boltzmann's constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, same value! So k = ΔE / (1/T1 or T2 or something like that?)

The ratio of the populations for star_1 and star_2 is given. Let me think. For each star, the excitation ratio is N_upper/N_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). So for star_1, the ratio is exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)), and for star_2, it's exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)).

The problem states that in star_1, the excitation is twice as much as in star_2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh, so maybe the ratio N1/N2 = 2? Or is it N1 = 2 N2? Wait, the way it's written is a bit ambiguous. The exact wording: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2."

So I think that means the number of atoms in the excited state in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So N1/N2 = 2.

Wait, but each star's N is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). So
