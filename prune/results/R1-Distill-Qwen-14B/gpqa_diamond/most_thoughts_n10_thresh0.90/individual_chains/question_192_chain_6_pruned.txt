Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, okay, let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is separated by a distance s from the main conductor's center. The cavity has radius r, and r is less than R, which makes sense because it's inside the conductor.

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the main conductor's center. But the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and both L and l are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are four different expressions for E. I remember from my studies that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. Let me think about Gauss's Law and how it applies here.

Wait, the conductor is uncharged, but there's a charge inside a cavity. Oh right, when a conductor encloses a charge, the conductor's inner surface must induce an opposite charge. But wait, in this case, the conductor is uncharged initially. So when a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced charge of -q. But then what happens to the outer surface? Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have +q to balance the inner -q. Or wait, no. Wait, the conductor was initially uncharged, so the total charge is zero. If the cavity has +q, the inner surface must have -q, so the outer surface must have +q to make the total zero. Because conductor's total charge is the sum of inner and outer surfaces. So inner is -q, outer is +q.

But how does that affect the electric field outside the conductor? I remember that for a conductor, the electric field outside depends only on the total charge enclosed, and behaves as if that charge were at the center. So the field outside would be as if a point charge equal to the total charge is at the center. But in this case, the total charge of the conductor is zero because it was initially uncharged and the charge q is inside the cavity. Wait, no, the conductor's charge is zero. So the charge +q is in
