Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about the luminosities of two stars. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, I remember that luminosity depends on both the radius and temperature of a star, right? The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Oh wait, maybe I can simplify this without the constants. So luminosity should be proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

The problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So if I call Star_2's radius R, Star_1's is 1.5R. Similarly, the mass is 1.5 times larger too. But wait, mass might not directly affect luminosity in this context unless we're considering something like the main sequence where more massive stars are hotter, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here since the problem says to assume they radiate as black bodies. Oh, but wait, the problem mentions that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest (their peak emission) are the same. I think that's related to their temperatures. Because, according to Wien's law, the peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature, λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant.

So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2. Because λ_max1 = λ_max2 implies T1 = T2. Wait, that's a big point. So both stars have the same temperature?

But wait, the problem also gives their radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, meaning perhaps it's not moving towards or away from us. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Wait, how does radial velocity affect the observed wavelength? Oh, right, Doppler shift. The star moving towards us would have its light blueshifted, and moving away would cause redshift. But wait, their peak wavelengths are the same in the problem statement. Hmm, that's confusing. Because if a star is moving towards us, its emitted light would be blueshifted, so the observed peak wavelength would be shorter than the emitted. But the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So does that mean their observed λ_max is the same, or their emitted λ_max?

Wait, the problem says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Hmm, that depends on whether the observed wavelength is the same, which would imply that their emitted wavelengths, adjusted for Doppler shift, are the same. So, maybe the observed λ_max is the same. Let me think.

Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so no Doppler shift. Its observed λ_max is the same as emitted. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Wait, but the direction matters. If Star_2 is moving away, the observed λ would be longer (redshift). If moving towards, shorter (blueshift). But the problem doesn't specify direction, just radial velocity of 700 km/s. Hmm, but regardless, the Doppler shift formula is (1 + v/c) for redshift, but I'm not sure about the
