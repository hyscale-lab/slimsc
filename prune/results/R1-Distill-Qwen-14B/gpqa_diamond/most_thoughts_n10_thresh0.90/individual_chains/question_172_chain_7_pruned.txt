Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, I remember that excitation has to do with the energy levels of atoms.

Wait, the problem mentions that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, in LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy states follows the Boltzmann distribution. Right, Boltzmann's equation relates the relative population of different energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_j)/(n_i) = (g_j/g_i) * exp( - (E_j - E_i)/(k T) ), where n_i and n_j are the populations of states i and j, g are the statistical weights, E the energies, k the Boltzmann constant, and T the temperature.

In this case, the energy difference between the two levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let's call this delta E. So delta E = E_j - E_i = 1.38e-23 J.

The problem states that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, no, more precisely, the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So I think that means the ratio of populations in the excited state to some reference state (maybe the ground state) is higher in star_1.

Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is higher in star_1. Let me clarify.

Letâ€™s denote the excited state as level j and the lower state as i. Then for star 1, n_j1 / n_i1 = 2 * (n_j2 / n_i2). Because it's twice as excited. Alternatively, maybe it's that the ratio of excited to some other state is twice. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as the ratio of excited to ground state in star_1 being twice that in star_2. So, (n_j1 / n_i1) = 2 * (n_j2 / n_i2). Or perhaps the other way around. Let me see. The problem says the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So if star_2 has a lower ratio, star_1 would have a higher ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is stating that the population in the excited state for star_1 is twice that of star_2. But wait, without knowing the total number of atoms, maybe it's the ratio of that particular energy level's population to the ground state.

Wait, perhaps it's better to assume that the ratio in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So (n_j1 / n_i1) = 2 * (n_j2 / n_i2). Let's go with that for now.

Using the Boltzmann equation for each star:

For star 1: (n_j1 / n_i1) = (g_j1/g_i1) * exp( - delta_E / (k T_1) )

Similarly, for star 2: (n_j2 / n_i2) = (g_j2/g_i2) * exp( - delta_E / (k T_2) )

Assuming that the statistical weights g_j/g_i are the same for both stars because we're considering the same transition in the same element (iron), so g_j1/g_i1 = g_j2/g_i2 = g. So the ratio would be the same for both. Then, the ratio of the two ratios is:

(n_j1/n_i1) / (n_j2/n_i2) = [ (g exp(-delta_E/(kT1)) ) / (g exp(-delta_E/(kT2)) )) ] = exp( (delta_E/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, let me compute that. Let me write it out:

(n_j1/n_i1) / (n_j2/n_i2) ) = exp( delta_E/(k) * (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Because the (n_j1/n_i1) is 2*(n_j2/n_i2), so:

2 = exp( delta_E/(k) (1/T2 -1/T1) )

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(2) = (delta_E / k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Let me rearrange this equation:

ln(2) = (delta_E / k) * ( (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) )

Hmm, that seems right. Let me double-check. Oh wait, 1/T2 - 1/T1 is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), yes.

So,

ln(2) = (delta_E / k) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2)

Wait, but I have T1 and T2 in terms of the equation. Let me think about the options. The options have equations with ln(2) equal to some expression involving T1 and T2.

Looking at the options:

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

But in our equation, the right-hand side is (delta_E /k ) multiplied by (T1-T2)/(T1 T2). So unless delta_E/(k) is 1, the equation wouldn't match.

Wait, what's the value of delta_E? The problem states delta_E is 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, let me compute delta_E/(k). The Boltzmann constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K.

So delta_E = 1.38e-23 J, so delta_E/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Ah, so delta_E/(k) = 1 K. So the equation simplifies.

So,

ln(2) = (1 K) * ( (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) )

Wait, but the units would be K * K^-1, because (T1 - T2) is in K, and T1 T2 is K^2. So (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) is (K) / (K^2) )= 1/K.

Wait, no, let me think. The delta_E is in J, which is kg m^2/s^2. k is J/K, so delta_E/k has units (J)/(J/K) )= K. So delta_E/k is 1 K, as I said.

So the equation is:

ln(2) = 1 * ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which can be rewritten as ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, because (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1 ).

Wait
