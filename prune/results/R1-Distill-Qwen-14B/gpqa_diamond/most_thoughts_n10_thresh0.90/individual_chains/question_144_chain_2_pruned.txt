Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance. The given data are production energy E_X =8 GeV, mass m_X=1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X=320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters.

Wait, mean decay distance... I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. The formula I think is τ = ħ/(Γ), where Γ is the total decay width. But wait, since this is a resonance, the width Γ is probably the total decay width. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact relation.

Also, the mean decay length is the product of the particle's velocity and its mean lifetime. So, L = v * τ. Oh right, because the particle moves during its lifetime, so the distance it travels before decaying is velocity multiplied by the lifetime.

So, the steps I think I need to take are:
1. Calculate the mean lifetime τ using the width Γ.
2. Find the particle's velocity v.
3. Multiply v by τ to get the decay length.

Wait, but how do I find the velocity? The particle is produced with a certain energy, so maybe I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The energy E is given as 8 GeV, which is the total energy. The mass is 1.2 GeV, so the rest mass energy is m*c². Then, the kinetic energy is E - m*c², but wait, no, in relativity, E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So, E is the total energy, so I can solve for momentum p.

Wait, the problem gives E as 8 GeV, which I think is the total energy. So let's compute p.

E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 )

So, p = sqrt( (E)^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c

Wait, but the units here are a bit confusing. Let me think in terms of natural units, where c=1. So in natural units, E and m have units of GeV, and energy squared is (mass * c^2)^2, but c is 1, so E^2 = p^2 + m^2.

Wait, so in natural units, E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV, so p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2) = sqrt(8^2 - 1.2^2) GeV. Let me calculate that.

8^2 is 64, 1.2^2 is 1.44. 64 - 1.44 = 62.56. sqrt(62.56) is around 7.91 GeV. So p ≈7.91 GeV.

Wait, but the units are a bit tricky. Since in natural units, c=1, so the momentum p is in GeV/c. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. When using E in GeV and m in GeV, but with c=1, so E in GeV is equal to (m c^2) in (GeV), etc. So, perhaps the momentum p is in GeV/c.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate beta (v/c) as p/E. Because in relativity, beta is v/c = p c / E. Oh wait, in natural units (c=1), beta = p/E.

Wait, in natural units, yes, because E² = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So when c=1, E² = p² + m². So p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2). Then, beta is p/E.

So beta = sqrt(E^2 - m^2) / E.

Wait, E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So let me compute:

E^2 = 64 GeV², m^2=1.44 GeV². So E^2 - m^2 =62.56 GeV². So sqrt(62.56) is approximately 7.91 GeV. So p is 7.91 GeV.

Then, beta = p/E = 7.91 /8 ≈0.98875. So v = beta c ≈0.98875 c.

Hmm, that's a high velocity.

Now, the mean lifetime τ is ħ / Γ. But Γ is given as 320 MeV. Wait, but units again. ħ has units of GeV·s, because E has units of GeV, time is in seconds.

Wait, ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So, τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, so Γ is 320 MeV. I need to convert that to GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So, τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) seconds.

Calculating that: 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So τ ≈20.56875e-25 s. Wait, wait, let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 6.582 / 0.32 = let's see, 0.32 into 6.582. 0.32 * 20 is 6.4. 6.582 -6.4 is 0.182. 0.182 /0.32 is approximately 0.56875. So, 20.56875.

So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 seconds. Wait, no, wait: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 20.56875e-25 s? No wait, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 /0.32 ) * 1e-25. So yes, 20.56875e-25 seconds.

Hmm, but
