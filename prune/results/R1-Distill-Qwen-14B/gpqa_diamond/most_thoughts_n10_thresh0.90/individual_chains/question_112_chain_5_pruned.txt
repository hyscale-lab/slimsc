Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, let's read it again carefully.

The state vector is |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh wait, so I should normalize it first. Because probabilities depend on the square of the coefficients, right?

Wait, the question says that |alpha> is proportional to that, so it's not normalized yet. So I need to find the normalization factor to make sure the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients is 1.

So the coefficients are (1+i) for |up> and (2-i) for |down>. Let's compute the squares of their magnitudes.

The magnitude squared of (1+i) is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because |a + ib|^2 = a² + b².

Similarly, (2 - i) has a magnitude squared of (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So the norm is sqrt(2 +5) = sqrt(7). So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Next part: the operator whose matrix elements are Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So what does this matrix look like?

In the basis of |up> and |down>, which are eigenstates of the z-component of spin, the operator has off-diagonal elements ħ/2 and zero on the diagonal. So the matrix is:

[ 0, ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2, 0 ]

Wait, because for a 2x2 matrix, A12 and A21 are ħ/2, and A11 and A22 are 0. So the matrix is:

[[0, ħ/2],
 [ħ/2, 0]]

This looks familiar. Oh, right! This is the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (ħ/2) σ_x.

So the operator A is proportional to the Pauli X operator. Oh, because σ_x has eigenstates that are superpositions of |up> and |down>, which are the standard basis here.

Wait, but the question is to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of this operator. Oh, right. Because in quantum mechanics, when you measure an operator, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are determined by the projection onto the corresponding eigenstates.

So the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of σ_x multiplied by the same normalization factor, since A is a scaled version of σ_x.

The eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So the eigenstates of A would be the same, because scaling the operator doesn't change its eigenvectors, only the eigenvalues.

So the operator A has eigenstates |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with corresponding eigenvalues.

Wait, but the eigenvalues of σ_x are +1 and -1. So for A = (ħ/2) σ_x, the eigenvalues would be (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1), so ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

But the question is to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate. Alternatively, it's to find the probabilities of the possible outcomes (eigenvalues) when measuring A.

Wait, wait, the problem says "the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator", which could be a bit ambiguous. But I think it refers to the probabilities of measuring each eigenvalue (the outcomes), not the states themselves. Because measuring the eigenstate doesn't make much sense; you measure the observable, which has eigenvalues.

So, to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A (which are the same as σ_x's eigenstates), and then square the coefficients to get the probabilities.

So, let's express |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x>.

But first, let's write |alpha> in terms of |up> and |down>. We have:

|alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Because it's normalized.

So,

|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>

We can write |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)

and |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

We can solve for |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |−x>. Let's see:

|up> = (|+x> + |−x>)/sqrt(2)
|down> = (|+x> - |−x>)/sqrt(2)

So, substituting into |alpha>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * (|+x> + |−x>)/sqrt(2) ) ] + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * (|+x> - |−x>)/sqrt(2) ) ]

Let me factor out 1/sqrt(7) and 1/sqrt(2):

= [ (1+i)/sqrt(14) (|+x> + |−x>) + (2 -i)/sqrt(14) (|+x> - |−x>) ) ]

Combine terms:

= [ (1+i) (|+x> + |−x>) + (2 - i) (|+x> - |−x>) ) ] / sqrt(14)

Let me expand this:

= [ (1+i)|+x> + (1+i)|−x> + (2 -i)|+x> - (2 -i)|−x> ] / sqrt(14)

Combine like terms:

For |+x>: (1+i + 2 -i ) |+x>
= (3) |+x>

For |−x> : (1+i - (2 - i) ) |−x>
= (1+i -2 +i) |−x> 
= (-1 + 2i ) |−x>

So,

|alpha> = [3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i) |−x> ] / sqrt(14)

Wait, but that can't be right. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, wait. Let me go step by step.

After substituting |up> and |down>:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) * (|+x> + |−x>)/sqrt(2) )

= (1+i)/(sqrt(7) *
