Okay, so I have this question about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. Hmm, wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and needs to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy upon absorbing a photon. The options are different momenta values. I need to find which one is correct.

First, I remember that in the quantum mechanical model, molecules can have rotational and vibrational energy levels. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which for rotation would be the J=0 state, and for vibration, the n=0 state.

Wait, but the question mentions the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, the non-rigid rotor is an improvement over the rigid rotor model by considering bond vibrations. So the moment of inertia isn't constant because the bond length can change with rotation.

But wait, the problem states that the molecule is in the fundamental state. So that's the lowest energy state for both rotation and vibration. If it absorbs a photon and switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy, that probably means it transitions to the next higher energy state, which would be the first excited state. But which transition is that? It could be either a change in rotational state or a vibrational state.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Oh, wait, the quantum rotation-vibration model—so it's considering both rotation and vibration together. So when the molecule is in the fundamental state, it's in the lowest J and n as well.

When it absorbs a photon, it can go to the next higher energy state. The next state would have the lowest possible energy, which might mean the next energy level, but which combination of J and n gives that.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (n=0) and ground rotational state (J=0). So when it absorbs a photon, which transition would give the next lowest energy. The next state could be either J=1 or n=1. Because for diatomic molecules, vibrational energy levels are higher in energy than rotational ones. So the energy gap for vibration is larger than that for rotation.

Wait, but the question says "next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state after the fundamental state would be the next possible state with the smallest energy increase. So that would likely be a rotational transition. Because the energy levels for rotation are closer together than vibration. So the photon would cause a transition from J=0 to J=1.

Wait, but wait. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next lowest energy state could be either J=1 or n=1. Which one has a lower energy? The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (n + 1/2) ħω, and the rotational are E_rot = (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

The energy difference for the first rotational transition (J=0 to J=1) is E_rot = [1(2) - 0(1)] * something. The energy difference ΔE_rot = (J=1 - J=0) = [ (2 - 0) * (ħ²)/(2I) ] = (2) * (ħ²)/(2I) ) = (ħ²)/(I).

Similarly, the vibrational transition from n=0 to n=1 is ΔE_vib = (1) * ħω. So which is smaller, the rotational ΔE or the vibrational ΔE?

Hmm, let's compute them.

I need to calculate both and see which is smaller.

Given the data:
Masses: Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. So the reduced mass μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20*2)/(22) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. But since 1 amu is about 1.66e-27 kg, so μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.66e-27 ≈ approx 3.01e-27 kg.

Bond length R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

But wait, the moment of inertia I for a diatomic molecule is I = μ R². So I = μ * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, let me compute I.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert μ to kg:

1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ about 3.01e-27 kg.

R = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg m².

Now, for the rotational energy difference ΔE_rot.

ΔE_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) [from J=0 to J=1: since E_rot for J=1 is (1*(1+1))/2 * ħ²/(I) = (2/2)(ħ²/(I)) = ħ²/(I). The difference from J=0 (which is zero) is ħ²/(I). So ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I).

Wait, no, wait. The energy levels for rotation are E_rot = (J(J+1) ħ²) / (2I). So for J=0, E0 = 0. J=1, E1 = (2 ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I). So the difference is ħ²/(I).

So ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I).

Now, let's compute that.

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ² is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

I is 1.204e-46 kg m².

So ΔE_rot = (1.112e-68 J² s²) / (1.204e-46 kg m²) )

Wait, the units: J is kg m²/s². So J² s² = (kg² m^4/s^4) ) * s² = kg² m^4/s².

So denominator is kg m².

So overall, (kg² m^4/s²) / (kg m²) ) = kg m²/s², which is J. So units are correct.

So compute numerically:

ΔE_rot ≈ (1.112e-68) / (1.204e-46) ) ≈ (1.112 / 1.204) * 1e-22 ≈ approx 0.923 * 1e-22 = 9.23e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy difference ΔE_vib = ħ ω.

Given ω =4e14 rad/s.

So ΔE_vib = 1.05457e-34 * 4e14 ≈ 4.218e-20 J.

Comparing ΔE_rot (9.23e-23 J) and ΔE_vib (4.22e-20 J). Oh, so the rotational transition requires much less energy. So the next state with the lowest possible energy is the J=1 state, so the photon must have energy corresponding to that.

Wait, but wait a second. The molecule is in the fundamental state, which is n=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest energy is J=1, n=0. Because that would require a lower energy increase than jumping to n=1. So the photon's energy should match the rotational energy jump.

But the question is about the momentum of the photon. Because energy of a photon is E_photon = h ν = (h c)/λ, but also E = p c, where p is momentum. So p = E / c.

Wait, because for a photon, E = pc (since m=0, so E² = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 → E=pc). So, p = E / c.

So, if the photon's energy is E_photon = ΔE_rot, then p = ΔE_rot / c.

Wait, but wait, actually, the energy required is the rotational energy difference. So let me compute that.

E_photon = ΔE_rot = 9.23e-23 J.

Then, p = E_photon / c. Since c is about 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.23e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = (9.23e-23) / 3e8 = approximately 3.076e-31 kg m/s. Hmm, but wait, none of the options are that small. The options are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range.

Wait, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in ΔE_rot.

Let me compute ΔE_rot again.

ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I).

I = μ R².

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 +2 ) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, 1 amu is 1.66e-27 kg, so μ = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg = approx 3.01e-27 kg.

R is 2e-10 m.

So I = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg m².

Then, ħ is 1.05457e-34 J s.

So ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 (J s)^2.

Wait, so ΔE_rot = (1.112e-68) / (1.204e-46) ) = (1.112 / 1.204) * 1e-22.

1.112/1.204 is approximately 0.923. So 0.923e-22 = 9.23e-23 J.

So that's correct.

Wait, but 9.23e-23 J for the photon energy. Then p = E/c = 9.23e-23 / 3e8 = approx 3.077e-31 kg m/s. But none of the options are that small. The options are on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28.

Hmm, so probably I'm missing something here. Oh wait, maybe the model is considering vibration and rotation together. Or perhaps it's the transition to the next state which is a combination of both.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the Fundamental vibration-rotation state. The fundamental state in the vibration-rotation spectrum is the lowest vibrational state and the lowest rotational state. The next state is either the next rotational level or the first vibrational level. So the photon would need to provide the energy difference for the lowest energy transition.

Wait, but the energy difference for the first vibrational state is larger than that for the rotational state.

So the molecule would preferentially transition via the rotation, so the photon's energy would be in the rotational region. But the options don't align with that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Another approach: the photon's energy must supply the energy needed for the transition. So the photon's energy E_photon = ΔE = E_final - E_initial.

The initial state is the fundamental state, which is n=0, J=0.

The next state with the lowest energy would be the one where either J increases by 1 or n increases by 1, whichever has the lower energy.

So if ΔE_rot < ΔE_vib, then the photon energy would be ΔE_rot.

But wait, earlier calculation shows that ΔE_rot is about 9.23e-23 J, while ΔE_vib is about 4.2e-20 J.

So the energy for the rotational transition is lower. Hence, the photon needed would have E = ΔE_rot, and thus p = E/c.

Wait, but I get p around 3e-31 kg m/s, but the options are 1e-27 to 1e-28. So that's a thousand times larger.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the moment of inertia. Let me double-check.

Wait, R is given as 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. Correct.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Correct.

So 1.818 amu * 1.66e-27 kg/amu = approx 3.01e-27 kg. Correct.

I = μ R² = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg m². Correct.

So perhaps the energy difference is for vibration, not rotation. Oh wait, but why would that be? Because the question says the molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model. Wait, non-rigid rotor means that the bond length is variable, so it's more about rotation coupled with vibration. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. To switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy, perhaps it's a transition to the next higher vibrational state because in vibration, the energy levels are higher, but perhaps that is the only transition allowed.

Wait, maybe the molecule is in the J=0, n=0 state, and the next state (lowest energy) is J=0, n=1? No, that can't be because n=1 is higher than J=1, n=0.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the energy levels. Let me think about the order of energies. Typically, the rotational energy levels are below the vibrational ones. So the energy levels go: J=0, n=0 (ground state), then J=1, n=0 (rotational excitation), then n=1, J=0 (vibrational excitation), etc.

So the next state with the lowest energy after J=0, n=0 is J=1, n=0. So the photon should have energy for that transition.

But earlier calculation gives p on the order of 1e-31, but options are higher. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the moment of the molecule, but wait, no, the question is about the photon's momentum.

Wait, perhaps the given data is in different units. Let me recheck.

Wait, what is the value of ΔE_rot? Let me re-calculate using exact values.

I'll compute ΔE_rot = ħ²/(2I) * (2), because from J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is ( (2) - 0 ) * (ħ²/(2I) ). So ΔE_rot = (2) * (ħ²/(2I)) ) = ħ²/(I).

I think that's correct.

Wait, let me compute I again. μ is (20*2)/(22) amu = (40/22) ≈ 1.818 amu.

So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.01e-27 kg.

R = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10)^2 = 3.01e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg m².

So ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 J² s².

So ΔE_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.204e-46 = (1.112/1.204) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.923e-22 = 9.23e-23 J.

Then, the energy of the photon is E_photon = 9.23e-23 J.

p_photon = E_photon / c = (9.23e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 9.23e-23 /3e8 = approximately 3.077e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are much larger. Let me check the options again:

Options:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, 1 Ns is 1 kg m/s.

So 3.077e-31 kg m/s is 3.077e-31 Ns. That's way smaller than any of the options. None of the options are that small.

Hmm, this suggests I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the vibrational energy. Let me compute the vibrational energy.

ΔE_vib = ħ ω.

Given ω =4e14 rad/s.

So ħ = 1.05457e-34 J s.

ΔE_vib = 1.05457e-34 * 4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

p_photon = E_photon/c = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg m/s = 1.406e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns, which matches this calculation.

Wait, so that suggests that the photon's energy should be the vibrational energy, not the rotational one. But why?

Wait, perhaps the non-rigid rotor model considers the vibrational energy as the primary transition when the molecule is in the fundamental state. Or perhaps the question is about a pure vibrational transition.

Wait, perhaps the initial state is the ground vibrational state (n=0) and ground rotational state (J=0). The next state with the lowest energy would be the first vibrational state (n=1), but that requires higher energy than the next rotational state. But earlier calculations suggest the rotational transition needs less energy.

But the options suggest the photon's momentum is 1.4e-28 Ns, which is for the vibrational transition.

So why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the fundamental state (n=0, J=0) to (n=1, J=0), which is a pure vibration transition, but that would require higher energy than a rotation transition.

But if the rotational transition is lower, why would the photon be for a higher energy transition?

Hmm, maybe the model here is that the molecule transitions from the ground vibrational state (n=0) to n=1, not considering rotation. Or perhaps the transition is from
