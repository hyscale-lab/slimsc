Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let's try to think this through.

First, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is in two dimensions, right? Because it has dx² and dy² terms. So maybe it's a 2D metric embedded in some higher-dimensional space? Or perhaps it's just a 2D space itself.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. I remember that in hyperbolic geometry, surfaces have a negative Gaussian curvature. The pseudosphere is a classic example.

But wait, the metric given here is a 2D metric. Oh, but maybe it's part of a higher-dimensional space. Alternatively, perhaps the metric is conformally flat because it's written as a scalar multiple of (dx² + dy²). The conformal factor here is 32/(4 - x² - y²). 

So, the area element in such a metric would be important. For a 2D metric, the area element is typically sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. Since the metric here is diagonal with both components being the same (g_{xx}=g_{yy}=32/(4 - x² - y²)), the determinant det(g) would be [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². So the square root of that is [32/(4 - x² - y²)].

Wait, but the area element is sqrt(-det(g)) for a Lorentzian metric, but here the metric looks like a Riemannian metric because both components are positive. So it must be a Riemannian metric. So area element would be [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, but wait, the radius in hyperbolic space is a bit tricky. Or perhaps in this context, it's the curvature radius. The Gaussian curvature of a pseudosphere is negative, right? So let me think about how the given metric relates to hyperbolic space.

The standard metric for hyperbolic space in the Poincaré disk model is usually written as ds² = (4/(1 + x² + y²)^2) (dx² + dy^2). Wait, but that's for radius 1. So if the radius is r, I think the metric would have a scaling factor. Let me recall: the Poincaré disk model for hyperbolic space of radius r is ds² = (r²/(r² - x² - y²)^2) (dx² + dy²). Or wait, maybe I got the denominator wrong. Let me check. Actually, more accurately, the Poincaré disk model with curvature k=-1/r² has the metric ds² = (r²/(r² - (x² + y²)))^2 (dx² + dy²). So for r=2, the curvature would be k= -1/(2²) = -1/4.

Wait, let me compute. If the metric is (r²/(r² -
