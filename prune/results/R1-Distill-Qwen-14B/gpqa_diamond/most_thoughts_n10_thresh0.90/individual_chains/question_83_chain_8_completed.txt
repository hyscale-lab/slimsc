Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration and pH calculations. Let me read the question carefully.

Alright, the problem says that we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D with different pairs of pH values.

Hmm. Acetic acid, CH3COOH, is a weak acid. When you titrate it with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. So the reaction will form the acetate ion, CH3COO^-.

First, I think I should figure out the initial concentration after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration becomes (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. Because concentration is moles per volume, and the volume doubles, the concentration halves. So, diluted to 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equals moles of acetic acid. So let's calculate that.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.05 M * 0.02 L (20 cm³ is 0.02 L) = 0.001 moles. Because 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001.

At equivalence point, moles of NaOH will be 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Wait, but the question asks about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. So let me think about each point separately.

First, the pH at 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence point volume is 2.5 cm³ (since equivalence is 10 cm³). So they add 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.

The reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is 1:1. So the moles of acetic acid that have reacted are 0.00025 moles. That's 25% of the initial 0.001 moles.

So, the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001. After adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, moles of CH3COOH left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

Moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed: 0.00025 moles.

Now, the total volume of the solution is the initial 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, so 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So concentrations:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Wait, but acetic acid is a weak acid, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. Let's see, log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) = 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So the pH at 25% titration is 4.733 + log( (0.005882)/(0.017647) )

Calculate the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is about -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256. Hmm, around 4.26. Looking at the options, let's see.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Let me compute the ratio again.

0.00025 / 0.0425 is 0.005882 M.

0.00075 / 0.0425 is 0.017647 M.

So the ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.33333, so log(1/3) is about -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256, which rounds to 4.26. So that's the first part.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form sodium acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is the salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so it will be basic.

The moles of sodium acetate are 0.001 moles. The total volume is initial 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ (equivalence point) = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

Concentration of acetate: 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Since acetate is a weak base, it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb can be calculated from Kw/Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration is 0.02 M. So we can set up the equation for Kb:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-], then:

5.405e-10 = (x^2) / (0.02 - x)

Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x^2 ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] is 3.288e-6 M. Then pOH = -log(3.288e-6).

Log(3.288) is about 0.517, so 0.517 -6 = -5.483 → pOH is 5.483.

Wait, wait, wait. No, because 3.288e-6 is 3.288 x 10^-6. So log(3.288e-6) is log(3.288) + log(1e-6) → 0.517 -6 = -5.483. So pH is 14 - 5.483 = 8.517, approximately 8.52.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Because when you have the acetate ion, which is the conjugate base of a weak acid, in solution, its concentration is 0.02 M. So when I calculated the Kb as 5.405e-10, which is correct, because Ka * Kb = Kw.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the approximation that [OH^-] is sqrt(Kb * C), where C is 0.02 M.

So [OH^-] = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M. So pOH ≈ 5.483, pH = 14 - 5.483 = 8.517, which is about 8.52.

But wait, the options don't have 8.52 as the equivalence point. Let me look at the options:

Option A: 4.26;8.52 → So this would match our calculations for the two points.

But let me think again. For the equivalence point, some sources say that for a weak acid titrated with a strong base, the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the conjugate base. So the calculation seems correct.

Wait, but I recall that for a weak acid's equivalence point, the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the conjugate base. So yes, that's what I did.

So the pH at 25% titration is ~4.26, and at equivalence it's ~8.52. So the correct option would be A.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 4.57;6.92. How come?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the 25% calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: maybe I should consider the dilution properly.

Wait, when I dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, the concentration becomes 0.025 M, as I did earlier.

At 25% titration, the volume of NaOH added is 25% of the equivalence volume. The equivalence volume is 10 cm³ (as calculated earlier), so 25% is 2.5 cm³.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Moles of CH3COOH initially: 0.001 mol. So after adding NaOH, moles of CH3COOH = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of CH3COO^- = 0.00025 mol.

Total volume now is 40 cm³ (initial) + 2.5 cm³ (NaOH) = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

So the ratio is 0.005882/0.017647 = 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is -0.477. pKa is 4.733, so pH = 4.733 -0.477 = 4.256, which is about 4.26.

So that's correct. So the first part is 4.26.

At equivalence point, as calculated, pH is about 8.52.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26;8.52, so that's the correct pair.

But wait, the problem is, in the options, option D is 4.57;6.92. What's wrong here?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point's pH.

Wait, let's recalculate the equivalence point.

Wait, when all the acetic acid has been neutralized, the solution is 0.001 moles of CH3COO^- in 50 cm³ (40+10=50). So concentration of CH3COO^- is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The Kb is Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb = 5.405e-10. For the reaction CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-, the expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

Assuming that x is the [OH^-], then:

Kb = x^2 / (0.02 - x) ≈ x^2 / 0.02, because x is very small.

So x^2 = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] = 3.288e-6 → pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.483 → pH = 14 -5.483 = 8.517 → around 8.52. So that's correct.

So the pair is 4.26 and 8.52, which is option A.

Wait, but looking again, I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the equivalence point for a weak acid could have a pH around 8.5 or so, which is what I got.

Hmm. But looking at the options, option A is 4.26;8.52, which matches my calculations.

So the answer should be option A.


To solve the problem, we first determine the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, resulting in a total volume of 40.00 cm³. The concentration becomes:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.05 \, \text{M} \times 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3}{40.00 \, \text{cm}^3} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we calculate the equivalence point. The moles of acetic acid initially are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid reacts with NaOH, requiring:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At 25% titration, 2.50 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

This reacts with an equal amount of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles},
\]
\[
\text{Moles of acetate ion formed} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume is now:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}\right),
\]

where:

\[
\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733.
\]

The ratio is:

\[
\frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} = \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \approx 0.3333,
\]
\[
\log(0.3333) \approx -0.477.
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 - 0.477 \approx 4.256 \, \text{(rounded to 4.26)}.
\]

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted, forming sodium acetate. The moles of sodium acetate are 0.001, and the total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let \([OH^-] = x\). Then:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x} \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot 0.02 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11},
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.483,
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - 5.483 \approx 8.517 \, \text{(rounded to 8.52)}.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
