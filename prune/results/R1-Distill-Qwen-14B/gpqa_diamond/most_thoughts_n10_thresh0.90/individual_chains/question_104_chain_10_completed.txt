Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The more massive the planet and the closer it is to the star, the bigger the shift, I think.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet similar in mass to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is about the ratio of their orbital periods—specifically, how many times longer Planet #2's period is than Planet #1's.

Wait, no, the orbital period is the time the planet takes to orbit the star. But how does the Doppler shift relate to the orbital period? I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think the RV method relates the velocity of the star (caused by the planet's tug) to the planet's orbital parameters.

The Doppler shift (or the velocity) is given by the formula something like v = (K) where K is the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve. K depends on the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, and the orbital period and semi-major axis.

Wait, the formula I remember is K = ( (G * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (P * (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) ) )^(1/ ( something ))... Wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, I think the formula is K = ( (27 * pi * G) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(0.5) P ) )^(1/3) ), but that might not be right. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the relationship between the velocity semi-amplitude (K) and the orbital period (P).

Wait, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet, the star, the orbital period, and the distance. But perhaps a better approach is to think about Kepler's third law. Since both stars are the same mass, and both planets have similar mass, maybe we can relate K to the orbital period.

Kepler's third law states that (a^3)/(P^2) = (G(M_star + M_p)) / (4 pi^2). But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (like Neptune is much less than Sun), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So (a^3)/(P^2) = (G M_star)/(4 pi^2).

But how does that tie into the RV method? The RV method gives us the star's velocity, which is K. The star's velocity is related to the planet's orbital parameters. The star and planet orbit their common center of mass. The star's velocity is K = (v) = (2 pi a_star) / P, where a_star is the star's orbit around the center of mass.

And a_star is related to a_planet (the planet's orbit) by the mass ratio. Since M_star >> M_p, a_star ≈ (M_p/(M_star)) * a_planet.

Wait, let me think again. The distance the star moves is a_star, and the planet's distance is a_planet. Since M_star * a_star = M_p * a_planet, because they balance each other in the center of mass. So a_star = (M_p / M_star) * a_planet. But since M_p << M_star, a_star is much smaller than a_planet.

But K is the star's velocity, which is (2 pi a_star) / P. So K = (2 pi a_star) / P.

Substituting a_star from above: a_star = (M_p / M_star) a_planet.

But from Kepler's third law for the planet's orbit: (a_planet^3) / (P^2) = (G (M_star + M_p)) / (4 pi^2). Again, since M_p is small, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So a_planet^3 = (G M_star P^2) / (4 pi^2).

So a_planet = [ (G M_star P^2) / (4 pi^2) ]^(1/3).

Then, a_star = (M_p / M_star) * [ (G M_star P^2) / (4 pi^2) ]^(1/3).

Now, substituting a_star into K:

K = (2 pi) / P * [ (M_p / M_star) * (G M_star P^2/(4 pi^2)) )^(1/3) ) ]

Let me compute this step by step. Let me write the equation again:

K = (2 pi) / P * (M_p / M_star) * [ ( G M_star P^2 / (4 pi^2) ) ]^(1/3 )

Let me compute the term inside the brackets: [ (G M_star P^2) / (4 pi^2) ) ]^(1/3 )

Let me factor this as [ G M_star P^2 ]^(1/3) / (4 pi^2)^(1/3 )

Putting it all together:

K = (2 pi / P) * (M_p / M_star) * [ G M_star P^2 ]^(1/3 ) / (4 pi^2)^(1/3 )

Simplify the terms. Let me look for ways to combine the terms.

First, note that 4 pi^2 = (2 pi) * 2 pi. So 4 pi^2 = (2 pi)^2. So (4 pi^2)^(1/3) = (2 pi)^(2/3).

So:

K = (2 pi / P ) * (M_p / M_star) * [ G M_star P^2 ]^(1/3 ) / (2 pi)^(2/3 )

We can factor 2 pi from the numerator in the first term and denominator in the last term.

(2 pi) / P * (M_p / M_star) * [ ... ] / (2 pi)^(2/3 )

So combine the 2 pi terms: (2 pi) / (2 pi)^(2/3) ) = (2 pi)^(1 - 2/3) ) = (2 pi)^(1/3).

So now the equation becomes:

K = (2 pi)^(1/3) * (M_p / M_star) * [ G M_star P^2 ]^(1/3 ) / P )

Wait, let's see. Wait, the denominator is P, so it's 1/P. Let me re-express:

[ G M_star P^2 ]^(1/3 ) is (G M_star)^(1/3) * P^(2/3).

So K becomes:

K = (2 pi)^(1/3) * (M_p / M_star) * (G M_star)^(1/3) * P^(2/3) ) * (1/P )

Simplify 1/P * P^(2/3) = P^(-1/3).

So K = (2 pi)^(1/3) * (M_p / M_star) * (G M_star)^(1/3) * P^(-1/3 )

Now, group the terms:

(2 pi)^(1/3) * (M_p) / M_star^(1) * (G M_star)^(1/3) * P^(-1/3 )

Combine the M_star terms: M_p * (M_star)^(1/3) / M_star = M_p * M_star^(-2/3 )

So K = (2 pi)^(1/3) * M_p * (G M_star)^(1/3) * M_star^(-2/3) * P^(-1/3 )

Wait, let me redo that:

After grouping, M_p / M_star * (M_star)^(1/3) ) = M_p * (M_star^(-1) * M_star^(1/3)) )= M_p * M_star^(-2/3).

So now K = (2 pi)^(1/3) * M_p * M_star^(-2/3) * (G)^(1/3) * P^(-1/3 )

Hmm, perhaps it's better to collect all the exponents now.

Let me write all the terms with exponents:

(2 pi)^(1/3) * M_p * (M_star)^(-2/3) * G^(1/3) * P^(-1/3 )

I can combine G^(1/3) and (2 pi)^(1/3):

G^(1/3) * (2 pi)^(1/3) = (2 pi G)^(1/3 )

So now K = (2 pi G)^(1/3 ) * M_p * M_star^(-2/3) * P^(-1/3 )

Let's write this as:

K = [ (2 pi G) / (M_star^2) ) ]^(1/3 ) * M_p / P^(1/3 )

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to express K in terms of P.

Alternatively, let me solve for P. Since we have K proportional to 1/P^(1/3), then P is proportional to (something involving K)^(-3).

Wait, but let's think about how K relates to P, given that the star mass is the same for both systems.

The problem states that both stars have the same mass as the Sun, so M_star is same for both. The planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), so M_p is same for both.

Wait, no, the problem says both planets have masses similar to Neptune, so we can assume M_p is the same for both planets.

Given that, let's denote the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)), because all other factors (M_p and M_star) are the same.

Wait, wait. Let me re-express K from the equation:

K = [ (2 pi G)^(1/3) ] * (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3))

So K = (constant) * (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Since M_p and M_star are the same for both planets, the factor (M_p / M_star^(2/3) ) is the same for both. Therefore, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3 )

Which implies that P^(1/3 ) ∝ 1 / K

So P ∝ (1/K )^3

Wait, no: because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so P^(1/3) is inversely proportional to K, so P is proportional to (1/K)^3.

Wait, more precisely, K = C / (P^(1/3)), where C is a constant. So P^(1/3) = C / K => P = (C / K )^3.

Thus, P is proportional to (1/K)^3.

So if K increases, P decreases.

In the problem, Planet #1 has K1 =5 milliangstrom, Planet #2 has K2=7 milliangstrom.

So the ratio of their periods P2/P1 is (K1/K2)^3.

Because P ∝ (1/K)^3, so P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, let's see:

P2 = (C / K2 )^3, P1 = (C / K1 )^3.

So P2/P1 = (C/K2)^3 / (C/K1)^3 )= (K1/K2)^3.

Yes, that's correct.

So putting in the numbers: K1=5, K2=7.

So ratio P2/P1 = (5/7)^3.

Wait no, wait: Wait, P is proportional to 1/K^3. So if K is larger, P is smaller.

So if K2 > K1, then P2 < P1.

Wait, but in the question, the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. How many times longer is P2 than P1.

So P2 = (C/K2)^3, P1 = (C/K1)^3.

P2/P1 = (C/K2)^3 / (C/K1)^3 )= (K1/K2)^3.

So if K2 is larger than K1, then (K1/K2) is less than 1, so (K1/K2)^3 is less than 1.

So P2 is shorter than P1.

Wait, but the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

That is, P2 / P1.

But according to the ratio, it's (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So planet #2's orbital period is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. Which means planet #2's period is shorter, not longer.

But the options given are:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

So 0.36 is option A.

But wait, let me make sure I'm getting the ratio right.

Wait, let me clarify:

If K is higher, the velocity semi-amplitude is higher, which would imply a shorter period.

So P2 is shorter than P1.

But the question says, how many times longer is P2 than P1.

If P2 is shorter, then P2/P1 is less than 1. So the only option less than 1 is A) 0.36 or D) 0.85.

Wait, so the ratio P2/P1 is (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.36 times P1, meaning it's shorter, so it's about 0.36 times as long.

So the answer should be option A) ~0.36.

But wait, the question says: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

So if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then planet #2's period is 0.36 times as long as planet #1's. So it's shorter. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So it's 0.36 times as long, so the correct answer is A) ~0.36.

Alternatively, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me double-check.

We said that P ∝ (1/K)^3.

So P2 = (1/K2)^3 * [some constant]

Similarly, P1 = (1/K1)^3 * [same constant]

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

So substituting K1=5, K2=7.

K1/K2 =5/7≈0.714.

Cubed: (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

Thus, P2 is about 0.364 times P1.

So planet #2's period is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, so it's shorter. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times as long as planet #1's period.

So the answer is option A) ~0.36.


To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). Using the radial velocity method, \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), meaning \( P \propto (1/K)^3 \). Since both stars and planets are similar in mass, the proportionality constant is the same for both planets.

Given:
- \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstrom} \) for planet #1,
- \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstrom} \) for planet #2,

the ratio of their orbital periods is:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

This means the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Therefore, planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's period, and the factor by which it is shorter is approximately 0.36.

From the options provided:
- **A) ~0.36**: Correct, as calculated above.
- **B) ~1.40**, **C) ~1.96**, **D) ~0.85**: Incorrect, as they do not match the calculated ratio.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
