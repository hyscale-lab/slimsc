Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me think through this.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it's just dx and dy involved. So we're dealing with a 2D space here, probably a surface embedded in higher dimensions since it's called a pseudosphere.

I remember that pseudospheres are surfaces of constant negative curvature. Oh wait, or is that hyperbolic space? Right, a pseudosphere might be a model of hyperbolic geometry. But wait, in two dimensions, hyperbolic space is often represented by the Poincaré disk model or the upper half-plane model. But this metric doesn't look exactly like either of those.

Let me write down the metric again. It's in the form ds² = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²). So the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which is similar to the Poincaré disk model, where the metric has a denominator of (1 - x² - y²)^2, but this is different. Wait, no, maybe it's scaled differently. Alternatively, maybe it's the Beltrami-Klein model, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the area of a pseudosphere. Oh wait, no, pseudospheres are surfaces, like in the Euclidean plane but with negative curvature. But wait, in two dimensions, the area of a hyperbolic disk is given by 2πr, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the area of a hyperbolic disk with radius r (in the Poincaré model) is 2π(r) where r is the hyperbolic radius. Or maybe it's 2π(r + 1), but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps in this metric, I need to compute the area of the entire space. Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, wait, the options include 4π(x² + y²), which doesn't make sense for an area because area should be a scalar, not depending on x and y. So options B and C are expressions that depend on coordinates, so probably they are not the correct answers. Options A and D are 0 and infinity. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the pseudosphere is a compact surface, so its area is finite. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the metric. So the denominator is 4 - x² - y². So when x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, so the metric becomes singular. That suggests that the region x² + y² < 4 is allowed. So the domain is a disk of radius 2, because when x² + y² =4, the denominator is zero. So the domain is x² + y² <4.

Wait, so the area of this 2D space can be found by integrating the area element over the entire space. The area element in this metric is sqrt(g) dx dy. Since it's 2D and the metric is diagonal, g = det(g_ij), where g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and g_yy is the same. So the determinant is (32/(4 - r²))²? Wait, no, because in 2D, determinant is (g_xx)(g_yy) - (g_xy)^2. But since g_xy is zero because the metric is only dx² + dy², so determinant is (32/(4 - r²))^2, but that's in polar coordinates? Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute in polar coordinates.

Let me switch to polar coordinates where x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ². So the metric becomes ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). So the area element is [32/(4 - r²)] dr dθ. Wait, but in 2D, the area element is sqrt(det(g)) dr dθ. Hmm, but the metric in polar coordinates would have g_rr = 32/(4 - r²), g_θθ = 32 r²/(4 - r²), and other components zero. So det(g) is (32/(4 - r²)) * (32 r²/(4 - r²)) ) = (32^2 r²)/(4 - r²)^2.

Wait, but the area element is sqrt(det(g)) dr dθ. So sqrt( (32^2 r²)/(4 - r²)^2 ) ) = (32 r)/(4 - r²). So the area element is (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ. So to find the total area, I need to integrate this over r from 0 to 2 (since r² <4) and θ from 0 to 2π.

So the area A is the integral from θ=0 to 2π of integral from r=0 to 2 of (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ.

Let me compute the inner integral first. Let u = 4 - r², then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr. So when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ (32 r)/(u) dr = ∫ (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr = ∫ (32 * (r dr))/(4 - r²).

Expressed in terms of u, r dr = - du/2. So,

∫ (32 * (-du/2) ) / u = -16 ∫ (1/u) du.

The limits: when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0. So substituting, the integral becomes:

-16 ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of (1/u) du = -16 [ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0.

But wait, ln(0) is negative infinity, so this is problematic. Wait, because when r approaches 2, u approaches 0, so the integral is from u=4 down to u=0, which would give us ln(4) - ln(0), but ln(0) is -infinity. So the integral becomes -16 ( ln(4) - (-infty) ), which is -16 (infty), which is -infty. But wait, that can't be right because our substitution had a negative sign.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the limits. Let me re-express it correctly.

The substitution: when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0. So the integral ∫(from r=0 to r=2) ... dr becomes ∫(u=4 to u=0) ... (-du/(2r))).

Wait, let me re-calculate.

Original integral: ∫ (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr from 0 to 2.

Let u =4 - r² → du= -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So the integral becomes ∫ (32 r dr)/(4 - r²) = ∫ (32 * (-du/2) )/u = ∫ (-16) (1/u) du.

Changing limits: when r=0 → u=4; r=2 → u=0. So integral from u=4 to u=0.

But since the integral is from higher to lower, I can reverse the limits and drop the negative sign.

So it becomes ∫ from u=0 to u=4 of 16*(1/u) du.

Which is 16 ∫ from 0 to4 (1/u) du = 16 [ ln(u) ] from 0 to4.

ln(4) is finite, but ln(0) is -infinity. So this becomes 16 ( ln(4) - (-infty) ) = 16 (infinite ) → the integral is divergent, approaching infinity.

So the inner integral (over r) is divergent. So when you multiply by the θ integral (which is 2π), the entire area becomes infinite. So the total area is infinite.

Wait, but wait, the pseudosphere of radius 2. Wait, I thought pseudospheres are compact, but perhaps in this metric, it's not compact because the area is infinite. Hmm, but I'm confused. Alternatively, maybe the metric represents a different kind of surface.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the metric is that of a hyperbolic plane. Because for hyperbolic plane, the area of a disk of radius r is 2π (cosh r - 1). Wait, but in that case, for r=2, the area would be 2π (cosh(2)-1). But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is conformally flat. The given metric can be written as ds² = f(r)² (dx² + dy²), where f(r) = sqrt(32/(4 - r²)).

The Gaussian curvature K for a 2D metric in the form ds² = f(r)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²) is given by:

K = - (1/(2 f²)) [ (f')² + f'' ]

Wait, alternatively, another formula I remember is the Gaussian curvature for a metric conformal to flat metric.

Wait, for a two-dimensional metric ds² = λ(r)² (dr² + r² dθ²), the Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = - [ (λ')/λ + (λ'')/λ ] / (2) 

Wait, I'm not sure. Another formula I found is K = - (1/(2 λ²)) [ (λ')² + λ λ'' ]

Wait, let me think. The Gaussian curvature K can be found from the formula:

K = - (1/(2 λ²)) [ (λ')² + λ λ'' ]

So if we compute that, perhaps we can find the curvature and then find the area.

Let me compute λ(r) = sqrt(32/(4 - r²)) = sqrt(32) / sqrt(4 - r²).

So λ = (4√2) / sqrt(4 - r²).

Compute λ' : derivative of λ with respect to r.

λ = 4√2 (4 - r²)^(-1/2).

λ' = 4√2 * (-1/2) (4 - r²)^(-3/2) * (-2r) 

Simplify:

λ' = 4√2 * (r) / (4 - r²)^(3/2)

= (4√2 r) / (4 - r²)^(3/2)

Now, λ' squared: (λ')^2 = (32 r²) / (4 - r²)^3.

Next, compute λ''. Let's find dλ'/dr.

λ' = (4√2 r) (4 - r²)^(-3/2)

So λ'' = 4√2 [ (4 - r²)^(-3/2) + r * (-3/2) * (4 - r²)^(-5/2) * (-2r) ) ]

Wait, perhaps better to use product rule.

Let me denote A = 4√2 r, B = (4 - r²)^(-3/2).

Then λ' = A * B.

λ'' = dA/dr * B + A * dB/dr.

dA/dr = 4√2.

dB/dr = (-3/2) * (4 - r²)^(-5/2) * (-2r) ) = (3 r) (4 - r²)^(-5/2).

So λ'' = 4√2 * B + A * (3 r B^2 )

Wait, let me compute each term.

Term1: dA/dr * B = 4√2 * (4 - r²)^(-3/2) = 4√2 / (4 - r²)^(3/2).

Term2: A * dB/dr = (4√2 r) * (3 r) / (4 - r²)^(5/2) ) = (12√2 r²) / (4 - r²)^(5/2).

So λ'' = (4√2)/(4 - r²)^(3/2) + (12√2 r²)/(4 - r²)^(5/2).

Factor out 4√2/(4 - r²)^(5/2):

= [4√2 (4 - r²) + 12√2 r² ] / (4 - r²)^(5/2)

= [4√2 (4 - r² + 3 r²) ] / (4 - r²)^(5/2)

= [4√2 (4 + 2 r²) ] / (4 - r²)^(5/2)

= 8√2 (2 + r²) / (4 - r²)^(5/2)

Now, compute (λ')² + λ λ''.

Wait, according to the formula, it's (λ')² + λ λ''.

Wait, no, the formula I thought was K = - (1/(2 λ²)) [ (λ')² + λ λ'' ].

Wait, let's compute each term.

(λ')² = 32 r² / (4 - r²)^3.

λ λ'' = λ (λ'') = [4√2 / sqrt(4 - r²)] * [8√2 (2 + r²) / (4 - r²)^(5/2) ) ]

Multiply them out:

= 4√2 * 8√2 * (2 +r²) / (4 - r²)^(3) 

Because sqrt(4 - r²) is (4 - r²)^(1/2), so denominator becomes (4 - r²)^(1/2) * (4 - r²)^(5/2) ) = (4 - r²)^3.

Numerator: 4√2 * 8√2 = 4*8 * (√2)^2 = 32 * 2 =64.

So λ λ'' = 64 (2 + r²) / (4 - r²)^3.

Now, (λ')² + λ λ'' = [32 r² + 64 (2 + r²) ] / (4 - r²)^3.

Compute numerator: 32 r² + 64 (2 + r²) = 32 r² + 128 + 64 r² = 96 r² +128.

Factor: 32 (3 r² +4).

Wait, 96 is 32*3, 128 is 32*4. So,

(λ')² + λ λ'' = 32 (3 r² +4) / (4 - r²)^3.

Now, K = - (1/(2 λ²)) [ (λ')² + λ λ'' ].

λ² is [32/(4 - r²)], so 1/(2 λ²) = (4 - r²)/(64).

So,

K = - [ (32 (3 r² +4) ) / (4 - r²)^3 ) ] * [ (4 - r²) / (64) ) ].

Simplify:

= - [ (32 (3 r² +4) ) * (4 - r²) ) ] / ( (4 - r²)^3 * 64 )

Wait, 32/64 is 1/2. So,

= - [ (3 r² +4) ) ]/( 2 (4 - r²)^2 )

Hmm, that's the Gaussian curvature K(r) for each r.

Wait, but for a pseudosphere, the Gaussian curvature should be constant. But here K depends on r, which suggests that the curvature is varying, so this is not a pseudosphere but perhaps a hyperbolic space with varying curvature. Wait, no, hyperbolic space has constant negative curvature. So this can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating K.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used a different formula. Alternatively, perhaps the metric given is for a sphere, but that's not making sense. Wait, the denominator is 4 - x² - y², which is similar to the sphere metric where denominator is (R² - x² - y²), but in this case, it's 4, so radius 2.

Wait, if the metric were ds² = (R²/(R² - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ² ), then that would be the metric for a sphere with radius R. Because for a sphere, the area is 4π R², and the metric in 2D would have the denominator (R² - r²), but in 3D it's (R² - r²) and another coordinate.

Wait, but this is a 2D metric, which could represent a sphere of radius 2. So in that case, the area would be 4π (2)^2 =16 π. But that's not one of the options either.

Wait, but the options are:

A) 0

B) 4π(x² + y²)

C) 4π(x² - y²)

D) +infty.

Wait, so B and C can't be, because area is a scalar. A is zero, which is unlikely. D is infinity.

Wait, but earlier when I integrated the area element, the integral diverged, suggesting the area is infinite. So the area is infinite, which would be option D.

But wait, the metric is defined for r² <4, so up to r=2. So the region is a disk of radius 2. But why is the area infinite? That seems odd because a disk in Euclidean space has finite area.

Wait, perhaps the metric is that of a hyperbolic plane, where the area of a disk grows exponentially. But wait, earlier when I did the integration, the inner integral gave an infinite result, leading to a total area of infinity. So option D, which is +infty, would be the answer.

But the question refers to a pseudosphere of radius 2. Wait, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, which in 2D is hyperbolic space. So the area of a hyperbolic disk of radius r is 2π (r + 1), but that's in the Poincaré model. Alternatively, the area depends on the curvature.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the area of the space. The metric is given as ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So the area element is 32/(4 - r²) dr dθ, as before.

The area is ∫ (from r=0 to 2) ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) [32/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

But wait, when I tried to compute this earlier, I got an infinite result because the denominator approaches zero as r approaches 2. So the integral of 1/(4 - r²) from 0 to 2 is problematic.

Wait, 1/(4 - r²) can be written as [1/(4 - r²)] = [1/( (2 - r)(2 + r) ) ].

Which can be decomposed into partial fractions.

But regardless, when integrating from 0 to 2, the integral becomes ∫ 32/(4 - r²) dr from 0 to 2.

Which is 32 ∫ [1/(4 - r²)] dr.

The integral of 1/(4 - r²) dr is (1/4) ln | (2 + r)/(2 - r) | ) + C.

So evaluating from 0 to 2:

At r=2, denominator is zero, so (2 +2)/(2-2) = 4/0 → infinity. So the integral diverges to infinity. Therefore, the area is infinite.

So the correct answer is D) +infty.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This is a 2D metric, and the task is to determine the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\). To compute the area, we first express the metric in polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\), where \(x = r \cos\theta\) and \(y = r \sin\theta\). The metric becomes:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right).
\]

The area element in this metric is given by \(\sqrt{\det(g)} \, dr \, d\theta\), where \(\det(g)\) is the determinant of the metric tensor. For this metric, the determinant is:

\[
\det(g) = \left(\frac{32}{4 - r^2}\right)^2.
\]

Thus, the area element is:

\[
\sqrt{\det(g)} \, dr \, d\theta = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

To find the total area, we integrate the area element over the entire domain of the metric. The domain is restricted to \(r^2 < 4\), or \(r \in [0, 2)\), as the metric becomes singular at \(r = 2\). The total area \(A\) is:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

First, compute the radial integral:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_4^0 \frac{-16}{u} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

This integral diverges because \(\int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln|u|\), and \(\ln(0)\) is \(-\infty\). Therefore, the radial integral diverges to infinity. Consequently, the total area is infinite.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A (\(0\))**: Incorrect, as the area is clearly not zero.
- **Option B (\(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\))**: Incorrect, as the area must be a scalar, not dependent on coordinates.
- **Option C (\(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\))**: Incorrect, same reason as above.
- **Option D (\(+\infty\))**: Correct, as the integral diverges, indicating an infinite area.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is infinite.

**Answer: D**
