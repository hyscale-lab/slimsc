Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and we need to determine the coupling pattern of a specific hydrogen in the final product's NMR spectrum. Hmm, sounds a bit complicated, but let's break it down.

First, the initial compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, quite rigid. The molecule has two bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions. So when it's heated with excess KOH, what reaction occurs? Oh right, that's probably an elimination reaction. Since it's KOH, likely an E2 mechanism. The base would abstract a β-hydrogen, and the bromide would leave, forming a double bond. Wait, but since there are two bromines, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane... when two adjacent carbons have bromines, elimination can form a double bond between them. So heating with KOH would produce 1,3-adamantadiene? Or maybe an allene, since the diene is conjugated? Alternatively, wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide? No, wait, no, KOH typically doesn't form epoxides without some specific conditions. Oh, wait, wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let's think again.

Wait, when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane, if the bromines are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond. But wait, in adamantane, the positions 1 and 3 are not adjacent. Wait, wait, no, no. Let me visualize the adamantane structure. Adamantane has a structure similar to four cyclohexane rings fused together. The positions 1 and 3 are on adjacent carbons, I think. No, wait, adamantane is a diamond-like structure. The positions are arranged so that 1 and 3 are on adjacent bridges. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two bridgeheads that are adjacent? Or perhaps not? Hmm, maybe the structure is such that eliminating both bromines would form a bridge.

Wait, maybe the elimination here leads to the formation of a cyclopropane ring? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, wait, another thought: when two bromines are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond. So if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which is a dihalide on adjacent carbons, the product would be 1,2-didehydroadamantane, forming a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, perhaps? Or maybe between 1 and 3? Hmm, maybe I should think about the product's structure.

The product after KOH is a light yellow solid, and the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a high chemical shift, which suggests perhaps an ether or an epoxide. Wait, but the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester). Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide, because epoxide rings can absorb around 1200-1300 cm-1 for the C-O stretch, but 1720 is more likely a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, it undergoes a double elimination. If the two Br are on adjacent carbons, then elimination would form a double bond. But if the starting compound is 1,3-dibromo, perhaps elimination would form a ring. Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide. Because if two Br are on adjacent carbons, and KOH abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of an epoxide. Wait, but how?

Oh, wait a second. I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Another possibility is that the reaction forms a ketone. How? Oh, wait, maybe each Br is on a bridgehead carbon. When heated with KOH, each Br leaves, but since both are on bridgeheads, maybe it's a double elimination, forming a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps each Br is eliminated as Br⁻, and the two adjacent carbons form carbonyl groups. Wait, but no, that would form a diketone. Alternatively, the elimination could form an allene, but that doesn't fit the IR data. Let me think about the NMR data.

The product 1 has NMR signals: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is likely an -OCH2O- group, like in an epoxide. Because epoxide protons typically show up around δ 3-4, but more deshielded if adjacent to an electronegative atom. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether, like an -OCH2CH2O- structure. But wait, 2H at 4.79. If it's an epoxide, each CH2 would have two protons, but in an epoxide, each CH2 is adjacent to two oxygen atoms, so the protons would typically be around δ 3.5-4.5. So 4.79 is a bit high, but possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. The 1720 cm-1 in IR definitely points to a carbonyl. So maybe the product is a diketone. But then, the NMR would show signals for the ketone carbonyl, but that's usually a singlet in IR and doesn't directly affect the H NMR except for deshielding nearby protons.

Wait, let's think about the reaction. 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with excess KOH. KOH is a strong base, and in such cases, elimination reactions are common. If each Br is on a bridgehead, perhaps each elimination forms a carbonyl group. Because bridgehead elimination can be possible. Wait, bridgehead elimination typically refers to the loss of a bridgehead substituent, like in norbornene systems. Wait, in some cases, bridgehead bromides can undergo elimination to form a double bond or perhaps a carbonyl.

Alternatively, considering the product, perhaps the reaction forms an epoxide. But how? Wait, maybe the KOH doesn't eliminate but does some kind of substitution. Wait, no, with excess KOH, elimination is more likely.

Wait, another approach: The IR absorption at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl. So the product after KOH is a ketone. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon elimination would lose two HBr molecules and form a ketone. How?

If each Br is on a bridgehead, perhaps the elimination forms a carbonyl group. For example, each Br is replaced by a carbonyl oxygen. Wait, but that would require two carbonyl groups, but that might not fit the structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a single carbonyl group formed by elimination between the two adjacent Br atoms.

Wait, perhaps the product is adamantanone. Adamantane has four rings; if a carbonyl is formed, perhaps it's at a bridgehead, making it a ketone. But then, how would that happen from 1,3-dibromoadamantane?

Wait, another possibility: the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, and their elimination forms a double bond, but that would require each Br to be on a bridgehead, making the double bond across a bridge. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the IR carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm is two protons. What structural features have two protons around there? Maybe an -OCH2O- group, as in an epoxide. So, product 1 is an epoxide, perhaps 1,3-adamantanediyl oxide. That would form when two adjacent OH groups are formed and then lose water, but wait, no, epoxide formation would come from a diol, which is then cyclized. Alternatively, the reaction could be an acid-catalyzed cyclization, but KOH is a base.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. Maybe the KOH is causing a substitution. But with two bromines, that would require a double substitution, but in what way would that form an epoxide? Alternatively, perhaps it's a Williamson ether synthesis, but how?

Wait, another thought: when vicinal dihalides react with a base, they can form alkenes (elimination) or possibly epoxides if the base is something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane. Wait, but that doesn't explain the IR data.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diradical, but I don't think that's relevant here.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone. Let's think about the possible structure. If both Br are eliminated, perhaps each Br is replaced by a hydroxyl group, but that would form a diol, which under basic conditions could lose water to form an epoxide. Oh, wait, maybe that's the case.

So, step by step: 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH. Each Br is replaced by an OH group via substitution, forming a diol. Then, under basic conditions, the diol could undergo cyclization to form an epoxide. Because when vicinal diols (1,2-diols) are treated with a base, they can form epoxides.

Wait, but 1,3-diol would be a diol with two OH groups on the same bridgehead or on adjacent carbons. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is elimination, forming a double bond, but then that leads us back to the problem of the IR absorption.

Wait, the IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is typical for a ketone or maybe an ester. But in the product, there's no ester mentioned, so it's more likely a ketone.

So, perhaps the product is a ketone. But how does 1,3-dibromoadamantane form a ketone upon treatment with KOH?

Wait, perhaps the bromides are eliminated to form a carbonyl. So each Br leaves, and the adjacent carbons each lose a hydrogen, forming a double bond. Wait, but then that would form an alkene, not a carbonyl.

Wait, wait, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and when they are eliminated, each bridgehead becomes a carbonyl group. Hmm, but that would require each bridgehead to have an adjacent carbon, which they don't. Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a single carbonyl group.

Alternatively, another approach: let me think about the structure of adamantane. It's a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. Each bridgehead has two adjacent carbons. So, if the Br is on a bridgehead, perhaps elimination would form a double bond in the bridge. Alternatively, perhaps the bridge becomes a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is 1,3-adamantanedione. But that would require two ketone groups, which would have two carbonyl peaks in IR, but the question only mentions a single peak at 1720 cm-1.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the next step and see if that gives me any clues.

The product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is typically used as a Lewis acid catalyst, especially in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But since product 1 is a ketone or an epoxide, what reaction would occur?

If product 1 is a ketone, heating with Al isopropoxide might induce some kind of alkylation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if product 1 is an epoxide, heating with a Lewis acid could cause ring-opening. For example, epoxides can open under acidic conditions, but Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, which can protonate the epoxide oxygen, making it more electrophilic.

Wait, but product 1's NMR suggests maybe an epoxide. Let me think: the 4.79 ppm is for two protons, which would make sense if it's an epoxide where each CH2 is adjacent to two oxygens. Then, product 2 would be the epoxide after ring-opening. But how?

Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, heating with Al isopropoxide might facilitate some kind of acylation. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: when epoxides are treated with Lewis acids like Al isopropoxide, they can undergo ring-opening via acid catalysis. The epoxide oxygen gets protonated, making the ring more strained, leading to nucleophilic attack. But without a nucleophile present, perhaps a neighboring group participates. Alternatively, in the case of adamantane-derived epoxides, maybe the ring-opening leads to some kind of carbocation rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide ring opens to form a diol. But then, product 2 would be a diol. But I'm not sure how that would help in the next step.

Wait, the next step is ozonolysis. Ozonolysis is typically used to cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into fragments. But if product 2 is a diol, maybe ozonolysis isn't applicable.

Wait, so let me try to summarize what I know so far:

1. Reactant: 1,3-dibromoadamantane.

2. Reaction with KOH (excess) at 240°C produces product 1, which is a light yellow solid. Its NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), and IR shows 1720 cm-1.

3. Product 1 is then heated with excess Al isopropoxide to form product 2.

4. Product 2 undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide addition to form product 3.

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum.

So, to figure this out, I need to work backwards.

Ozonolysis of product 2 would cleave any double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, product 2 must have a double bond.

Wait, that would mean that step 2 (heating product 1 with Al isopropoxide) forms a compound with a double bond.

So, product 1 must have a functional group that, upon heating with a Lewis acid, forms a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide that, upon acid treatment, undergoes ring-opening to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, another angle: if product 1 is a ketone, heating it with Al isopropoxide might not do much unless it's part of a Friedel-Crafts reaction, but ketones aren't typically involved in those. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and heating with Al isopropoxide leads to ring-opening and formation of a carbonyl group or a diol.

Wait, but product 2 then undergoes ozonolysis, which requires a double bond. So, product 2 must have a double bond.

Putting this together:

If product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 must have a double bond. How?

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane, which upon ring-opening forms a diene. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an alkene formed via elimination from product 1. So, product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 is an alkene.

Wait, how? Maybe product 1 is an epoxide, which upon acid treatment (Al isopropoxide) undergoes some kind of ring-opening followed by elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, that's possible. Epoxide ring-opening under acidic conditions typically forms a carbocation, which can undergo hydride shifts or other rearrangements, followed by water attack or other nucleophilic attack. But in some cases, especially with strained epoxides, the ring-opening could lead to the formation of a more stable carbocation, which might then lose a proton to form a double bond.

So, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, product 2 is an alkene (from dehydration), and product 3 comes from ozonolysis of that alkene.

Let me try to outline the possible structures:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (epoxide) → product 2 (alkene) → product 3 (from ozonolysis).

So, product 3 would be carbonyl compounds from the ozonolysis of product 2's double bond.

Wait, if product 2 is an alkene, ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyl groups. The position of the double bond in product 2 will determine the structure of product 3, which in turn affects the NMR.

But the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. The most deshielded would likely be near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. So, perhaps the hydrogen is adjacent to a carbonyl, making it deshielded and possibly split into a certain coupling pattern.

Let me think about the possible structure after ozonolysis. Suppose product 2 has a double bond between carbons A and B. Ozonolysis would break this into two carbonyl groups, each attached to the respective carbons. The resulting product 3 would have two carbonyl groups.

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try to think of each step in more detail.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1.

IR of product 1: 1720 cm-1 → carbonyl group.

So, product 1 has a carbonyl.

NMR of product 1: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 2H at 4.79 is likely adjacent to an electronegative group, like oxygen. So, perhaps an epoxide or an ether.

Wait, but product 1 has a carbonyl group, so perhaps the structure is a ketone with an adjacent epoxide or another functional group. Hmm, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diketone, but that would require two carbonyl groups, which would likely show two IR peaks. But the question mentions a characteristic absorbance, so maybe it's a single carbonyl.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH gives a single carbonyl via elimination.

Wait, considering the structure of adamantane, if each Br is on a bridgehead, elimination would form a carbonyl group. So, perhaps each Br is replaced by a carbonyl oxygen, but that would require each Br to be on a bridgehead, and elimination would form a diketone. But the IR shows a single peak, so perhaps only one carbonyl is formed.

Wait, maybe the molecule undergoes a double elimination, where two HBr molecules are lost, and a single carbonyl group is formed between the two bridgeheads. So, perhaps the product is 1,3-adamantanedione, but that would have two ketone groups, which would show two carbonyl peaks in IR. Hmm, perhaps the IR is referring to a conjugated carbonyl, so maybe only one peak.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane ketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction forms an epoxide, and the IR's 1720 cm-1 is for something else. Wait, maybe the product is a ketone and an epoxide. But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't a ketone. Maybe the IR peak is from something else, like an ester or an aldehyde. But without more data, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the product is cyclohexanone. No, that's not likely because the starting material is adamantane-based.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a bicyclic ketone.

Well, perhaps I should move on and consider the next steps, and see if that helps.

Step 2: product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide. Suppose product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 could be an enol ether or something else. But more likely, perhaps the ketone undergoes some kind of elimination to form a double bond. Wait, but product 2 is then subjected to ozonolysis, which requires a double bond.

So, perhaps product 2 has a double bond, which is formed via elimination from product 1.

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an alkene formed via elimination. How? Maybe the ketone is further treated to form an enol, which then eliminates water to form a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 is a double bond formed via ring-opening and elimination.

Let me outline:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (epoxide) via substitution.

2. Product 1 (epoxide) → product 2 (alkene) via acid-catalyzed ring-opening and elimination.

3. Product 2 (alkene) → product 3 (carbonyl compounds) via ozonolysis.

So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

Now, the NMR of product 3 would show signals from the carbonyl-adjacent hydrogens. The most deshielded would be near the carbonyl. The coupling pattern depends on neighboring protons.

Wait, ozonolysis of a symmetrical double bond would give identical carbonyl compounds, but if the double bond is unsymmetrical, the products would be different.

Assuming product 2 has a double bond that, when ozonolyzed, breaks into two carbonyl groups. The resulting product 3 would have carbonyl groups attached to chains with adjacent hydrogens.

Suppose the double bond in product 2 is between two CH2 groups. Ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl compounds, each with a CH2 group attached. So, each would have a CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, but the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. So, in product 3, the hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded and split by neighboring Hs.

If each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group that's connected to another CH2, the Hs on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be split by the Hs on the adjacent CH2.

Wait, example: suppose product 2 is CH2=CH2. Ozonolysis would give two formaldehyde molecules, but that's a trivial case. But in a more complex structure, like CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- with a double bond in the middle, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl compounds.

Wait, but in the case of adamantane derivatives, the structure is rigid, so the double bond would be in a specific position.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a diene, but ozonolysis would break each double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 has a single double bond, leading to product 3 having two carbonyl groups.

Suppose product 2 is an alkene where each end is connected to a CH2 group. Ozonolysis would produce two aldehyde groups. Each aldehyde's adjacent CH2 group would have hydrogens that are deshielded.

Wait, but in the case of an aldehyde, the adjacent CH2 would be -CH2-CHO. The Hs on the CH2 would be split by the Hs on the adjacent CH2. Alternatively, if the structure is symmetrical, the Hs would couple with each other.

Wait, perhaps each aldehyde is part of a larger structure, like -CH2-CHO. The Hs on the CH2 would each be next to another CH2 group, leading to coupling.

Wait, but in the case of product 3, let's say the structure is something like HCO-R, where R is a group with Hs. The H on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would have coupling with adjacent Hs.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the coupling patterns.

The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

A triplet occurs when a proton has two neighboring protons (n+1 rule, where n=2 gives triplet).

A triplet of triplets would be when a proton is split by two different sets of neighboring protons, each causing triplet splitting. So, like if a proton is next to two different groups of protons, each with two neighbors, the splitting would be more complex.

A doublet of triplets is when a proton is split by two different neighboring groups, one causing a doublet and the other a triplet. Wait, no, more accurately, if a proton is split by two different neighboring groups, each causing a different splitting pattern, the overall pattern could be a combination. For example, if split by a J1 and J2, each with different coupling constants, the splitting could be a doublet of triplets.

A pentet is when a proton has four neighboring equivalent protons, leading to a quintet (n=4 → 5 peaks).

But in the case of product 3, after ozonolysis, the structure would be such that the most deshielded H is adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's say the structure is something like R-CO-CH2-CH2-X, where the Hs on the CH2 next to CO would be deshielded.

If the CO is at the end, say R-CO-CH2-CH2-Y, then the Hs on the CH2 next to CO (the first CH2) would be adjacent to the second CH2's Hs.

So, for each H on the first CH2, they would be split by the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. Each of these Hs would have a coupling with the two Hs on the adjacent group. Wait, but each H on the first CH2 is adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 and perhaps another group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 has two Hs, and each H on the first CH2 is adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 and two Hs on the next CH2. So each H would have coupling with four Hs in total.

Wait, but if the Hs are on adjacent CH2 groups, each H on the first CH2 would be next to the two Hs on the same CH2 (geminal coupling, but usually not observed because they are equivalent and split into a singlet). Wait, but geminal coupling is usually not observed because the two Hs are equivalent and split each other into a singlet. So, the coupling would be with the Hs on the adjacent CH2 group.

So, each H on the first CH2 is adjacent to two Hs on the next CH2. So, each H would couple with two Hs, leading to a triplet (n=2 → triplet).

But if each H is also adjacent to another set of Hs, such as from another CH2 group, then the coupling could be more complex.

Wait, another possibility: the Hs are in a -CH2-CH2- group, each H on the first CH2 coupling with the two Hs on the second CH2. So, each H would be a triplet. But if the Hs on the first CH2 are also coupling with another set, like from a branch, it could lead to a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a -CH2-CHO group. The Hs on the CH2 would be adjacent to the CHO and to the next CH2. The Hs on the CH2 next to CHO would each have coupling with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So, each H would be a triplet.

But wait, if the structure is something like (CH2)2CO, then each H on the first CH2 is next to the two Hs on the second CH2. So, each H is a triplet. But if there's another coupling, perhaps with a neighboring group, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs are in a -CH2-CH2-CH2- group, but with the middle CH2 next to a carbonyl. Then, the Hs on the middle CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on each side. So, each H would be split by four Hs (two on each adjacent CH2), leading to a quintet (n=4). But that's not one of the options here. Wait, the options don't include a quintet except option D, which is a pentet. Wait, option D is pentet, which is a five-line splitting, which would correspond to n=4 (four neighboring Hs).

Alternatively, maybe the Hs are adjacent to two different types of Hs. For example, if a H is adjacent to two Hs on one side and another two on the other side, but with different coupling constants, that could lead to a doublet of triplets or a triplet of triplets.

Wait, another angle: the most deshielded H is adjacent to a carbonyl group and perhaps part of a cyclopropane ring. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis leads to a diketone, with each ketone group having adjacent CH2 groups. The Hs on the CH2 next to the ketone would each be split by the two Hs on the same CH2 (which are equivalent, so they don't split) and the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So, each H would be a triplet.

But if the Hs are also adjacent to another set, like a branching point, it could lead to more splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs are part of a -CH2-CO- group and also adjacent to another CH2 group that has two Hs. So, each H on the first CH2 would be split by two Hs from the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

But in that case, the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

Looking back at the options, option A is triplet. But the options also include others. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the structure is such that each H is adjacent to two Hs on one side and three on the other. Wait, but that's getting complicated.

Another possibility: the Hs are adjacent to two sets of neighboring Hs with different coupling constants. For example, each H is adjacent to two Hs with J1 and two Hs with J2. This would lead to a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Alternatively, if a H is adjacent to two Hs with one coupling and another two Hs with a different coupling, the splitting could be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a -CH2-CHO group, where the CH2 is between two carbonyl groups. Each H on the CH2 would be split by the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 and perhaps another group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the Hs are in a -CH2-CH2-CHO group. Then, each H on the first CH2 would be split by the two Hs on the same CH2 (geminal, no splitting) and the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So, each H would be a triplet.

But if there's another adjacent group, like another CH2, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a -CH2-CO-CH2- group, and each H on the CH2 next to CO is adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 and two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So, each H would be a triplet.

Wait, but in that case, each H would be a triplet. So the answer would be triplet, option A.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the Hs are part of a more complex coupling scenario.

Wait, another angle: in the ozonolysis product, the Hs adjacent to the carbonyl are part of a -CH2-CHO group. Each H on the CH2 would be split by the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So, each would be a triplet.

But if the CH2 is between two carbonyl groups, like R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R', then the Hs on the middle CH2 would be split by the Hs on both adjacent CH2 groups, leading to more complex splitting.

Wait, suppose the structure is such that a CH2 group is between two carbonyl groups. Each H on the CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on one side and two on the other. So, each H would be a triplet from one side and another triplet from the other side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So, the coupling pattern would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps each H is adjacent to three other Hs, leading to a quartet, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, the H is adjacent to two Hs on one side and one on the other, leading to a triplet of doublets, but that's not an option.

Hmm. Another possibility is that the H is part of a -CH2-CO- group and adjacent to another CH2 group that has two Hs. So, each H on the CH2 would be split by the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

In that case, the coupling would be a triplet, option A.

But I'm not entirely confident. Since I'm a bit stuck, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Let me recap the steps:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (epoxide or ketone).

2. Product 1 → product 2 (alkene via elimination).

3. Product 2 → product 3 (carbonyl compounds via ozonolysis).

In product 3, the most deshielded H is adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's imagine product 3 has a structure where a CH2 group is next to a carbonyl. Each H on that CH2 would be split by the two Hs on the adjacent CH2.

So, each H would be a triplet. So, the answer would be triplet, option A.

But wait, another possibility: if the CH2 is between two carbonyl groups, then each H would be split by two Hs on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets. So, each H would have coupling with two Hs on one side and two on the other, leading to a triplet for each set, resulting in a triplet of triplets.

But how likely is that structure? If product 2 had a double bond that, upon ozonolysis, breaks into two carbonyl groups, each attached to a CH2 group. So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups connected by a CH2-CH2 bridge. Each CH2 group would have two Hs.

So, in product 3, each CH2 would be next to a carbonyl on one side and another CH2 on the other. The Hs on the middle CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on each side. So, each H would be a triplet from each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

In that case, the coupling pattern would be a triplet of triplets, option B.

So, I'm now thinking that the correct answer is option B: triplet of triplets.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, leading to a final product whose most deshielded hydrogen's coupling pattern is to be determined. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH**  
   The starting material, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, reacts with KOH. The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group. The NMR spectrum of product 1 includes a signal at 4.79 ppm (2H), suggesting a deshielded proton environment, likely adjacent to an electronegative group such as oxygen. This suggests that product 1 is likely an epoxide or a ketone.

2. **Reaction 2: Product 1 + Al isopropoxide**  
   Product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This step likely facilitates the formation of a double bond (alkene) in product 2. This is inferred because ozonolysis in the next step requires a double bond to cleave.

3. **Reaction 3: Ozonolysis of product 2**  
   Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3, which contains carbonyl groups. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group, as carbonyl groups deshield nearby protons.

4. **Coupling Pattern Analysis**  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group. If this hydrogen is part of a -CH₂- group, it would couple with the two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group. This coupling would result in a triplet (n = 2, as per the n+1 rule). However, if the hydrogen is also coupled to another set of hydrogens (e.g., from a neighboring group), the splitting pattern becomes more complex. Specifically, if the hydrogen couples with two hydrogens on one side and another two hydrogens on the other side, the coupling pattern would be a triplet of triplets.

Given the structure of the products and the described reactions, the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 exhibits a coupling pattern of a triplet of triplets.
