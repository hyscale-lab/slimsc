Okay, I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration calculations. Let me read it carefully.

So the question is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. The initial solution is 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. We add 20.00 cm³ of water, then titrate with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values. The Ka is given as 1.85e-5.

Hmm. I remember that for a titration, especially with weak acids and strong bases, the pH depends on how much base has been added. So let's break this down into steps.

First, let's figure out the initial concentration after dilution. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and when we dilute it, its concentration changes, which will affect its pH before any titration.

So the initial volume is 20 cm³, 0.05 M. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. The dilution equation is C1V1 = C2V2. So 0.05 M * 20 cm³ = C2 * 40 cm³. Let's compute that.

0.05 * 20 = 1, so 1 = C2 *40 → C2 = 1/40 = 0.025 M. Oh wait, that's 0.025 M acetic acid after dilution. Right.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let's find out how much NaOH is needed.

Moles of acetic acid initially: Molarity * Volume in liters. So 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol.

NaOH has a molarity of 0.1 M. So moles = M * V → V = moles / M. V = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question is about 25% titration and equivalence point. Let's tackle each.

First, what's 25% titration? That means 25% of the required NaOH has been added. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at this point, we've added 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH.

Let me think about the state of the solution at this point. Before any NaOH is added, we have a solution of acetic acid. As we add NaOH, it reacts with the acetic acid: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O. So the OH- from NaOH deprotonates the acetic acid, forming acetate ions.

At 25% titration, only a quarter of the acetic acid has reacted. So the moles of NaOH added are a quarter of the moles of acetic acid. Let me calculate the moles involved.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Since the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol, adding 0.00025 mol of NaOH will convert 0.00025 mol of acetic acid to acetate.

So the remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And the moles of acetate (CH3COO-) formed are 0.00025 mol.

But wait, what's the total volume at this point? The initial solution is 40 cm³, and we added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So total volume is 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Wait, this setup reminds me of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Oh right, because we have a buffer solution here—some acid and some conjugate base.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) → pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(5.405e4) → about 4.73? Wait, let me calculate more accurately.

Wait no, wait. pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that.

log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

[A-] is acetate, [HA] is acetic acid.

So [A-]/[HA] is (0.00025 / 0.0425) / (0.00075 / 0.0425) → 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3.

So log(1/3) is log(0.3333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.256. Rounded to two decimal places, 4.26.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. Let me hold onto that for now.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. The solution will be of sodium acetate in water. Since acetate is a weak base, the solution will be basic.

So the moles of NaOH at equivalence are 0.001 mol, as calculated earlier. The total volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

Molarity of acetate ions is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Now, acetate acts as a base in water. The reaction is:

CH3COO- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH-

The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka → 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb = 5.405e-10. Let's find the pH.

Using the formula for weak base:

[OH-] = sqrt(Kb * C) → sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) → sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98.

So pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02. Wait, but none of the options have 9.02. Hmm. Let me think again.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me recompute.

Wait, Kb is 5.405e-10. Concentration is 0.02 M.

So Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO-]

Assuming x is [OH-], then:

x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) = approx 1.04e-5.

So pOH is -log(1.04e-5) → log(1.04) is about 0.017, so 5 - 0.017 = 4.983. So pOH ≈4.98 → pH ≈9.02.

But looking at the options, the equivalence point values are:

A) 8.52

B) 6.73

C)7.00

D)6.92

Hmm, none of these are near 9.02. Did I make a mistake? Wait, maybe I messed up the concentration.

Wait, wait, let me recheck. At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added are 0.001 mol, and the total volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³ (0.05 L).

So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 =0.02 M. That's correct.

Ah, wait wait. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the Kb. Let me compute that again.

Kb = Kw / Ka = 1e-14 /1.85e-5.

1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5 is approximately 5.405e-10. Correct.

Hmm, so why does none of the options match this? Maybe I should reevaluate my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that at the equivalence point, the solution is a buffer? No, wait, equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized, so it's just the conjugate base. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base. So it will hydrolyze in water to produce a basic solution.

Wait, but maybe I should have considered the hydrolysis correctly. Another approach: calculate the pH using the Kb.

Wait, maybe I made a calculation error in finding [OH-].

Let me recompute:

x^2 / (0.02) = 5.405e-10 → x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) = 1.04e-5. So [OH-] is 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5). Let me compute this more accurately.

Log(1.04) is about 0.017, so log(1.04e-5) is 0.017 -5 → -4.983 → so pOH is 4.983. pH is 14 -4.983 =9.017.

But none of the options have a pH at equivalence point near 9.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the initial dilution. Let me recheck that.

Original solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid.

Adding 20 cm³ of water: total volume 40 cm³.

Molarity after dilution: (0.05 M)(20 cm³) /40 cm³ = 0.025 M. That's correct.

Moles of acetic acid: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Correct.

At equivalence, adding 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH: 0.1 *0.01 L =0.001 mol. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the solution at equivalence point. Wait, sodium acetate dissociates into Na+ and CH3COO^-.

The Na+ is a spectator ion; the acetate ion reacts with water.

So, [CH3COO^-] is 0.02 M. As before.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it using another method. Maybe using the formula for weak bases:

pOH = ½ (pKb - log C)

Wait, wait, no, the formula for pH when you have a weak base is:

pOH = (pKb + log C)/2? Or is it another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact expression.

The equation is Kb = x² / (C - x) ≈ x² / C, since x is small.

So x = sqrt
