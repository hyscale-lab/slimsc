Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, so M1 = 1.5 M2. Hmm, but wait, how does mass relate to luminosity? I remember that for stars, the luminosity depends on both radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. So the radius squared and temperature to the fourth power.

Wait, but the problem also says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. I remember Wien's law, which says λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if their λ_max is the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ1 = λ2 implies T1 = T2.

So if T1 equals T2, then the temperature terms in the luminosity formula will cancel out. Let me write down the luminosity formula for both stars.

L1 = 4π (R1)^2 σ T^4
L2 = 4π (R2)^2 σ T^4

Since T is the same, L1/L2 = (R1²)/(R2²) = (1.5 R2)^2 / R2² = (2.25 R2²) / R2² = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. But wait, the options have something around 2.23 to 2.35. Hmm, but wait, did I miss anything?

Wait, the problem mentions the radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Oh, right! Because when a star moves towards or away from us, there's a Doppler shift. The observed wavelength would be affected by the star's velocity. But wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. But if Star_2 is moving, its observed λ_max might be different from its actual λ_max. Or wait, does the problem mean that the intrinsic λ_max (their own emission peak) is the same? Or is it the observed λ_max?

Hmm, the question states: "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So that implies the observed wavelengths are the same. So the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. But for each star, their actual λ_max depends on their own temperature. But wait, if their actual temperatures are different, then the observed λ_max would be different due to Doppler shift.

Wait, but let's think again. Let me clarify this point. The actual emitted λ_max is determined by their temperature. But due to their velocity relative to us, this λ_max is shifted. So the observed λ_max depends on both the actual T and the velocity.

So let's model this. Let me denote the actual temperature of Star_1 as T1, Star_2 as T2. The observed wavelength for Star_1 would be λ1_obs = λ1 * sqrt( (1 - v1 / c) / (1 + v1 / c) ) ), but wait, for radial velocity, the Doppler shift formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) if moving away, or (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) if moving towards. Wait, actually, I think the formula is λ_obs = λ_em * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ), where β is v/c and v is the radial velocity. But here, Star_1 has v=0, so λ1_obs = λ1_rest. Star_2 has v=700 km/s, which is a significant fraction of c? Wait, 700 km/s is about 0.00233c, because c is about 3e5 km/s. So 700/3e5 is about 0.00233, so beta is 0.00233.

But the observed λ1 and λ2 are the same. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

But λ1_obs is λ1_rest, because Star_1's velocity is zero.

λ2_obs is λ2_rest multiplied by the Doppler factor.

Wait, let me think about the Doppler effect for wavelength. The formula is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

But wait, that's when the source is moving away. If it's moving towards us, v is negative, so the denominator is (1 - v/c), and the numerator is (1 + v/c), but if v is towards, then the observed wavelength is shorter.

Wait, the formula I remember is:

When the source is moving away, observed wavelength is longer.

When moving towards, it's shorter.

The exact formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z), where z is the redshift. But for small z, z ≈ v/c. But for more precise cases, the relativistic Doppler shift is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

But wait, no: when the source is moving away, v is positive, and λ_obs > λ_rest (redshifted). When moving towards, v is negative, so λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c) ) = 1/(sqrt( ... )) which is smaller than λ_rest.

So for Star_2, which has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, I'm assuming it's moving away from us because the velocity is positive in the radial direction (but the problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s; the question doesn't specify direction, just that Star_1 is 0 and Star_2 is 700. So perhaps Star_2 is moving away, so v = +700 km/s.

So, the observed wavelengths are the same. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

But λ1_obs is λ1_rest, because v1=0.

λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c) )

So, λ1_rest = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But according to Wien's law, λ_rest = b / T. So λ1_rest = b / T1 and λ2_rest = b / T2.

So substituting:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

We can cancel b from both sides:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Rewriting:

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

But wait, v2 is positive as it's moving away. So sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ), where beta is v2/c.

So, the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) = sqrt( (1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c) )

But what's the value of beta? v2 is 700 km/s. Let's compute beta = v2/c = 700 / (3e5) = 700 / 300,000 = 0.002333... approximately 0.002333.

So, let's compute (1 - beta)/(1 + beta):

(1 - 0.002333)/(1 + 0.002333) = (0.997667 )/(1.002333 ) ≈ 0.99533.

Taking the square root: sqrt(0.99533) ≈ 0.99766.

So T1 = T2 * 0.99766.

So T1 is about 0.99766 * T2.

But earlier, we thought that T1 = T2, because their λ_max are the same. But wait, no. Because the observed λ_max is same, but the actual λ_rest depends on their temperatures, and the Doppler shift. So without considering Doppler shift, if Star_2 is moving, its observed λ_max would be different, but since the observed λ_max is same as Star_1's, their actual temperatures must be different.

Wait, so back to the luminosity. The formula for luminosity is L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

We have L1 = 4π (1.5 R2)² σ T1⁴
L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴

So the ratio L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 ) ) = (2.25) * (T1/T2)^4.

We found earlier that T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - beta) / (1 + beta) )

So T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - 0.002333)/(1 + 0.002333) )

As I calculated, this ratio is approximately 0.99766, so T1 ≈ 0.99766 T2.

Thus, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.99766)^4 ≈ Let me compute that.

0.99766^2 is approximately (1 - 2*0.00234) since (1-x)^2 ≈ 1-2x for small x. So 1 - 0.00468 ≈ 0.99532. Hmm, but perhaps exact calculation is better.

Wait, 0.99766 → let's compute 0.99766^4:

Compute 0.99766²:

0.99766 * 0.99766:

Let me compute 10000 * 0.99766 = 9976.6. So (9976.6)^2 = ?

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute as (1 - 0.00234)^4.

(1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 -4x +6x² -4x³ +x^4, where x=0.00234.

So compute:

1 -4*(0.00234) +6*(0.00234)^2 -4*(0.00234)^3 + (0.00234)^4.

Compute each term:

4x = 0.00936

6x² = 6*(0.00234)^2 = 6*(0.0000054756)=0.0000328536

4x^3 =4*(0.00234)^3 ≈4*(0.00000001256) ≈ 5.024e-8

x^4 ≈ (0.00234)^4 ≈ 2.98e-11.

So putting it all together:

1 - 0.00936 + 0.0000328536 - 0.00000005024 + 0.0000000000298

So:

1 - 0.00936 = 0.99064

+ 0.0000328536 → 0.9906728536

- 0.00000005024 → 0.99067280336

+ 0.0000000000298 → negligible.

So approx 0.9906728.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.99067.

So the ratio L1/L2 becomes 2.25 * 0.99067 ≈ 2.25 * 0.99067 ≈ Let me compute that.

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

But more accurately:

2.25 * 0.99067 = ?

0.99067 * 2 = 1.98134.

0.99067 * 0.25 = 0.2476675.

Adding together: 1.98134 + 0.2476675 = 2.2290075.

So approximately 2.229.

Now, looking at the options, option D is ~2.23. So that's the closest.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because I approximated (T1/T2)^4 as 0.99067, but perhaps a more precise calculation is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps using a different approach would yield a more precise result.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler shift calculation. Let me re-calculate the Doppler shift more accurately.

v = 700 km/s.

c ≈ 299792 km/s.

So beta = v/c = 700 / 299792 ≈ 0.0023364.

So (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) = (1 - 0.0023364)/(1 + 0.0023364) = (0.9976636)/(1.0023364).

Compute this division:

0.9976636 / 1.0023364.

Let me compute 0.9976636 / 1.0023364:

Approximately, 0.9976636 / 1.0023364 ≈ let's compute 0.9976636 ÷ 1.0023364.

Let me write it as (1 - 0.0023364) / (1 + 0.0023364) = (1 - a)/(1 + a), where a=0.0023364.

We can compute this as (1 - a)/(1 + a) ≈ (1 - 2a)/(1) for small a, but perhaps a better approximation is needed.

Alternatively, using a calculator-like approach:

Compute 0.9976636 ÷ 1.0023364.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1e7 to eliminate decimals.

Approximate:

Numerator: 9,976,636

Denominator: 10,023,364

Now, 10,023,364 x 0.995 ≈ 10,023,364 - (0.005 * 10,023,364) = 10,023,364 - 50,116.82 = 9,973,247.18.

Wait, perhaps better to compute 10,023,364 * 0.99532 = ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 9976636 / 10023364.

Let me compute this as:

9976636 ÷ 10023364 ≈ 0.99533.

Wait, because 10023364 * 0.99533 = approximately:

10023364 * 0.995 = 10023364 * (1 - 0.005) = 10023364 - 50116.82 = 9973247.18.

But 9976636 is about 9973247.18 + 3388.82 → so the difference is 3388.82. So we need to find the multiplier beyond 0.995.

Let me set x as the multiplier, so:

x = 0.995 + d.

We have 10023364 * x = 9976636.

We can find d:

We know that 10023364 * 0.995 = 9973247.18.

So 9973247.18 + 10023364 * d = 9976636.

So 10023364 * d = 9976636 - 9973247.18 = 3388.82.

So d = 3388.82 / 10023364 ≈ 3.38e3 / 1e7 → ~0.0003378.

So x ≈ 0.995 + 0.0003378 = 0.9953378.

So (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ≈ 0.9953378.

So sqrt(0.9953378) ≈ Let me compute that.

0.9953378^(1/2).

We can use the Taylor expansion for sqrt(1 - ε), where ε is small.

sqrt(1 - ε) ≈ 1 - ε/2 - ε²/(8) - ... .

Here, ε = 1 - 0.9953378 = 0.0046622.

Wait, no. Wait, 0.9953378 = 1 - 0.0046622.

So ε = 0.0046622.

So sqrt(1 - ε) ≈ 1 - (ε/2) - (ε²)/(8).

Let me compute each term:

ε/2 = 0.0046622 / 2 = 0.0023311.

ε² = (0.0046622)^2 ≈ 0.00002175.

ε²/8 ≈ 0.000002719.

So sqrt ≈ 1 - 0.0023311 - 0.000002719 ≈ 0.997666.

Wait, that's approximately 0.997666.

Wait, but wait: sqrt(0.9953378) is approximately 0.997664.

So T1 = T2 * 0.997664.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (0.997664)^4.

Again, let's compute this more accurately.

Compute (0.997664)^4.

We can compute step by step:

First, compute (0.997664)^2.

0.997664 * 0.997664.

Let me compute 0.997664 * 0.997664.

We can write this as (1 - 0.002336)^2.

Which is 1 - 2*0.002336 + (0.002336)^2.

= 1 - 0.004672 + 0.000005456.

= 0.995334456.

Now, (0.995334456)^2.

Again, (1 - 0.004665544)^2.

Which is 1 - 2*0.004665544 + (0.004665544)^2.

= 1 - 0.009331088 + 0.00002176.

= (1 - 0.009331088) = 0.990668912 + 0.00002176 → 0.990690672.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.990690672.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.990690672 ≈ 2.25 * 0.99069 ≈ 2.229.

Which is about 2.23, matching option D.

So the answer should be D) ~2.23.


To determine the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 and Star_2, we start by using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

Given that Star_1 has a radius \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and the same peak wavelength as Star_2, we know from Wien's law (\( \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T} \)) that their temperatures must be related. However, Star_2 has a radial velocity of \( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), which introduces a Doppler shift. The observed peak wavelength for both stars is the same, so the relationship between their intrinsic temperatures must account for this shift.

### Step 1: Relating Temperatures
The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
\]

Since the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both stars, we equate their rest wavelengths:

\[
\frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
\]

Canceling \( b \) and rearranging:

\[
T_1 = T_2 \sqrt{\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}}
\]

Substituting \( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 299,792 \, \text{km/s} \), we find:

\[
\beta = \frac{v}{c} = \frac{700}{299792} \approx 0.0023364
\]

\[
\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta} = \frac{1 - 0.0023364}{1 + 0.0023364} \approx 0.9953378
\]

\[
T_1 = T_2 \sqrt{0.9953378} \approx T_2 \cdot 0.997664
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx 0.997664
\]

### Step 2: Luminosity Ratio
The luminosity ratio is:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{4\pi R_1^2 \sigma T_1^4}{4\pi R_2^2 \sigma T_2^4} = \frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx 0.997664 \):

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \cdot (0.997664)^4
\]

First, calculate \( (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \). Next, compute \( (0.997664)^4 \):

\[
(0.997664)^2 = 1 - 2(0.0023364) + (0.0023364)^2 \approx 0.995334
\]

\[
(0.995334)^2 = 1 - 2(0.0046655) + (0.0046655)^2 \approx 0.990691
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.990691 \approx 2.229
\]

### Step 3: Final Answer
The calculated ratio \( \frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.23 \), which matches option **D**.

**Answer: D**
