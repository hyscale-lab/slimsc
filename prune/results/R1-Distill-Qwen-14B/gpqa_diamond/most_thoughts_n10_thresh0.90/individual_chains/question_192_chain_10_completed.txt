Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the setup: there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small cavity, which is also spherical. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. So the cavity isn't centered at the conductor's center.

Then, someone places a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Both l and L are bigger than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor.

Wait, the angle between l (the distance from the cavity's center to P) and s (the distance between the two centers) is theta. So I guess the point P is somewhere in space relative to both the conductor and the cavity.

I remember that conductors in electrostatic equilibrium have some interesting properties. The charges redistribute themselves in such a way that the electric field inside the conductor material is zero. So the conductor itself must have induced charges.

But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. When the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, it induces charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor. Oh right, because the conductor is a shell, the charges inside the cavity (the +q) will cause the inner surface of the conductor to have an induced charge of -q. Since the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface must then have +q to balance it out.

So, the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. Now, the electric field outside the conductor (like at point P) should be due to the outer surface charge, but wait, the conductor is uncharged, wait no, wait. The conductor was initially uncharged, but when +q is placed inside, the conductor's inner surface gets -q and the outer surface +q. So the net charge on the conductor is zero because it started neutral and the inner and outer charges cancel each other. Wait, no, that can't be right because the conductor is a conductor. Let me think again.

Wait, the conductor was initially neutral. When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the cavity is inside the conductor. So the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface will have +q. Because the conductor was neutral, the total charge is zero: (-q on inner, +q on outer). So the outer surface's +q is the only charge outside the conductor, but wait no, wait. The conductor itself is neutral, so the total charge on the conductor (inner and outer) is zero, so the outer surface must have +q, because the inner is -q. So the outer surface's charge is +q, which contributes to the electric field outside.

But wait, the conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface's charge would distribute uniformly. But wait, wait. The conductor is a spherical shell, right? So the outer surface would have a charge of +q, but wait, no. Because the conductor was initially uncharged, and the cavity has a charge +q, so the inner surface must have -q, leaving the outer surface with +q, since the conductor's total charge is zero. Wait, no, the conductor's total charge is zero. Because it was uncharged, and the net charge comes from the cavity. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q to make the conductor's total charge zero. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the outer surface's charge is +q, so the conductor's charge is (-q) + (+q) = 0. That's correct.

So the electric field outside the conductor, at point P, would be due to the outer surface's charge, which is +q. But wait, the point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, so according to Gauss's Law, the electric field outside a charged spherical shell is as if the charge were concentrated at the center. So the field would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q_enclosed) / L².

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface has charge +q, so the Q_enclosed for the Gaussian surface at P would be +q. So E = (q)/(4πε₀ L²), right? That's the same as option B: E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q/L²).

But wait, I'm getting confused because of the position of the cavity. The cavity isn't at the center, so the inner surface's charge isn't uniform. Wait, the inner surface's charge is -q, but because the cavity is not at the center, the induced charges on the inner surface might not be spherically symmetric. But wait, the outer surface is still a conductor, so the charges on the outer surface would be uniformly distributed because the electric field inside the conductor is zero. So the outer surface's charge would act as if it's a point charge at the center, regardless of the inner cavity's position.

Wait, but wait, the point P is outside the conductor. The conductor's outer radius is R, and L is greater than R. So the electric field at P due to the outer surface's charge is (1/(4πε₀)) (q)/(L²). Because the outer surface's charge is +q, and the Gaussian surface at P would enclose that charge.

But looking at the options, option B is exactly that.

But wait, some of the options involve l and theta. Let me think again. Is there any possibility that the field depends on the position of the cavity?

Wait, in the conductor, the charges rearrange such that the inner surface has -q, and the outer has +q. But the outer surface is a sphere, so regardless of where the cavity is, the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform because the conductor is a sphere, and the outer surface's charge will distribute uniformly, leading to the same E as if the charge were at the center. So the position of the cavity (i.e., the displacement s between the two centers) doesn't affect the external field. Because for the external field, only the total charge on the outer surface matters, which is +q, and it's as if it's at the center.

So the electric field at P is E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q/L²). That's option B.

Wait, but why are options A, C, D involving l and theta? Are they considering the field due to the cavity's charge?

No, because point P is outside the conductor. The conductor's outer surface is a distance R from the center, and P is at L > R. So the field at P is due to the +q on the outer surface, treated as a point charge at the center.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B.


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Setup and Induced Charges**:  
   The spherical conductor is initially uncharged. When a charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge of $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor and a charge of $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor. This ensures the conductor remains neutral overall.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   The electric field outside a charged spherical shell is determined by the total charge on the shell, as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the shell. Since the outer surface of the conductor has a charge of $+q$, the electric field at point $P$ (which is outside the conductor) depends only on this charge.

3. **Gaussian Surface Application**:  
   Using Gauss's Law, the electric field at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]
   This result is independent of the position of the cavity or the angle $\theta$, as the external electric field depends only on the total charge on the outer surface of the conductor.

4. **Relevance of Other Options**:  
   Options $A$, $C$, and $D$ involve terms like $l$, $s$, and $\theta$, which are unnecessary for calculating the electric field outside the conductor. These terms describe the geometry of the cavity and its position relative to the conductor, but they do not affect the external field, which depends solely on the uniformly distributed charge on the outer surface.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
