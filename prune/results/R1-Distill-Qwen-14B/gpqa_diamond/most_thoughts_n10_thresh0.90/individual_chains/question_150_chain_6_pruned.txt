Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question involves identifying a compound based on its NMR data and predicting the product after a series of reactions.

First, I'll read the problem carefully. The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and the reagents used are NaNO2 and HCl, followed by H2O, and then aqueous KOH with heat. The options are four different compounds, all of which seem to be aldehydes with some substituents.

Hmm, so the first step is to figure out what the original compound is. Let's start by analyzing the NMR data.

The 1H NMR spectrum shows the following signals:
- 9.72 ppm, triplet (t), 1H. That's a strong signal, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically appear around 9-10 ppm, so this fits.
- 6.98 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. That's probably aromatic protons. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. Maybe two equivalent aromatic protons, like in a para-substituted benzene? Wait, but wait, the coupling might be with another aromatic ring. Alternatively, maybe they're adjacent to substituents.
- 6.51 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. Another set of aromatic protons. The doublet suggests coupling with one proton. Maybe these are part of a different aromatic ring.
- 6.27 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Broad singlet could mean these protons are either in a conjugated system or perhaps part of an enol structure, but more likely, maybe they're adjacent to an electrondonating group. Alternatively, perhaps they're in a conjugated diene or something else. Or, since it's a singlet, maybe they're in an environment where they don't have neighboring protons. Wait, 2H as a singlet, maybe they're in a vinyl group or part of a conjugated system.
- 3.66 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. This is a quartet, but according to the data, it's a doublet. Wait, no, the data says "d, 2H". So this is a doublet of two protons. Integration is 2H. That could be a CH2 group attached to something deshielded, maybe oxygen, like OCH2 or something. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 connected to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. For example, a methylene adjacent to an aldehyde or an oxygen. Or perhaps it's part of an ether or an ester.

So putting this together: the molecule has an aldehyde group (9.72 ppm, triplet), some aromatic rings, and a CH2 group attached to an oxygen. Let me think about the structure.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

Calculating: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be, for example, one ring and four double bonds, but more likely, a combination of rings and double bonds. So perhaps one benzene ring (3 double bonds), one double bond (like an aldehyde or an enal), and maybe a ring.

Looking at the NMR, the 9.72 is an aldehyde. So that's one double bond accounted for. The aromatic protons suggest at least one benzene ring. Possibly two benzene rings, given the four aromatic protons in two doublets. Wait, the first aromatic is 2H, the second is another 2H. So maybe two substituents on a benzene ring, or perhaps two separate aromatic rings.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's think about the structure. If the aldehyde is present, perhaps it's part of a side chain attached to a benzene ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a diphenyl compound. Wait, but let's see. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

Looking at the NMR data again. The 9.72 is the aldehyde - that's a triplet, which indicates coupling with two protons. So the aldehyde proton is adjacent to a CH2 group. Because in a triplet, the coupling is with two protons, so perhaps the aldehyde is at the end of a CH2-CHO group. So for example, something like R-CH2-CHO. So the aldehyde is coupled with the two protons on the adjacent CH2, which would give a triplet.

So the aldehyde is at R-CH2-CHO. Now, the CH2 is at 3.66 ppm, a doublet. So the two protons on CH2 are adjacent to something with two protons as well. For example, if the CH2 is next to another CH2, but the coupling would be more than that. Alternatively, maybe the CH2 is attached to an oxygen, like an OCH2CH2CHO? But that doesn't seem to fit the aromatic parts.

Wait, but the NMR has two aromatic regions: 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). That suggests two sets of two equivalent aromatic protons, perhaps in two different aromatic rings.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a benzene ring with two substituents, each being a para-substituted group. Wait, but 6.98 and 6.51 for two doublets each of 2H could be two aromatic rings each with two protons. For example, two para-substituted benzene rings, each with a substituent. But then the substituents would account for the other carbons.

Wait, let me think about the molecular formula again. C8H9NO. Let's consider that there are two benzene rings. Each benzene ring has 6 carbons, but if the molecule is a diphenyl compound, that's 12 carbons, which is way more than 8. So that's not possible. So perhaps only one benzene ring.

Wait, maybe the structure is a benzaldehyde derivative. Let's consider if the molecule has a benzene ring with substituents, and an aldehyde group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a substituent that has the aldehyde group and the CH2 group.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's subtract the formula for benzaldehyde, which is C7H6O. Our compound has one more CH3 (since it's C8H9NO), but wait, benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Wait, no, wait: C8H9NO is our formula. So perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that adds up to C8-C6=2 carbons (since benzene is C6H6). Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CHO group. Let's see:

Benzene with a substituent R. R would be CH2CHO, which is two carbons (since CH2CHO is CH2-CHO, which is two carbons: the CH2 and the CHO). So benzene (C6H5) + CH2CHO (C2H3O) would give C8H8O. But our formula is C8H9NO. Wait, the substituent is CH2CHO: that would be C2H3O. So the benzene ring would contribute C6H5, so the total would be C8H8O. But we have C8H9NO. So that's one more H and an N. Hmm, maybe the substituent is something else.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a group with a nitrogen. Because the molecular formula includes N. So perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(NO) group or something similar? Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH2CHNO group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a secondary amine or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a side chain with an amine.

Wait, but the NMR data doesn't show any signals that indicate amines, which typically appear around 1-5 ppm. So maybe the N is in a different part. Let me think: the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So N is present as one atom, so perhaps it's part of an amide, an amine, or an imine.

Wait, the NMR shows a triplet at 9.72, which is probably the aldehyde. So perhaps the substituent is a side chain with an aldehyde and an oxygen. Let me think again.

Another approach: the 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. That's a tricky one. Broad singlet could mean either that the protons are in a conjugated system or perhaps they're part of an enol. Alternatively, maybe they're in a di-substituted vinyl group, but that would usually show coupling.

Wait, perhaps the 6.27 ppm is a pair of protons that are coupled with each other but in a way that the splitting isn't observed because the coupling is with equivalent protons? Or perhaps they're in a conjugated diene, but that might not necessarily be a singlet.

Wait, another idea: maybe the 6.27 ppm is an aromatic ring with two protons that are para to substituents. But then why a singlet? Because in a para-substituted benzene, the protons are equivalent, so they would be a doublet if coupled with adjacent H's.

Wait, perhaps it's not an aromatic proton. Maybe it's a vinyl proton. For example, in a conjugated enal system, the protons on the double bond could appear as a singlet if they're next to substituents that deshield them.

Wait, but in an enal, the protons on the double bond are usually split into a triplet or a doublet. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the 6.27 is an AB system where the protons are equivalent and don't split each other, resulting in a singlet.

Alternatively, perhaps it's part of a carbonyl group adjacent to a CH2 group. Wait, but the 3.66 is the CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like this: a benzene ring with a substituent that's a CH2 group, which is further connected to a CHO group. But then where is the N?

Wait, the molecular formula has an N and an O. So perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group connected to an O-linked group, but that's not clear yet.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like OCH2CHO. But then that would require the O to be part of an ether or ester group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde with a substituent that has an oxygen and a nitrogen. But I'm not sure. Let me think of possible structures matching the NMR.

Another approach: let's break down the NMR peaks.

The aldehyde at 9.72 ppm (t) suggests that it's coupled with two protons, likely from a CH2 group adjacent to it. So, perhaps the structure is R-CH2-CHO.

The 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) is a CH2 group, adjacent to something that gives a doublet. The doublet means each proton is coupled with one other set of protons. So maybe this CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group. But then why is the coupling one? Alternatively, maybe it's adjacent to a group with two equivalent protons, such as an aromatic ring.

Wait, but the CH2 is at 3.66, which is a bit deshielded, perhaps because it's next to an oxygen. So maybe it's an OCH2 group. Like OCH2-CH2-CHO. But wait, then the CH2 next to O would be split into a quartet or something else. Or perhaps it's part of an ether.

Alternatively, maybe the CH2 is attached to an oxygen and next to another CH2. So something like OCH2-CH2-CHO. But then the CH2 next to O would have a triplet from coupling with the adjacent CH2, but the data shows a doublet.

Hmm. Maybe it's not an ether. Another possibility is a carbonyl group adjacent to the CH2. For example, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CHO. But then the carbonyl would be a ketone or something else, but that doesn't fit the aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is part of an enol structure, but that's just a guess.

Now, looking at the aromatic signals. The 6.98 and 6.51 doublets each have two protons. Let's think about a para-substituted benzene. For example, if the substituent is at the para position, then the aromatic protons would be two doublets. But wait, para substitution typically gives two equivalent protons, so maybe as a doublet of doublets, but in some cases, it's a singlet? Or perhaps the substituent is such that the two protons are each adjacent to another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the benzene ring has two substituents, each of which is a CH2CHO group. But that might complicate the structure.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is a diphenyl acetaldehyde or something similar. Wait, but diphenyl would require more carbons than allowed.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent on the benzene is a group that includes the aldehyde and the CH2. So, for example, benzaldehyde with a substituent that adds another group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-phenylbut-3-enal or something like that. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the molecular formula again. C8H9NO. So 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one N, and one O.

If the structure has a benzene ring (6 carbons), then the substituent would be two carbons (since 6+2=8). So substituent is two carbons with an O and an N.

Wait, but two carbons can't have both O and N. Because two carbons could have substituents like O and N, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps one of them is part of a functional group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CHO group. That would be two carbons: CH2-CHO. So the benzene would be C6H5-CH2-CHO. Then the molecular formula would be C6H5 (C6H5) + CH2CHO (C2H3O) → C8H8O. But our molecular formula is C8H9NO, which has an extra H and an N. So that doesn't fit.

Ah, maybe the substituent has an NH group. So perhaps it's C6H5-CH2-CHO-NH2? No, that would add more N and more H.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-CHO group where the CH2 is connected to an oxygen, like OCH2CHO. But then the O would be part of an ether or ester.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group connected to
