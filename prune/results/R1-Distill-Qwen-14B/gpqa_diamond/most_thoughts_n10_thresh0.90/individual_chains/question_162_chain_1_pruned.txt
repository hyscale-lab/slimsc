Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the area of a pseudosphere given a specific metric. I remember that in general relativity and differential geometry, the metric tensor describes the geometry of spacetime. But wait, pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a two-dimensional surface with constant negative curvature, which is a model in hyperbolic geometry. So the question is about finding its area using the given metric.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Hmm, that looks a bit like a conformal metric, where the line element is a scalar function multiplied by the Euclidean metric. So the conformal factor here is 32/(4 - x² - y²). 

Wait, but what's the significance of this metric? I remember that the Poincaré disk model uses a similar metric. The Poincaré disk is a model where the hyperbolic plane is represented as the interior of a unit disk. Its metric is usually written as ds² = [4/(1 - x² - y²)^2] (dx² + dy²). Comparing that to the given metric, the denominator here is (4 - x² - y²), so that's like scaling the Poincaré disk.

Let me think. If the standard Poincaré disk has a radius parameter, say R, then the metric is ds² = [4/(1 - (x² + y²)/R²)] (dx² + dy²). So in our case, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²) = 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So that would be R² = 4, so R=2. Oh wait, so this metric is the Poincaré disk model with radius R=2.

Now, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, pseudosphere and sphere... Hmm. Wait, a pseudosphere is a specific surface in hyperbolic geometry, but maybe in this context, it refers to the entire hyperbolic plane or a certain part of it.

But wait, the Poincaré disk is a model of the hyperbolic plane, which is unbounded. So the "area" of the entire hyperbolic plane would be infinite. But the question mentions a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Maybe it's considering a region up to a certain radius, like a "disk" of radius 2 in this model.

Wait, let's think about the area in the Poincaré disk model. The disk usually has a curvature. The area of a disk of radius r in the hyperbolic plane can be calculated. The formula for the area in hyperbolic geometry is A = 4π sinh²(k r / 2), where k is the curvature. Or wait, another formula: the area is 2π (cosh(k r) - 1)/(k), or something like that. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric given is of a hyperboloid or something else. But wait, the question states that it's a pseudosphere. A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, like a horn or a tractricoid. But in any case, the area of a pseudosphere is finite. Wait, no, I think the tractricoid (which is a pseudosphere) has finite surface area but infinite length. But in this problem, perhaps the setup is different.

Wait, maybe I should compute the area from the given metric. The metric is ds² = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²). So in two-dimensional space, the area element would be sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. For a metric of the form ds² = E dx² + 2F dxdy + G dy², the determinant is EG - F². In this case, E = 32/(4 - x² - y²), G is the same, and F is zero because there's no cross term. So determinant g = (32/(4 - r²))^2, where r² = x² + y².

Wait, so the area element dA = sqrt(g) dx dy = [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy. To find the total area, we can integrate this over the region where the metric is defined. The metric denominator is 4 - x² - y², which must be positive to have a real metric. So 4 - r² >0 → r² <4 → r <2. So the region is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane.

But let me think again. The area is ∫∫ dA = ∫ (from r=0 to 2) ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) [32/(4 - r²)] r dθ dr.

So first, integrate over θ: the integral from 0 to 2π of dθ is 2π.

Then, the integral becomes 2π * ∫ (from 0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute this. Let u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → - (du/2) = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes:

32 * 2π * ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [ (r dr) / u ] → 32 * 2π * [−1/2 ∫ (from 4 to 0) (1/u) du ]

Wait, wait, maybe I should compute this step by step.

The integral I = ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make substitution u =4 - r². Then du = -2 r dr → r dr = - du/2.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So I becomes:

∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [32/(u)] * (-du/2) )

= 32 * (1/2) ∫ (from 4 to 0) (1/u) (-du)

= 16 ∫ (from 0 to4) (1/u) du

= 16 [ln u from 0 to4]

Wait, ln 4 minus ln 0. But ln 0 is negative infinity, so this would be 16 (ln4 - (-infty)) which is infinity. Wait, that can't be right because the area element would diverge at r=2.

But wait, that suggests that the area is infinite, which would make option D the answer. But wait, in reality, the Poincaré disk model represents the entire hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. So the area is indeed infinite. Then the question is whether the pseudosphere of radius r=2 refers to the entire hyperbolic plane or just a part of it.

Wait, I'm getting confused. The pseudosphere is a finite surface, but I think in this question, perhaps the metric represents the entire hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. So the area would be +infty, option D.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about a compactified version, but that doesn't seem to be the case here. The given metric has a denominator 4 - x² - y², which allows x² + y² <4. So it's a disk of radius 2. But integrating the area element gives infinity, which would mean option D is correct.

Wait, but how does this relate to a pseudosphere of radius 2? I thought pseudospheres are models of hyperbolic geometry, but they have finite surface area. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing between the tractricoid (which is a finite area) and the hyperbolic plane (infinite area). So if the question is about the entire hyperbolic plane, the area is infinite.

But the question says, "the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2." Wait, maybe I've been thinking about this incorrectly. Pseudosphere usually refers to a tractricoid, which is a surface of revolution of a tractrix. The tractrix has a certain property, but the surface area is finite. However, the metric given here could be for a different model.

Wait, maybe the metric is that of a sphere in some coordinate system, but I'm not so sure. Alternatively, perhaps this is a metric for a two-dimensional surface with a singularity at r=2.

Wait, let's step back. The pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. The area enclosed by a circle of radius r in hyperbolic geometry is given by 4π sinh²(k r /2), where k is the curvature. Alternatively, the area of a circle of radius r is 2π (cosh(k r) - 1)/(k). Wait, maybe I should calculate the curvature from the given metric.

In the given metric, the conformal factor is 32/(4 - x² - y²). Let's express it in polar coordinates (r, θ) where r² =x² + y².

So the metric becomes ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²).

The Gaussian curvature K of a conformally flat metric ds² = e^{2λ(r)} (dr² + r² dθ²) is given by K = - e^{2λ} [ ( (r e^{λ}) '' ) + ( (r e^{λ}) ' ) / r ) ].

Wait, maybe that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, for a conformal metric f(r)(dr² + r² dθ²), the Gaussian curvature is [ (f')/(r f) ) ]' + (1/(2 r²)) (f'') ) * something. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the Gaussian curvature another way. The Gaussian curvature K can be computed from the Laplacian of ln f, where f is the conformal factor.

Wait, the formula is K = - (1/(2 f)) Δ (ln f), where Δ is the Laplacian. Let me compute Δ(ln f).

f(r) = 32/(4 - r²) = 32*(4 - r²)^{-1}.

ln f = ln(32) - ln(4 - r²).

The Laplacian in two dimensions for a radially symmetric function is Δ (ln f) = (1/r) d/dr (r d(ln f)/dr )

So first, d(ln f)/dr = 0 - [ (-2 r) / (4 -
