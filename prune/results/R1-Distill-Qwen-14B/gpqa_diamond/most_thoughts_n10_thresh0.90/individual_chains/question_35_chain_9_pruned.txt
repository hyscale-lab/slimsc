Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. 

The problem says that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and satisfies the eigenvalue equation Ayφ = aφ. The matrix Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). 

Wait, so first I need to figure out the form of the Ay matrix. Let me write that out. Since c = h/(4π), and S is:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

So Ay = c * S. So substituting c, Ay becomes:

[ (h/4π)*0   (h/4π)*(-i) ]
[ (h/4π)*i    (h/4π)*0 ]

Simplifying, that's:

[ 0    (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   0 ]

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue.

The matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ -a      (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (i h)/(4π) * (-i h)/(4π) ] = a² - [ (i*(-i) h²)/( (4π)^2 ) ]

Wait, i*(-i) is -i², which is -(-1) = 1. So the second term becomes (h²)/(16π²). 

So the determinant equation is a² - (h²)/(16π²) = 0. 

Solving, a² = (h²)/(16π²) → a = ± h/(4π) * (1/2) ? Wait, wait, no. Because sqrt( (h²)/(16π²) ) is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues a are ± h/(4π).

Wait, no, sqrt of (h²/(16π²)) is h/(4π). So a = ± (h/(4π)) * 1? Or wait, wait. Wait, (h/(4π))^2 is h²/(16 π²). So a² is that, so a is ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = - h/(4π). 

Wait, but wait, hold on—because the determinant equation is a² - (h^2)/(16 π^2) = 0. So a^2 = (h^2)/(16 π^2). So a is sqrt( (h^2)/(16 π^2) ) = h/(4 π) times sqrt(1), so ± h/(4 π).
