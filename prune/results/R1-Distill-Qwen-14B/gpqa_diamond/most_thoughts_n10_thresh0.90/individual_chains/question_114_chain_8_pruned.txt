Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for the given reactions. Let me think this through step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, what's happening here? Butan-2-one is a ketone, right? So when a ketone reacts with a cyanide source like NaCN, I remember that it's a nucleophilic addition. The CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when NaCN adds, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But wait, the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me see: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or is it more like (CH2)2-C(OH)(CN)-? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me draw it out.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN would form (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons. Butanenitrile is four carbons with the nitrile. The product structure would be CH2CN-C(OH)(CH3)2? No, wait, the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Oh, but butanenitrile would have four carbons including the nitrile. So maybe the initial product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanenitrile? Or am I getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH3? No, no, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when it reacts with NaCN, the product after addition would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me structure that.

Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the position of the hydroxy group and the methyl matters. 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would have the structure: CH2CH(CN)(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait. Wait, butanenitrile is four carbons, with the nitrile on C-1. So numbering from the nitrile end: 1, 2, 3, 4. So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be:

NC-CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2- something? Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN. Wait, no, but that would be 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile? Or maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution.

Wait, no, the reaction is addition. Because in ketones, the cyanide adds to the carbonyl. So the product would be a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrins are formed when a nucleophile like CN- adds to a carbonyl, giving a secondary alcohol and a nitrile group.

So the product would have the structure where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by OH and CN. So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. After adding CN-, it becomes (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Let me count the carbons. The starting ketone is three carbons (butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is 3 carbons in the chain), so the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, that's 4 carbons including the nitrile? Wait, but butanenitrile has four carbons, so the product is butanenitrile with substituents.

Wait, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, that wouldn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the product is 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanenitrile. But the given product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is a substitution. Wait, no, substitution would require a good leaving group
