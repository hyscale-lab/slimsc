--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data includes the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters, so it's a very small distance.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay length depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula, I think, is something like L = gamma * beta * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is the velocity over c, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime.

But wait, how do I find tau, the proper lifetime? Oh right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that the uncertainty in energy (Γ) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (tau) is about h-bar over 2pi. So tau is approximately h-bar divided by (2 pi Γ). Or wait, maybe it's h-bar over Γ, because Γ is the total decay width which is the energy uncertainty. So tau ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, let me get that right. The natural line width is given by the uncertainty principle: ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. Since Γ is the total decay width, it's like the energy uncertainty, so Δt is the lifetime tau. So, tau ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, I think the exact formula is tau = ħ / Γ. Because Γ is the total width, which is the inverse of the lifetime. So yeah, tau = ħ / Γ.

Then, I need to compute gamma and beta. Since E is the production energy, which is higher than the rest mass (m_X is 1.2 GeV, E is 8 GeV), so the meson is moving relativistically.

The energy E is the total energy, which is gamma * m_X c². So gamma is E/(m_X c²). Wait, but since m_X is given in GeV/c², and E is given in GeV, perhaps we can work in units where c=1, so E = gamma m_X.

Wait, let's think in natural units where c=1. So E = gamma m_X c² → gamma = E/(m_X c²). But in natural units, c=1, so gamma = E/(m_X).

Wait, E is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV. So gamma is 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Then beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²), since beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma)^2 ) ≈ 1 for large gamma.

Wait, wait, let me compute beta correctly.

Gamma is E/(m_X c²). Oh wait, because E = gamma m_X c², so gamma = E/(m_X c²). But in natural units where c=1, E = gamma m_X, so gamma = E/m_X = 8/1.2 = 6.666... So gamma is 6.666..., which is 20/3.

Then, beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

So let's compute that.

Gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.444.

1/gamma squared is 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887.

So now, putting it all together, the lifetime tau is h-bar / Γ. But wait, Γ is given in MeV. I need to convert units so everything is consistent.

Wait, ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Its value is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and Planck constant is about 6.626e-34 J·s. But when working in natural units (GeV and seconds), ħ is about 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s. But Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = ħ / Γ.

So tau ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 s ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Then, the gamma factor is 6.666..., and beta is approx 0.9887.

So the mean decay length L is gamma * beta * c * tau.

But wait, c is the speed of light. Since we're working in natural units where c is 3e8 m/s, but in our earlier steps, we've considered c=1, so when calculating L, we need to include c.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, in the natural units, when we have L = gamma * beta * c * tau. But wait, tau is in seconds, and c is in m/s. So, let's compute each part.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute in units where c is in m/s, and the other units are converted properly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma * beta * c * tau.

Gamma is 6.666..., beta is 0.9887. So gamma * beta is approx 6.666 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.592.

c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So L = 6.592 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, let's compute that.

Let me compute 6.592 * 3e8 = 1.9776e9.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24: 1.9776e9 * 2.056875e-24.

Let me compute that: 1.9776 * 2.056875 is approximately 4.065 (because 2 * 2 is 4, and 0.056875 * 2 is around 0.11375, but more accurately, 1.9776 * 2.056875 = let me calculate:

1.9776 * 2 = 3.9552

1.9776 * 0.056875 = ?

0.056875 is about 0.056875.

1.9776 * 0.05 = 0.09888.

1.9776 * 0.006875 = approx 0.01358.

So total is approx 0.09888 + 0.01358 = 0.11246.

So total 3.9552 + 0.11246 ≈ 4.06766.

So 4.06766e-15 meters.

Wait, because 1e9 * 1e-24 is 1e-15.

So that gives approximately 4.067e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, option C is 5.02e-15.

So our calculation is around 4.067e-15, which is closest to option B.

Wait a minute, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might have messed up with the units.

Wait, the calculation for tau: tau = ħ / Γ.

ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Γ is 0.32 GeV. So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

Then, gamma * beta is 6.666... * 0.9887 ≈ 6.592.

So L = gamma * beta * c * tau = 6.592 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16.

Then multiply by 6.592: 6.170625e-16 * 6.592 ≈ ?

Compute 6.170625 *6.592:

6 * 6=36, 6*0.592=3.552, 0.170625 *6=1.02375, 0.170625 *0.592≈0.1008.

Wait, perhaps better to multiply 6.170625 *6.592.

6 *6.170625 = 37.02375.

0.5 *6.170625=3.0853125.

0.092 *6.170625 ≈ 0.567 (approx 6.170625 * 0.09 is 0.555356, 0.002 is 0.01234, total ~0.5677).

Wait, actually, 6.170625 * 6.592 = ?

Let me compute 6.170625 *6 = 37.02375.

6.170625 *0.5 =3.0853125.

6.170625 *0.092= ?

0.09 *6.170625=0.555356, 0.002 *6.170625=0.01234125. So total 0.567697.

So adding all parts: 37.02375 +3.0853125=40.1090625, plus 0.567697=40.67676.

So approximately 40.67676e-16 meters, which is 4.067676e-15 meters.

So L ≈4.0677e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. Hmm, very close to our result. So I think option B is the correct answer.

Wait, but let me think again about the calculation steps. Did I make a mistake in any step?

Alternative approach: Let's compute more accurately.

Compute gamma: 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 20/3 ≈6.66666667.

Beta: sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))) = sqrt(1 - (9/400)) = sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.9887.

Gamma * beta = 6.66666667 * 0.9887 ≈6.592.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, 6.66666667 * 0.9887.

Let me compute 6.66666667 * 0.9887.

Compute 6 *0.9887=5.9322.

0.66666667 *0.9887≈approx 0.66666667 *1=0.66666667, but minus 0.66666667 *0.0113= approx 0.007533.

So 0.66666667 -0.007533 ≈0.65913.

So total beta*gamma is 5.9322 +0.65913 =6.59133.

So 6.59133.

Then, tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 2.056875e-24 s.

So now, L = gamma*beta * c * tau.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So gamma*beta * c = 6.59133 *3e8 = 1.9774e9 m/s.

Multiply by tau: 1.9774e9 * 2.056875e-24 s.

So 1.9774e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.9774 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.

Compute 1.9774 * 2.056875.

Let me compute 2 *2.056875= 4.11375.

But 1.9774 is 0.0226 less than 2.

So (2 -0.0226) * 2.056875 = 4.11375 - (0.0226 * 2.056875).

0.0226 *2.056875≈ 0.0466.

So 4.11375-0.0466≈4.06715.

So 4.06715e-15 meters.

Which is approximately 4.067e-15 m.

The options are:

A) 5.0223e-16
B)4.0655e-15
C)5.0223e-15
D)4.0655e-16

So our calculation is about 4.067e-15, which is very close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15. The slight discrepancy might be due to more precise calculation of beta or gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute beta more accurately.

Compute beta again:

gamma = 20/3 ≈6.666666667.

gamma squared is (400/9) ≈44.44444444.

1/gamma squared is 9/400=0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225=0.9775.

Square root of 0.9775.

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775).

Let me compute 0.988^2 = (0.98 +0.008)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.008 +0.008^2 = 0.9604 + 0.01568 + 0.000064 = 0.976144.

Wait, 0.988^2 is 0.976144, which is less than 0.9775.

Next, 0.9887^2.

Let me compute 0.9887 *0.9887.

0.98 *0.98 = 0.9604.

0.98 *0.0087 = 0.008526.

0.0087 *0.98 = 0.008526.

0.0087 *0.0087 = about 0.00007569.

So (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.9604 + 2*(0.008526) + 0.00007569.

= 0.9604 + 0.017052 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.97752769.

Which is approximately 0.97753, very close to 0.9775. So beta is approximately 0.9887.

So our calculation of beta is correct to four decimal places.

So beta is approximately 0.9887.

So gamma * beta is 6.66666667 *0.9887 ≈6.592.

Wait, perhaps the exact value is 6.66666667 multiplied by 0.9887.

Let me compute 6.66666667 * 0.9887.

Let me compute 6 *0.9887=5.9322.

0.66666667 *0.9887= 666666.67 * 0.9887 / 1e6.

Wait, 0.66666667 * 0.9887 = (2/3) *0.9887.

Which is approximately 0.6591333.

So 5.9322 + 0.6591333 ≈6.5913333.

So gamma * beta = approx 6.5913333.

So the mean decay length is 6.5913333 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Which is 6.5913333 *3e8=1.9774e9 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s: 1.9774e9 *2.056875e-24 = (1.9774 *2.056875) *1e-15.

Compute 1.9774 *2.056875.

Let me compute 2 *2.056875=4.11375.

But 1.9774 is 0.0226 less than 2.

So 0.0226 *2.056875 = approximately 0.0466.

So subtract that from 4.11375 →4.11375 -0.0466=4.06715.

So 4.06715e-15 meters.

But option B is 4.0655e-15, so maybe more precise calculations would adjust it a bit.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma*beta more precisely.

Gamma = 8 /1.2 =6.666666666666667.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).

Wait, since E = gamma m c², so beta = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)) ) = sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E² *c^0) ), but since we're in units where c=1, it's sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2).

So let me compute (m/E)^2. m=1.2 GeV, E=8 GeV.

(1.2/8)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225.

So 1 -0.0225=0.9775.

Square root: 0.9887.

So beta is 0.9887.

So gamma * beta = 6.666666667 *0.9887 = let me compute this more accurately.

6.666666667 *0.9887.

Let me compute 6.666666667 *0.9887.

Split into 6 *0.9887 =5.9322.

0.666666667 *0.9887 = approx 0.6591333.

So 5.9322 +0.6591333=6.5913333.

So, 6.5913333.

Now, 6.5913333 *3e8 m/s = 1.9774e9 m/s.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So, 1.9774e9 m/s *2.056875e-24 s = 1.9774 *2.056875 *1e-15 m.

Compute 1.9774 *2.056875.

Let me compute it more accurately.

Let me write 2.056875 as 2 + 0.056875.

So 1.9774 *2 =3.9548.

1.9774 *0.056875 = Let's compute 0.05*1.9774 =0.09887.

0.006875 *1.9774 = let's see, 0.006 *1.9774=0.0118644, 0.000875 *1.9774≈0.001734.

So 0.0118644 +0.001734 =0.0135984.

So total for 0.056875: 0.09887 +0.0135984 ≈0.1124684.

So 1.9774 *2.056875 =3.9548 +0.1124684=4.0672684.

So 4.0672684e-15 m.

So approximately 4.0673e-15 m.

The options are B)4.0655e-15 and C)5.0223e-15.

Hmm, why is there a slight discrepancy between our calculation and option B?

Wait, maybe the natural value of ħ is 197.33 MeV·fm, but perhaps I should use a different unit for ħ.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate tau using ħ in different units. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in using ħ correctly. Let me check.

The formula tau = ħ / Γ.

But ħ in units of GeV·s is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s ≈2.056875e-24 seconds.

That's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Yes, that's correct.

So, perhaps the calculation is accurate, and the correct answer is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using more precise values for gamma and beta.

Wait, gamma is exactly 20/3, which is 6.666666666666667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2 ) = sqrt(1 -0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.9887.

But perhaps a more precise value of beta would change the result a little.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial units were in different terms. For example, perhaps the calculation should use units where ħc is used instead of ħ.

Wait, decay length is often calculated using ħ c / (Γ c^2), which is ħ/(Γ c). Hmm, perhaps I need to re-express some terms.

Wait, the lifetime is tau = ħ/(Γ), since Γ is the decay width, which has units of energy.

But when calculating the decay length, L = v * tau.

Wait, v is beta c.

So tau is in seconds, v
