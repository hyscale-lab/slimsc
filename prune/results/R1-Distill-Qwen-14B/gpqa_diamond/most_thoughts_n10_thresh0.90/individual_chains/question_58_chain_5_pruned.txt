Okay, so I have this physics question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's read it again. The question is about which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, like infinities that pop up in calculations. These divergences can cause problems, so regularization helps make the math work by introducing a temporary cutoff, like a maximum energy scale or short distance cutoff, which is then removed after renormalization.

Wait, but wait, which theories actually need this? Let me think.

Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a quantum field theory. I think it's a renormalizable theory. So it requires renormalization, which implies that it must handle divergences, so they must use regularization, right. So QED would require regularization steps. So option C is probably not the correct answer because it does require it.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), that's the theory of the strong force. It's also a quantum field theory and similarly renormalizable. Wait, but QCD has something called asymptotic freedom, which means that at high energies (or equivalently, at short distances), the coupling becomes weak. But when doing calculations, you still get divergences, so regularization is needed. So option B requires regularization as well.

Superstring Theory... Hmm. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. From what I remember, string theory is a theory of quantum gravity, right? And it's supposed to be a background-independent theory. Also, string theories don't have point particles, so maybe they don't have the same kind of divergences as QFTs. Wait, but in string theory, when you compute loop diagrams, especially at high energies, do you get divergences? Or does the theory handle things differently?

Wait, in string theory, the interactions are different. Instead of particles, you have strings, and the interactions are more smooth. I think that in string theory, the perturbative expansions have a better behaved structure. String theories often avoid the usual divergences that QFTs have because the string framework handles high energies better. Or wait, maybe they don't require regularization because they don't have the same kind of divergences. Superstring Theory is an example where perhaps divergences are less of a problem or absent. So maybe A is the correct answer.

But wait, what about Classical Electrodynamics? That's option D. Classical theories don't have quantum divergences because they don't involve the same kind of integrals that lead to infinities. In classical E&M, you can have issues like the infinite charge density at a point charge, but these are more about mathematical singularities rather than physical divergences needing regularization. So in the context of regularization, which is a quantum field theory technique, classical theories don't require it. So option D, Classical Electrodynamics, never requires regularization because it's not a quantum theory.

Wait, but the question is about which theory never requires regularization at high energies. So the question is about regularization as part of the physical theory's calculations.

So thinking again: QED and QCD are quantum theories where regularization is needed. Superstring Theory is a quantum theory but perhaps doesn't require regularization. Or maybe it does, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the correct answer could be D, because it's a classical theory and doesn't use regularization at all.

Wait, but the question is about which theory "never requires regularization at high energies." So which of these theories doesn't need regularization? Since regularization is a quantum field theory technique, a classical theory wouldn't require it. So option D, Classical Electrodynamics, doesn't need regularization because it's not a quantum theory. So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but the options are A through D, and the question is about which doesn't require regularization. So since D is classical, and regularization is a QFT thing, it's the one that doesn't need it.

Alternatively, someone might confuse superstring theory. But I think superstring theory is a quantum theory, so it would
