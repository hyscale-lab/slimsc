Alright, let's tackle this physics problem. Okay, so I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says we have 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times 1.6 x 10^-19 coulombs. But wait, let me write that down: 2e = 2 * 1.6e-19 C = 3.2e-19 C.

Now, the setup: the system is isolated. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, point P has the 13th charge, and the other 12 are each located 2 meters away from P. Hmm, all 12 are at the same distance from P. So the configuration is like a sphere with 12 charges on its surface, each at radius 2 m, and the 13th at the center.

The question asks for the minimum energy of the system. Oh wait, minimum energy. Systems tend to have their potential energy minimized when the charges are arranged in a way that the potential energy is as low as possible. But wait, since all the 12 charges are at 2 meters from P, and the 13th is fixed at P, perhaps the potential energy is due to the interactions between the 12 charges and the 13th, and also between the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, no. The 13th charge is fixed at P, so the other 12 are each 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from the fixed charge. But what about the interactions between the 12 charges themselves? Because each of the 12 is at 2 meters from P, but their separation from each other depends on the arrangement. If they're on a sphere, their mutual distances would be greater than 2 meters apart, but I'm not sure exactly how that plays in.

But wait, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So their positions are fixed in a sphere of radius 2 m around P. So each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 m from P, but their mutual distances vary. However, since the problem is about the minimum energy
