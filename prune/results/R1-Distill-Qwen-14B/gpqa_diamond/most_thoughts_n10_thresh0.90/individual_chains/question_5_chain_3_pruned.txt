Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Hmm, it's about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Let me break this down.

First, I remember that the operator P is a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is given in terms of 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. The direction n is in the x-z plane, so the direction vector can be represented in spherical coordinates as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), since it's in the x-z plane, φ would be 0 or π, but I think for an arbitrary direction in x-z, φ is 0. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the direction n is arbitrary but in the x-z plane, so it can have any angle θ from the z-axis, but φ would be 0 because it's in the x-z plane. Or wait, maybe not. Wait, no, φ is the azimuthal angle, which is the angle around the z-axis. So if the direction is in x-z, then φ can be 0 or π, but maybe the problem allows for any direction in x-z, so φ can be any angle, but in the x-z plane, the polar angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and the azimuthal angle φ is 0 or π. Wait, no, actually, the direction in x-z plane would have φ=0 or φ=π, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the direction is given by some general θ and φ, but since it's in the x-z plane, φ is 0 or π, so maybe the general eigenvalue equation can be expressed in terms of θ.

Wait, the problem states that the direction n is in the x-z plane. So the unit vector n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because in spherical coordinates, x = sinθ cosφ, y=sinθ sinφ, z=cosθ. But since it's in the x-z plane, φ=0, so x = sinθ, y=0, z=cosθ. So n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

The operator P is a vector operator, so the operator along direction n would be P · n = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ. Because n is a unit vector, so the operator is the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding direction cosine. So P_n = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

Wait, but the problem says the operator is P along an arbitrary direction n in x-z plane. So I think I need to find the matrix representation of this operator P_n, then find its eigenvector with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So first, let's write down the matrices for each component.

Given:
P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So the operator
