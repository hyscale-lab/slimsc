Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, the molecular formula might give me some clues about the structure. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18-10)/2= 8/2=4. So 4 degrees of unsaturation. That could mean like a ring plus some double bonds or something like that.

The NMR data is given. Let me look at that. The 1H-NMR shows peaks at:

9.72 ppm as a triplet (t, 1H). High upfield? That's probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm as sharp singlets or triplets if coupled with something else.

Then, 6.98 ppm as a doublet (d, 2H). That sounds like aromatic protons, maybe on a benzene ring. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. Then 6.51 ppm as another doublet (d, 2H), which is also aromatic. So perhaps a para-substituted benzene ring? Because in para substitution, the two protons are equivalent and each is split into a doublet. Wait, or maybe it's two different rings? Or maybe an ortho coupling.

Next, 6.27 ppm as a broad singlet (bs, 2H). Broad suggests maybe exchange, like an -OH group, but wait, that's 2H. Hmm, maybe two protons in a conjugated system, like in a conjugated diene or maybe some vinyl protons. Or maybe it's an enol form, but I'm not sure.

Then 3.66 ppm as a doublet (d, 2H). That's around where methylene groups adjacent to oxygen atoms appear, like in ethers or esters. So maybe a CH2-O group.

Looking at the peaks, the aldehyde at 9.72, so the compound probably has an aldehyde group. The aromatic protons suggest maybe two benzene rings attached. The 6.98 and 6.51 could be from two different aromatic rings. Wait, but each is a doublet. Alternatively, perhaps they are part of a single ring. Let me think: if it's a para-substituted benzene, the two protons would be equivalent and as a doublet each. But maybe each is a doublet because of coupling with another ring's protons. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another thought: sometimes when you have two substituents on a benzene ring, like if it's a para-substituted ring with another substituent, the coupling can lead to doublets. But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's see: if there's an aldehyde group (CHO), which is O, then the rest would be C7H8N. Wait, no: C8H9NO, so 8 carbons. Let's see, maybe a benzaldehyde derivative with substituents.

Wait, the NMR shows two sets of aromatic protons. Maybe the compound has two benzene rings attached, each with substituents. Alternatively, perhaps a single benzene ring with substituents. Let me try to think.

Wait, another approach: The reagents used are NaNO2 and HCl, followed by H2O, then aqueous KOH and heat. NaNO2 and HCl are typically for diazotization. So the starting compound probably has an aromatic amine group, which is converted into a diazonium salt. Then, when treated with water (probably a hydrolysis step), maybe the diazonium salt is hydrolyzed. And then KOH and heat might be for elimination or some kind of condensation.

Wait, but the starting compound has the formula C8H9NO. So, if it's an aromatic amine, the structure would have a benzene ring and an -NH2 group. But wait, the molecular formula includes N and O. Let's see: if the structure is something like a benzaldehyde with an amino group attached, maybe. Or perhaps a nitro group? Wait, but the NMR doesn't show a nitro proton, so probably it's an amine.

Wait, but the starting compound's NMR shows an aldehyde (9.72), so maybe it's a benzaldehyde derivative with an amino group as a substituent. So perhaps it's something like 4-aminobenzaldehyde, but with more substituents. Alternatively, considering the molecular formula, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene with an aldehyde and an amino group.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the atoms. If the molecule has a benzene ring (6 carbons), then the remaining two carbons would be in a substituent. The substituents could be CHO (aldehyde) and another group that includes N and O.

Wait, but the aldehyde is CHO (1 C), and then the other substituent would have to be another group. Let's see, perhaps a CH2O group. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows a triplet at 9.72 ppm, which is the aldehyde proton. So perhaps the aldehyde is adjacent to another proton, which causes the coupling. So maybe it's an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde? Like CH2=CHCHO? No, but that would have more protons. Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is part of a conjugated system.

Wait, the peak at 6.27 is a broad singlet of 2H. Maybe those are enol protons or maybe part of a conjugated diene. Alternatively, perhaps they are the protons on a vicinal diol, but that's a bit of a stretch.

Another thought: the triplet at 9.72 could be an aldehyde adjacent to a CH2 group. So perhaps the structure is something like CH2CHO attached to a benzene ring, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the reaction steps. The first reagent is NaNO2 and HCl. That's the typical conditions for diazotization, which converts an aromatic amine into a diazonium chloride. Then, step 2 is H2O. Diazonium salts in water typically undergo hydrolysis. For example, if it's an aryl diazonium salt, hydrolysis can give a phenol. But wait, that's typically when the diazonium salt is treated with something like H2O under acidic conditions, like H2SO4. Alternatively, maybe the diazonium salt is treated with water to form a phenol.

Then, the third step is aq. KOH and heat. That's a strong base and heat, which could lead to elimination reactions, like the formation of a double bond via E2 mechanism, or maybe some kind of aldol condensation.

But
