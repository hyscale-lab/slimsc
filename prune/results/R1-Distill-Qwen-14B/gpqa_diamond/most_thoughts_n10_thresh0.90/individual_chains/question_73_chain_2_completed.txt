Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. So, the question is about two astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds, and I have to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, okay.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So, they're moving in the same direction, I guess. The options given are A to D, each giving a relative speed and total energy.

Wait, the question is about relative speed and total energy. So, I think I need to calculate two things: the relative velocity between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system, which would be the sum of their relativistic energies.

Let me break this down. First, the relative speed. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed isn't just 0.6c minus 0.5c, right? Because in relativity, you can't just subtract velocities like that. Oh yeah, that's the velocity addition formula in special relativity. The formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)).

Wait, wait. Wait, which one is moving faster? The first astronaut has a speed of 0.6c, and the second has 0.5c. So from the perspective of the second astronaut, the first is moving at 0.1c. But wait, no, because in relativity, you can't just subtract. So let's apply the formula correctly.

Wait, no, the formula is when you have two frames moving relative to each other. So, if someone is moving at speed u in one frame, what's their speed in a frame moving at speed v relative to the first? So in this case, the second astronaut is moving at 0.5c relative to the first astronaut? No, wait. Let's think.

Wait, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c in the lab frame. The second is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So, from the perspective of the first astronaut, what is the speed of the second astronaut?

So, for this, I think I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let me write it down. So, the formula is u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u*v)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of the object in the lab frame (the second astronaut's speed, 0.5c), and v is the velocity of the moving frame (the first astronaut's speed, 0.6c). Wait no, wait: when you're in the frame of the first astronaut, the lab is moving at -0.6c. So, the second astronaut's speed in that frame would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²). Let me compute that.

So, the numerator is (0.5c - 0.6c) = -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So, u' = (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.14286c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14286c, which is about 0.14c, but it's a negative value, meaning it's moving in the opposite direction as the first astronaut's frame. But since the question probably just wants the magnitude, the relative speed is about 0.14c. Looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c. So that's one part done.

Wait, but the sign indicates direction. But the problem asks for relative speed, which is a scalar, so the magnitude is what's important. So, 0.14c, which matches options C and D.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. The system consists of both astronauts. Each has relativistic kinetic energy, but wait, the total energy is the sum of their rest energy plus kinetic energy? Or is it their relativistic energies.

Wait, the total energy of each astronaut is their rest mass energy multiplied by gamma. So each astronaut's total energy is gamma * m c². Since the problem states their masses as 2m and 3m, I need to compute gamma for each and then sum the energies.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So let's compute each astronaut's gamma.

First astronaut: v = 0.6c.

Gamma_1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So, energy E1 = gamma_1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: v = 0.5c.

Gamma_2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So, E2 = gamma_2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c².

Looking back at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option D says E=5 mc². So 5.96 is option C.

So the relative speed is 0.14c and the total energy is 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C matches both.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system of two astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between the two astronauts is determined using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( u = 0.5c \) (speed of the second astronaut in the lab frame),
- \( v = 0.6c \) (speed of the first astronaut in the lab frame).

Substituting the values:
\[
u' = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.14286c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, but since the question asks for the relative speed (a scalar), the magnitude is \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy of each astronaut is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \).

#### First Astronaut:
- Mass = \( 2m \),
- Speed = \( 0.6c \).

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m c^2) = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Second Astronaut:
- Mass = \( 3m \),
- Speed = \( 0.5c \).

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m c^2) \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
