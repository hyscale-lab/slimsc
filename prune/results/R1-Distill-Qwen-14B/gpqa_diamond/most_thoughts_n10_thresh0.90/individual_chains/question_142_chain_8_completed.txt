Okay, so I have this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Right, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. So this must be some kind of mixed state because the trace is 1, right? Let me check: each |0><0| and |1><1| are projectors, each with trace 1. So adding them gives trace 2, multiplied by 1/2, the trace is 1. Yep, that's correct.

Wait, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm, I think qubits are two-level systems, so in a two-dimensional Hilbert space. But how does the density matrix relate to this geometry? Oh wait, maybe it's about the Bloch sphere representation. Because pure states are on the Bloch sphere, and mixed states are inside it.

So to find where this ρ is located on the Bloch sphere, I need to express it in terms of the Pauli matrices. Because the density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where I is the identity matrix, σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (like coordinates) that determines the state's position on the Bloch sphere.

Let me recall the standard form. The density matrix for a qubit can be written as:

ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2.

Wait, no, more accurately, it's ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector (r_x, r_y, r_z) and σ are the Pauli matrices. So the density matrix is expressed in terms of this vector r.

So, let's compute each term. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute |0><0| and |1><1|.

|0><0| is the matrix [[1, 0], [0, 0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ is (I)/2.

Wait wait, because (|0><0| + |1><1|) is I, so ρ = I/2. So the density matrix is I/2.

Now, let's express I/2 in terms of (I + r·σ)/2. So, I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2 implies that (I) = I + r·σ. Oh wait no, wait:

I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2 → Multiply both sides by 2: I = I + r·σ → Subtract I: 0 = r·σ.

So r·σ must be the zero matrix. Let me think about what that means for the vector r. The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So, r·σ would be r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z.

If r·σ = 0, then each coefficient must be zero because the Pauli matrices are linearly independent. So r_x = r_y = r_z = 0.

So the vector r is (0,0,0). That would place the density matrix at the origin in the Bloch sphere. But wait, the origin is the completely mixed state for a qubit. Because any state with r=0 is the maximally mixed state.

So, looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). Option B is (0,0,1), which would be the state |0> if I'm not mistaken. Option A is (1,1,0), which doesn't seem familiar. Option D is (1,1,1), which might be a point on the sphere but not sure.

Wait, let me confirm. The density matrix I/2 is the maximally mixed state. For a qubit, that's represented by the point at the center of the Bloch sphere, which is the origin, (0,0,0). So yes, the correct answer must be option C.


The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. For a single qubit, the density matrix can generally be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is a vector determining the position of the state on the Bloch sphere, and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given density matrix, we see that:

\[
\frac{I}{2} = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2}.
\]

This implies:

\[
I = I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}.
\]

Subtracting \(I\) from both sides gives:

\[
\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0.
\]

Since the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, the only solution is:

\[
\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0).
\]

This means the density matrix corresponds to the maximally mixed state, which is represented by the origin in the Bloch sphere. Among the given options, the correct geometrical position is:

**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).**

Answer: C
