Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator is given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0).

Hmm, I remember that the angular momentum operators in quantum mechanics are related to the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, S is probably a Pauli matrix. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Let me think about each one. The σy matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Oh yeah, that's exactly S here. So S is the σy Pauli matrix.

The operator Ay is given by c multiplied by σy. The constant c is h/(4π). Wait, the Pauli matrices are usually 2x2, so S is 2x2 here, like the problem states.

So, to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, I need to solve the equation Ay φ = a φ. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, I can set up the characteristic equation.

First, let's write down the matrix Ay. Since S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], multiplying by c gives Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So,

Ay = [[0, -i*(h/(4π))],
      [i*(h/(4π)), 0]]

To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

Let me compute the matrix (Ay - a I):

[[ -a,  -i*(h/(4π)) ],
 [ i*(h/(4π)), -a ] ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [(-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π))] = a² - [ (-i)(i) (h/(4π))^2 ]

Wait, (-i)*(i) is (-i^2) which is -(-1) = 1. Because i² is -1, so (-i)(i) = -i² = 1.

So determinant is a² - [ (1) * (h²/(16 π²)) ) ] = 0.

So equation is a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0 → a² = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4 π).

Wait, but wait a second. The eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1. Let me see, because for σy, the eigenvalues are ±1. So when you multiply by c, the eigenvalues become c*(±1). So in this case, c is h/(4π), so eigenvalues would be ±h/(4π). But wait, looking at the options, some of them have different values. Let me check.

Option A: imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts are ±h/(4π). Hmm, that doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator should be real. Because angular momentum operators are Hermitian, right? So their eigenvalues should be real. So if the eigenvalues have imaginary parts, that would mean the operator isn't Hermitian, but I think Ay should be Hermitian.

Wait, let me verify. S is σy, which is Hermitian because the Pauli matrices are Hermitian. c is a real constant. So Ay = c S should also be Hermitian. So eigenvalues should be real. So any option that suggests eigenvalues with non-zero imaginary parts must be incorrect.

Looking at the options, option A has imaginary parts, which can't be right. Option B: eigenvalues with real parts ±1 and imaginary parts ±1/2. That also has imaginary parts, so no. Option C and D: C talks about eigenfunctions and whether they are eigenfunctions of other operators, D about the basis functions.

So the eigenvalues of Ay are ±h/(4π). So which options don't have imaginary parts? Options C and D.

Now, looking at the options. Let's reevaluate.

The eigenvalues are real, so A and B are incorrect. So the correct statement must be either C or D.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

Wait, A is the total angular momentum. So A² is a Casimir operator, and its eigenfunctions are the same as those of the total angular momentum. For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenfunctions of A² are the same as those of any component, because A² is diagonal in any direction's eigenbasis. Wait, no. Wait, A² is S·S where S is spin. For a spin-1/2 particle, S^2 has eigenvalue (1/2)(1/2+1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ². Oh, but in this case, the operator is in terms of h.

Wait, in the problem statement, A is the intrinsic angular momentum operator. So for a muon, which is a lepton, spin 1/2. So A² would have eigenvalue (ħ²) * (1/2)(1/2 +1) ) = (3/4) ħ^2.

Wait, but in our problem, the operator Ay is (c S), and c is h/(4π). Let me compute c in terms of ħ. Because ħ = h/(2π). So h = 2π ħ. Then c = (2π ħ) / (4π) ) = ħ/(2). So c = ħ/2.

Wait, so Ay = (ħ/2) S_y. So the eigenvalues of Ay would be (ħ/2) * (±1) → ± ħ/2.

Wait, let me confirm. The eigenvalues of S_y are ±1 (since S_y is a Pauli matrix, which has eigenvalues ±1). So Ay's eigenvalues are (h/(4π)) * (±1) → ± h/(4π). Wait, but earlier I thought h/(4π) equals ħ/(2) because ħ is h/(2π). So yes, h/(4π) is ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

Wait, but the question states that the eigenvalue a is the eigenvalue of Ay. So the eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ, so a is ± ħ/2.

Wait, but let me think about the options. The possible correct statements.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Is that true?

In quantum mechanics, for spin systems, the eigenfunctions of any component (like Sx, Sy, Sz) form a basis, but the eigenfunctions of S² and Sz are the same. Because S² commutes with Sz. Similarly, for any component, the eigenfunctions of S² are the same as those of S² and any other component? Wait, no.

Wait, the eigenfunctions of A² (which is S²) and any component (e.g., Sz) are the same because S² and Sz commute. So if a state is an eigenstate of Sz, it's also an eigenstate of S². Similarly, if a state is an eigenstate of Sy, it's not necessarily an eigenstate of S². Wait, no. Because S² commutes with all components, so any eigenstate of S² is a linear combination of eigenstates of any component. But an eigenstate of a component (like Sy) might not be an eigenstate of S².

Wait, actually, S² is the Casimir operator, which commutes with all the components. So the eigenfunctions of S² are the same as the eigenfunctions of any component, but only in the sense that you can have simultaneous eigenfunctions for S² and another component. Wait, no, S² and Sx don't commute with each other, so you can't have eigenstates of S² and Sx that are the same. So an eigenstate of Sx is not an eigenstate of S² unless it's a simultaneous eigenstate, which is possible only if the state is an eigenstate of S² and Sx, but that's not generally the case.

Wait, but for spin-1/2, the eigenstates of S_x are superpositions of the eigenstates of S_z. So the eigenstates of S² (which for spin 1/2 is 3ħ²/4) are the same as any direction's eigenstates? No, because S² is the same in all directions. So S² is spin magnitude squared, and its eigenvalues are the same regardless of the direction. The eigenfunctions of S² are not the same as those of Sx or Sy, but rather, any spin state can be expressed as a combination of eigenstates of S² and any component.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think: For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenstates of S² are the same as the eigenstates of any component, because S² is a multiple of the identity matrix? No, wait, S² is not the identity matrix. S² is (Sx² + Sy² + Sz²). For a spin-1/2 particle, S² has eigenvalue (3/4) ħ². So S² is a multiple of the identity matrix: (3/4 ħ²) I. So any state is an eigenstate of S² with eigenvalue 3ħ²/4. So in that case, any state is also an eigenstate of S². So the eigenfunctions of Ay (which is S_y) would also be eigenfunctions of S² because S² is a multiple of the identity matrix.

Wait, that can't be right because S² is not the identity matrix. Wait, no, the identity matrix would have eigenvalue 1 for all states, but S² is a multiple of the identity. For spin-1/2:

S² = (Sx² + Sy² + Sz²) = ( (σ_x ħ/2 )² + ... ) = ( (σ_x)^2 + σ_y^2 + σ_z^2 ) (ħ²/4 )

Each Pauli matrix squared is I, so σ_x² = I, same for y and z. So S² = (I + I + I) * ħ²/4 = 3I ħ²/4.

Ah, so S² is (3ħ²/4) I. So any state is an eigenstate of S² with eigenvalue 3ħ²/4. So if a state is an eigenstate of Ay (which is (ħ/2) Sy), then it's also an eigenstate of S² because S² is a multiple of the identity. Because any vector multiplied by the identity gives the same vector scaled.

Wait, so if that's the case, then the eigenfunctions of Ay (which are eigenfunctions of Sy) are also eigenfunctions of S². So the statement in option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A², which is S². So then if this is true, option C is incorrect because they can also be eigenfunctions of A². But option C says "can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az." Wait, but if the state is an eigenstate of Sy, is it also an eigenstate of Sz (Az)? No, because they are different components and don't commute. So the eigenfunctions of Ay (Sy) are not eigenfunctions of Az (Sz), so option C's statement is correct in that part. But the first part says they can also be eigenfunctions of A². But since A² is (3ħ²/4) I, any state is an eigenstate of A², so the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². So option C's statement is incorrect because the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² and not of Az.

Wait, no. Let me see, option C says "can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az." So the first part is correct because any state is an eigenfunction of A². But the second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. That is correct because Sy and Sz don't commute, so a state can't be eigenfunction of both.

So the statement in option C is correct. So option C is correct.

Alternatively, option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Well, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis for the vector space, which is two-dimensional since it's a 2x2 matrix. So any vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the eigenvectors. So the statement in D is true. Because the matrix Ay is 2x2, its eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question says which statement is correct during the calculation. So let's think again.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

This seems to be correct because the eigenvectors of Ay form a basis for the space. So the statement in D is correct.

Wait, but let me reevaluate the options. The question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Option D seems to be a correct statement about the eigenvectors. So which of the options is correct.

Alternatively, Option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az.

But since A² is a multiple of I, any eigenstate is also an eigenstate of A². So eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², which is correct. So the first part of option C is correct, and the second part is correct as well, so option C is a correct statement.

Wait, but looking back, the answer can only be one option. So let me recheck the options.

Option C: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

Since A² is (3ħ²/4) I, any state is an eigenstate of A². So if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it's automatically an eigenstate of A². So the first part of C is correct. And since Ay and Az don't commute, the eigenstates of Ay are not eigenstates of Az. So the statement in C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Ay is a 2x2 matrix, so the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, so D is correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

So both C and D could be correct statements. But the options can only have one correct answer, so perhaps I need to examine more carefully.

Wait, the question is which statement will I consider to be correct during the calculation. So perhaps during the calculation, which of the statements is necessarily true.

Let me think about each option again.

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real ±h/(4π). No, because eigenvalues are real, so this is wrong.

Option B: Same issue; eigenvalues have imaginary parts, which can't be right. So B is wrong.

Option C: Correct because eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². Because A² is identity scaled, so any state is an eigenstate. So yes, option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Since Ay is 2x2, the eigenvectors form a basis, so yes, D is correct.

But wait, the question is about what is correct during the calculation. So if
