Okay, so I've got this problem here about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this transit happening depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight.

The question says that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have the same mass, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period—three times shorter than Planet_2. Both have circular orbits, which might simplify some calculations.

The host stars are interesting. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, that's a bit confusing. I thought more massive stars are usually larger, but maybe Planet_1's star is more evolved? No, the note says the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, so Planet_1's star is more massive but same radius. Maybe they're in different evolutionary stages, but that might not affect the transit probability.

So what affects the transit probability? I think the key factors are the orbital period, the size of the star, and the size of the planet. Wait, but in this case, the planets have the same mass, but mass doesn't directly translate to radius. Oh, but wait, the question says they're Earth-like, so maybe I can assume their radii are similar to Earth's. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps the planet size isn't varying here; maybe it's the same for both. Hmm, but the problem doesn't state that.

Wait, the transit probability (P) is given by some formula. I think the formula is P = (R_star / a) * (something else?), where a is the semi-major axis. Oh wait, the formula I remember is P = (R* / a) * (sqrt(1 - e²)) / (1 - e), but since both orbits are circular, e is zero, so the probability simplifies to P = R_star / a.

Wait, no, I'm mixing things up. The transit probability is the area of the star as seen from Earth divided by the area of the planet's orbital plane. More accurately, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a) multiplied by something else. Wait, let me think again. The probability that the planet's orbit intersects our line of sight is
