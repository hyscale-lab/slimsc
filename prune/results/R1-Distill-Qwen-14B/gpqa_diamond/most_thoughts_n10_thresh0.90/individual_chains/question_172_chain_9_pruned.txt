Okay, so I've got this question about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when we talk about excitation, it's related to the energy levels of atoms. The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, but wait—twice as excited, does that mean the population of a higher energy level is twice as much? Or does it refer to the excitation energy per atom?

I think it's about the population. So, the number of iron atoms in that specific energy level is twice as high in star_1 compared to star_2. But wait, no, the question says the atoms themselves are twice as excited. I'm a bit confused here. Oh, wait, maybe it's the probability that an atom is in that excited state. So, the excitation is about the probability of being in a certain energy level.

I remember the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the population of different energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium. The formula is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Oh right, because higher energy levels have lower populations at lower temperatures.

In this case, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me note that down. So, the energy levels are E_high and E_low, and the difference is E_high - E_low = ΔE. So ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

The problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. I think that means the ratio of the excited state population to the ground state (or another lower state) is higher. Wait, but the question says "twice as excited in a specific energy level". So perhaps the population in a higher energy level (say level 2) compared to a lower level (level 1) is twice as high in star_1 as in star_2.

So, for star_1: n2/n1 = 2 * (n2/n1)_star_2.

Wait, maybe I should model it as the ratio of the excited level to the ground level. Let's say that in star_1, the ratio of (n2/n1) is twice that of star_2. So (n2/n1)_1 = 2 * (n2/n1)_2.

But wait, no. The question says that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps the excitation is directly proportional. So n2 for star_1 is twice n2 for star_2? Or maybe the ratio (n2/n1) for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Alternatively, maybe each atom is twice as excited on average. But that's less likely. I think the first approach is better: using the Boltzmann factor for the ratio of populations in two energy levels.

So, the Boltzmann equation is n_i / n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

Assuming that E_i is higher than E_j, so E_i = E_j + ΔE.

So, n_i/n_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

In this case, for star
