Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with electric potential energy problems. But let's take it step by step. 

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that, so 2e. Their masses are negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that; it's all about electric potential energy.

So the setup: 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I'm supposed to find the minimum energy of the system.

Hmm, wait, energy in an electric system usually refers to the electric potential energy. So I'm probably looking at calculating the potential energy between these charges.

Wait, but wait. The 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So the 12 charges are all at the same distance from the fixed charge. Oh wait, but also, the 12 charges are at 2 m from P, but how about their arrangement? Are the 12 arranged symmetrically, maybe on a sphere around P? Or are they all at the same point? Wait, the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 m from P. But the 13th is fixed at P.

But wait, potential energy in a system of charges. I remember that the electric potential energy of a system of point charges is the work required to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions, considering the potential due to all the other charges already placed.

But wait, in this case, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So when bringing in the other 12 charges, each will interact with the 13th, and with each other. But wait, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So perhaps their mutual distances are not specified, but I'm assuming that each is 2 m from P, but all at the same point? Or perhaps arranged in a way that their mutual distances are such that their configuration allows the system to have the minimal energy.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy. So maybe the 12 charges are arranged in a way that minimizes their mutual repulsion, but wait, they're all positive charges because each is 2e. So they repel each other.

Wait, but if all 12 are at the same point, that would be a configuration with the maximum potential energy, I think. Because bringing them close together would require more work, since they repel. So to minimize the potential energy, they'd be placed as far apart as possible, perhaps on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 m, each as far as they can be from each other. Wait, but the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, so maybe they're all on a sphere of radius 2 m, equally spaced.

Wait, but I'm not sure if their mutual arrangement affects the calculation. Because the problem might just be asking for the potential energy due to the interactions between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge at P. Or is it considering both the interactions between the 12 and the 13th, and also between the 12 themselves?

Hmm. Let me think. The potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies between all pairs. So for all the 12 charges, each has a charge of 2e, and the 13th is fixed at 2e as well.

Wait, each of the 12 charges is at 2 m from P (so the 13th). So each of the 12 charges is at distance r=2 m from the 13th.

So first, the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12. The formula for potential energy between two point charges is U = (k * q1
