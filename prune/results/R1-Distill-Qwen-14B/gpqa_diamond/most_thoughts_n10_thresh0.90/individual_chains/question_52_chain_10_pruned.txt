Okay, let's try to tackle this astronomy problem. Hmm, so the question is about stars with and without spots, and how that affects the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in two energy levels. I'm a bit rusty on my stellar atmospheres, but I'll think it through.

So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, no, wait—wait a second. Wait, when spots cover part of the surface, the total luminosity changes. But how does that affect the effective temperature?

Wait, no, the effective temperature is a measure of the star's luminosity and radius. Oh, right, the effective temperature is calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff⁴. So if the star's surface has spots that are cooler, the overall emitted flux would decrease, hence the Teff would go down. But in this question, the star's Teff decreases when spots are present. So the overall photospheric temperature is dropping.

But wait, the question says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So the star's average Teff is lower when spots are present. That makes sense because the spots are cooler, so the star's average emission is less, leading to a lower Teff.

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Oh right, in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the population of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations between two levels is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(kT) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

The problem states that when the star has spots, the photospheric effective temperature is lower (5500 K) compared to 6000 K without spots. But wait, the spots themselves are cooler regions. So the overall photosphere's average temperature is lower, but the spots have a much lower temperature, perhaps. But the question is about the photosphere as a whole. Or is it about the temperature at the point where the Ti atoms are emitting?

Wait, the problem says "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases," so the effective T is 5500 K when 40% is covered. So when spots are present, the photosphere's T is effectively lower. So when the star has spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K, and without spots, it's 6000 K.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because the spots are cooler, the average T of the whole star is lower when the spots are present. So when the star has spots, the photosphere’s average T is 5500 K. So when considering the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels, the temperature used in the Boltzmann equation is the effective temperature of the photosphere, right?

So the ratio R is (n2/n1) when T is 5500 K, and the original ratio R0 is (n2/n1) when T is 6000 K. The question says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So R_spot = (n2/n1)_5500 < (n2/n1)_6000 = R_no_spot. Therefore, the factor is R_no_spot / R_spot.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The ratio is n2/n1. So if the star has a higher T, then the ratio would be higher, because higher temperatures make higher energy levels more populated. So higher T → higher ratio. So when the star has spots, the T is lower, so the ratio n2/n1 is lower.

The problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when spots are present, the ratio is lower. So the ratio without spots is higher. Therefore, the factor by which the ratio changes (without spots compared to with spots) is R_no_spot / R_spot.

We need to compute this factor. So we can model the ratio as proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)), because the statistical weights g2/g1 are the same in both cases, so they'll cancel out when taking the ratio of the ratios.

So the ratio (n2/n1) is proportional to exp(- (E2-E1)/(k T)). Let's define ΔE = E2 - E1. Then, the ratio for no spots is R0 = exp(-ΔE/(k T0)), where T0 is 6000 K. For spots, R = exp(-ΔE/(k T_spot)), where T_spot is 5500 K.

Wait, but wait. Let me get the signs right. The Boltzmann factor is exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ), assuming E2 > E1. So if E2 > E1, then the higher the temperature, the more the ratio increases.

So, when T is higher, (E2-E1)/(k T) is smaller, so exp(-x) is larger. So without spots, T is higher, so R0 is higher than R.

So the factor is R0/R = [exp(-ΔE/(k T0))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T_spot))] = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T0) + ΔE/(k T_spot) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/T_spot - 1/T0 ] )

Hmm. Alternatively, since T_spot < T0, 1/T_spot > 1/T0, so the exponent is positive. Therefore, the ratio R0/R is greater than 1.

So we need to compute this factor. Let me plug in the numbers.

But wait, what's the energy difference ΔE corresponding to a transition at λ ≈ 1448 Å. That's in the near ultraviolet, I think. Let me calculate the energy of a photon with wavelength 1448 Å.

The energy E_photon = hc / λ. h is Planck's constant,
