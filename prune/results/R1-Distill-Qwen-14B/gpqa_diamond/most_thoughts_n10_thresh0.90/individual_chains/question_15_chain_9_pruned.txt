Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, right, the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. So, figuring out which planet has a higher probability of transiting is key here.

The question gives me two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same minimum mass, which I think is important because it tells us something about their size, right? But wait, same mass doesn't necessarily mean same radius because density matters too. Oh, but wait, the host stars' radii are the same, but their masses are different. Planet_1's host is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But the host stars have the same radius.

So, what factors determine the probability of a planet transiting? I remember that the probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the inclination of the orbit. Oh right, the formula for the transit probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 * (something about the orbital plane). Wait, no, more accurately, the transit probability P is given by (R_planet / a) * (1/(sqrt(1-e²))) ), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so it's just (R_planet / a). Or wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, another approach: the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits is (R_star + R_planet) / a. Or is it (R_planet / a)? No, wait, that's the approximate formula. The exact probability involves the impact parameter, but for a circular orbit, the maximum probability is (R_planet / a), but actually, the probability is proportional to (R_planet * R_star) / (a^2) multiplied by some factor. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, wait, no. The transit probability is given by the formula: P ≈ (R_p / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - b²))) ), where b is the impact parameter. But since we're considering the maximum probability scenario, which is when the orbit is edge-on, so the impact parameter b is zero, so the probability is highest when the planet's orbit is aligned. But wait, that's not quite right. The transit probability is actually a function of the orbital inclination. The probability that the inclination is such that the planet transits is given by (R_star + R_planet) / (a * sqrt(a² - (R_star + R_planet)^2))), but I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, I remember that the probability of a transit is approximately (R_p + R_star) / a, but in reality, it's (R_p / R_star) multiplied by (1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_star/a)^2))), but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think in terms of the formula from my notes.

Wait, another thought: The transit probability is proportional to (R_p / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_star / a)^2))) ), but wait no, perhaps that's not right. Alternatively, for a randomly
