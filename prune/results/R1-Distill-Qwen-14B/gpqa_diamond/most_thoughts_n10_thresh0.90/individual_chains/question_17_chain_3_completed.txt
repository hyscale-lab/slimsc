Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think through it. The question says that there's a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also give me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. And the pH is ideal, which I think probably means it's set so that EDTA is in its correct deprotonated form to form the complex properly. The temperature is 25°C, but I think that's just given as a condition and doesn't affect the calculation here.

Wait, I remember that EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is a chelating agent. It binds metal ions like Ca²+ to form a complex. The formation constant, K, tells us how strong the complex is. A higher K means the complex is more stable.

The problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution. So, when Ca²+ and EDTA combine, they form a complex, right? The complex here is CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA^4− ion.

The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 0.02 M. So, initially, I think the solution is made by dissolving the Ca-EDTA salt, which dissociates completely. So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M.

But wait, because the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−, which are present in a 1:1 ratio. So, the concentration of each would be 0.02 M if they were free, but in reality, some of them form the complex. Or wait, no. Wait, the complex is formed from the dissociation of CaY²−, which is 0.02 M. So, when it dissociates, each mole of CaY²− gives one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4−. But in reality, the formation of the complex goes both ways: Ca²+ and EDTA^4− can form the complex, but the K is so large that it's essentially all complex.

Wait no, wait. The formation constant K is for the reaction Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA²−. The K is given as 5e10, which is a large number, so the reaction favors the formation of the complex.

So, the solution starts with the complex at 0.02 M. So, let me set up an ICE table.

Wait, but the complex is dissociating into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. But because K is so large, the dissociation is minimal. So, the concentration of the complex is approximately 0.02 M, and the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4− are both approximately x, and their product is K.

Wait, no, the K expression is K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). So, the formation constant is K = [complex]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]).

But in the solution, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4− are both x, assuming that the dissociation is small. So, substituting into the equation:

K = (0.02) / (x * x) = 5e10.

So, 5e10 = 0.02 / x² → x² = 0.02 / 5e10 → x² = 2e-13 → x = sqrt(2e-13) → sqrt(2) is approx 1.414, so 1.414e-6.5, wait, let me compute it accurately.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So, 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5)e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. The square root of 4e-13 is 2e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. So, 2e-6.5 is the same as 2 * 1e-6.5, which is 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, that would make x ≈ 6.32e-7 M. So, the concentration of calcium ions is 6.3e-7 M, which would correspond to option C.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The setup is correct? Because the solution starts with the complex at 0.02 M, and dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−, each with concentration x. So, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4−] = x, and [complex] ≈ 0.02 (since dissociation is small). So, K = (0.02)/(x^2) = 5e10 → x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2 → 2e-2 / 5e10 = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 → 2e-6.5 is same as 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7. So, yes, option C is 6.3e-7, which matches.

Alternatively, another approach: the concentration of free Ca²+ is given by the dissociation of the complex. Since K is so large, almost all of the complex remains intact, so the amount of dissociated Ca²+ is small. So, the formula [Ca²+] = sqrt( ( [CaY²−] ) / K ) → because K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]). Since [Ca²+] = [Y^4−], it's sqrt( [CaY²−] / K ) → sqrt( 0.02 /5e10 ) → same calculation as before.

So, the answer should be option C, 6.3e-7 M.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of a Ca-EDTA complex (CaY²⁻) with a formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we use the relationship:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Since the dissociation of the complex is minimal due to the large \( K \), the concentrations of free \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \) ions are equal, denoted as \( x \). Substituting into the equation:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{x^2}
\]

Given \( [\text{CaY}^{2-}] = 0.02 \, \text{M} \) and \( K = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we solve for \( x \):

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
