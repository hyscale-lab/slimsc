Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the question involves a substance X that reacts with liquid Y violently, releasing gas W. The gas has the same number of neutrons and protons, which probably means it's either H2O or something similar, but wait, the molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Oh, wait, another thought: if a molecule has same number of protons and neutrons, maybe it's something like D2O, but no, D2O is deuterium oxide. Or perhaps it's another compound. Let me think.

The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius, which is just above 0 degrees. What substance has a melting point close to that? Maybe something like ammonium chloride? Or maybe something else. Wait, another thought: the melting point of ice is 273 K, which is 0 degrees Celsius. 277 K is a bit higher. Hmm, maybe B is something like water or another compound that has a melting point around there.

Then, there's a part about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. The product has 2 atoms of oxygen. So the product could be a molecule with two oxygen atoms, like maybe a carboxylic acid derivative? Wait, but let's think about what X might be.

The question also mentions that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X has an isotope with a higher mass. And X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Hmm, a common reagent used could be something like KMnO4, but wait, that's more of an oxidizing agent. Another possibility: perhaps it's something like sodium borohydride (NaBH4), which is a reducing agent. Oh wait, wait, another thought: maybe X is something like LiAlH4, which is a strong reducing agent used in organic reactions. Or perhaps it's a metal like lithium or magnesium. Alternatively, maybe it's a heavy water component, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's go back to the reaction. X reacts with Y violently to release gas W. Let's think about what kind of reactions are violent. Acid-base reactions can be violent, but maybe more likely, it's a reaction where a metal reacts with something like water. Oh, wait, for example, sodium reacting with water produces hydrogen gas, but that's a violent reaction. Similarly, potassium reacts violently with water.

So if X is a metal like Na or K, Y could be water. The reaction between Na and water is exothermic and produces H2 gas. Wait, in that case, the gas W would be H2. But H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons in each molecule. Wait, no: each H2 molecule has 2 H atoms, each with 1 proton and 1 neutron if it's deuterium. Wait, but in normal H2, each H is protium, so one proton, zero neutrons? No, wait
