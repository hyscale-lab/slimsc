Okay, so I have this astronomy problem to solve. Let me read through it again and try to figure out what's going on. 

The question is about a star with certain characteristics and how its properties change when it has spots. The main focus is on the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that the number of atoms in different energy levels relates to the Saha equation, which deals with ionization, but wait, this is about energy levels in neutral atoms, so maybe it's more about the Boltzmann equation.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation deals with the distribution of particles in different energy states. The equation is something like (n_i / n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this problem, when the star has spots, 40% of its surface is covered, and the Teff drops from 6000 K to 5500 K. The ratio of Ti atoms in two levels decreases when the star has spots. So when the star is spotless (T=6000 K), the ratio is higher, and when it has spots (T=5500 K), the ratio is lower.

Wait, so the problem is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when there are no spots compared to when there are spots. So I need to calculate (ratio without spots) / (ratio with spots). 

The ratio is n1/n2, where n1 and n2 are the number of atoms in levels 1 and 2. So using the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Because if E1 is lower than E2, then E2 - E1 is positive, and exp of a positive number would make the ratio larger if T is lower. Wait, but when T is lower, the exponential term becomes smaller, right? Because the exponent is positive, so higher T would make the exponent larger, leading to a larger ratio. So if the temperature decreases, the ratio n1/n2 should decrease as well. But the problem says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio decreases. That's consistent because when T is lower, the ratio goes down. So when spots are present, the ratio is lower, and without spots, it's higher. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Wait, no. The problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T is 5500 K (with spots), the ratio is lower than when T is 6000 K (no spots). So the ratio is (n1/n2)_6000K divided by (n1/n2)_5500K. Let me write that as:

Factor = (n1/n2)_{6000} / (n1/n2)_{5500}

Which, using the Boltzmann equation, becomes:

Factor = [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k * 6000) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k * 5500) ) ]

The (g1/g2) terms cancel out, so the factor becomes:

exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [ 1/(6000) - 1/(5500) ] )

Because when you divide the exponents, you subtract the exponents. So the exponent becomes (E2-E1)/(k) [ 1/6000 - 1/5500 ].

Wait, but (E2-E1)/(k) is a term I can calculate. But wait, the problem gives the wavelength of the transition between the two levels as approximately 1448 Å. I think this is the wavelength of the emitted photon when an atom transitions from level 2 to level 1. So the energy difference between the levels can be found using the photon energy equation: ΔE = h c / λ.

Right, so the energy difference E2 - E1 = hc/λ. Since the wavelength is given as 1448 Å, which is 1.448e-6 meters.

Wait, let me compute ΔE. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. So hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide that by λ: 1.9878e-25 J·m /
