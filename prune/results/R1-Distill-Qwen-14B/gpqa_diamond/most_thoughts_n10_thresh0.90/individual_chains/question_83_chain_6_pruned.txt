Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on titration calculations, but let's try to think it through.

So the setup is: We have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. We dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

First, let me figure out the initial concentrations after dilution. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and when we dilute it, its concentration decreases. So the initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³ of water. So total volume becomes 40 cm³, which is 0.04 liters.

The initial moles of acetic acid can be calculated as Molarity * Volume. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

When we dilute it to 40 cm³, the new concentration is moles / volume. So 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid solution is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate this with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. So each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid, producing the acetate ion.

First, let's find the equivalence point. The moles of NaOH needed equals the initial moles of acetic acid. So 0.001 moles. Since the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume required is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 liters, which is 10 cm³.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration and equivalence point. So 25% of the equivalence volume is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH.

Wait, no. Wait, the equivalence volume is 10 cm³. So 25% of that is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So at that point, how much of the acid has been neutralized?

Each cm³ of NaOH is 0.1 M, so moles of NaOH added: 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 moles. So moles of acetic acid neutralized is 0.00025, and moles of acetate formed is also 0.00025.

The initial moles of acetic acid in the 40 cm³ solution is 0.001 (as calculated before). So after 25% titration, moles of acetic acid left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. Moles of acetate is 0.00025.

Now, the total volume of the solution at 25% titration is the initial 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Wait, wait wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the total volume is 40 cm³ (diluted solution) + 2.5 cm³ of NaOH solution. So 42.5 cm³, yes.

So to find pH, since we're dealing with a buffer solution (mix of weak acid and its conjugate base), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

The pKa is the negative log of Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa is about 4.73 (since log(1.85e-5) is about 4.73; wait, 1e-5 is 5, so 1.85 is about 0.265, so 4.735).

So plugging in the concentrations:

log(0.005882 / 0.017647) = log(0.333...) ≈ -0.4771.

So pH = 4.73 + (-0.4771) ≈ 4.25.

Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value, which matches.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. The ratio is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. So log(1/3) is log(0.333...) which is about -0.477. So 4.73 -0.477 is 4.253, so about 4.25. Close to 4.26, which is option A's first value.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Since sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid and strong base, the solution will be basic.

The moles of acetate at equivalence point: same as initial moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 moles. The total volume is 40 cm³ (diluted solution) plus 10 cm³ (equivalence volume) = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb is 5.405e-10. The concentration is 0.02 M.

Using the approximation for weak bases, [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * C). So sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH is 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have a pH near 9. Wait, let me recheck my calculations.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Kb. Let's recalculate.

Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approx 5.405e-10, that's correct.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

So Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is [OH-], then:

x^2 / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

pOH is about -log(1.04e-5) = 4.98, so pH is 9.02.

But wait the options don't have a pH of about 9.02. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, let me
