Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The researchers are trying to detect transits of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have limited observing time and want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. Both planets were already detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. The key points are:

- Both have the same mass.
- Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So, if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3.
- Both have circular orbits.
- The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radii because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. So, same radius but different masses.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The options are A to D, each giving different probabilities.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size. Specifically, the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a_orbit)^2, where R_star is the star's radius and a_orbit is the semi-major axis (which, for a circular orbit, is just the radius of the orbit).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The transit probability formula is given by P = (R_*/ a)^2 * (1/(1 + (M_planet/M_star)^0.5)), but wait, no. I think I'm mixing up some terms. Wait, I think the transit probability is actually P = (R_star + R_planet)^2 / (a^2), but since the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's, R_planet is negligible, so we can approximate it as (R_star / a)^2.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me recall: the transit probability is the ratio of the areas. The planet must pass directly in front of the star as seen from Earth, which is a geometric probability. The formula is:

P = (R_* / a)^2 * (1 / (1 + (M_p / M_*)^0.5)) )

Wait, no, that's the formula for Doppler wobble amplitude, maybe. Hmm, I think I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the transit probability is actually the ratio of the area of the circle where the planet can cause a transit (the 'Einstein ring' concept) to the area of the planet's orbit. So, the probability is (R_star / a)^2. Because the planet must cross the line of sight, so the chance is proportional to the square of (R_star / a). Because the area where the planet can be in the right position is a circle with radius R_star, and the area of the orbit is a circle with radius a. So the probability is (R_star / a)^2 times the chance that the inclination is right. Wait, but perhaps that's already accounted for.

Wait, no, wait. The transit probability, assuming random orientations, is given by the formula:

P = (R_* + R_p)^2 / (a^2) * (1/(1 + (M_p/(M_* + M_p))^0.5)) )

Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me check my notes. Oh right, I remember now: the probability of a transit is given by:

P = (R_* / a)^2 * (1 / (sqrt(1 + (M_p/M_*)^2)) )

Wait, no, that's the formula from the Doppler method's velocity semi-amplitude. Hmm. Alternatively, the transit probability is given by the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis, squared. Because the planet has to pass in front of the star, so it's the area of the star relative to the orbit.

Wait, no, if the orbit is randomly oriented, the probability that the inclination is just right for a transit is (R_star / a) * (something). Wait, I think the correct formula is:

The probability is (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 + (M_p/(M_*) )^{1/3} )) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think differently. The transit probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter (expressed as the semi-major axis), squared. So:

P = ( (2 R_*) ) / (2 a) )^2 = (R_*/ a)^2.

Wait, that's right. Because the planet has to cross the disk of the star. The area is π (R_*)^2, and the area where the planet can be in front is a circle of radius a, so area π a^2. So the probability is (R_* / a)^2.

But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the planet's orbit is a circle with radius a, and the
