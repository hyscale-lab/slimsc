Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, denoted as A_y. It says that A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and the eigenvalue equation is A_y φ = a φ. The matrix form of A_y is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is the matrix:

First row: 0   -i
Second row: i   0.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum components are often represented by Pauli matrices. Oh right! The Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. The S matrix here looks like sigma_y, which is the Pauli y matrix. Because the standard sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So yeah, S is sigma_y.

So, A_y = c * S, where c = h/(4π). Wait, let me compute c. Planck's constant h is usually in J·s, and 4π is a factor, but I think in terms of equations, the specific value of c might not matter immediately.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. So I need to find the eigenvalues 'a' and eigenvectors φ such that A_y φ = a φ.

Wait, but wait, the given matrix S is 2x2. So A_y is a 2x2 matrix. So the eigenvalues and eigenvectors would be for a 2x2 matrix. Let me write down A_y.

A_y = c * S = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So let's compute that. Let me see, c is h/(4π), so each element is multiplied by c. So:

A_y = [[0, -(i h)/(4π)], [i h/(4π), 0]]

Now, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0.

The matrix A_y - a I is:

[[-a, -(i h)/(4π)],
 [ (i h)/(4π), -a]]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (i h)/(4π) * -(i h)/(4π) ) ]

So determinant = a² - [ (i h)/(4π) * (-i h)/(4π) ) ]

Wait, let's compute the product. (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) = (-i²) (h²)/(16 π²) )

But i squared is -1, so -i² = 1. So:

= a² - [ (1) * (h²)/(16 π²) ) ]

Therefore, the equation a² - (h²)/(16 π²) ) = 0.

So a² = (h²)/(16 π²)
Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4π)

Wait, so the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). But wait, those are real numbers. But the matrix A_y is a complex matrix, so I wonder why the eigenvalues are real. Wait, because the matrix is Hermitian? Let me check if A_y is Hermitian.

A matrix is Hermitian if it equals its conjugate transpose. Let's compute the conjugate transpose of A_y.

Original A_y:
Row 1: [0, -(i h)/(4π)]
Row 2: [ (i h)/(4π), 0 ]

Conjugate each element:
Row 1 becomes [0, (i h)/(4π)]
Row 2 becomes [-(i h)/(4π), 0 ]

Then transpose (swap rows and columns):
First element [0, -(i h)/(4π)] becomes [0, (i h)/(4π)] in first column?
Wait, let me think. The conjugate transpose (adjoint) of A_y is:

[ [0, (i h)/(4π) ], [ -(i h)/(4π), 0 ] ]

Compare to A_y. A_y is:

[ [0, -(i h)/(4π) ], [ (i h)/(4π), 0 ] ]

So the adjoint is not the same as A_y. So A_y is not Hermitian? Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, because A_y is part of the angular momentum operator. Oh wait, no, I think I made a mistake here.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, right? Because sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z are Hermitian. So S (sigma_y) is Hermitian. So if A_y = c S, and c is a real constant, then A_y is also Hermitian. So why did my earlier calculation suggest otherwise?

Wait, let me double-check. Let me compute the adjoint of A_y.

Each element of A_y is c times the corresponding element of S. So, the adjoint of A_y is (c S)† = c S†. But since S is Hermitian, S† = S. So A_y† = c S = A_y. So yes, A_y is Hermitian. So my earlier calculation of the matrix must have an error.

Wait, when I computed A_y, I think I might have messed up the signs.

Wait, S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]] as given. So when we multiply by c, which is real, each element becomes c * [0, -i, i, 0], so:

A_y = [ [0, -i c],
         [i c, 0] ]

So when I compute the adjoint (conjugate transpose), each element a_ij becomes a_ji*, which is the complex conjugate of the element.

So conjugate of A_y's (1,2) element is i c → -i c. So the adjoint matrix is [[0, i c], [-i c, 0]]

But A_y is [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]]

Which is not the same as the adjoint. Oh wait, wait, no. Because A_y is:

Row 1: 0, -i c
Row 2: i c, 0

The adjoint (conjugate transpose) would be:

Column 1 becomes row 1: 0, i c → as row 1: [0, i c]
Column 2 becomes row 2: -i c, 0 → [ -i c, 0 ]

So the adjoint is [[0, i c], [ -i c, 0 ]]

Which is not the same as A_y, unless c is zero, which it's not. So that suggests A_y is not Hermitian. But wait, earlier I thought S is Hermitian. Let me check S again.

S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S† is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is not the same as S. So S is not Hermitian? Wait, that can't be right. Because the Pauli matrices are supposed to be Hermitian. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in S's definition.

Wait, no. The Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Is that Hermitian? Let's compute its conjugate transpose, which would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. Which is the same as the original matrix? No, because the original S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], and the adjoint is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. So they're negatives of each other.

Wait, that would imply S is anti-Hermitian, not Hermitian. But that can't be right because the Pauli matrices are Hermitian. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the form of the Pauli Y matrix. Let me check: the standard Pauli matrices. Oh wait, the standard sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is indeed anti-Hermitian, because if you take the conjugate transpose, you get [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is equal to -sigma_y. So sigma_y is anti-Hermitian.

Wait, but I thought Pauli matrices are Hermitian. Wait, wait, no. Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The Pauli matrices are Hermitian because they satisfy sigma_i = sigma_i†. But sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], and its conjugate transpose is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is not equal to sigma_y. So it must be that sigma_y is anti-Hermitian, because sigma_y† = -sigma_y.

Wait, no, wait, let me compute sigma_y†.

Compute sigma_y:

First row: 0, -i
Second row: i, 0.

The conjugate transpose would swap rows and columns, and take complex conjugates. So the (1,2) element becomes (2,1) element and is conjugated.

So sigma_y†:
(1,1)=0; (1,2)=i
(2,1)=-i; (2,2)=0.

Which is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is -sigma_y. So sigma_y is anti-Hermitian. So sigma_y† = - sigma_y.

So if S is sigma_y, then A_y = c * S is c sigma_y. So A_y† = c sigma_y† = c (- sigma_y) = - c sigma_y = - A_y.

So A_y is anti-Hermitian, not Hermitian. That changes things.

Wait, but angular momentum operators are supposed to be Hermitian, because their eigenvalues (which are real) correspond to measurable quantities. So I'm confused here. Wait, what if c is imaginary? Let me see: in the problem statement, c is h/(4π). h is Planck's constant, which has units of J·s, and it's a real number. So c is real.

Wait, so A_y is c * S, where S is anti-Hermitian. So A_y is anti-Hermitian. So A_y† = - A_y. Therefore, A_y is not Hermitian. But that would imply that its eigenvalues are purely imaginary, because for anti-Hermitian operators, the eigenvalues are imaginary. So this is conflicting with my earlier calculation where I found real eigenvalues.

Wait, I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me re-calculate the eigenvalues correctly. Because if the matrix is anti-Hermitian, its eigenvalues should be imaginary.

So the matrix A_y is [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]]

Wait, let me think about the determinant. The matrix minus a I is [[-a, -i c], [i c, -a]]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i c)(i c) ) ].

Wait, (-i c) * (i c) = (-i)(i) c² = (1) c², because (-i)(i) = (-i²) = -(-1) = 1.

So determinant = a² - c².

So the equation is a² - c² = 0 → a² = c² → a = ± c → a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but earlier I thought A_y is anti-Hermitian, which would lead to eigenvalues being purely imaginary. But according to this, the eigenvalues are real. There's a contradiction here.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the matrix A_y. Let me re-express it.

Wait, A_y is (h/(4π)) * sigma_y.

sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So A_y is [[0, -i (h/4π)], [i (h/4π), 0]]

So the matrix is:

[ [0,  -i (h/(4π)) ],
  [i (h/(4π)), 0 ] ]

So when I compute the eigenvalues, perhaps I should set up the equation (A_y - a I) φ = 0.

Let me denote (h/(4π)) as k for simplicity. So the matrix becomes [[0, -i k], [
