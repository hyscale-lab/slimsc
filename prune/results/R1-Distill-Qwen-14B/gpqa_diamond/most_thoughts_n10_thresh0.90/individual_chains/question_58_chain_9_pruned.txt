Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's read it carefully. The question is asking which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like when calculations result in infinite values. Divergences happen because the mathematics isn't handling the extremes properly, so regularization helps make the calculations finite and manageable.

Wait, so each of these theories is a different kind of physics theory. Let me think about each one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. That's a type of string theory, right? String theories try to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity. I think strings are tiny, and they vibrate at different frequencies. Since string theory incorporates gravity and is a candidate for a theory of everything, maybe it handles things differently. But does it require regularization?

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, dealing with quarks and gluons. I remember that QCD has something called asymptotic freedom, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the interaction between quarks becomes weaker. But wait, when dealing with things like loop diagrams in perturbation theory, you can get divergences. So they must use regularization techniques, like maybe dimensional regularization or cutoff methods. So B does require regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-established quantum field theory. But I also remember that QED has issues with divergent integrals in calculations, especially in processes like electron self-energy or vacuum polarization. Because of this, QED definitely needs regularization techniques. But wait, isn't there something about renormalization in QED? Oh right, renormalization is a process that deals with these divergences, which involves absorbing the infinities into redefined parameters. So regularization is a part of that process for QED.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. This is the non-quantum version, Maxwell's equations and all that. In classical ED, you don't have the same kinds of divergences as in quantum theories because there's no inherent uncertainty or quantization. The theory is deterministic and doesn't involve the same infinities that quantum theories do. So for classical ED, you don't need regularization because you're not dealing with the same divergences that quantum theories face.

Wait, but wait a minute. Do any of these theories not require regularization because they don't have the same divergent problems? Superstring theory is a quantum theory, so maybe it does require regularization. Or perhaps because it's a theory that includes gravity, it handles things differently. But I'm not sure.

So the question is, which theory never requires regularization at high energies.

Wait, let's think again. Regularization is a quantum field theory technique. So classical theories don't require regularization because they don't have the same issues. So D is Classical Electrodynamics, which is a classical theory. So it doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory. So that's the correct answer.

But wait, the question is about high energies. Because in high-energy (
