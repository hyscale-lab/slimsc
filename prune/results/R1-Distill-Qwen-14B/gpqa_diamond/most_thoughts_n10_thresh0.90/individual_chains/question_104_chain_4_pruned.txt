Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, I need to figure out how the orbital periods of the two planets relate based on the spectral line shifts. Let me think this through.

Alright, so both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull.

Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes 7. Wait, I remember that the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us. So the amplitude of the velocity is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period.

The formula I think is something like the semi-amplitude K equals ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(0.5) )) ) * (1/(c)) ) * (1/(1/(P^(1/3)) )) ? Hmm, maybe I'm getting mixed up. Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the velocity semi-amplitude K.

Wait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P) )^(1/3) ) 

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (because Neptune is much less massive than the Sun), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies a bit.

Wait, another approach. The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(0.5) )

But since the orbits are circular, e=0, so the denominator becomes 1. Also, assuming inclination i is 90 degrees (edge-on), sin i =1.

So K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Given that both planets have similar masses (Neptune-like) and M_star is the same for both, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K increases, P decreases, and vice versa.

Wait, wait. The problem states that the shift is periodic, but the actual velocity relates to K. So a larger shift would mean a larger K. Because the velocity is causing the Doppler shift.

So for Planet #1, K1 is 5 miliangstrom, and for Planet #2, K2 is 7 miliangstrom.

Wait, but wait. The actual Doppler shift depends on the velocity. The shift in wavelength (Δλ) is given by λ = c * (Δv) / c, but more accurately, the Doppler shift formula is Δλ/λ ≈ (v/c). So if the wavelength shift is 5 milliangstroms, and assuming the spectral line is at a certain wavelength (say, λ), then the velocity would be v = (Δλ) / λ * c.

But wait, the problem gives the shift as 5 milliangstrom for a given wavelength. Let's think about it: the actual velocity depends on the shift divided by the wavelength. But since the problem gives the shifts for the same spectral line at the same wavelength for both stars, the ratio of their velocities is just the ratio of the shifts. Because Δλ is 5 vs. 7.

So K1 = 5, K2 =7. Therefore, K2/K1 =7/5=1.4.

But wait, I thought that K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)), so if K2 is 7/5 times K1, then P2 is (K1/K2)^3 times P1.

Wait, let me write it correctly. Since K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)), so P ∝ 1/(K)^(3).

So P2/P1 = [K1/(K2)]^3.

Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so P is proportional to 1/K^3, so the ratio is (K2 / K1)^-3? Wait, no, let me correct.

Let me define K as being proportional to 1/(P)^(1/3). So K = C / (P)^(1/3), where C is a constant determined by other factors. So if K increases, P decreases.

So P = C' * (1/K)^(3), where C' is another constant.

So for two
