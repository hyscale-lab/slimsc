Okay, so I have this Michael addition reaction problem to solve. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it step by step. The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each with different reactants and conditions. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different products for A, B, and C. I need to figure out the products for each reaction and match them to the options.

First, let's start with reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). So, what's happening here?

I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophilic attack on a beta-carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile would be the enolate ion.

Dimethyl malonate is a diester, right? Structure-wise, it's CH2(COOEt)2. It can act as a Michael donor because its enolate can form easily. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3, but wait, the acrylate is E, so the substituents on the double bond are on opposite sides. The substituents here are the p-tolyl group (a phenyl ring with a methyl at the para position) and the ester group.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3, but the substituents on the double bond are the p-tolyl group (as part of the acrylate) and the ester oxygen. Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Let's think again: the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the substituents on the double bond are CH3 (from p-tolyl) on one side and COOEt on the other. Or perhaps I'm mixing up the positions. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)COOEt? No, maybe the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOEt? Wait, wait, no. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. So 3-(p-tolyl) would imply that the substituent is on the third carbon of the acrylate, but the acrylate only has three carbons: CH2, CH, and COOEt. Hmm, perhaps I need to think of it as the double bond being between C2 and C3. Wait, maybe the correct structure
