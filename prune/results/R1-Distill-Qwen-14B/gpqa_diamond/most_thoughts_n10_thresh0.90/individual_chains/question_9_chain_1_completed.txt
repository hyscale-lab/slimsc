Okay, so I have this question about which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry stuff, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that C3h symmetry means the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and also a mirror plane (σh) that contains the rotation axis. So the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also mirror reflection in that plane.

The options given are four molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone, and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. And the choices are A, B, C, D for each.

Let me think about each option. I'll start by recalling their structures.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. I think that's (i-PrO)3B, a borate ester. Triisopropyl groups are bulky and all the same. So the molecule has a trigonal planar structure around the boron. Wait, but wait, is that correct? Boron usually has three bonds in such compounds. So the structure is like a trigonal planar with three isopropyl groups attached. So is that C3 symmetric?

Trigonal symmetry would imply C3, but since each isopropyl group is identical, rotating 120 degrees would map the molecule onto itself. But what about mirror planes? The molecule might have a plane of symmetry that includes the boron atom. So yes, that would make it C3h. Wait, but wait, mirror planes in such molecules—does triisopropyl borate have a mirror plane? The molecule is flat, so a plane through the boron and the center of each isopropyl group... Hmm, actually, in such a structure, each isopropyl is attached to the boron in a symmetrical way. So a rotation of 120 degrees would map the molecule onto itself, and there's a mirror plane bisecting each pair of substituents. So yes, triisopropyl borate should have C3h symmetry.

Option D is quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic amine, a bridge structure. I think its structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane system. The molecule is known for having a high degree of symmetry. Wait, does it have C3h symmetry or maybe C2v or something else? Let me visualize it. Quinuclidine has a bridge structure with three bridges. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, maybe through the bridge, but the symmetry might be higher. I think it has a three-fold rotation axis because you can rotate it 120 degrees and it looks the same. But does it have a mirror plane that includes that axis? Hmm, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe it has a different symmetry. Wait, I'm a bit confused. I think quinuclidine has a C3 axis but might not have an h mirror plane. Or maybe it does. Alternatively, maybe it has a different symmetry like S4 or something else. Not sure. I'll have to come back to this.

Option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me parse that. Benzo suggests a benzene ring, and the substituents are trifuran, which is a fused furan system. The numbers 1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'' indicate the positions where the benzo ring is fused to the furans. So it's a fused ring system, maybe like a benzofuran trimer or something. The substituents are at positions 1,3,4,6,7,9 as ketones (hexaone). Hmm, not sure about the structure. How symmetric is this? Well, the numbering seems complicated, but considering the way the rings are fused, perhaps there's a three-fold symmetry. Because the rings are fused in a way that each is connected in a symmetrical pattern. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a different symmetry. Maybe C3h symmetry. I'm not certain, but perhaps.

Option A is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Triphenylene is a tricyclic benzene system, right? So this molecule has three benzene rings fused together. Then it's attached to a trifuran, with ketone groups. So the structure is more complex. I'm thinking about the symmetry. If the triphenylene part has threefold symmetry, perhaps the molecule as a whole does as well, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, the symmetry might be lower because of the substituents.

Wait, but the question is about which of the options has C3h symmetry. So I have to figure out which of these four has that.

Let me think again about each option.

Triisopropyl borate (option C): as I thought earlier, it's a trigonal planar molecule with three identical substituents. So it has a C3 axis. Now, does it have an h mirror plane? An h plane is a horizontal mirror plane, but in this case, the molecule is probably planar with the B in the center. So a plane through B and each isopropyl group would be a mirror plane. Alternatively, maybe it's a σv plane. Wait, the h plane is a horizontal mirror plane, which would be perpendicular to the principal axis. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, the principal axis is the C3. The h plane would be perpendicular to it, passing through the axis. So in triisopropylborate, if you rotate 120 degrees, the molecule looks the same. Now, does it have a mirror plane that includes the C3 axis? For example, a plane that cuts through the boron and one of the isopropyl groups. But wait, that would make each isopropyl group symmetric across that plane. Since all three are the same, perhaps each has such a plane. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have that plane because each isopropyl is in a different position. Wait, no, each is attached symmetrically.

Wait, triisopropylborate is symmetric. So, yes, it has a C3 axis. Now for the mirror planes: typically, for a molecule with trigonal symmetry, there are three mirror planes each passing through a bond axis (i.e., each mirror plane includes the C3 axis and one of the substituents). So for each substituent, there's a mirror plane. So if you have three substituents, you have three mirror planes. So in that case, the molecule would have D3h symmetry, which includes C3, the mirror planes, and inversion. Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe it only has C3 and one mirror plane. No, wait, D3h has more symmetry elements. Oh, wait, if the molecule has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then the point group would be D3h. But if the molecule doesn't have the horizontal mirror, but has three vertical mirror planes, the point group would be D3. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, the definition of C3h symmetry is that the molecule has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule would be superimposable on its mirror image when reflected in that plane. Let me think about triisopropylborate. If the molecule is planar, with boron in the center and the three isopropyl groups around it, then a horizontal mirror plane would be a plane perpendicular to the C3 axis, perhaps. Wait, but in this molecule, the C3 axis is along the boron's position. So a horizontal mirror would be perpendicular to that, cutting through the boron and, perhaps, the plane of the substituents.

Wait, in reality, the molecule is planar, so a horizontal mirror plane would pass through the boron and the mid-plane of the substituents. So reflecting across that plane would leave the molecule unchanged, since each isopropyl group is identical and arranged symmetrically. So yes, the molecule would have both the C3 axis and the σh plane, making its point group C3h. Alternatively, if it has more symmetry elements, it might be D3h, but I think the question is only about whether it has C3h, not higher symmetry.

Wait, but I'm not certain about the point group of triisopropyl borate. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has C3 symmetry but no mirror planes. Then it wouldn't be C3h.

Wait, another approach: which of these molecules are known to have C3h symmetry?

Quinuclidine: I think quinuclidine has a higher symmetry, maybe C3v or something else. Or perhaps it's C2v. Alternatively, I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to look up structure.

Quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane system with an amine. The molecule has a bridgehead structure. So it's symmetric across three planes. It has a three-fold axis, perhaps. Wait, if you imagine rotating the molecule 120 degrees, would it look the same? Let me visualize: each bridge is between two bridgeheads. So each of the three bridges is equivalent. So yes, a rotation of 120 degrees would map the molecule onto itself. So it has a C3 axis. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Let's see. A plane cutting through the center of the molecule, perhaps along one of the bridges. But wait, in quinuclidine, the molecule is not flat; it's a three-dimensional structure. Hmm, not sure if it has a mirror plane. Alternatively, maybe it's C3h. Or perhaps not, because the molecule's structure might not have the mirror plane.

Quinuclidine is a tetrahedral structure, perhaps. Wait, no, it's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is a more complex system. Alternatively, perhaps it's more like a propeller shape, which would suggest that it has C3 symmetry. But whether it has a mirror plane is the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the mirror plane is present. If the molecule can be mirrored across a plane that includes the C3 axis, then it would have C3h.

But I'm getting stuck on this. Maybe I should think about other options.

Option A: triphenyleno[...]trifuran... So triphenylene is a three-fused benzene rings, right? So that part has a three-fold symmetry. Then it's attached to a trifuran, which is three furan rings. So the entire molecule might have a three-fold symmetry. So perhaps it has C3h symmetry.

Wait, but the substituents are at 1,3,6,8,11,13 positions as ketones. So the substituents might be arranged in a symmetric way, which could contribute to the overall symmetry.

But I'm not very confident about this.

Option B: benzo[...]trifuran... So it's a benzene ring fused with three furan rings. The benzo part is attached at specific positions. The substituents are at 1,3,4,6,7,9, which are all ketones. Hmm, maybe the molecule is symmetric across a three-fold axis. So rotating 120 degrees would align the substituents.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct. Triisopropylborate is a trigonal planar molecule with three identical substituents, so it should have C3 symmetry. Now, does it have a mirror plane?

Wait, the structure of triisopropylborate is [B(i-PrO)3], which has a trigonal planar geometry. So the point group is D3h. Because in addition to the C3 axis, the molecule has three mirror planes (each passing through a bond and the center), as well as a horizontal mirror plane. So the point group is D3h, which includes C3h. So the molecule has C3h symmetry as part of D3h.

But I'm not sure if the question is considering only the C3h point group, not higher symmetry groups.

Wait, the question says which has C3h symmetry. So if a molecule has D3h symmetry, it would certainly have C3h as a subset. So triisopropylborate would have C3h.

So option C would be correct.

Wait, but the question is about which of the four options has C3h symmetry. So I think triisopropyl borate (option C) is the right answer.

Wait, but let me think again about quinuclidine. If it has a three-fold rotation axis and a mirror plane, it would have C3h. I'm not so sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine doesn't have a mirror plane, which would mean it doesn't have C3h, only C3.

So, putting it all together, I think option C is correct.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on their structures and symmetry properties. **C₃h** symmetry implies the presence of a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that contains the rotation axis. Below is the analysis of each option:

---

### **Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**
This molecule consists of a triphenylene core (three fused benzene rings) attached to a trifuran system with ketone groups at specific positions. The triphenylene core has three-fold symmetry, and the trifuran system is symmetrically attached. However, the ketone groups at positions 1,3,6,8,11,13 may disrupt the overall symmetry. While the molecule may have some degree of symmetry, it is unlikely to possess **C₃h** symmetry due to the arrangement of the substituents.

---

### **Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**
This molecule features a benzene ring fused to a trifuran system with ketone groups at positions 1,3,4,6,7,9. The fused ring system may exhibit some symmetry, but the positions of the ketone groups are not symmetric. As a result, this molecule does not have **C₃h** symmetry.

---

### **Option C: Triisopropyl Borate**
Triisopropyl borate, [(i-PrO)₃B], has a trigonal planar geometry around the boron atom, with three identical isopropyl groups attached. This structure has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and three mirror planes (σv) that pass through the boron atom and each isopropyl group. Additionally, it has a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that contains the C₃ axis. Since the molecule satisfies the criteria for **C₃h** symmetry, this option is correct.

---

### **Option D: Quinuclidine**
Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane system with an amine group. It has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) due to the symmetry of the bicyclic structure. However, it lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh), as the molecule is not planar and the symmetry elements do not satisfy the requirements for **C₃h** symmetry. Therefore, quinuclidine does not have **C₃h** symmetry.

---

### **Conclusion**
Based on the analysis, **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) is the only molecule that possesses **C₃h** symmetry.

**Answer: C**
