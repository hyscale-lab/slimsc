Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck on how to approach it. Let's see if I can think it through step by step.

The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, right. So the setup is that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is generally c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's when the medium is at rest relative to the observer. But in this case, the glass is moving, so I think I have to consider the frame of reference here.

So the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. Oh, but the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. Hmm, so from the lab frame (observer's frame), the glass is moving, and the light is also moving in that same direction.

Wait, maybe I should think about this using the concept of relative velocity. The speed of light in the glass is (c/n) in the glass's frame. But from the lab frame, which is moving with velocity v relative to the glass, the speed of the light would change.

Wait no, that's not quite right. Wait, I think I'm getting confused between the glass's frame and the lab frame. The glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. The light is moving inside the glass, which is itself moving in the lab frame.

So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at c/n. But in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass, the light's speed would be different.

Wait, but velocities don't just add up linearly in relativity, right? Because of the principles of special relativity. Oh, right, because the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. Wait, but wait, the problem says the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1. So in any frame, the speed of light in vacuum is c. But here, the light is in a medium, so it's moving at c/n in the glass's frame. But when the glass is moving, the lab frame would see the speed differently.

Wait no, wait. Wait, the problem says the light is
