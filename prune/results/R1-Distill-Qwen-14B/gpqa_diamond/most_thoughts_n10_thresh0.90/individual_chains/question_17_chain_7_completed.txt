Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says that there's a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent that binds metal ions like calcium. The pH is ideal, so I don't need to worry about that complicating things. The temperature is 25°C, but I don't think that affects the calculation here. The K value is given as 5x10^10. 

Wait, wait. So Ca-EDTA is a complex, right? So the formula is probably CaY^2- if Y is the EDTA^4- form. But since the pH is ideal, I guess the EDTA is in the correct form to bind Ca^2+ effectively. So the complex is [CaY]^2-.

The problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. Because EDTA forms a complex with Ca^2+, the free calcium concentration will be much lower than the concentration of the complex. So I think this is a problem involving the dissociation of a complex ion.

The formula for the complex dissociation would be: [CaY]^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + Y^4-. The formation constant, Kf, is given as 5e10. But wait, sometimes people use K as the dissociation constant. Oh wait, wait. Formation constant is Kf, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So Kf = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y^4-]).

But wait, in this problem, K is given as 5e10. So that must be the formation constant. Because the problem says K_Ca-EDTA = 5e10. So Kf = 5e10.

The solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of [CaY]^2- is 0.02 M. We can assume that the dissociation is minimal, so we can approximate that [CaY]^2- remains approximately 0.02 M. But wait, let me think. Because Kf is so large, the complex is very stable, so it doesn't dissociate much. So the concentrations of Ca^2+ and Y^4- will be very small.

So the reaction is [CaY]^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + Y^4-.

The Kf is [CaY]/([Ca][Y]) = 5e10.

So if the initial concentration of [CaY] is 0.02 M, and we let x be the concentration of Ca^2+ that dissociates, then [CaY] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, since x is very small. Similarly, [Ca] = x and [Y] = x. So substituting into Kf:

5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x) → 5e10 = 0.02/(x²)

So solving for x²: x² = 0.02/(5e10) → x² = 2e-12 /5 → wait, let me compute that correctly.

0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-13 squared is (1e-6.5)^2 → 1e-13. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 1e-7. So 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7. 

Wait, but wait, 4e-13 is x squared, so x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Because sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-12) is 1e-6, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7. So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that should be the answer.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So the initial concentration is 0.02 M of the complex. The Kf is 5e10. We're assuming that the dissociation is small, so [CaY] ≈ 0.02, and [Ca] = [Y] = x, which is small. So Kf = 0.02/(x^2) = 5e10 → x² = 0.02/(5e10) → x²=4e-13 → x=6.32e-7. Yes, that makes sense. So the free calcium concentration is 6.3e-7 M. So option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{[CaY]}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant is given as \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The initial concentration of the complex, \([CaY]^{2-}\), is 0.02 M. Let \( x \) represent the concentration of dissociated \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{Y}^{4-}\). Since \( K_f \) is very large, the dissociation is minimal, so \([CaY]^{2-} \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\), and \([Ca^{2+}] = [Y^{4-}] = x\).

The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaY}]^{2-}}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Substituting \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \):

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
