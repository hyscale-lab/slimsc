Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully. Hmm, it's about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. Let me break it down step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and Reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So it's a ketone. And NaCN is sodium cyanide. I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, it forms a cyanohydrin. So the product would be a compound where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by an -OH and a -CN group. But wait, the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's see the structure. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so the cyanohydrin would add a CN and OH to the same carbon. So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CNCH2? Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH3? No, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a three-carbon chain, right? So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would be CH2C(OH)(CN)(CH2CH3), but I might be getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, the formula in the product is butanenitrile, so four carbons. Hmm, maybe I should draw this out mentally.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN would give a cyanohydrin. The cyanide attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen becomes an -OH group. So the product would have a structure like (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but wait, that's only three carbons. Oh, wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, no. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but with substituents. So maybe the product is (CH(CH3)2)C(OH)CN? No, perhaps it's (CH3)2CHCH2CN with an OH on the same carbon as the CN? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. Wait, perhaps the butanenitrile part is four carbons, so the structure is CH2CH(CH2CN)(OH)CH3? Hmm, maybe I should think about how the cyanohydrin forms. The general reaction is ketone + CN- → cyanohydrin. So R2CO → R2C(OH)CN. So for butan-2-one, it's (CH3)2CO. The product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN plus another methyl group? Or wait, perhaps it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key is that the reaction forms a cyanohydrin, which requires a strong acid catalyst, right?

Wait, when forming cyanohydrins, the reaction is typically done under acidic conditions. Because the cyanide ion is a nucleophile, but in the presence of an acid, the carbonyl becomes more electrophilic. So the reagent A is likely an acid. Looking at the options, reagent A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. So if A is H3O+, that's a strong acid. NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate, which is a source of H+ and also HS03^- which can act as a nucleophile? Wait, no. In the cyanohydrin formation, the acid is just to protonate the carbonyl. So reagent A would be an acid, such as H3O+.

So for the first reaction, the correct reagent A is H3O+. So looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3. So maybe the correct choice is either A or B.

Now, moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The reagent B is H2O or something else, and the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). How does that happen?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. In acidic conditions, the nitrile is protonated, then hydrolyzed. Alternatively, using H2O with acid, like HCl, could lead to the formation of a carboxylic acid. Wait, but wait, what's the reaction here? The nitrile is at the end of a chain, but in this case, it's attached to the same carbon as the hydroxyl group. So the structure is R-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH2-... Wait, no. The structure is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile: so the nitrile is on carbon 2, along with the hydroxyl. Wait, butanenitrile is four carbons, with the nitrile on carbon 1. But in this case, it's 2-hydroxybutanenitrile, so the nitrile is on carbon 2. So when it's converted to butanoic acid, the nitrile becomes a carboxylic acid on carbon 2, which would require oxidation.

Wait, but oxidation of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically requires strong oxidizing agents. For example, using KMnO4 under acidic conditions. Alternatively, another method is hydrolysis of the nitrile to the acid. But under what conditions?

Wait, the starting material is 2-hydroxy-2-nitro... no, sorry, it's 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the nitrile is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl group. To convert the nitrile to a carboxylic acid, you need to oxidize it. But in this case, it's attached to a carbon that's already attached to an -OH group. That might complicate things because the adjacent hydroxyl could influence the reaction.

Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrolysis reaction. Let me think about the reaction conditions. If the nitrile is treated with water in the presence of an acid, like HCl, that could hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. But wait, nitrile hydrolysis usually requires more than just water and acid. I think for nitrile to carboxylic acid, you need either strong acidic or basic conditions, and often heat. Alternatively, using a catalyst like H2SO4 or HCl.

Looking at the options for reagent B, the options are H2O and something else. Wait
