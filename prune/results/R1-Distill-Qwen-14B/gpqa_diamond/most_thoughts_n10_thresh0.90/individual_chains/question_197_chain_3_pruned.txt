Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question and data carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that when alkenes react with red phosphorus and HI, it's a hydrohalogenation reaction. Specifically, this is a case of HI adding across a double bond in a way that's probably following a certain mechanism. Oh wait, red phosphorus is involved, I think that's part of the phosphorus tribromide or something similar for deoxygenation? Or wait, no, red phosphorus is used in the hydroxymercuration or maybe it's for the halogenation. Wait, no—wait, when you have red phosphorus and HI, that's the situation for the formation of the ylide. Oh, wait, no, maybe that's for the Wittig reaction. Hmm, no, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is for the substitution of an alcohol group with iodide. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI is used in the hydroxymercuration reaction? Or maybe it's for the synthesis of alkenes via elimination. Wait, perhaps it's the dehydrohalogenation? No, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, I think when you have an alcohol and you treat it with red phosphorus and HI, it's a way to convert the hydroxyl group into a good leaving group, perhaps replacing it with an iodide. But wait, that doesn't make sense because if it's an alcohol, it would become a better leaving group, but then maybe it's a substitution reaction.

Wait, perhaps I should first figure out what the structure of Compound X is. Because the question provides IR and NMR data, so I need to deduce the structure from that.

Looking at the IR data: The peaks are 3400–2500 cm-1, which often indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But 3400 is a broad peak for O-H. Then, 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde or ester or carboxylic acid. Wait, but wait. The 1720 cm-1 is a bit lower, which might suggest an ester or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl, maybe an aromatic ring attached? Or maybe a ketone. But the 1610 and 1450 cm-1 suggest aromatic ring stretching, so the compound has an aromatic ring.

In the NMR data, let's see:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm. That's a strong indication of an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid proton. But wait, a carboxylic acid proton typically appears around 10-12 ppm and is broad because of hydrogen bonding. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton is around 9-10 ppm, but 10.5 is a bit high for an aldehyde. Hmm. But wait, maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the other peaks:

8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These look like two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring, because in a para-substituted ring, the protons across from each other would be equivalent and split into doublets with coupling. So that would fit with a benzene ring where each substituent is at para positions.

Then, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet integrating to 1H. That could be a methine proton adjacent to something, perhaps a CH in a substituent group.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, 2H. Maybe adjacent to the aromatic ring, perhaps part of a CH2 group.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet of 3H. That's likely a methyl group attached to a CH, perhaps like a CH(CH3) group.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, integrating to 3H. That's usually a methyl group at the end of an ethyl chain. So maybe a ethyl group attached somewhere.

Putting this together, the aromatic ring is para-substituted. The substituents are probably a carbonyl group and another group. Wait, but looking at the NMR data, let's think about the possible structure.

The 10.5 ppm peak could be a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group and another substituent. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde and another group.

Wait, but the IR data has a 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-1, but sometimes they can be a bit lower if conjugated. However, another possibility is that the 1720 cm-1 is an ester or ketone. Wait, but if it were a ketone, why would there be a peak at 10.5, which is more likely to be a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1720 is an ester. Let's think: what if the compound is a benzaldehyde derivative? Then, the aldehyde would have a peak around 10 ppm. But the 10.5 is a bit high. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an aromatic aldehyde (benzaldehyde), which typically has a peak around 9.8-10.5 ppm, depending on substitution.

Wait, let's think of the substituents on the benzene ring. So, in the NMR, the two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm suggest a para-substituted benzene. So, for each aromatic proton, they are split into a doublet, which suggests coupling with one adjacent proton. Wait, no, in para substitution, each set of H is at the ortho and para positions. Wait, no, in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group and the other is an alkyl group.

Wait, perhaps the benzene ring has two substituents at the para positions: one is a carbonyl group (like a COOH or COOR or COR), and the other is an ethyl group or a more complex substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl chain or a branched chain.

Wait, looking at the NMR data, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a methine adjacent to a carbonyl group. For example, if we have a structure like RCOCH2CH(CH3)-something.

Wait, let me try to sketch a possible structure.

So, the benzene ring has a substituent at position 1 and position 4 (para positions). Let's say substituents are a -COOH group at position 1 and another group at position 4.

Wait, but the IR has a 1720 cm-1, which could be a carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is about 1700-1720, so that fits. The broad peak at ~10.5 ppm would be the -COOH proton.

So, the benzene ring has two substituents: a -COOH and another group.

Looking at the other NMR signals:

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be that CH.

Then, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 group attached to that CH.

The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a methyl group at the end of an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- group? Or maybe a propyl chain with branching.

Wait, another approach: The 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3
