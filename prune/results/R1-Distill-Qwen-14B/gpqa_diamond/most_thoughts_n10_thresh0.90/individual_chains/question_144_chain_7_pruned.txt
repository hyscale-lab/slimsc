Okay, so I have this physics problem about meson decay. Hmm, I remember mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're made up of a quark and an antiquark. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson resonance called X.

The given data: production energy E_X is 8 GeV. Mass m_X is 1.2 GeV. The width Γ_X is 320 MeV. And the options are four different distances. I think I need to calculate the mean decay length, which is the average distance the meson travels before decaying.

Wait, decay length. I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like L = γ * β * c * τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, β is the velocity over c, c is the speed of light, and τ is the proper lifetime.

But wait, how do I get τ from the given width Γ? Oh, right. The width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So the lifetime τ is approximately ħ/(Γ). But I think the exact relation is τ = ħ/(Γ), since Γ is the total decay width, which is the inverse of the lifetime.

Wait, but let me think. Decay width Γ is the energy width of the particle's resonance, and it's connected to the lifetime via τ = ħ/(Γ). Yeah, that sounds right.

So, first, I need to calculate τ. But wait, the units are in GeV and MeV. I need to make sure all units are consistent. Let me convert everything to compatible units.

So Γ is 320 MeV. Let me convert that to GeV: 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

Now, ħ is the reduced Planck constant. I think ħc is a useful quantity in particle physics. Oh wait, ħc is approximately 197.327 MeV·fm, or sometimes expressed in GeV·fm. Wait, 1 MeV is 0.001 GeV, so 197.327 MeV·fm is 0.197327 GeV·fm.

Wait, maybe I should calculate τ using τ = ħ/(Γ). Let me see
