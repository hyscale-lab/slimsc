Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, which is represented by a 2x2 matrix Ay. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum operators in quantum mechanics are related to spin matrices. Oh wait, the muon is a spin-1/2 particle, so its spin matrices should be 2x2.

The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So I can write S as:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

And Ay would be c times S. Let me compute that. c is h/(4π), so:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Wait, but when you multiply a matrix by a scalar, each element gets multiplied by that scalar. So each element of S is multiplied by c.

So Ay becomes:

Ay = [[0, (-i)(h/(4π))],
      [i*(h/(4π)), 0]]

Alternatively, I can factor out the c:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Okay, now I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

So first, let me write down Ay - a I:

Ay - a I = [[-a, (-i)(h/(4π))],
           [i*(h/(4π)), -a]]

The determinant of this matrix is:

| Ay - a I | = (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ]

Let me calculate the determinant step by step.

The (1,2) element is (-i)(h/(4π)) and the (2,1) is (i)(h/(4π)).

So when multiplied, they are [ (-i)(h/(4π)) ] * [ i (h/(4π)) ].

Wait, the product of (1,2) and (2,1) elements is (-i)(i) multiplied by (h/(4π))^2.

(-i)(i) equals -i^2, which is -(-1) = 1. So 1 multiplied by (h/(4π))^2.

So the determinant is a² - [ (h^2/(16π²)) * 1 ].

Set determinant to zero:

a² - (h²)/(16π²) = 0.

So a² = h²/(16π²)

Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4π) * (1/4π? Wait no, sqrt(h²/(16π²)) is h/(4π). So a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, wait. Wait, sqrt( (h^2)/(16 π²) ) is h/(4π) because 16 is 4 squared.

So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalues are +2πh or -2πh, real parts are +h/(4π) or -h/(4π). But wait, eigenvalues for Ay are ± h/(4π), which are real. So their imaginary parts would be zero. So option A can't be correct because it talks about non-zero imaginary parts.

Option B says the imaginary parts are ±1/2 and real parts ±1. That also doesn't make sense because our eigenvalues are real
