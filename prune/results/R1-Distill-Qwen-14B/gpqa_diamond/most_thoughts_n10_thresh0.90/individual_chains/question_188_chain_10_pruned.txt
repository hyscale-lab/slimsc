Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that a rhombohedral crystal has all sides equal, and all angles are the same. So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice parameter, right? So the lattice parameter a is 10 Angstroms.

The question asks for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Hmm, I think interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice, often denoted as d_hkl for a plane with Miller indices hkl. So I need to calculate d_111 for this crystal.

I remember there's a formula for interplanar distance in a crystal. The formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + l^2 + m^2) + 2(hl*cos gamma + hk*cos beta + lm*cos alpha) )) ... wait, or maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, I think the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + l² + m²) - 2(hl cos gamma + hk cos beta + lm cos alpha) ) ), but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, rhombohedral systems have all angles the same, so alpha = beta = gamma here, which is 30 degrees. So the formula might simplify.

Alternatively, I recall another approach. For a rhombohedral system, the lattice is a special case where a = b = c and alpha = beta = gamma. The general formula for interplanar distance is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos(180 - α) - 2hl cos(180 - α) - 2kl cos(180 - α) } }

Wait, wait, no. Because in a rhombohedral lattice, the angles between the axes are the same, but the formula might be different. Alternatively, maybe the formula for interplanar distance in a cubic system is simpler, but here it's rhombohedral. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

where θ is the angle between the axes. But wait, the angle in the formula is the angle between the lattice vectors. In a rhombohedral system, each angle is 30 degrees. So let me think.

Wait, in a cubic system, the interplanar distance is a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²). But when the angles between the axes are not 90 degrees, the formula changes. So I think the general formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos γ + hk cos γ + ... ) } }

Wait, maybe I should look up the correct formula. Oh wait, I'm just trying to remember. Another approach: the interplanar distance can be found using the reciprocal of the metric tensor.

Wait, the metric tensor M for a crystal is given by:

M = [ [ a², ab cos γ, ac cos β ],
       [ ab cos γ, b², bc cos α ],
       [ ac cos β, bc cos α, c² ] ]

But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a, and all angles are the same, so M becomes:

M = [ [ a², a² cos α, a² cos α ],
       [ a² cos α, a², a² cos α ],
       [ a² cos α, a² cos α, a² ] ]

Because α = beta = gamma =30 degrees.

Now, the Miller indices (hkl) relate to the interplanar distance via the formula:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ h² (M11) + k² (M22) + l² (M33) + 2hk (M12) + 2hl (M13) + 2kl (M23) } } }

Wait, no, I think the inverse is involved. Because the formula for d is 1/(sqrt( (h u_1 + k u_2 + l u_3)^2 ... )) ), but perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, the interplanar distance d for a plane (hkl) is given by 1/(sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos alpha) )) ), but wait, that was for a cubic system? No, wait, in a cubic system
