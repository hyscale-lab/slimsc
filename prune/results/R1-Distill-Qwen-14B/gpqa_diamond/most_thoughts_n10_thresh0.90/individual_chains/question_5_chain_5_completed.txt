Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'm going to take it step by step. Let me read the question again.

Alright, the problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz, each represented by a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Hmm, wait. I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvectors correspond to the possible states with definite eigenvalues. So here, we're looking for a state (eigenvector) where the operator P has eigenvalue +ħ/2.

But wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components. Oh, right, because operators can be expressed in terms of their components along different axes. So to find the eigenvector of P in an arbitrary direction, I probably need to consider the operator along that direction.

Wait, the direction n is in the x-z plane. So the direction can be represented by some angles, maybe theta from the z-axis and phi from the x-axis? But since it's in the x-z plane, phi might be zero or something. Or perhaps not, because n could be at an angle in x-z, meaning phi is 0 or pi, depending on direction.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. So the operator P is probably a vector operator, meaning it's like the spin operator. So the eigenvectors of P in a particular direction would correspond to spin-up or spin-down along that direction.

Right. So the operator P (maybe it's spin) along direction n is given by the sum of the components multiplied by the direction cosines. So P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, the y-component n_y is zero. So the operator becomes P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

But let me confirm. The direction vector n lies in the x-z plane, so n has components (n_x, 0, n_z). And since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So the operator P along n is P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Each of the components Px, Py, Pz is given as a matrix. Let me write them down.

Px is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Wait, since P has components along x, y, and z, the operator along n is a linear combination of these.

So let's compute P_n. Since n is in x-z plane, n_y = 0. So P_n = (n_x ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + (n_z ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Wait, but n_x and n_z could be written in terms of theta, the polar angle. Because in the x-z plane, the angle theta would be measured from the z-axis. So n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta), because in spherical coordinates, x is sinθ cosφ, z is cosθ, but since direction is in x-z, phi is 0 or pi, but for simplicity, maybe phi is 0, so n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta).

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. In spherical coordinates, the unit vector in direction (theta, phi) is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since the direction is in x-z plane, phi must be 0, so the vector becomes (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So then, substituting into P_n, we have:

P_n = (sinθ * ħ/2) * [[0 1], [1 0]] + (cosθ * ħ/2) * [[1 0], [0 -1]]

Let me compute this:

The first term is (ħ/2) sinθ times [[0 1],[1 0]]
The second term is (ħ/2) cosθ times [[1 0],[0 -1]]

So adding them together:

P_n = (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, let me compute each element:

Top-left: (ħ/2)(cosθ *1) + (sinθ * 0) )= (ħ/2) cosθ

Top-right: (ħ/2)(0 + sinθ )

Wait, wait, no. Let me better compute the matrix element-wise.

The first matrix is sinθ * [[0 1],[1 0]] multiplied by ħ/2.

So top-left element: (ħ/2) * 0 * sinθ = 0
Top-right: (ħ/2) * 1 * sinθ = (ħ/2) sinθ
Bottom-left: (ħ/2) *1 * sinθ = (ħ/2) sinθ
Bottom-right: (ħ/2) *0 * sinθ = 0

The second matrix is cosθ * [[1 0],[0 -1]] multiplied by ħ/2.

So top-left: (ħ/2) *1 * cosθ = (ħ/2) cosθ
Top-right: (ħ/2)*0 * cosθ =0
Bottom-left: (ħ/2)*0 * cosθ=0
Bottom-right: (ħ/2)*(-1)* cosθ = -(ħ/2) cosθ

Adding these together:

Top-left: (0) + (ħ/2 cosθ) = (ħ/2) cosθ
Top-right: (ħ/2 sinθ) + 0 = (ħ/2) sinθ
Bottom-left: (ħ/2 sinθ) + 0 = (ħ/2) sinθ
Bottom-right: 0 + ( - ħ/2 cosθ ) = - (ħ/2 ) cosθ

So P_n is (ħ/2) * [[ cosθ , sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, no, because each element is already multiplied by ħ/2. So the matrix is:

[ [ (ħ/2) cosθ , (ħ/2) sinθ ],
  [ (ħ/2) sinθ , -(ħ/2) cosθ ] ]

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me redo the calculation.

Wait, the first matrix from Px is (ħ/2) * sinθ * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]

So each element of that matrix is:

[ [0, sinθ (ħ/2) ],
  [sinθ (ħ/2), 0 ] ]

The second term is (ħ/2) cosθ * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Which gives:

[ [ (ħ/2 cosθ ), 0 ],
  [ 0, -(ħ/2 cosθ) ] ]

Adding these two matrices component-wise:

Top-left: 0 + (ħ/2 cosθ ) = (ħ/2 cosθ )
Top-right: (ħ/2 sinθ ) + 0 = (ħ/2 sinθ )
Bottom-left: (ħ/2 sinθ ) + 0 = (ħ/2 sinθ )
Bottom-right: 0 + ( - ħ/2 cosθ ) = - (ħ/2 cosθ )

So P_n is the matrix:

[ [ (ħ/2 cosθ ) , (ħ/2 sinθ ) ],
  [ (ħ/2 sinθ ) , ( - ħ/2 cosθ ) ] ]

Hmm, okay. Now, we need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Hmm. So to find the eigenvector, we'll solve (P_n - λ I ) |v> = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue, which is +ħ/2.

Wait, but let's represent the eigenvalue equation as P_n |v> = λ |v>.

So, substituting P_n into this, we have:

[ [ (ħ/2 cosθ ) , (ħ/2 sinθ ) ],
  [ (ħ/2 sinθ ) , ( - ħ/2 cosθ ) ] ] 

multiplied by the vector [a, b]^T equals λ [a, b]^T.

So, the equations are:

(ħ/2 cosθ ) a + (ħ/2 sinθ ) b = λ a 
(ħ/2 sinθ ) a + (- ħ/2 cosθ ) b = λ b

Since λ is ħ/2, let's substitute that in.

So equation 1:

( (ħ/2 ) cosθ ) a + ( (ħ/2 ) sinθ ) b = ( ħ/2 ) a

Divide both sides by ħ/2:

cosθ a + sinθ b = a

Equation 2:

( (ħ/2 ) sinθ ) a + (- (ħ/2 cosθ )) b = ( ħ/2 ) b

Again, divide by ħ/2:

sinθ a - cosθ b = b

So now, the two equations are:

1. cosθ a + sinθ b = a → (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0
2. sinθ a - cosθ b = b → sinθ a - (cosθ + 1) b = 0

Hmm, so we have two equations:

Equation 1: (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0 

Equation 2: sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b = 0 

Let me write them again:

1. (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0 
2. sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b = 0 

We can try to solve these equations.

Let me take equation 1 and solve for a in terms of b.

From equation 1: (cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

But maybe it's better to write the equations as ratios. Let's see.

Alternatively, I can write the equations as:

Equation 1: (cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b  
Equation 2: sinθ a = (cosθ +1) b

From equation 2: a = [ (cosθ +1) / sinθ ] b

Substitute this into equation 1:

(cosθ -1) [ (cosθ +1) / sinθ ] b + sinθ b = 0

Factor out b:

[ (cosθ -1)(cosθ +1) / sinθ + sinθ ] b = 0

But since b can't be zero (unless a is zero, which would make the vector trivial, but we're looking for non-trivial solutions), the term in brackets must be zero.

Compute numerator:

(cos²θ - 1) / sinθ + sinθ = [ (- sin²θ) / sinθ ] + sinθ = - sinθ + sinθ = 0

Wait, that's interesting. So [ ] term is zero, which means any a and b that satisfy equation 2 are solutions, provided that equation 1 is satisfied.

Wait, perhaps that suggests that the two equations are linearly dependent, so we have a single equation to solve.

So from equation 2: a = [ (cosθ + 1) / sinθ ] b

So the ratio a/b is (cosθ +1)/ sinθ

But let me think about this. Let me consider the case when sinθ is not zero, which would be the case when theta is not 0 or pi. 

So, if sinθ ≠0, then a = [ (cosθ +1) / sinθ ] b.

Let me rewrite this as a = [ (1 + cosθ) / sinθ ] b.

Hmm, and 1 + cosθ = 2 cos²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So:

(1 + cosθ)/sinθ = [ 2 cos²(theta/2) ] / [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] = [ cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ) ] = cot(theta/2)

So a = cot(theta/2) * b

Which implies that a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] b

So the ratio a/b is cot(theta/2), so a = b cot(theta/2)

But perhaps it's easier to parameterize the eigenvector in terms of an angle. Alternatively, let's express the eigenvector as [ a, b ]^T = b [ a/b , 1 ]^T = b [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]^T

So, the eigenvector can be written as proportional to [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

Wait, but wait, perhaps another approach would be better. Let me think in terms of the direction of the eigenvector.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the eigenvectors in terms of spin states. The eigenstates for spin in a direction (theta, phi) are given by:

|+> = cos(theta/2) |↑> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |↓>
|-> = -i e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |↑> + cos(theta/2) |↓>

But in this problem, since the direction is in the x-z plane, phi is zero. So the eigenstate becomes:

|+> = cos(theta/2) |↑> + sin(theta/2) |↓>
|-> = -i sin(theta/2) |↑> + cos(theta/2) |↓>

Wait, but perhaps I should verify that. Because when phi is zero, the state becomes:

|+> = cos(theta/2) |↑> + sin(theta/2) e^{i0} |↓> = cos(theta/2)|↑> + sin(theta/2)|↓>

Which is the same as I wrote.

So the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 would be proportional to [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but wait. Let me confirm by applying P_n to this vector.

Wait, but P_n is the operator along direction n, which is in the x-z plane. So the eigenstates would be aligned along n, and thus the eigenvectors would have components as per the spin states.

So, the normalized eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 is:

[ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, perhaps multiplied by a phase factor. But the problem asks for the elements, not necessarily the phase.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but that's probably not normalized yet. Let me check the normalization.

The norm squared is cos²(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) = 1, so it's already normalized.

So the eigenvector would have elements (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but let me check the options again.

Options:

A) (√(2/3)ħ, √(1/3)ħ)
B) (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ)
C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))
D) (√(2/3)ħ cos(theta/2), √(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2))

Hmm, option C is just (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I derived.

But wait, the problem says to find the normalized eigenvector. So that's option C.

But wait, the way the operator was constructed, does it affect the eigenvectors? Let me think again.

Wait, but the operator P is a vector operator, and the eigenvectors are the same as those for the spin operator in that direction. So I think the approach is correct.

But wait, the operator P is given as P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. So the eigenvalues would be ± ħ/2, correct.

So the eigenvectors are the same as the eigenstates of spin along direction n, which is in the x-z plane. So for +eigenvalue, the eigenvector would be |+> as I wrote.

So the elements are (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

But wait, let me think again. The eigenvector I found has elements [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking at the options, option C says exactly that. So that must be the correct answer.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the direction vector can be parameterized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

### Step 1: Construct the operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$
The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is given by:
\[
\vec{P}_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z
\]
Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, and using the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$:
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix},
\]
we find:
\[
\vec{P}_n = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Solve for the eigenvector corresponding to $+\hbar/2$
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\vec{P}_n \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Substituting $\vec{P}_n$ into the equation:
\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$ and solving the resulting system of equations:
\[
\cos\theta \, a + \sin\theta \, b = a, \quad \sin\theta \, a - \cos\theta \, b = b.
\]
From these, we find that the eigenvector components satisfy:
\[
a = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \quad b = \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right).
\]

### Step 3: Normalize the eigenvector
The eigenvector is already normalized because:
\[
\cos^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) + \sin^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = 1.
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ — This does not match the derived eigenvector components.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ — This is the general form of spherical coordinates but does not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ — This matches the derived eigenvector components exactly.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ — This is not normalized correctly and does not match the derived eigenvector.

### Final Answer:
The normalized eigenvector is given by $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$, which corresponds to **Option C**.
