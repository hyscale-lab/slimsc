Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the spectroscopic data provided. Let me start by breaking down each piece of information.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. So that makes me think the compound has either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid group. But wait, a broad peak in that region is more typical of an alcohol's -OH stretching. However, carboxylic acids can also show a very broad peak, but sometimes they can be around 2500-3300 as a broad O-H stretch. Either way, there's an O-H group present.

Then, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 region is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. The 1650 peak might correspond to another carbonyl group, perhaps an amide or maybe an conjugated carbonyl, like in an aromatic ring (like an aromatic ketone or something with conjugation). Alternatively, maybe it's an absorption from an aromatic ring, but more likely another carbonyl. Hmm.

Moving on to the 1H NMR spectrum. There are several peaks, and importantly, some correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, so that suggests the compound has a double bond, possibly in a conjugated system, like an aromatic ring. Wait, but vinyl could also be part of an ester or something else.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. M/z 45 is a common fragment. Let me think about possible ions that give m/z 45. One possibility is CH3COO+ (which is 45, since 12+16+16+1=45). Alternatively, maybe an acetyl group or a ketene. Or, another possibility is the fragment being (CH2O2) as in something like HCOOCH3, but I'm not sure. Wait, 45 is also the molecular weight for C2H3O2+ or something like that. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is CH2O2, but I'm not certain. Let's think: 45 can be (CH3CO)+ which is 43, but wait 43 is CH3CO, but maybe it's part of a larger molecule. Alternatively, a fragment like CH2O2 would be 44, but wait that's not 45. Hmm. Another thought: the molecular ion for acetone is (C3H6O), but that's m/z 58. Wait, maybe 45 is from (C3H6O)+, no that's 58. Hmm, perhaps it's a different group. Alternatively, the fragment might be a ketone group. Wait, what's the molecular weight of (CH3)2CO? That's acetone, 58. Not 45. Alternatively, maybe methyl isocyanate? No, that's 59. Or maybe a smaller fragment. Let me think about the possible options.

Looking at the options, the possible formulas are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O2.

Let me list the degrees of unsaturation for each option. Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here.

For C6H12O: C=6, H=12, O=1.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2= 2/2=1.

So one DoU could be a ring or a double bond.

C6H10O: DoU = (14 -10)/2= 2.

So two DoUs: maybe a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

C6H10O2: DoU = (14 -10 - (2*2))/2? Wait, no. The formula is C6H10O2.

Wait, the general formula for DoU is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since X and N are zero here,

DoU = (2*6 + 2 -10 -0 +0)/2 = (14-10)/2= 4/2=2.

So two DoUs.

Similarly, C6H12O2: DoU= (14 -12)/2=1.

So, 1 DoU.

Now, from the NMR, there are vinyl hydrogens, so there's a double bond or maybe an aromatic ring. That would account for a DoU.

The FTIR shows a carbonyl (1700) and another peak at 1650. So that suggests two carbonyl groups? Or perhaps one carbonyl and something else. Wait, the 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like an aromatic ketone, or maybe a conjugated ester. Or it could be an amide, but more likely a carbonyl.

Wait, if there are two carbonyl peaks, that suggests two different carbonyl groups. So maybe an ester and a ketone, or a ketone and something else.

Wait, but wait: the 1700 cm^-1 is typically ester or ketone. 1650 could be another carbonyl, perhaps a conjugated one, maybe an aromatic ketone. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is a C=C stretching. Hmm, but the NMR says vinyl hydrogens, so the compound has a C=C.

Wait, but the FTIR peaks: 1700 and 1650. Let's think about possible functional groups.

- If the compound is an ester, the carbonyl is around 1700-1750. The 1650 might be an adjacent carbonyl, like in a conjugated system.

Alternatively, maybe the 1700 is from an ester, and the 1650 is from an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds (but that doesn't necessarily show a carbonyl peak).
