Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about the Michael addition reactions. I remember that Michael addition involves the attack of a nucleophile on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound, leading to the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond.

The problem has three parts, A, B, and C. Each part gives a different set of reactants and conditions, and I need to find the major products. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different possible products. Let's tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) and ethanol. I think NaOEt is a strong base, so it's likely deprotonating something to form an enolate. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form a strong enolate. The other component, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, is the Michael acceptor because it's an alpha-beta unsaturated ester.

So the Michael addition would involve the enolate of the malonate attacking the beta position of the acrylate. Let me draw this out. Dimethyl malonate is (CH3CO)2CHCOOEt or something similar? Wait, no, dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOEt)2. So when it forms the enolate, the base would deprotonate the central CH2, making a conjugated base. Then, this enolate would attack the beta carbon of the acrylate.

The acrylate is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so its structure would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OEt, but wait no, the formula is more like CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOEt? No, wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the double bond between carbons 2 and 3, with the p-tolyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt. Wait, no, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OEt? Or perhaps it's CH2=CH-CH2-OEt, but the p-tolyl is on the third carbon. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the positions.

Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-CH(p-tolyl)COOR? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-OEt?
