Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck but let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll think through it carefully.

The question describes a reaction involving Substance X, which reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W, a precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which I remember is about 4°C. Hmm, that's just above freezing point of water, which is 273 K, so 277 is a bit higher. So maybe B is a solid that's close to melting, like something that's a solid at room temp but melts just a little above freezing. I'm thinking maybe something like water, but that's 0°C. Alternatively, perhaps something like paraffin or another organic substance? Wait, melting point around 4°C—could it be something like ice? No, ice melts at 0. Maybe another compound... Hmm.

But let's look at the other parts. Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecule must have equal numbers of protons and neutrons. Wait, but each molecule is made up of atoms. So for each molecule, the sum of protons in the atoms equals the sum of neutrons. Alternatively, maybe each molecule has the same number of each? Like, for example, O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons in each molecule (since each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, so two atoms would make 16 each). Wait, but O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons in total per molecule. So that would satisfy the condition: same number of protons and neutrons (16 each). Another example could be H2O: each molecule has 2+8=10 protons, and neutrons are (each H has 0, each O has 8) so 0+8=8. So 10 protons vs 8 neutrons—not equal. So O2 is a possibility.

Wait, but another possibility is CO2. Each molecule has 1 C (6 protons, 6 neutrons) and 2 O (each 8 protons, 8 neutrons). Wait, wait, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So CO2 would have 6 + 2*8 = 22 protons. Neutrons would be 6 + 2*8=22 as well. Oh! So CO2 also has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So that could be possible. So gas W could be either O2 or CO2.

Wait, but let's think about the reaction. Substance X reacts with liquid Y to produce gas W. Then a precipitate G forms. When G is heated, it gives B. Also, the product of a keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms. So perhaps X is something like a base, reacting with an acid to produce water and a precipitate?

Wait, the question also says that substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X might be something like NH3, which is known to have isotopes, but maybe more likely, it's something like NaOH, but that's a guess. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH3CH2OH, but that's more of an alcohol. Hmm, but I'm getting ahead of myself.

Let's try to work through the information step by step.

1. The reaction of X with liquid Y produces gas W, precipitate G. When G is heated, it gives B whose melting point is ~277 K (4°C). So B is a solid that's just above freezing. Let's think of possible solids with that melting point.

2. Gas W: same number of protons and neutrons per molecule. So possible candidates are O2 (since each O has 8 p and 8 n; 2 O atoms would have 16 p and 16 n, so 16 each). Another is CO2, as earlier—each molecule has 22 p and 22 n. Also possible is something like NH3? Wait, NH3 has 14 p (N=7, H=1 each *3 -> 7 +3 =10 p?), no, wait, the molecule as a whole would have sum of protons. For NH3: N is 7 p, H each is 1, so total p=7+3=10. Neutrons: N has 7 neutrons, H has 0. So total n=7. So 10 p vs 7 n—not equal. So maybe O2 is a better option.

3. Let's think about the reaction. If X is reacting with a liquid Y to produce a gas and a precipitate. Let's think about common reactions. Perhaps X is a metal, Y is an acid, producing a gas (like CO2 or H2), and a precipitate (like a metal hydroxide? Or perhaps a sulfide, but that's less likely). Alternatively, X could be a base reacting with an acid.

Wait, but the product when a keto acid reacts with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. Keto acid is like acetic acid, which is CH3COOH. If X reacts with it, the product has 2 O atoms. Wait, perhaps it's a neutralization reaction. If X is a base like NaOH, then reacting with acetic acid (CH3COOH) would produce Na acetate (CH3COO-Na+) and water. So the product would be sodium acetate, which has formula CH3COO-Na. Wait, but the product of X and a keto acid contains 2 O atoms per
