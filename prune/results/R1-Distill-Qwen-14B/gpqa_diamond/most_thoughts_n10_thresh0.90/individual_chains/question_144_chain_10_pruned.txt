Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember mesons are subatomic particles, right? And a resonance means it's a particle that exists for a very short time before decaying. The question is asking about the mean decay distance of this meson X.

The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. I'm trying to recall the formula for the mean decay distance. Oh wait, I think decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. 

So, the mean decay length L would be the product of the lifetime τ and the velocity βc. The formula is L = βγ c τ. Wait, because velocity is βc, and gamma is the Lorentz factor. But wait, particles that are unstable have a mean lifetime τ, which is the proper lifetime. So when they're moving, their lifetime as observed is gamma multiplied by τ. So the time they live from our frame is gamma τ, and distance is velocity times time, which is βc * gamma τ. So L = βγ c τ. 

But wait, how do I find τ? Oh right, the width Γ is related to the mean lifetime. The uncertainty principle says Γ is the total decay width, and the mean lifetime τ is inversely proportional to Γ. The relation is τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, units! I have to make sure everything is in correct units.

Wait, let's think about the steps:

1. Calculate the mean lifetime τ.
2. Find the Lorentz factor gamma for the meson.
3. Find the velocity beta.
4. Compute L = beta * gamma * c * tau.

But wait, another thought: For a relativistic particle, the mean path length can also be calculated using another formula. I think the formula is L = c * tau * (E / m) * (1 / (Γ/(m)) )? No, that might not be right. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the decay length considering energy and width.

Wait, I recall that sometimes the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But let me make sure. The natural line width is Γ = ħ / τ. So yes, that's correct.

So first, compute τ = ħ / Γ. But I have to make sure the units are compatible. Let me think about the units. ħ is in units of GeV·seconds, I think. Let me remember the value of ħ: approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

So, Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So, τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s.

Calculating 6.582 / 0.32, let's see: 0.32 * 20 = 6.4, so 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So τ is approximately 20.56875e-25 seconds, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, no, wait: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 6.582 / 0.32 = approximately 20.56875, so τ is 20.56875e-25 seconds, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, no, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. So 6.582/0.32 is about 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait 6.582 divided by 0.32. Let me compute that:

0.32 × 20 = 6.4. 0.32 × 20.56875 = 6.582 because 0.32 × 0.56875 = 0.18199999... which added to 6.4 gives 6.581999, so 6.582. So correct.

So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Next step: find gamma and beta. Because the particle is produced with energy E, which is 8 GeV, and its rest mass m is 1.2 GeV.

The energy E is related to the relativistic gamma factor by E = gamma m c². Wait, but in units where c=1, E = gamma m, right? So gamma = E / (m c²), but since we're using GeV and masses in GeV/c², perhaps in these units, E = gamma m, so gamma is E/m.

Wait, E is given as 8 GeV, and m is 1.2 GeV/c². So gamma = E/(m c²) → but wait, let me think about units. If E is in GeV, and m is in GeV/c², then E = gamma m c² → gamma = E/(m c²). But in natural units where c=1, E=gamma m. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, in natural units (c=1, ħ=1), E (in GeV) is gamma m (GeV) since m is in GeV/c², so E = gamma m c². So in natural units, E = gamma m. So gamma = E/(m) because m is in GeV/c², and E is GeV. So here, gamma = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV/c² * (c²) → wait, no. Wait, perhaps more accurately:

E = gamma * m c² → gamma = E/(m c²). But when c is in m/s, and E is in GeV, m in GeV/c².

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute gamma as E/(m), because the units would work out. Let me see:

E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV/c². So gamma = E/(m c²) → but in units where c=1, it's E/(m).

Wait, so in this case, E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². So gamma = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV/c²) * (1/c²) → Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should approach it with formulas.

The relativistic energy is E = gamma m c². So gamma = E/(m c²). But m is given as m_X =1.2 GeV. Wait, wait, no. The mass is m_X=1.2 GeV/c². So the rest mass energy is m c² = 1.2 GeV.

So E = gamma m c^2 → gamma = E/(m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) = 6.666... So gamma is approximately 6.6667.

So gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... ≈ 6.6667.

Then, beta = v/c. Since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²), so beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/( (8/1.2)^2 )) ) = sqrt(1 - (1/(6.6667^2))).

Compute 6.6667 squared: 6.6667^2 = approx 44.4444. So 1/44.4444 ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The sqrt of that is about 0.9887.

Wait, let me compute more accurately: 6.6666667^2 is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.444444.

So 1 - (1/(400/9)) = 1 - (9/400) = (400-9)/400 = 391/400 = 0.9775.

So sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887.

But perhaps I should calculate it more precisely.

Compute 0.9775^0.5. Let's see, 0.9887^2 is about 0.9775. So beta is approximately 0.9887.

So now, L = beta * gamma * c * tau.

Wait, wait, let me make sure. Because L = beta gamma c tau.

Wait, no, the formula is L = v * gamma tau, because tau is the proper lifetime, so the lifetime observed is gamma tau. So distance is v * (gamma tau) = beta c gamma tau.

So L = beta gamma c tau.

So, let me compute each term:

beta ≈ 0.9887.

gamma ≈ 6.6667.

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So let's compute each part step by step.

First, compute beta * gamma: 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.604.

Then, multiply by c: 6.604 * 3e8 m/s → 1.9812e9 m/s.

Wait, no: 6.604 * 3e8 = 1.9812e9 m/s.

Then, multiply by tau: 1.9812e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

So that's 1.9812e9 * 2.056875e-24 = Let's compute that.

1.9812 * 2.056875 ≈ let's calculate:

1.9812 * 2 = 3.9624,

1.9812 * 0.056875 = approx 0.1127.

So total around 4.0751.

So 4.0751e(9-24) → 4.0751e-15 meters.

Wait, 1e9 * 1e-24 is 1e-15, correct.

So approximately 4.075e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 and option C is 5.0223e-15. So our calculation is about 4.075e-15, which is closest to option B, which is 4.0655e-15.

Wait, perhaps let me recalculate more accurately.

Compute beta more accurately.

Gamma is 8/1.2 = 20/3 ≈6.6666666667.

So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))) = sqrt(1 - (9/400)) )= sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(0.9775).

What's the exact value of sqrt(0.9775)?

Let me compute it.

Compute 0.9775^(1/2).

We can use the approximation:

sqrt(a + b) ≈ sqrt(a) + (b)/(2 sqrt(a)) when b is small.

Wait, a=0.9775, perhaps it's better to find exact square.

Alternatively, let's compute 0.9887^2 = (0.98)^2 + 2*(0.98)*(0.0087) + (0.0087)^2.

Wait, 0.9887^2 = (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98² + 2*0.98*0.0087 + 0.0087².

0.98² = 0.9604.

2*0.98*0.0087 = 2 * 0.008526 = 0.017052.

0.0087² ≈ 0.00007569.

Adding together: 0.9604 + 0.017052 = 0.977452 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.97752769.

Which is a bit higher than 0.9775. So 0.9887^2 ≈ 0.97752769, which is a bit more than 0.9775. So the actual sqrt(0.9775) would be a bit less than 0.9887, say approximately 0.98865.

Wait, perhaps using a better method. Let me compute the exact value.

We can compute sqrt(0.9775) using a calculator method.

Let me see, 0.988^2 = ?

0.988 * 0.988: 988 * 988.

Wait, 988 * 988 = ?

Let me compute 988 * 988:

= (1000 - 12)^2 = 1000² - 2*1000*12 + 12² = 1,000,000 - 24,000 + 144 = 976,144.

So 0.988^2 = 0.976144, which is less than 0.9775. So the square is 0.976144.

0.988^2 = 0.976144.

0.9885^2: let's compute.

0.9885 * 0.9885:

= (0.988 + 0.0005)^2 = 0.988^2 + 2*0.988*0.0005 + 0.0005^2.

= 0.976144 + 0.000988 + 0.00000025 = 0.976144 + 0.000988 = 0.977132 + 0.00000025 ≈0.97713225.

That's still less than 0.9775.

So 0.9885^2≈0.977132.

0.9886^2: Let's see.

0.9886 = 0.9885 + 0.0001.

So (0.9885 + 0.0001)^2 = 0.9885^2 + 2*0.9885*0.0001 + 0.0001^2.

= 0.97713225 + 0.0001977 + 0.00000001 ≈ 0.97732996.

Still less than 0.9775.

0.9887^2: 0.9886^2 is 0.97733, adding another 0.0001 in the delta.

Wait, perhaps the better approach is to compute the difference between 0.9775 and 0.97733, which is about 0.00017. So we need to find how much more than 0.9886 we need to
