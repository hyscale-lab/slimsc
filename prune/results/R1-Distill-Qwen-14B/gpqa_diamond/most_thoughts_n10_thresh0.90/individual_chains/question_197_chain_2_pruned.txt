Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus with HI is usually used for the hydrolysis of alkyl halides to produce alcohols, or maybe something else... Wait, no, wait. Oh right, when an alkyl halide reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it's a dehydrohalogenation reaction. Wait, no, wait. No, wait again. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of alkyl halides, but more specifically, maybe it's the hydrolysis of a vicinal dihalide. Or wait, I think another reaction: when an alkyl halide reacts with HI and red phosphorus, it goes through a substitution reaction, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's the reaction where a bromide or iodide is converted into an alcohol. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possible reaction type first.

Wait, another thought. Red phosphorus with HI is used for the dehydrohalogenation of vicinal dihalides to form alkenes. Oh wait, no, that's with NaOH and heat. Or maybe it's the Halolysis? I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Alternatively, I recall that when an alkyl halide reacts with HI in presence of red phosphorus, it's a type of substitution reaction where the P takes the halide, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. So, if Compound X is an alkyl halide, reacting with HI and red phosphorus would lead to maybe an elimination (if it's a vicinal dihalide) or a substitution. Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look at the IR and NMR data first, figure out what Compound X is, and then determine what the reaction does.

So, let's look at the IR data first. The IR has peaks at:

3400â€“2500 cm-1: That's a broad peak, likely from O-H stretching. But wait, that's a big region. Alternatively, it could be N-H or maybe an alkyne C-H stretch. But considering the other peaks, maybe it's an O-H stretch from a carbonyl, like a carboxylic acid, or maybe an alcohol.

Then, 1720 cm-1: That's a strong peak, probably a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. But wait, if the 1720 is around that area, could be a carbonyl. Also, 1610 and 1450 cm-1: These are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So, there's likely an aromatic ring in the compound.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H NMR:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5. That's usually indicative of an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, but sometimes higher. Alternatively, it could be an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid -OH, but that's usually a broad peak and can appear around 10-12 ppm. Wait, but wait. If it's a carboxylic acid, the -OH would be broad and maybe around 10-12 ppm, but I'm not certain. Also, maybe it's an aromatic proton adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group like a carbonyl.

Wait, but the integration is 1H. Hmm. Alternatively, if it's an aldehyde, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10, but a broad one could be something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton, like a phenolic -OH, but in that case, the peak might be broader and could be around 5-10 ppm, but again, not sure.

Next peak: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That's a classic aromatic quartet. It looks like a para-substituted benzene ring. The two doublets suggest two sets of equivalent protons, like in a para-substituted benzene. So, perhaps in a structure like p-xylene, but with substituents that cause the shifts.

So, looking at the NMR, the aromatic region shows two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So, the ring is para-substituted. The substituents would affect the chemical shifts. For example, if there's an electron-withdrawing group (like a carbonyl), the protons meta to it would be downfield shifted. Alternatively, if there's an electron-donating group, like a methyl, then the protons would be upfield.

Wait, but the 10.5 ppm peak could be a carbonyl adjacent to an aromatic ring, making it a ketone or an acid. Or maybe an aldehyde group attached to the ring. Wait, but 10.5 is a bit high for an aldehyde. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid. Let me think.

So, putting this together, the aromatic ring has two substituents in para positions. One of them could be a carbonyl group, perhaps a ketone or a carboxylic acid.

Other NMR peaks:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, maybe a CH group next to something. Maybe an adjacent CH2 or CH3.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Maybe a CH2 group, perhaps part of a chain next to an electronegative atom or group, like oxygen or a carbonyl.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of 3H as a doublet. That's probably a methyl group attached to a CH (like in isobutyl groups). So, for example, a CH(CH2CH3) group might have a methyl as a doublet around 1.4 ppm.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A terminal methyl group, perhaps part of an ethyl chain, like CH2CH3.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with a substituent that's a carbonyl group and another substituent that's an ethyl or isobutyl group.

Wait, let's consider the options given. The options are A, B, C, D. Let's look at them.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So, that's a benzene ring with an ethyl group at position 4 (para) and a propanoic acid group at position 2 (meta to the ethyl). Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid would have the phenyl group attached to the second carbon of the propanoic acid. So the structure would be CH2CH2COOH attached to the benzene ring. Hmm.

But in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm peak could be the carboxylic acid -OH, but wait, the integration is 1H. But a carboxylic acid would have a broad peak, but integrating to one proton would suggest perhaps an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone, but then the peak wouldn't be at 10.5.

Wait, but the 1720 cm-1 in IR is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-1, perhaps a bit higher. But 1720 is also in the range for an ester or ketone.

Wait, the IR also shows a peak at 1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1, which are indicative of aromatic C=C stretching. So, that's consistent with a benzene ring.

Now, looking at the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a single proton, which could be something else. Let's think: perhaps it's an aldehyde proton. If that's the case, then the structure might have a benzaldehyde
