Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the question involves exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. 

They detected a periodic shift in the spectral lines of each star. For planet #1, the shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Hmm. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull. The shift relates to the star's velocity towards and away from us. So a larger shift would mean a higher velocity.

Wait, but how does the velocity relate to the orbital period and the mass of the planet? I think I need to recall the formula related to the radial velocity method.

I remember that the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is given by the formula:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * something... Hmm, maybe I should look for a more precise formula.

Wait, another approach: the formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (2π G) / (c * P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

But since the planet masses are much smaller than the stars, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies a bit.

Since both stars have the same mass (M), and both planets have the same mass (m), let's see. So the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (m) / (M)^(2/3) * (1/P)^(1/3). 

Wait, but the formula for K is:

K = ( (G * (m_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + m_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(2π c)) )^(1/3) * (1/P)^(1/3) )? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the formula for K is:

K = [ (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2π)) ) * (1/P)^(1/3)

Wait, perhaps it's better to look up the exact formula. Oh wait, I can't actually look things up right now, but I'll try to remember correctly.

The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(2) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2π c)) ) * (1/P)^(1/3) )

Wait, no, maybe the correct formula
