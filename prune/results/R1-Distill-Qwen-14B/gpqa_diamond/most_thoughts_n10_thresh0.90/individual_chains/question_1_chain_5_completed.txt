Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see. The question is about the energy difference between two quantum states so that they can be clearly distinguished. Hmm.

So, the problem states that there are two states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. Wait, the lifetimes... I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle relates the energy of a particle to the precision of its measurement. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle! It says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of ħ/2, but often approximated as ΔEΔt ≈ ħ. 

So, the uncertainty in energy depends on the lifetime of the state because the lifetime is the time over which the energy is measured. The longer the lifetime, the more precisely the energy can be measured because there's more time to observe it, leading to a smaller uncertainty. Alternatively, a shorter lifetime means a larger uncertainty in energy.

The question is asking for the energy difference that allows us to clearly resolve the two states. That means the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state, right? Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, we wouldn't be able to distinguish them.

Wait, but each state has its own lifetime. So the uncertainty in energy for each state would be based on their respective lifetimes. Let me think: for state E1 with a lifetime τ1 = 1e-9 seconds, the uncertainty ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(τ1). Similarly, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(τ2), where τ2 is 1e-8 seconds.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So we need the difference |E2 - E1| to be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe each's uncertainty? Or maybe the maximum of the two uncertainties?

Alternatively, perhaps the energy resolution is determined by the shorter lifetime. Because the state with the shorter lifetime has a larger uncertainty. So if the difference is larger than the uncertainty of the state with the shorter lifetime, we can resolve them. Let me think more.

Suppose the two states have different uncertainties. The state with the shorter lifetime (E1) has a larger uncertainty (since ΔE ≈ ħ/τ, so shorter τ means larger ΔE). So if the energy difference is larger than the larger uncertainty, then the two states can be distinguished. Because even the state with the larger uncertainty would have a width that's less than the energy difference.

Wait, wait. Let me get this right. The energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty of the state with the shorter lifetime. Because the uncertainty is larger for the shorter-lived state. So, if the energy difference is bigger than ΔE1, which is bigger than ΔE2, then the two states can be resolved.

So, let's compute the uncertainties. I'll need the value of ħ. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. Then ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s.

So, for E1: τ1 = 1e-9 s. So ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (1.055e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.055e-25 J. Hmm, but the options are given in eV. So I need to convert J to eV.

1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So to convert J to eV, divide by 1.602e-19.

So ΔE1 = 1.055e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.58e-7 eV. Wait, that's 6.58e-7 eV. That's 0.658e-6 eV, which is about 0.658 micro-eV.

Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 1e-9 seconds is 1 nanosecond. So let's compute 1.055e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.055e-25 J. Then divide by 1.602e-19 to get eV: (1.055e-25)/(1.602e-19) = approx (1.055 / 1.602) * 1e-6 = 0.658 * 1e-6 eV. Yep, so about 6.58e-7 eV, or 0.658 micro-eV.

Similarly, for τ2 =1e-8 seconds, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = (1.055e-34) / (1e-8) = 1.055e-26 J. Convert to eV: 1.055e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.58e-8 eV. That's 0.658e-7 eV, about 0.0658 micro-eV.

So the uncertainty for E1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, and for E2 it's about 6.58e-8 eV.

Now, the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties to be clearly distinguishable. Or wait, wait. Because each state has its own uncertainty, the energy difference must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or perhaps the maximum of the two? Hmm. Let me think about how energy resolution works.

In spectroscopy, for example, the resolving power depends on the energy spread. If two peaks are being observed, each with their own linewidths, the minimum energy difference between them for resolution is roughly the sum of their half-widths. So, the energy difference ΔE should be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

But in this case, the problem says "clearly distinguish these two energy levels." So the energy difference should be greater than the sum of the two uncertainties.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Another approach: the uncertainty principle says that the time of measurement defines the energy uncertainty. If you have two states, the precision in energy measurement is determined by the longer of the two lifetimes? Or the shorter?

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty of the state with the shorter lifetime because that's the larger uncertainty. Because if the difference is larger than the larger uncertainty, then they can be separated. So perhaps the difference must be larger than the larger ΔE.

Wait, let's think in terms of the energy spectrum. Each state has a certain width. The state with the shorter lifetime has a broader line. The other state has a narrower line. The separation between the two lines must be larger than the sum of their half-widths for them to be resolved.

So, the energy difference ΔE should be greater than (ΔE1 + ΔE2) for them to be resolvable.

Wait, in that case, let's compute ΔE1 + ΔE2.

ΔE1 is 6.58e-7 eV, ΔE2 is 6.58e-8 eV. So sum is approximately 7.24e-7 eV.

So the energy difference needs to be greater than about 7.24e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 → 0.001 meV. That's way smaller than 7e-7 eV, so not enough.

B) 1e-11 eV → 0.01e-9 → 0.01 neV. Also way too small.

C) 1e-4 eV → which is 1e-4 eV → 100 meV. That's way bigger than 7e-7.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.01e-7 → 0.01 micro-eV.

Wait, but wait, our calculated sum is about 7.24e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be greater than that. The options are A: 1e-9 (0.001e-6), B: 1e-11 (0.00001e-6), C:1e-4 (1e4 eV?), wait no, 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV, which is 100 meV, which is way bigger. D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.01e-6 eV, which is 0.01 micro-eV.

So none of the options except C is larger than 7.24e-7 eV. But C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is way larger than the needed 7.24e-7. So that would definitely be resolvable.

Wait, but let's think again. Wait, the question says "their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved." So perhaps the energy difference just needs to be larger than the uncertainty of the state with the shorter lifetime, because that's the dominant uncertainty. Because if the energy difference is larger than the maximum uncertainty, then it's resolvable.

Wait, the state with the shorter lifetime (E1) has a larger uncertainty in energy. So the energy difference must be larger than ΔE1 to be resolvable. Because if the difference is larger than the maximum uncertainty, then the two states won't overlap.

So, in that case, the required ΔE is larger than 6.58e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV = 0.0001 eV = 100 meV. That's way bigger than 6.58e-7 eV.

Option C is 1e-4 eV. So the energy difference is much larger than the required uncertainty, so the states can be resolved.

Looking at the other options:

A) 1e-9 eV is 0.001 micro-eV, which is much smaller than 6.58e-7 eV, so not enough.

B) 1e-11 eV is even smaller. So definitely too small.

D) 1e-8 eV is 0.01 micro-eV, which is still smaller than 6.58e-7 eV.

So the only option that provides an energy difference larger than the required uncertainty is option C.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think about the units again. 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV, which is 100 meV. That seems like a lot. But in terms of the uncertainty, which is 6.58e-7 eV, it's much larger. So the energy difference in option C is way beyond the needed threshold.

So the correct option is C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish the two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) to the lifetime (\( \tau \)) of the state: 

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau}.
\]

Here, \( \hbar \) (reduced Planck's constant) is approximately \( 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). The lifetimes of the two states are \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). Converting the uncertainties to electron volts (eV) using \( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \), we calculate:

1. For \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} \, \text{J} = 1.055 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to eV:
   \[
   \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \, \text{eV} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. For \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} \, \text{J} = 1.055 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to eV:
   \[
   \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \, \text{eV} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties, \( \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \). Calculating the sum:
\[
\Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.58 \times 10^{-7} + 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, we evaluate the options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.001 \, \mu\text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.00001 \, \mu\text{eV} \), which is even smaller than Option A. Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), or \( 100 \, \text{meV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.01 \, \mu\text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

The only option that provides an energy difference greater than the required threshold is **Option C**.
