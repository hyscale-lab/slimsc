Okay, let's try to tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it step by step.

So the problem is about finding the probability of measuring the electron in certain eigenstates and the average value of an operator. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand.

Alright, the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So I think that means it's not normalized yet. I'll probably need to normalize it first. The operator's matrix elements are given as A_ij = ħ/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so that's a 2x2 matrix. Let me write it out.

For a two-level system, the basis states are |up> and |down>, which are the eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. So the operator A would have zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. So the matrix would look like:

[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2 0 ]

Wait, no. Because if i != j, then A_ij is ħ/2. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonals (i=j) are zero, and the off-diagonals are ħ/2. So yeah, that's correct.

Now, I think the first part is to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate of operator A. Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the operator's eigenstates are not the same as |up> and |down>, right? Because A is a different operator, not the z-projection. Oh right, because the eigenstates of A would be different.

So, the problem says: "the eigenstates of the operator whose matrix is..." So the operator is A, and we need to find the probabilities of measuring the electron in each of the eigenstates of A. Then, find the average value of A.

Hmm. So the process would be:

1. Find the eigenstates of operator A.
2. Express the state |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates.
3. The coefficients' magnitudes squared will give the probabilities.
4. The average value is the expectation value of A, which can be found using the state |alpha> and the matrix A.

Alternatively, because expectation value is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues. So maybe I can find the eigenvalues and eigenstates of A, then compute the expectation.

First, let's handle the state |alpha>. It's given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So I need to normalize it.

Compute the norm: |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2.

|1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.
|2 -i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5.
So total is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is sqrt(7).

So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, operator A has the matrix [ [0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0] ].

Wait, no, let me think. The matrix elements are given as A_ij = ħ/2 if i != j, else 0. So the matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]] as I thought.

What are the eigenvalues and eigenstates of A?

The matrix A is symmetric, so it's diagonalizable with orthogonal eigenvectors. Let me find the eigenvalues.

The characteristic equation is det(A - λ I) = 0.

So determinant of [ -λ, ħ/2; ħ/2, -λ ] is λ² - (ħ²/4) = 0 → λ² = ħ²/4 → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Now, find the eigenvectors.

For λ = ħ/2:
(A - λ I) v =0 → [ -ħ/2, ħ/2; ħ/2, -ħ/2 ] v =0.

So the equations are -ħ/2 v1 + ħ/2 v2 =0 → -v1 + v2 =0 → v2 =v1.

So eigenvectors are proportional to (1,1). Similarly, for λ=-ħ/2, the equations give -v1 - v2=0 → v2 = -v1. So eigenvectors are (1, -1).

Wait, let me confirm. For λ= ħ/2:

Equation 1: (-λ) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 → (-ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2=0 → -v1 + v2 =0 → v2 =v1.

Similarly, equation 2: (ħ/2) v1 - (ħ/2) v2=0 → same as equation 1.

So the eigenvectors can be written as (1,1). Similarly for the other eigenvalue, (1,-1).

But wait, I should normalize them.

So the eigenvectors are:

|u1> = ( |up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2),

|u2> = ( |up> - |down> ) / sqrt(2).

So these are the eigenstates of A.

Now, the state |alpha> is expressed in the |up> and |down> basis. I need to express |alpha> in terms of |u1> and |u2>, because the probabilities are the square of the coefficients when written in this basis.

So let me write |alpha> as a combination of |u1> and |u2>.

Alternatively, we can compute the inner products <u1|alpha> and <u2|alpha> to find the expansion coefficients.

Let me compute <u1| alpha >.

< u1 | alpha > = [ <up| + <down| ] / sqrt(2) * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ].

So,

= [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * <up|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) <down|up> ] / sqrt(2)

+ [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|down> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) <down|down> ] / sqrt(2).

Wait, no, actually:

Wait, no. More accurately, <u1|alpha> = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

So, the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) <up|down> + (1+i)/sqrt(7) <down|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) <down|down> ]

But <up|down> is zero, and <up|up> = <down|down> =1.

So simplifying:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) *1 + 0 + 0 + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) *1 ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i + 2 -i ) / sqrt(7) ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (3) / sqrt(7) ]

= 3/( sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) ) ) = 3 / sqrt(14)

Wait, 1+i + 2 -i = 3? Let me check that. 1 +2 is 3, i -i is 0. Yep. So that's correct.

Similarly, compute <u2| alpha >.

< u2 | alpha > = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| - <down| ) ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

So similarly:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) <up|down> - (1+i)/sqrt(7) <down|up> - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) <down|down> ]

Again, <up|down> and <down|up> are zero.

So it becomes:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) *1 - (2 -i)/sqrt(7)*1 ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1 +i -2 +i ) / sqrt(7) ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(7) ]

= (-1 + 2i) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )

= (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14)

So now, the coefficients are c1 = 3/sqrt(14) and c2 = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, |alpha> is written as c1 |u1> + c2 |u2>.

So the probabilities are |c1|^2 and |c2|^2.

Compute |c1|^2:

(3/sqrt(14))^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Wait, 9 divided by 14 is approximately 0.642857. Hmm, but looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which sums to 1. So 9/14 is about 0.642857, which is close to 0.64, but let's see what the other coefficient is.

Compute |c2|^2:

(-1 + 2i) is a complex number. Its magnitude squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 =1 +4=5. So |c2|^2 =5/(14) ≈0.3571.

Wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.3571, which is about 0.36. So the probabilities would be approximately 0.643 and 0.357.

Wait, but wait, 9/14 is 0.642857..., which is 0.642857, which is about 0.643, but the options have 0.64 and 0.36 as option A. So that's close.

So the probabilities would be 9/14 ≈0.643 and 5/14≈0.357. So approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A is 0
