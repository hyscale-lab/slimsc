Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to unpack it step by step. Hmm, the question is a bit complicated, but I'll take it slowly.

The problem starts by talking about Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. I remember that isotopes are variants of elements with the same number of protons but different neutrons. So, Substance X has an element with a heavier isotope. That suggests maybe something like Cl-35 and Cl-37, where Cl typically has 35 as the common isotope but sometimes 37.

Then, Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, same number of n and p. Let's think: for a molecule, each atom contributes. But if the molecule is something simple like H2O, no. Wait, wait, the molecule itself has the same number of neutrons and protons. So per molecule, the sum of all protons equals the sum of all neutrons.

Wait, but each atom contributes protons and neutrons. Let's consider possible gases. For example, H2? No, hydrogen has 1 proton each, so 2 in total. Neutrons? Hydrogen-1 has 0 neutrons. So H2 has 2 protons, 0 neutrons. Not same. So maybe something else.

Wait, another possibility: CO2? No, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something like O2 or N2? Let's see. O has atomic number 8, so each O atom has 8 protons. O's common isotope is O-16, which has 8 neutrons. So each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So yes, same number. So gas W could be O2. Or maybe another diatomic gas.

Wait, but another thought: maybe the molecule is something else. Let's say the molecule has one atom. Like, if it's a monoatomic gas. Then the number of protons equals the number of neutrons for that atom. So, for example, carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. So if W is C, but that's a solid, not a gas usually. Or maybe carbon monoxide? No, that's a molecule. Wait, maybe the gas is carbon dioxide, but CO2 is a molecule, so each atom contributes. Alternatively, maybe it's another molecule where the sum of protons equals sum of neutrons.

Wait, another approach: which common gases have molecules where the sum of protons equals sum of neutrons? Let's think of H2O. H2O has 2 H (each with 1 p, 0 n) and 1 O (8 p, 8 n). So total protons: 2 +8=10. Neutrons: 0 +8=8. Not equal. So no.

What about CH4? Each C is 6 p, 6 n (if C-12). Each H is 1 p, 0 n. So CH4: 6 +4*(1) =10 p; 6 +0 =6 n. Not equal.

Wait, maybe CO. C has 6 p, 6 n (if C-12), O has 8 p, 8 n (O-16). So CO: 14 p, 14 n. So that's a molecule where total protons and neutrons are equal. So gas W could be CO. But wait, CO is a gas under certain conditions, but maybe it's more about something more common like O2 or another.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is NH3? No, it's not a diatomic. Let me think again. Suppose the molecule is O2: each O has 8 p, 8 n (assuming O-16). So two O atoms: 16 p, 16 n. So protons equal neutrons, so that fits. So W could be O2.

Wait, but O2 is a diatomic gas. So that's a possibility. Alternatively, maybe it's nitrogen gas, N2. N has 7 p, 7 n (if N-14). So two N atoms: 14 p, 14 n. That also fits. So W could be either O2 or N2. Alternatively, maybe CO2? Let's check: CO2 has one C and two O. C is 6 p, 6 n; each O is 8 p, 8 n. So total protons: 6 + 2*8=22. Neutrons: 6 + 2*8=22. So yes, CO2 also works. So gas W could be CO2.

But wait, let's think about the reaction. If X reacts with Y to produce W and precipitate G. I know that when metals react with acids, they produce hydrogen gas, but in this case, the gas produced is W, which could be H2, but earlier we saw that H2 doesn't fit the neutron and proton condition. Because H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. So that's not the case.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the gas is something like Cl2. Cl has 17 p. The common isotope is Cl-35 (18 n) and Cl-37 (20 n). So Cl2 would have 34 p and 36 n (if both are Cl-35: 35 neutrons each, so 70 total n), but wait that's not equal. So that wouldn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, what if W is CH4
