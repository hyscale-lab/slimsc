Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand.

So there's this uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and it's smaller than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. 

Point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and both L and l are greater than R. Oh, and there's an angle theta between l and s. 

I remember that when charges are placed inside cavities of conductors, the behavior of the electric field outside depends on whether the conductor is conducting and whether it's charged or not. Since the conductor is uncharged, I think charges would redistribute in a specific way.

Wait, so the conductor is uncharged, but there's a charge inside the cavity. How does that affect things? Oh right, in electrostatics, the charges inside a conductor's cavity will induce charges on the inner surface of the conductor. But since the conductor itself is uncharged, the induced charges must balance out in a way.

Let me think. The conductor is neutral, so the charges induced on the inner surface must exactly cancel the charge inside the cavity. So, the inner surface would have a charge of -q, right? Because the charge inside is +q, and the conductor's total charge is zero, so the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q to balance it. But wait, no. Wait, conductor is neutral. So when a charge +q is inside the cavity, it induces -q on the inner surface, and since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q, because the total charge of the conductor is zero. So inner surface: -q, outer surface: +q.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The conductor as a whole is neutral, so the induced charges must sum to zero. The charge inside the cavity is +q. The inner surface of the conductor must have a charge of -q, because that's induced by the +q. Then, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to make the total charge of the conductor zero (since it's uncharged), because -q (inner) + +q (outer) = 0.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the outer surface has a charge +q. So when considering a point outside the conductor, the electric field would be due to the outer charge, which is +q. So the field outside would be as if the charge is at the center of the conductor, right? Because the outer surface's charge distribution is spherical, so it behaves like a point charge at the center.

Wait, but the cavity is not at the center. Oh, but the outer surface's charge distribution is induced in such a way that it's symmetric. Because the conductor is a sphere, so any induced charges on the inner surface would cause the outer surface to be symmetric. So the outer surface would have a uniform charge distribution, making the electric field outside just that of a point charge q at the center.

But wait, point P is outside the conductor. So the electric field at P would be due to the charge on the outer surface, which is +q, treated as if it's at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but the point P's position is at a distance L from the conductor's center, but the cavity's center is separated by s from the conductor's center. So the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and the angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, but if the outer surface has a charge of +q and is a sphere, then the electric field outside should be as if the charge is at the center of the conductor. So the electric field at P, which is outside, would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²). Because L is the distance from P to the center of the conductor.

But wait, looking at the options, option B is exactly this. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but why is there an option involving l and theta? Let me think again. If the charge is inside the cavity, which is off-center, does that affect the outer field?

Ah, I remember: in the case of a spherical conductor with a cavity, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface. So the location of the inner charge doesn't affect the external field. Because the inner charge only induces a charge on the inner surface, and the outer surface's charge is +q. So the external field is as if the charge is at the center.

But wait, that's only when the conductor is a perfect sphere. If the cavity is off-center, but the outer surface remains symmetric, then yes. The outer surface's charge distribution is uniform, so the field outside is as if it's a point charge at the center.

So in the problem, point P is outside, so E is due to the outer charge, which is +q, so E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Looking at the options, option B is this.

Wait, but what are the other options? Option A has (l - s cosθ) squared. That would be if the charge was at the cavity's center, but the field outside would be from the outer charge, which is at the center of the conductor.

So yeah, I think B is correct.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity inside. The cavity is offset from the center of the conductor by a distance $s$, and a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor and a distance $l$ from the center of the cavity. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

When a charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity of an uncharged spherical conductor, it induces a charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge $+q$ to maintain charge neutrality. The electric field outside the conductor is determined by the charge on the outer surface, which is distributed uniformly due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor. This means the electric field at any point outside the conductor behaves as if the charge $+q$ is located at the center of the conductor.

The distance from the point $P$ to the center of the conductor is $L$, and the electric field at $P$ is therefore given by:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

This matches option B. The other options are incorrect because they involve distances or angles related to the cavity's center ($l$, $s$, and $\theta$), which do not affect the electric field outside the conductor. The field outside depends only on the total charge on the outer surface, which is $+q$, and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.

Answer: B
