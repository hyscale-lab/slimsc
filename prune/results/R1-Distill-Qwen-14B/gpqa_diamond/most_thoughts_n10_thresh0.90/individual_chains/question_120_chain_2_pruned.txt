Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, parallax is something I remember from my studies. Let me think. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh wait, right, the formula is that distance (in parsecs) is 1 divided by parallax (in arcseconds). So distance d = 1/plx.

But wait, the question isn't directly about distance. It's about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So like, if I look at a range of parallax values, how does the count of stars in each such range change as plx changes?

The options are A to D, each with different exponents. So the question is about the functional dependence of the number density of stars on parallax.

Let me try to model this. I think the number of stars in a certain range of distances (or parallaxes) depends on the volume of space you're considering. Volume increases with the cube of distance because volume scales with radius cubed.

Wait, so if I consider a shell at a distance d with thickness dr, the volume of that shell would be approximately 4πd² dr. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the derivative with respect to r (which is dr) gives 4πr² dr. So each shell's volume depends on d squared times dr.

But parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance d. So d = 1/plx. So dr would be the derivative of d with respect to plx? Wait, let's see. If d = 1/plx, then dr/dplx = -1/(plx²). So a small change in plx corresponds to a change in d. But I'm more interested in how the number of stars relates to plx.

Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density (stars per unit volume) is uniform. So the number of stars in a volume is proportional to the volume.

So the number of stars in a shell between plx and plx + dplx would be proportional to the volume of that shell. But wait, the shell is a thin slice in terms of parallax. So perhaps I need to express the volume in terms of plx.

Let me think again. The volume of a thin shell in distance is 4πd² dd. But since we're considering a change in parallax, d is 1/plx, and dd is the change in distance for a small change in plx. Alternatively, maybe I should express the volume in terms of plx.

Since d = 1/plx, then dd = -1/(plx^2) dplx. Wait, because d = 1/plx, so the derivative dd/dplx = -1/(plx²). So, dd = -(1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases.

But the volume element in terms of plx would be 4πd² dd. Substituting d=1/plx, d² is 1/plx². And dd is (-1/plx²) dplx. So putting it all together:

Volume dV = 4π (1/plx²) * (-1/plx²) dplx
Wait, but I think I might be mixing up variables. Let me re-express the shell volume in terms of plx. So, for a small change in plx (dplx), what is the corresponding change in distance (dd), and hence the volume.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of stars per unit parallax range.

The number of stars in a shell with parallax between plx and plx + dplx is proportional to the volume of that shell. The volume of the shell at distance d (where d=1/plx) is 4πd² dd. So, substituting d=1/plx, and dd = (dd/dplx) dplx.
