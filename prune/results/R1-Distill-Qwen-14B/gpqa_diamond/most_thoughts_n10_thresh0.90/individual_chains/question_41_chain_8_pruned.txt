Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the lab.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's when the medium is stationary. What if the medium is moving?

Oh right, this is about how the speed of light is measured in a moving medium. I think in the case where the medium is moving, you have to consider the velocity addition formulas from special relativity. But I'm a bit confused about how to apply them here.

Wait, but let's get the basics right. The speed of light in the glass is v1 = c/n. Since the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light, which is towards the observer. So the observer is in the lab frame, and the glass is moving with velocity v relative to the lab.

I think the key here is to find the speed of the light relative to the lab. So in the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at c/n. But when the glass is moving, the lab sees a different speed.

Wait, but according to special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. The velocity addition formula comes into play. The formula is (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c²). But wait, in which frame are these velocities measured?

Wait, let me clarify. Let's set up the frames. Let the lab be the stationary frame S, and the glass's frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to S. In the glass frame, the light has velocity u' = c/n towards the observer. Wait, but wait, the direction matters here.

Wait, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So both the glass and the light are moving towards the observer. Or maybe the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the observer is in front of the direction of motion of the glass and light.

Wait, the problem says the glass is moving towards the observer. So the observer is on the same side as the direction of the glass's velocity. And the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, meaning towards the observer.

So from the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n towards the observer. Now, in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass (but wait, the lab is stationary, and the glass is moving at v relative to the lab), so the lab's frame is S, and glass frame S' is moving at velocity v in the +x direction (towards the observer).

Wait, no, wait, the glass is moving towards the observer, so in the lab frame S, the glass's velocity is v (towards the observer). So in S', which is the glass's frame, the lab is moving at -v. 

So in S', the speed of light is c/n towards the observer. Let me think: in S', the light's velocity is u' = c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion. But wait, in S', if the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, which is the same as the lab's motion relative to S'? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the lab frame. In the lab, the glass is moving at velocity v. The light in the glass is moving at c/n relative to the glass. So from the lab's perspective, the speed of the light would be the sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity in the glass's frame, but adjusted for relativity.

Wait, but I remember the relativistic velocity addition formula. If an object has velocity u in the frame S' (moving at velocity v relative to S), then in S, the velocity u' is given by (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²
