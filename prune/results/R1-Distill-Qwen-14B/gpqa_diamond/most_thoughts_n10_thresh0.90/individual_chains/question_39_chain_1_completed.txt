Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says that each particle has a wave function given by (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measure the position, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this interval, but it's given as this expression. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait, no, the wave function as given is valid where the particle can exist. So the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. Because otherwise, the part outside (x<1 and x>3) wouldn't have any probability of finding the particle, right?

So the wave function must satisfy the normalization condition. The integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1. That's the standard normalization condition for wave functions. So I need to compute the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 and set it equal to 1 to find a.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Let me write that out properly. ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) - 0.5i. Wait, but wait, is that a real function? Or is it complex? Because I see an 'i' there. Oh, right, 'i' is the imaginary unit. So ψ(x) is a complex function.

The absolute square is ψ*(x) * ψ(x), where * denotes the complex conjugate. So let's compute that.

So ψ(x) = (a/(sqrt(1+x))) - 0.5i. The complex conjugate ψ*(x) would be (a/(sqrt(1+x))) + 0.5i.

Multiplying them together: ψ*ψ = [a/(sqrt(1+x)))]² + (0.5)^2 + [a/(sqrt(1+x)))]*(-0.5i) + [a/(sqrt(1+x)))]*(0.5i) ?

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute it properly. Let me write it as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5)i. So when you multiply ψ*(x) and ψ(x), it's (a/sqrt(...))² plus (0.5)^2 minus i times (a/sqrt(...)) times 0.5 and i times the same but with a minus. Wait, perhaps it's easier to just compute the product as (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5i)^2 + terms that might cancel. Wait, no, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the cross terms cancel out. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe because the wave function is ψ = A + B i, then ψ*ψ = (A + B i)(A - B i) ) = A² + B². Ah! Yes, right. Because (A + iB)(A - iB) = A² + B². So that's much easier.

So in this case, A is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and B is 0.5. So the absolute square is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

So |ψ(x)|² = [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

Now, the integral of this from x=1 to x=3 should be 1.

Wait, but wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, and we're told that the particle exists only between x=1 and x=3. So ψ(x) is zero outside this interval. Wait, but the wave function given is non-zero there, but perhaps the actual wave function is zero elsewhere. Hmm, but the problem says that the wave function in the part where it can exist is as given. So maybe the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3. So the integral is from 1 to 3.

So the normalization condition is ∫ (from 1 to 3) [a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Now, let's compute that integral.

Let me split the integral into two parts:

Integral [a²/(1+x) dx] from 1 to 3 + Integral [0.25 dx] from 1 to 3.

The first integral: a² ∫ dx/(1+x) from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So from 1 to 3, it's ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So the first part is a² ln(2).

The second integral: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3. That's 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2=0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Then a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(0.7213) more accurately. Let's see.

0.85 squared is 0.7225. Oh, that's very close to 0.7213. So a is approximately 0.85.

So the answer should be option B) 0.85.


To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i,
\]

and the normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

Since the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the wave function is zero outside this interval. Thus, the integral reduces to:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

The absolute square of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

Splitting the integral into two parts:

1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_{1}^{3} = a^2 \ln(4) - a^2 \ln(2) = a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5.
   \]

Adding these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
