Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I'm supposed to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I remember that relativistic mechanics are a bit tricky, especially when dealing with velocities and energies. 

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The options are A to D, each giving different relative speed and total energy. 

First, I think I need to find the relative speed between them. Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't the same as classically adding the velocities. Oh right, because velocities don't just add up normally when they're a significant fraction of the speed of light. So I should use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. 

The formula is v_rel = (v2 - v1) / (1 - (v2 v1)/c²). Wait, but which way are they moving? Both are in the positive x-direction, so v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c. Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait: if they're moving in the same direction, then from the perspective of the first astronaut (the 2m one), the second (3m) is moving slower. So I think the relative velocity would be the difference, but adjusted for relativity. 

Wait, let me make sure. The velocity u is of the second object as seen from the first's frame. So using the formula: u = (v2 - v1) / (1 - (v2 v1)/c²). Let me plug in the values. 

v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So u = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Wait, that gives u = (-0.1c) / (1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²)) ) → (-0.1c)/(1-0.3) → (-0.1c)/(0.7) → approximately -0.1429c. But since speed is a magnitude, the relative speed is 0.1429c, which is about 0.14c. Wait, but that would mean the relative speed is about 0.14c in the negative direction, but speed is positive, so it's 0.14c. Looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. 

Wait, but when I calculated the value, it came to approximately 0.1429c, which is about 0.14c, so that's correct. So the relative speed is 0.14c, which matches options C and D. So that's one part done. 

Now for the total energy of the system. Hmm, total energy in relativity includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Wait, but since this is a system, perhaps we need to calculate the total energy as the sum of each astronaut's energy. Or wait, no, because in relativity, energy isn't just additive in different frames. Oh wait, but here, we're just considering each in their own rest frames, but perhaps the problem is asking for the sum of their energies in the same frame. Let me see.

Wait, the question says "the total energy of the system." So I think it's referring to the sum of their energies in the same reference frame. So perhaps the rest frame of the combined system, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's the sum from the lab frame where they are moving. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify which frame. Oh, wait, maybe the lab frame is the one where the astronauts are moving as given. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. 

Wait, the problem gives each astronaut's speed in the positive x-direction, but I think the frame of reference is the lab frame, perhaps, where both are moving relative to it. So the total energy would be the sum of their relativistic energies in that frame. So each astronaut's energy is gamma * m c², where m is their rest mass, and gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c): gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2) ) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So their energy is E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.25)) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding them together: E_total = 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc^2, which matches this. So the total energy would be 5.96 mc², and relative speed 0.14c. So the correct option would be C.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there any other considerations? Like, if the system's rest frame is different? Hmm, but the problem says "the total energy of the system." If the system is considered in its center of momentum frame, then the total energy would be the sum of their rest energies plus any kinetic energy, but I think that's more complicated and probably unnecessary here. Since the given options suggest E is around 5.96, which is the sum of their energies in the lab frame where they are moving, I think that's the intended approach. So the answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} = -0.1429c
\]

Since speed is a magnitude, the relative speed is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c
\]

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
