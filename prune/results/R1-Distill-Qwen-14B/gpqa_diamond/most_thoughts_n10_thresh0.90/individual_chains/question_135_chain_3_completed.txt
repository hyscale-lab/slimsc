Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by this Lagrangian term: L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I'm misreading that. Let me parse it again. Oh, probably it's L(y) = -λ ψ_f(y) (X(y) + υ) ψ_f(y). Or wait, maybe it's more like the Yukawa coupling term. Oh right, the standard Yukawa interaction is something like L = -g ψ ψ X, where X is the scalar field. So in this case, the Lagrangian is L = -λ f ψ_f (X + υ) ψ_f. So that's like a Yukawa coupling where the fermion ψ_f couples to the boson X with coupling λ, and perhaps υ is a constant, maybe the vacuum expectation value?

Anyway, the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, what can X decay into?

I remember that in particle physics, when a boson decays, it must produce particles that are lighter than the mass of the boson. So the mass of X is 6 GeV, so any decay products must have a combined mass less than 6 GeV.

Wait, but wait—since X is a boson, what kind of particles can it decay into? If X is a scalar boson, like the Higgs, it can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, right? Because the Higgs couples to fermions. So in this case, X must couple to some fermions because the Lagrangian shows an interaction term with ψ_f.

So the possible decay products are fermion-antifermion pairs. Each pair must have a mass such that the sum is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Wait, no, not exactly. Because each fermion has a mass, so for each pair of fermions, the sum of their rest masses must be less than the mass of X. Because in the rest frame of X, the decay products must have enough energy to create their rest mass. So for a fermion-antifermion pair, each fermion has mass m, so the combined mass is 2m. So 2m ≤ 6 GeV, so m ≤ 3 GeV.

So looking at all the known fermions, which ones have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV?

Let's list the fermions and their masses.

Leptons:
- Electron (e-): about 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ-): about 0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ-): about 1.777 GeV

Quarks:
- Up (u): ~0.003 GeV (current mass)
- Down (d): ~0.004 GeV
- Strange (s): ~0.095 GeV
- Charm (c): ~1.27 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV (wait, around 4.7?)
- Top (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV.

Wait, but for decay, the mass of the fermion must be less than 3 GeV, since 2m ≤6 GeV.

So let's see each fermion:

Electron: 0.0005 GeV → 2m ~0.001 GeV <6 GeV → allowed.

Muon: ~0.105 → 2*0.105=0.21 <6 → allowed.

Tau: ~1.777 → 2*1.777≈3.55 GeV. Oh wait, 3.55 is more than 3, so 2m = ~3.55 >6? No, wait, wait. Wait, 1.777*2 is 3.554 GeV. So that's less than 6 GeV. So tau pair is allowed.

Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, 3.554 is less than 6, so yes, allowed. So tau can be a decay product.

Quarks:

u: 0.003 GeV → 2m=0.006 <6 → allowed.

d: ~0.004 → 2m=0.008 <6 → allowed.

s: ~0.095 → 2m=0.19 <6 → allowed.

c: ~1.27 → 2m=2.54 <6 → allowed.

b: ~4.5 → 2m=9 → 9 is way larger than 6 → not allowed.

t: way too heavy, but X is only 6 GeV, so top can't be produced.

So the possible fermion pairs are:

e+ e-,
mu+ mu-,
tau+ tau-,
u u-bar,
d d-bar,
s s-bar,
c c-bar.

Wait, but what about bottom quarks? Their mass is around 4.5 GeV. So 2m_b is ~9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b-bar.

So possible decay channels are all the above except b and t.

Wait, but what about the masses of the quarks? Because in the Lagrangian, the coupling might depend on the fermion mass. Because in Yukawa interactions, the coupling is proportional to the mass of the fermion. So perhaps the interaction term is L = -λ (m_f ψ_f ψ_f X), which would mean that the coupling strength depends on m_f.

But for decay, the coupling strength determines the decay rate, but the kinematics only depends on whether the product is allowed.

So regardless of the coupling strength, as long as the fermion mass is less than 3 GeV, the decay is kinematically possible.

Wait, but wait. For fermions with masses higher than 3 GeV, but less than 6, can they be produced? For example, a fermion with mass of 4 GeV: then 2m=8 GeV, which is more than 6, so it can't be produced as a pair.

So the allowed fermions are those with m ≤3 GeV.

So which fermions have m ≤3 GeV?

Leptons: e, mu, tau (tau is 1.777 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV).

Quarks: u, d, s, c (u: ~3 MeV, d: ~5 MeV, s: ~100 MeV, c: ~1.27 GeV. All of them have m ≤3 GeV.

So X can decay into any of the combinations of these fermions.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but the bottom quarks are too heavy. So option A is wrong because it includes b.

Option B: X→ c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So that includes all the allowed except b and t. Because c has m ~1.27 GeV, which is allowed. So this option includes all the allowed leptons and quarks.

But wait, what about the top quark? Oh, top is way too heavy, so not included.

Option C: includes t t-bar. That's impossible because X is only 6 GeV. So no.

Option D: includes b, which is not allowed.

So the correct decay channels are all except the b and t.

So looking at the options, option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Wait, let's check the options again.

Option A: includes b, which is wrong.

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e → correct.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e → t is too heavy, so wrong.

Option D: includes b → wrong.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem is about the boson X decaying into fermion-antifermion pairs. The possible pairs are the ones where each fermion has mass less than or equal to 3 GeV.

So the decay products are:

e+ e-,

mu+ mu-,

tau+ tau-,

u u-bar,

d d-bar,

s s-bar,

c c-bar.

Which are all present in option B.

So the correct answer is B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction term in the Lagrangian indicates that \( X \) couples to fermions, and the decay products must be fermion-antifermion pairs. For a decay to be kinematically allowed, the total mass of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of each fermion in the pair. This implies \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Analysis of Fermion Masses:
1. **Leptons**:
   - Electron (\( e^- \)): \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_e \approx 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Muon (\( \mu^- \)): \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\mu \approx 0.21 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Tau (\( \tau^- \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.554 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).

2. **Quarks**:
   - Up (\( u \)): \( m_u \approx 0.003 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_u \approx 0.006 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Down (\( d \)): \( m_d \approx 0.004 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_d \approx 0.008 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Strange (\( s \)): \( m_s \approx 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_s \approx 0.19 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Charm (\( c \)): \( m_c \approx 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c \approx 2.54 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Bottom (\( b \)): \( m_b \approx 4.1-4.7 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b \approx 8.2-9.4 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed).
   - Top (\( t \)): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (far too heavy, not allowed).

### Allowed Decays:
The boson \( X \) can decay into the following fermion-antifermion pairs:
- \( e^+ e^- \),
- \( \mu^+ \mu^- \),
- \( \tau^+ \tau^- \),
- \( u \bar{u} \),
- \( d \bar{d} \),
- \( s \bar{s} \),
- \( c \bar{c} \).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed because \( m_t \) is far too heavy. **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all the kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
