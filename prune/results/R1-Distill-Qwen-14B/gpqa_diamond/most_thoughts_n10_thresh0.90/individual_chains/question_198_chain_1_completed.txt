Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem states that we have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The concentrations are given: the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, okay, so I remember that stability constants (formation constants) are used to determine the concentration of metal complexes in solution. Each β represents the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex with a certain number of ligand molecules.

The problem is asking about the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2^(n+) complex. So the blue complex is probably the one with two SCN ligands, but wait, I need to confirm which β corresponds to which complex. Oh wait, the β values are given as β1, β2, etc. So typically, β_n is the formation constant for the complex with n ligands. So β1 is for the monodentate complex, β2 for the bidentate, etc. Wait no, maybe βn is the constant for the complex with n SCN- ions attached. So [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ has a stability constant βn. So β1 is for CoSCN^+, β2 for Co(SCN)2^0, β3 for Co(SCN)3^-, and β4 for Co(SCN)4^2-? Because each SCN- is -1, so adding four of them would give a charge of 4- on the complex, but the Co is +2, so total charge would be 2-4= -2? Wait, no, wait. Let me think: The initial ion is Co^2+. Each SCN^- is -1. So for each complex:

- Co^2+ + n SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_n]^{2 -n}. So for n=1, charge is 2-1= +1 → [CoSCN]^+.

n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (neutral).

n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^-.

n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

Wait, but the problem says "dithiocyanato" which usually refers to two SCN ligands. So the dithiocyanato complex is the one with two SCN ligands, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So β2 is 40, which is the stability constant for that complex.

The question is about the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2] in the solution. So to find the percentage of this species relative to all possible cobalt species.

I think the approach here is to calculate the fraction of Co present as each complex, then find which fraction corresponds to the dithiocyanato (n=2) complex.

Since there are multiple complexes possible, the total concentration of Co is the sum of the concentrations of all these complexes plus any free Co^2+ ions. But wait, in aqueous solution, most of the Co would be complexed, so the free Co^2+ might be negligible, but I'm not sure. Let's see.

The equation for each complex is:

[Co(SCN)_n]^{2+ (2-n)} = βn * [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n

But wait, actually, the general equation is:

[Co(SCN)_n] = βn * [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n

Because βn is the formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands.

The total concentration of Co is c_total = [Co^2+] + sum([Co(SCN)_n] for n=1 to 4).

Wait, but the problem states that the total cobalt concentration c(Co) is 1e-2 M. So c_total is 1e-2 M.

So, [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^{2-}] = 1e-2 M.

But since the concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M, which is 1e-1 M, which is much higher than the Co concentration, the ligand is in excess. So the ligand concentration can be considered constant, and we can approximate [SCN^-] ≈ 0.1 M for each term.

So, let's write each complex concentration in terms of [Co^2+]:

[CoSCN^+] = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^1 = 9 * [Co^2+] * 0.1 = 0.9 [Co^2+]

[Co(SCN)_2] = β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 = 40 [Co^2+]*(0.1)^2 = 40 * [Co^2+] * 0.01 = 0.4 [Co^2+]

[Co(SCN)_3^-] = β3 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 = 63 * [Co^2+]*(0.1)^3 = 63 * [Co^2+] * 0.001 = 0.063 [Co^2+]

[Co(SCN)_4^{2-}] = β4 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4 = 16 * [Co^2+]*(0.1)^4 = 16 * [Co^2+] * 0.0001 = 0.0016 [Co^2+]

So substituting these into the total equation:

[Co^2+] + 0.9 [Co^2+] + 0.4 [Co^2+] + 0.063 [Co^2+] + 0.0016 [Co^2+] = 1e-2

Let me sum the coefficients:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9; 1.9 +0.4=2.3; 2.3+0.063=2.363; 2.363+0.0016=2.3646.

So [Co^2+ ] * 2.3646 = 1e-2 → [Co^2+] = 1e-2 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004225 M.

Wait, so [Co^2+] is about 0.004225 M. Now, let's find the concentration of each complex.

[CoSCN+] = 0.9 * 0.004225 ≈ 0.0038025 M

[Co(SCN)_2] = 0.4 * 0.004225 ≈ 0.00169 M

[Co(SCN)_3^-] = 0.063 * 0.004225 ≈ 0.000266 M

[Co(SCN)_4^{2-}] = 0.0016 * 0.004225 ≈ 0.00000676 M

Now, the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2].

So [Co(SCN)_2] is 0.00169 M.

Total Co is 1e-2 M.

The fraction is (0.00169) / (0.01) = 0.169, which is 16.9%.

Wait, but that's option D. But wait, none of the options have 16.9% except option D.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because 16.9% is option D, but I'm a bit confused because the β values are higher for higher n, so I thought maybe the higher complexes would be more prevalent.

Wait, no, because β increases up to n=3, but for n=4, β4 is lower than β3. Let me see.

Wait, β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So β3 is the highest. But because each subsequent complex requires an additional SCN-, and the concentrations are dominated by higher-order complexes if β is higher and the ligand is in excess.

Wait, but in my calculation, [Co^2+] is 0.004225, and the complexes:

[CoSCN+] is 3.8e-3,

[Co(SCN)_2] is 1.69e-3,

[Co(SCN)_3] is 2.66e-4,

[Co(SCN)_4] is 6.76e-6.

So, the dominant species is [CoSCN+], followed by [Co(SCN)_2], then [Co(SCN)_3^-], and the fourth is negligible.

So the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2] is 1.69e-3 / 0.01 = 0.169, 16.9%. Which is option D.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 16.9%, so why is the correct answer not that? No, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, let me think again. When we set up the equation, I summed all the complexes plus [Co^2+] to equal c_total. But wait, the problem states that the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M. So that includes all species, so the setup is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the formation constants are cumulative, so each β is for the nth complex, considering the previous (n-1) complexes. Wait, no, the way I did it is correct because each βn is the formation constant for the nth complex from the (n-1)th complex. Or wait, no, perhaps the way I approached it is wrong because the β values are for the overall formation from Co^2+ and n SCN^-.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model it as each complex step being a separate step, but I think the approach I took earlier is correct because each β is the overall formation constant for that complex.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I should have considered the general equation for each complex and then added them up, but I think I did it right.

Wait, let me re-calculate the sum.

Sum of coefficients:

β1 * [SCN]^1 = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

β2 * [SCN]^2 =40 * 0.01 =0.4

β3 * [SCN]^3 =63 * 0.001=0.063

β4 * [SCN]^4 =16 * 0.0001=0.0016

So each term is βn * [SCN]^n, and each complex is [Co(SCN)_n] = (βn * [SCN]^n) * [Co^2+]

So the sum of all these terms plus [Co^2+] equals c_total.

So the equation is:

[Co^2+] + 0.9 [Co^2+] + 0.4 [Co^2+] + 0.063 [Co^2+] + 0.0016 [Co^2+] = 0.01

Which is [Co^2+](1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016) = 0.01

Sum of the coefficients: 1 +0.9=1.9, +0.4=2.3, +0.063=2.363, +0.0016=2.3646.

So [Co^2+] = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004225 M.

Then [Co(SCN)_2] is β2 * [Co^2+] [SCN]^2 = 40 * 0.004225 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.004225 * 0.01 = 40 * 0.00004225 = 0.00169 M.

Wait, 40 * 0.004225 is 0.169, and 0.169 *0.01 is 0.00169.

So [Co(SCN)_2] is 0.00169 M.

Total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M.

So (0.00169 / 0.01)*100 =16.9%.

Hmm, that would be option D.

But wait, wait a minute. I think I may have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute the [Co(SCN)_2] concentration.

Wait, [Co(SCN)_2] = β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 = 40 * [Co^2+] * (0.1)^2 = 40 * [Co^2+] *0.01.

I calculated [Co^2+] as 0.004225.

So 40 * 0.004225 = 0.169, then 0.169 * 0.01 = 0.00169 M. That's correct.

So the percentage is (0.00169 / 0.01) *100 = 16.9%, which is option D. But I'm a bit confused because the β3 is higher than β2, so I'd expect [Co(SCN)_3] to be more than [Co(SCN)_2], but perhaps because the [SCN^-] is not extremely high, the higher β doesn't compensate for the higher power.

Wait, let me compute the [Co(SCN)_3] concentration again. [Co(SCN)_3] is 63 * [Co^2+] * (0.1)^3 =63 * 0.004225 * 0.001 = ?

63 * 0.004225 ≈ 0.266. Then 0.266 * 0.001 =0.000266 M.

So the [Co(SCN)_3] is 0.000266 M, which is about 2.66e-4, which is much less than [Co(SCN)_2] (1.69e-3), so the [Co(SCN)_2] is about 6.3 times higher than [Co(SCN)_3].

So the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2] is 16.9%, which would be option D. But looking at the options, option C is 38.1%, which is about double that.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of [Co^2+]. Let me check that again.

The sum in the denominator is 1 +0.9+0.4+0.063+0.0016=2.3646.

[Co^2+] = 0.01 / 2.3646 = approximately 0.004225 M.

Hmm, that seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I'm considering the complexes in a way that isn't correct. Wait, another approach: the fraction of each complex is (βn [SCN]^n) divided by the sum of all (βn [SCN]^n) plus 1 (for [Co^2+]).

But since [Co^2+] is part of the denominator, perhaps it's better to compute the fraction as βn [SCN]^n divided by the sum of all terms plus 1.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider all the possible complexes and the free ion as part of the distribution.

So the fraction for each complex is [Co(SCN)_n] / ( [Co^2+] + sum [Co(SCN)_k] ), where k=1,2,3,4 ).

But that's what I did earlier. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute each fraction as (βn [SCN]^n) / (1 + sum βk [SCN]^k ), where k=1 to 4.

Wait, actually, the total is [Co^2+] + sum βn [Co^2+][SCN]^n = [Co^2+](1 + sum βn [SCN]^n).

So [Co^2+] = c_total / (1 + sum βn [SCN]^n).

Then, each [Co(SCN)_n] = βn [SCN]^n [Co^2+] = c_total βn [SCN]^n / (1 + sum βk [SCN]^k).

Thus, the fraction for each complex is (βn [SCN]^n) / (1 + sum βk [SCN]^k).

So to find the percentage for [Co(SCN)_2], we compute (β2 [SCN]^2) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4) ) * 100.

So let's compute each term:

β1 [SCN]^1 =9 *0.1=0.9

β2 [SCN]^2=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4

β3 [SCN]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063

β4 [SCN]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016

Sum these up plus 1:

Total denominator = 1 + 0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 = 2.3646

Numerator for β2 term is 0.4.

So the fraction is 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, which is 16.9%. So the percentage is 16.9%, which matches option D.

But wait, looking at the options, option C is 38.1%, which is approximately double. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm calculating.

Wait, another thing: perhaps the β values are given as cumulative, meaning that βn is the constant for the nth complex relative to the (n-1)th. Oh wait, that's a different approach. So for example, the formation constants could be such that βn = K_n / K_{n-1}, where K_n is the overall constant for the nth complex.

If that's the case, then the overall approach would be different.

Wait, but the problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I think these are the overall stability constants for each complex. That is, the βn is the equilibrium constant for Co^2+ +n SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}.

In that case, the approach I took earlier is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I'm considering [SCN^-] as 0.1 M, but in reality, when the ligand is in excess, the concentration of [SCN^-] is not exactly 0.1 because some is tied up in complexes. However, since the ligand is in excess (0.1 M and Co is 1e-2 M), the change is negligible, so using 0.1 is a valid approximation.

Therefore, the calculation seems correct, and the percentage is 16.9%, so option D.

Wait, but looking back, the [Co(SCN)_2] is 1.69e-3 M, which is about 16.9% of the total Co concentration. So that's option D.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the β values are logarithmic. Wait, no, the problem states the stability constants, so they're in terms of K, not log K. So my calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option C, 38.1%, but I'm not seeing where I might have gone wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the charge. No, the formation constants are given as βn, which are product terms. So I think the approach is correct.

Wait, let me recheck the calculations numerically.

Compute each βn [SCN]^n:

n=1: 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

n=2:40 *0.01=0.4

n=3:63 *0.001=0.063

n=4:16 * 0.0001=0.0016

Sum of these terms: 0.9 + 0.4=1.3; +0.063=1.363; +0.0016=1.3646.

Adding 1 for [Co^2+], the denominator is 2.3646.

So the fraction for n=2 is 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, which is 16.9% → option D.

Hmm, so I think the correct answer is D, 16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the given stability constants (β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16) and the concentrations [Co²⁺] = 10⁻² M and [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M. The stability constants represent the equilibrium constants for the formation of the complexes [Co(SCN)ₙ]^(2−n) from Co²⁺ and n SCN⁻ ligands.

### Step 1: Expression for the total cobalt concentration
The total cobalt concentration is given as:

\[
c_{\text{total}} = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{CoSCN}^+] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_2] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_3^-] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_4^{2-}]
\]

Each complex concentration can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co²⁺], using the stability constants:

\[
[\text{Co(SCN)}_n] = \beta_n [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^n
\]

Substituting these into the total cobalt concentration equation:

\[
c_{\text{total}} = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + \beta_1 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^1 + \beta_2 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^4
\]

Factoring out [Co²⁺]:

\[
c_{\text{total}} = [\text{Co}^{2+}] \left( 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-]^1 + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 \right)
\]

### Step 2: Solve for [Co²⁺]
The ligand concentration, [SCN⁻], is 0.1 M, so:

\[
\beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9
\]
\[
\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4
\]
\[
\beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063
\]
\[
\beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016
\]

Summing these terms:

\[
1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

Thus:

\[
[\text{Co}^{2+}] = \frac{c_{\text{total}}}{2.3646} = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 0.004225 \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the concentration of [Co(SCN)₂]
The concentration of the dithiocyanato complex is:

\[
[\text{Co(SCN)}_2] = \beta_2 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot 0.004225 \cdot (0.1)^2
\]

First, calculate \( 40 \cdot 0.004225 = 0.169 \), then multiply by \( (0.1)^2 = 0.01 \):

\[
[\text{Co(SCN)}_2] = 0.169 \cdot 0.01 = 0.00169 \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]
The percentage of [Co(SCN)₂] is:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)}_2]}{c_{\text{total}}} \cdot 100 = \frac{0.00169}{0.01} \cdot 100 = 16.9\%
\]

### Final Answer:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.

**Answer: D**
