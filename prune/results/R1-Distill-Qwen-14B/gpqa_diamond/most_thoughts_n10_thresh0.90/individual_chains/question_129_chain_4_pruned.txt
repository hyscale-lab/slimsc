Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound E is. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The problem gives a series of reactions starting from compound A and going through several steps to form E. There are also some hints and an IR spectrum clue, so I'll need to use all of that information.

First, let me list out the reactions:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

The options for E are four different ketones. So E is a ketone, which makes sense because the last step is elimination, possibly leading to a carbonyl group.

Now, looking at hint a: Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting an ylide with an aldehyde or ketone.

The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, the structure sounds a bit complicated. Let me visualize it. So it's a cyclopentane ring. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group attached. Propan-2-ylidene would be a CH2-C(CH3)= group? Or wait, propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)=, no, wait. Wait, propan-2-ylidene is (CH3)2C= attached as a substituent.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane has methyl groups at positions 1 and 2. At position 4, there's a substituent which is a propan-2-ylidene group. But propan-2-ylidene is like a methylene group attached to a methyl group, so maybe it's (CH2)2C(CH3)=? Or wait, ylides have the structure P=CH-R. So when the Wittig reaction happens, the ylide adds to the carbonyl, forming an alkene.

Wait, the product of the Wittig reaction is an alkene. So in this case, the product is a cyclopentane with a substituent that's an alkene. So the structure would have a double bond attached to the ring.

So if compound A is reacting with a Wittig reagent, then A must be a carbonyl compound. Because the Wittig reacts with aldehydes or ketones. So A is probably a cyclopentanone or something similar.

Looking at the product structure: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, propan-2-ylidene is (CH3)2C=, which would come from a ylide like (CH3)2C=PPh3 or something. So the Wittig would form a new double bond.

Wait, the product being 4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane would imply that the double bond is between carbons 4 and 5 of the cyclopentane (assuming numbering). Or maybe it's a substituent on the ring.

Wait, maybe the product is a bicyclic compound? No, probably not. So the Wittig reaction adds an alkene to a carbonyl group in A.

So if A is a ketone, like cyclopentanone, but with substituents.

Let me think: When a Wittig reagent (ylide) reacts with a ketone, it forms an alkene. So if A is, say, 4-methylcyclopentanone, then the Wittig would add the ylide's R group to the carbonyl, replacing the O with a double bond.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane has methyl groups at 1 and 2, and a propan-2-ylidene group at 4, which is a double bond attached to a methyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the propan-2-ylidene is a substituent on the ring as a double bond. So the cyclopentane has a substituent that is an alkene.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that the cyclopentane has a double bond attached to position 4 as part of a substituent. Like, perhaps a cyclopentane ring with a double bond branch.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to think about the structure of the product. Let's imagine the cyclopentane ring. Carbon 1 has a methyl group, carbon 2 also has a methyl, and carbon 4 has a substituent. That substituent is propan-2-ylidene, which is (CH2)C(CH3)=, but wait: propan-2-ylidene would be (CH3)2C= as a substituent.

Wait, no. Propan-2-ylidene is probably (CH3)2C= attached as a substituent. So the substituent is a double bond, and the structure is cyclopentane with a (CH3)2C=CH2 group? No, wait, the product is 4-(propan-2-ylidene). So perhaps it's attached as a substituent, making the structure have a double bond as a substituent.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the structure of the product. 4-(propan-2-ylidene) would be a substituent at position 4, which is a group with a double bond. So the substituent is (CH3)2C=CH- or something like that. Wait, no. Propan-2-ylidene is (CH2CH2C(CH3) ? No, perhaps it's more accurate to think of it as (CH3)2C=.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is (CH3)2C=CH2. But that would be isopropenyl group. Wait, propan-2-ylidene is the same as isopropenyl. So the substituent at position 4 is an isopropenyl group attached to the cyclopentane ring. So the product is a cyclopentane with methyl groups at 1 and 2, and an isopropenyl substituent at 4.

So the starting material A must have a ketone group where the Wittig reagent added the isopropenyl group.

Wait, no. The Wittig reaction replaces the carbonyl oxygen with an alkene. So if A is a ketone, say, cyclopentanone with substituents, then the Wittig adds a group across the carbonyl.

Wait, another approach: the Wittig reaction forms alkenes. So if A is a cyclopentanone derivative, the Wittig would add a group to the carbonyl, forming a double bond. So the product would have a new double bond.

But the product is a cyclopentane with methyl groups at 1 and 2, and a propan-2-ylidene group at 4. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure of the product is a cyclopentane ring with a substituent that's a double bond. So, for example, a cyclopentane ring with a double bond at position 4, but that doesn't seem right because the substituent is the propan-2-ylidene.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ring. Like, the substituent is (CH2)C(CH3)=CH2, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe compound A is a cyclopentanone with a methyl group at position 4
