--- Full Content ---
Alright, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let's read through the question carefully.

So, the question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons and varying hydrogens and oxygen counts.

First, the FTIR data: a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, a very broad peak might be more like an alcohol or maybe a phenol? Or maybe a carbonyl group? No, wait, the carbonyl (C=O) is usually around 1700 cm^-1, which is another peak mentioned here.

The other strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm. The 1700 is a strong peak which suggests a carbonyl group. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a conjugated carbonyl like in a conjugated diene system. The 1650 is a bit lower, maybe an aromatic ring (like C=C stretching) or conjugated carbonyl. Wait, I'm a bit confused. The carbonyl in conjugation with an aromatic ring would have a lower wavenumber, maybe around 1680-1650. So perhaps the compound has a conjugated carbonyl group, like an aromatic ester or something with an aromatic ring and a carbonyl.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So that suggests the presence of a double bond. Maybe a conjugated diene? Or perhaps an aromatic ring, which is a conjugated system with double bonds. But if it's vinyl, maybe it's a more simple alkene.

Looking at the mass spec data: there's a fragment peak at m/z=45. Let me think about what gives m/z 45. Common ions at 45 are like (CH3O)+ but wait, 45 is C3H7O. Or maybe (CH2)2O, which is 44? Hmm, not sure. Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be (CH3CO)+ which is 45. Because CH3CO+ is 45. How? C=O plus CH3 is 12*2 + 1*3 +16 = 24 +3 +16=43. Wait, that's 43, but maybe it's (CH2)2CO+... No, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, could it be (CH3)2CO which would be 58? Alternatively, perhaps it's a cleavage product involving an ester or ketone.

Wait, another approach. Let's think of the possible formulas and see which one fits.

Options are:
A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So, we have to find which of these fits the spectral data.

FTIR: Broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 suggests OH groups. So, the compound has at least an -OH. Looking at the options, which have O? All except B (which is C6H10O) and D (C6H12O) have O. Wait, no, option A is O2, B is O, C is O2, D is O.

Wait, the FTIR has a broad peak, which is common for O-H. So, if the compound has an -OH group, the formula must include at least one O. So, all options except B and D have O, but wait, options A is O2, C is O2, B is O, D is O. So, perhaps the compound is a diol or an ester with an -OH.

Wait, but looking at the other peaks: 1700 and 1650. These are carbonyl stretches. So, the compound has a carbonyl group. So, the formula must have at least one O (for the carbonyl). So, options A, C are O2, which can have a carbonyl and an -OH group.

Wait, but wait: the compound could be an ester, which has both O in the ester group. Let's think about the structure.

If the formula is C6H12O2, that's 6 carbons, 12 hydrogens, 2 oxygens. Possible structures could be esters, like methyl something ester, or perhaps a cyclic ester, or a diester.

Alternatively, C6H10O2 would have a degree of unsaturation higher. Let's calculate degree of unsaturation for each option.

Degree of unsaturation formula: Degrees = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or nitrogen.

Option A: C=6, H=12, O=2. So, 2*6 +2 =14. 14 -12 = 2. 2/2 =1. So one degree of unsaturation. That could be a ring or a double bond.

Option B: C6H10O. 2*6+2=14. 14-10=4. 4/2=2. So two degrees: could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a triple bond and a ring, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2. 2*6+2=14. 14-10=4. 4/2=2. Two degrees.

Option D: C6H12O. 2*6+2=14. 14-12=2. 2/2=1. One degree.

So, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond. So the structure must have at least one double bond.

Looking at the options with at least one double bond (from NMR data), which requires a degree of unsaturation. So, options with at least one double bond would have at least one degree of unsaturation. So, all options except perhaps A and D have one or more.

Wait, the NMR indicates vinyl hydrogens, which are on a CH2 group adjacent to a double bond, or perhaps on a benzene ring. But benzene wouldn't have vinyl hydrogens exactly; they're aromatic protons. So, perhaps it's an alkene.

So, let's think about each option.

FTIR has a broad peak at 3000, which is likely O-H. So, the compound has an -OH group.

The IR has a peak at 1700 (carbonyl), and 1650 (maybe conjugated carbonyl or another group).

So, perhaps the compound is an aromatic ester with an -OH group. For example, something like methyl salicylate, which has a benzene ring, an ester group (COO), and a hydroxyl group on the ring.

Wait, but let's look at the possibilities.

Another thought: the NMR has peaks for vinyl hydrogens, so perhaps a conjugated diene or an isolated double bond. Alternatively, perhaps a cyclic structure.

Wait, the mass spec has a peak at m/z=45. What's that? Let me think about common fragments. The most common m/z 45 fragment is probably (CH3)2CO+ (which is 58?), wait no. Wait, 45 is 45 g/mol. Let me think about possible ions.

Wait, 45 could be CH3COOH (but that's 60). Or maybe CH3COO- is 60, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2CH2O+ or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketene ion, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: think about the possible structures based on the options.

Option A: C6H12O2. It could be an ester, like methyl pentanoate or something else. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard. Let's think about the IR: a broad peak at 3000 suggests an -OH group, but in an ester, the -O- is present but not an -OH. Wait, unless it's a hemiacetal or something else. Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, the IR would have a broad peak and a strong carbonyl around 1700. But the molecular formula for a carboxylic acid would be CnH2nO2. Let's see: for example, hexanoic acid is C6H12O2, which matches option A. So, hexanoic acid would have a broad O-H stretch around 3000 cm-1, a strong carbonyl around 1700. But wait, hexanoic acid would have an -OH group, but in the NMR, you'd see the O-H peak as well, which might be a broad peak. But the question's NMR doesn't mention that, but it says 'several peaks including vinyl hydrogens.' So, hexanoic acid doesn't have vinyl hydrogens; it's a saturated acid. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an ester with a double bond. For example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. So, such as methyl vinyl benzoate or something similar. That would have a conjugated double bond (so the carbonyl peak would be around 1650-1700). Wait, the IR shows 1700 and 1650; perhaps the 1700 is a carbonyl, and 1650 is the conjugated double bond.

In that case, the structure would have a double bond conjugated to the carbonyl group. So, for example, an ester with a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl.

Now, the mass spec: the fragment at 45. Let's think about what that would be. If the molecule is an ester, maybe it cleaves to form an acylium ion or something else. Wait, another possibility: if the molecule has a ketone group, maybe a fragment like (CH3)CO+ would be 58? No, 45 is lower. Wait, 45 could be (CH2)2CO+, but that's 44 (since (CH2)2CO is 44 g/mol: 24 (C2) + 4 (H4) +16 (O) = 44). Oh wait, 2*12=24, 4*1=4, 16=16. 24+4+16=44. So 44 is possible, but the question says 45. Hmm, maybe that's a different fragment.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH3CO+ fragment. CH3CO+ is 43 (12+12 + 16 = 40? Wait, CH3CO is C2H3O. Wait, that's 24 +3 +16 = 43. So m/z 43. But the question says 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2O group. CH2O is formaldehyde, which is 30. No. Or maybe a CH3CHO (acetaldehyde) is 44 (C2H4O: 24 +4 +16=44). So that's m/z 44.

Hmm, I'm not getting this. Let's think of other possibilities. Maybe a fragment like C3H7O+? That would be 3*12 +7 +16 = 36 +7 +16 =59, which is higher than 45.

Wait another approach: perhaps the molecule undergoes a McLafferty rearrangement, which is common in mass spec for ketones or esters. McLafferty rearrangement produces a fragment that is a methyl group (CH3) moving, leading to a loss of CO and forming a new double bond. The fragment would then have a certain mass. But I'm not exactly sure about the masses involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's 91. No, that's not 45.

Wait, another thought: the fragment at 45 could be the (CH2)2O+ ion. (CH2)2O is ethylene oxide, which has a molecular weight of 44 (12*2 +2 +16 = 24 +2 +16=42? Wait, no. Wait, (CH2)2O: 2 carbons, 4 hydrogens, and one oxygen. 2*12=24, 4*1=4, 16=16. 24+4+16=44. So m/z 44. But the question says 45. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's (CH3)CO+ which is 43. But again, the question says 45. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a different type of fragment. Wait, think about the molecular formula.

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (option C), the possible structure could be something like methyl acrylate (but that's C4H6O2). Alternatively, perhaps a substituted propenoate. Let me think: if the structure is an ester with a double bond, like CH2=CHCO-O-R, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I'll try to connect the mass spec data. Suppose the molecular ion is at some higher m/z, but the fragment at 45 suggests a smaller ion. Let's think about the possible parent ions.

Wait, the molecular formula must have fragments that sum to 45. Let's think about the possible components.

For option C: C6H10O2.

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the molecular weight is (6*12) + (10*1) + (2*16) ) =72 +10 +32=114. So the molecular ion would be at 114.

The fragment at 45 could be a piece of it. Let's think about what fragments sum to 45.

45 is 3*12 + 15? Wait, no. 45 could be C3H7O. Because 3*12=36, 7*1=7, 16 (O) =53? No. Wait, 36+7=43, plus O (16) would be 59, which is higher than 45.

Alternatively, maybe it's (CH3)2CO, which is 58. No.

Wait, perhaps it's the loss of a larger group. For example, the molecule could lose a fragment of molecular weight 114-45=69. But what would that be? 69 is the molecular weight of, say, cyclopropane (but that's 42). Alternatively, something else.

Another approach: what if the fragment is a ketene ion (RCO+)? The molecular formula of the fragment would be RCO+. Let's say R is methyl (CH3), then RCO is C2H5O, which is 43. Close to 45, but not exactly. Alternatively, if R is ethyl, then it's C3H7O, which is 59. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde ion (RCHO+). The aldehyde group is CHO, which is 29. So, if the fragment is something like CH2CH2CHO, that's 60. No, not matching.

I'm not making much progress with the mass spec. Let's think about other data points.

The FTIR has a broad peak at 3000, which suggests an -OH group. So the compound must have an -OH. So, looking at the options, which have O.

Option A: C6H12O2. Could be a diol or an ester with an -OH.

Option C: C6H10O2. Maybe a diester? Or a mono-ester with a ring.

Wait, but if the compound is an ester, like R-O-CO-R', then the IR would show the ester carbonyl around 1700, and maybe an O-H if it's a hydroxyl ester, like a salicylate.

Wait, but if it's a simple ester without an -OH, the FTIR would show an O-H? I'm not sure. Wait, no. Esters don't have -OH groups. So the broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 suggests an -OH, so the compound must have an alcohol group or a phenol or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, carboxylic acids have broad O-H stretches. So if the compound is a carboxylic acid, its formula would be CnH2nO2.

Looking at the options, option A is C6H12O2. Which matches a carboxylic acid (since for a carboxylic acid, it's CnH2nO2). Wait, wait, but the formula for a carboxylic acid is actually CnH2n-1COOH, which simplifies to CnH2nO2. For example, hexanoic acid is C6H12O2, which matches option A.

So, if the compound is hexanoic acid, let's see:

FTIR: broad O-H around 3000 cm^-1 (carboxylic acid has a very broad peak), and the carbonyl around 1700 cm^-1.

The NMR: would show the O-H proton, but the question says 'peaks including vinyl hydrogens.' Hexanoic acid is a saturated compound, so no vinyl hydrogens. That's a problem because the NMR in the question has vinyl hydrogens. So hexanoic acid can't be the right structure.

So, the compound can't be a straight-chain carboxylic acid. So, maybe it's something else with an -OH.

What about a diol? Like a diol with a carbonyl group and a double bond. Or perhaps a cyclic ether with a carbonyl and an -OH? Not sure.

Alternatively, the compound could be an aromatic ester with a hydroxyl group. For example, methyl salicylate. Let's see.

Methyl salicylate has the structure OMe-O-C6H4-OH, wait, no. Wait, salicylic acid is 2-hydroxybenzoic acid. Its ester would be the methyl ester, so methyl salicylate has a benzene ring with a hydroxyl group and a methoxycarbonyl group attached.

FTIR: the O-H (phenolic) would show a broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. The ester carbonyl would be around 1700 cm^-1. Also, the aromatic C=C would have a peak around 1600 cm^-1. But the question says a peak at 1650, which might fit. But methyl salicylate's structure has a benzene ring and an ester group.

The 1H NMR would show aromatic protons, but also the ester group. Also, the presence of a hydroxyl group would show as a broad peak, but since the question says 'several peaks including vinyl hydrogens,' but methyl salicylate is an aromatic ester without vinyl groups, so that's a problem. So the NMR data suggests vinyl hydrogens, which are not present in methyl salicylate. So that's not it.

Another possibility: the compound is an enol or an enol ether. Enols have conjugated double bonds and hydroxyl groups. For instance, a cyclic enol ether like dioxin, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the compound is a keto-ester. Like ethyl acetoacetate. But let's think about that. Its structure is CH3COCH2COOEt. The FTIR would show a carbonyl around 1700 (ester) and another around 1750 (maybe the ketone?), but I'm not sure. The 1H NMR would have vinyl hydrogens if there's a double bond. Wait, ethyl acetoacetate has a methyl ketone and an ester group, but no double bond. So no vinyl hydrogens. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. Like methyl acrylate. Structure: CH2=CHCOOCH3. The IR would show a carbonyl around 1700, and the conjugated double bond (C=C) would have a peak around 1650 cm^-1. The broad peak at 3000 would imply an -OH group, but methyl acrylate doesn't have an -OH. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, but if the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid. Like acrylic acid, but that's a monomer without an -OH except the carboxylic group. So, maybe the formula is C6H10O2.

Wait, let's think about the options again. Option C is C6H10O2. So, molecular weight is 6*12 +10 +32 =72 +10 +32=114. If it's an ester, perhaps with a double bond.

Wait, another angle: the NMR has vinyl hydrogens. So let's think about which options have a double bond.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation is 1. So, either a ring and a double bond, or a triple bond.

But the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so perhaps a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation is 2. So could be two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

So, for option C, perhaps the structure is an aromatic ring (which is a ring with three double bonds) plus an ester group. But wait, the benzene ring is a six-membered ring with three double bonds, which is three degrees of unsaturation. But for option C, degrees of unsaturation is 2, so that's a problem. So maybe it's not an aromatic ring.

Alternatively, perhaps an ester with a double bond elsewhere. For example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester with a double bond.

So, let's imagine a structure like CH2=CHCOO-R, where R is another substituent. For example, if R is a methyl group, then the formula would be C5H8O2, but the options are C6, so perhaps another substituent.

Alternatively, the structure could be a cyclic ester with a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: the presence of a conjugated carbonyl and a double bond would explain the IR peaks. So, perhaps a structure like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's a longer chain, and the formula would be C9H12O2, which isn't one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a substituted cyclohexene with an ester group and an -OH.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. But again, not sure.

Let's go back to the mass spec. Maybe the fragment at 45 is (CH3)CO+ which is 43, but that's close to 45. Maybe it's a different kind of fragment. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a ketone group and upon fragmentation, the CO group breaks off as a fragment. So, if the CO is part of a larger group, maybe it leaves as CO+ or as part of a larger ion.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a CH2O group. Wait, CH2O is formaldehyde, 30. No, that doesn't add up.

Hmm, not making progress on that front. Let's think about another approach: the number of signals in the NMR. The question says 'several peaks including vinyl hydrogens.' So, perhaps the structure has a conjugated diene or a simple alkene with two sets of vinyl protons.

Wait, another thought: the NMR has peaks for vinyl hydrogens, which are probably in a trans configuration, giving two different peaks, or maybe in a cis, but perhaps that's not important right now.

Let me think about the options again, considering the degrees of unsaturation.

Option B: C6H10O. Degrees of unsaturation is 2. So, two rings, or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation is 2. So same possibilities.

Option A and D have one degree.

Since the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which imply a double bond, the compound must have at least one double bond. So, the degrees of unsaturation from that are one (if a single double bond), but the compound might have another ring (like option B and C have two degrees, so one could be a ring and one a double bond).

But I'm not sure how that helps.

Let me try to think about each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation 1. So, either a ring or a double bond. But the NMR has vinyl, so likely a double bond.

So, the structure could be a cyclic ester (lactone) with no double bond? No, because the NMR needs vinyl H.

So, perhaps a six-membered ring with a double bond and an ester group. But not sure.

Option D: C6H12O. Degrees of unsaturation 1. So, a ring or a double bond. But the question has an O-H group (from IR), so it's an alcohol. So maybe cyclohexanol, but that wouldn't have a carbonyl group. So, the IR wouldn't show 1700 cm^-1. So, probably not.

Option B: C6H10O. Degrees of unsaturation 2. So, perhaps a cyclohexene ring (one double bond, one ring). But the FTIR has a carbonyl, which is 1700. So, that would require a carbonyl group, but option B has only one O. So, perhaps an aldehyde group (RCHO) and a ring. But aldehyde has O, but would the FTIR show a peak at 1700? Yes, an aldehyde's C=O is around 2820 (stretching) and 1720 (C=O) cm^-1. Wait, but the IR in the question shows a peak at 1700, which aligns with aldehyde or ketone. But the O-H in the question's IR is a broad peak, so perhaps it's a cyclic hemiacetal or something else. Not sure.

But I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should think of the possible structures and see which fit all the data.

The key points:

- FTIR: O-H (broad), C=O (1700), and another peak at 1650 (perhaps conjugated C=C or another C=O).

- NMR: vinyl H.

- Mass: m/z=45.

So, let's think of a structure that has:

1. An -OH group (from the IR's broad peak).

2. A carbonyl group (1700 cm^-1), perhaps conjugated (so the 1650 is from conjugation).

3. A double bond (from vinyl H in NMR).

4. A fragment at 45 in mass spec.

Which option matches this?

Option C is C6H10O2. So, let's imagine a structure with an ester group (O2), a double bond, and an -OH group. So, maybe something like a substituted acrylic acid ester with a hydroxyl group.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a substituted cinnamic acid ester. Cinnamic acid is benzene with a CH2CHCOOH group. Its ester would be benzene with a CH2CHCOO-R group.

But let's see: cinnamic acid methyl ester would have the structure Ph-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, cinnamic acid is Ph-CH=CH-COOH. So, the methyl ester would be Ph-CH=CH-COOCH3. So, this structure has:

- A benzene ring (no vinyl H, as aromatic H are typically around 7 ppm and show as multiple peaks, but the question says 'vinyl' H, which are CH2 or CH in a double bond), not sure.

Wait, in cinnamic acid methyl ester, the structure is Ph-CH=CH-CO-OCH3. The vinyl Hs would be the two CH=CH protons. So, the NMR would show peaks for those.

The FTIR would show a carbonyl around 1700 (ester) and a conjugated double bond (C=C) around 1650. The O-H in the IR would be from where? Wait, cinnamic acid methyl ester doesn't have an -OH group. So that's a problem because the IR shows a broad peak at 3000, which suggests an -OH.

So, perhaps the compound is a dihydroxy ester, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the molecular formula.

Option C: C6H10O2.

If the structure is an ester, the general formula is RCOOR'. For example, RCOOR' would have (n+1) + (m+1) = n + m + 2 carbons, where R is n carbons and R' is m carbons. So, for a six-carbon ester, R and R' could be methyl and butyl, etc.

Wait, another idea: the structure could be a bicyclic compound with an ester and a double bond. Not sure.

Alternatively, the structure could be a substituted maleate or something like that. But I'm not familiar enough with that.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a ketone with an ester group and an -OH.

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Let's think about the mass spec again.

Wait, the fragment at 45 could be the methyl group attached to the carbonyl. For example, if the structure is CH3CO-something, then the fragment could be CH3CO+ (43), but that's not 45. Alternatively, perhaps CH2CH2CO+ is 58.

Another angle: the molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. Let's calculate the molecular weight: (6*12) + (10*1) + (2*16) = 72 +10 +32 =114.

If the molecular ion is at 114, what's the fragment at 45? 114-45=69. So, perhaps the molecule loses a fragment of 69. What's 69? It's the molecular weight of something like C3H7O (3*12=36 +7=43 +16=59. No. Wait, 69 is 5 carbons? No, 69/12 is about 5.75, so not a whole number. Maybe it's a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is formed by losing a larger group. For example, if the molecule is an ester, losing the R group from the ester (RCOOR'), the RCOO part would have a certain mass.

But I'm not making progress here.

Let me think about the possible structures again. What about a cyclic ester with a double bond and an -OH group.

Wait, another idea: the compound could be a dihydroxyketone, but that doesn't fit the ester part.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an alpha-hydroxy ester. For example, something like CH2(OH)CH2COO-R. But I'm not sure about the IR and NMR data.

Alternatively, maybe it's a vicinal diol with a conjugated carbonyl. But again, not sure.

Given the time I've spent, maybe it's better to make an educated guess based on the data.

The presence of a broad O-H and a carbonyl suggests either a carboxylic acid or an ester with an -OH (like a phenol ester).

The NMR has vinyl H, so a double bond is present.

The mass spec has a fragment at 45.

If the structure is an aromatic ester with a vinyl group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the fragment at 45 is 45 g/mol. Let me think about possible functional groups.

Suppose the compound is a propenoate ester. For example, methyl propenoate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. Its molecular formula is C5H8O2. But the options are C6, so perhaps another substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 (ethyl propenoate), which is C6H10O2. That's option C.

So, structure: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3.

But wait, that's C6H10O2. Let's see:

FTIR: the ester carbonyl would be around 1700, and the conjugated double bond (CH2=CH-) would have a peak around 1650. The O-H? Wait, but this structure doesn't have an -OH group. So the broad peak at 3000 would not be explained. So that can't be right.

Hmm. Maybe the structure has both an ester group and an -OH group. For example, a substituted acrylic acid ester with a hydroxyl group.

But how?

Wait, another option: the compound is a diester with a hydroxyl group. For example, something like HOCH2CH2COOCH2CH2COOH. But that's more than six carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted cinnamic acid ester with a hydroxyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a compound with a ketone group, an -OH, and a double bond.

Wait, another approach: the mass spec fragment of 45 could be the loss of a fragment of 45 (so the molecule loses something with a mass of 45, leaving a smaller ion). So the molecule M would have a mass of M = 45 + (rest of the molecule). But without knowing M, it's hard.

Alternatively, the fragment might be a daughter ion formed from the parent ion. For example, if the parent ion is 114 (as in option C), and the fragment is 45, perhaps the molecule breaks into two parts: 45 and 69.

But I can't think of a logical way for that.

At this point, perhaps it's best to try to match the options with the data.

So, we have to choose between options A, B, C, D.

Option A: C6H12O2. Could be a diol ester or a cyclic ester.

Option C: C6H10O2. Could be an ester with a double bond and an -OH.

But earlier, I thought the structure with an -OH and an ester group.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond and an -OH group. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a substituted cyclohexene with an ester group and an -OH. But this is getting too vague.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps the best approach is to look for the only option that has an -OH, a carbonyl, and a double bond.

Looking at the options:

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation=2. So, either two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

If it's a ring and a double bond, that fits the vinyl H.

The presence of O2 suggests ester groups or ketones, but given the IR, it's likely an ester.

But to have an -OH, perhaps it's a diol ester.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester with a conjugated double bond and an -OH.

Given that, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH. Let's see the formula: C5H8O3. No, that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a mono-ester with a double bond and an -OH elsewhere.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Looking back, the only option that has two oxygens and a degree of unsaturation that allows for a double bond is option C (C6H10O2). So, I'll go with option C.


The question involves identifying an unknown compound based on its FTIR, 1H NMR, and mass spectrometry data. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **FTIR Data**:
   - A broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of an -OH group.
   - Strong absorption peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ indicate a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 cm⁻¹ peak could correspond to a conjugated system, such as a carbonyl group conjugated with a double bond.

2. **1H NMR Data**:
   - The presence of peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens indicates the compound contains a double bond.

3. **Mass Spectrometry Data**:
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45 suggests a specific fragmentation pattern. This could correspond to a fragment such as (CH3CO)+ (43), but the exact identity of the fragment is unclear.

4. **Chemical Formula Options**:
   - **A) C6H12O2**: Degrees of unsaturation = 1. This could correspond to a ring or a double bond. However, the NMR data indicates the presence of vinyl hydrogens, suggesting a double bond. Additionally, the broad IR peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ implies an -OH group, which fits with this formula.
   - **B) C6H10O**: Degrees of unsaturation = 2. This could correspond to a ring and a double bond or two double bonds. However, the compound must also have a carbonyl group (C=O), which is not consistent with this formula.
   - **C) C6H10O2**: Degrees of unsaturation = 2. This could correspond to a ring and a double bond or two double bonds. The presence of two oxygens suggests the compound could be an ester or a carboxylic acid. The broad IR peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ and the 1H NMR data for vinyl hydrogens are consistent with this formula.
   - **D) C6H12O**: Degrees of unsaturation = 1. This could correspond to a ring or a double bond. However, the broad IR peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ implies an -OH group, and the absence of a second oxygen makes it less likely to match the data.

### Conclusion:
The compound must have an -OH group (from the broad IR peak at 3000 cm⁻¹), a carbonyl group (from the IR peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹), and a double bond (from the NMR data). Among the options, **C6H10O2** (Option C) best fits these criteria, as it allows for the presence of an ester group, a double bond, and an -OH group.

Answer: C
