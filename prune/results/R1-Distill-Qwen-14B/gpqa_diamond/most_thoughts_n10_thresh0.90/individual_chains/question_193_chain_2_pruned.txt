Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Hmm, let's see. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. I need to figure out how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. The options are A to D, each with different relationships involving r.

Wait, I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) in parsecs is equal to 1 divided by distance (r in parsecs). So plx = 1/r, which means r = 1/plx. That's the key relationship here.

The question says the number of stars varies as 1/(plx)^5. Let's denote N as the number of stars. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. I need to express this in terms of r.

Since plx = 1/r, substituting that into the equation gives N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let's compute that exponent. (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5. So 1 divided by that would be r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

Wait, but the question is asking how the number changes with distance per unit range. So it's about dN/dr, the rate of change. Because when they say 'how does N change with distance', they're talking about the derivative, right? Or maybe not? Wait, no. The question says 'how does the number of stars in that region change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)'. So it's like, for a small increase in r, how much does N change? That would be the derivative of N with respect to r.

But wait, let me think again. The number of stars is proportional to r^5, so N = k * r^5, where k is a constant. Then the derivative dN/dr would be 5k r^4. So the change per unit distance would be proportional to r^4. But wait, the options are about the number of stars as a function of r. Or wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the question says the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to 1/plx^5. And since plx is inversely proportional to r, that makes N proportional to r^5. So N = C * r^5, where C is some constant.

But the question is asking, how does the number of stars change with distance? Like, does it increase or decrease, and by what factor? So if N is proportional to r^5, then as r increases, N increases as the fifth power. So for each additional unit of r, the number of stars increases by more as r gets larger.

Wait, but the options are about the dependence. So the correct option would be that N is proportional to r^5. Looking at the options, option B is ~r^5. So the answer should be B.

But wait, I thought that the number of stars in a region would be related to the volume, which is r^3, since volume scales with r^3. But that's when you're considering the number within a sphere of radius r. But in this case, the number is varying with parallax in a specific way,
