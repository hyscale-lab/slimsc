Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the setup: there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the position, none of the particles were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside that region, right?

Wait, no, wait. The wave function's modulus squared gives the probability density. So if no particles are found outside x=1 and x=3, that means the probability is zero there. So the wave function must be zero for x <1 and x>3.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, but wait, I thought that the wave function should be zero outside the allowed region. So in this case, for x <1 and x>3, the wave function should be zero. So that would mean that a / sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i = 0 in those regions.

Wait, but a is a constant, right? So let's think. For x values less than 1, the sqrt(1+x) is a real number. So the term a/sqrt(1+x) is real. So the expression would be a real number minus 0.5i. How can this be zero? Because zero has to be both real and imaginary parts zero.

So for the wave function to be zero, the real part and the imaginary part must both be zero.

So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So setting both to zero:

a/sqrt(1+x) = 0 for x <1 and x>3.

But wait, if x is any value less than 1, like x=0, then 1+x =1, so sqrt(1)=1. So a/1 = a. So for a to be zero, but that can't be. Because then the entire wave function would be zero, which wouldn't make sense because then the particle wouldn't be anywhere.

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. Let me re-read the problem.

The wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So it's a complex function. But when they measure the particle's position, none were found at x <1 or x>3. So the wave function must be zero (i.e., zero probability) outside that region.

So for x <1 and x>3, the wave function should be zero. So the given wave function should be zero in those regions.

Wait, let's think about x=0, which is less than 1. Then the wave function becomes (a/sqrt(1)) - 0.5i = a -0.5i. For this to be zero, both real and imaginary parts must be zero. So a must be zero, and 0.5i must be zero. But 0.5i is not zero. So that would imply that the wave function isn't zero outside x=1, which contradicts the measurement.

So maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps the wave function as given is valid only between x=1 and x=3. So maybe the wave function is zero outside this region, and given by that expression inside.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So that suggests it's a complex function. But in regions where the particle can't be found, the wave function must be zero.

Wait, but for x between 1 and 3, the wave function is that expression, and elsewhere zero. So the function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3.

But then, the given expression might not include the Heaviside step functions or something, but perhaps the way it's written, it's only valid within the region. So maybe in the region 1 <=x <=3, the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i, and zero otherwise.

But that seems a bit odd, because the wave function is complex in that region. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is supposed to be zero outside 1 and 3, but the given expression is only for x between 1 and 3.

Wait, but the question says that the wave function in a part of space where it can exist is described as that expression. So perhaps the given wave function is only valid in the region where the particle exists, i.e., between x=1 and x=3.

So, perhaps the wave function is:

ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤3

and ψ(x)=0 otherwise.

So, that would make sense. So, the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere.

But wait, the problem says that when measuring, none were found outside, which justifies that the wave function is zero outside.

Now, the next step is to find 'a' such that the wave function is normalized. Because the total probability must be 1.

So, the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1.

So, |ψ(x)|² is [(a / sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i] multiplied by its complex conjugate.

The complex conjugate of ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i.

So, the modulus squared is [ (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 ].

Because when you multiply (a - 0.5i) by (a +0.5i), you get a² + (0.5)^2.

So, the modulus squared is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Now, the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let's write that integral:

Integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

We can split this into two integrals:

a² * Integral from 1 to3 of [1/(1+x)] dx + Integral from 1 to3 of 0.25 dx =1.

Compute each integral.

First integral: ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln|1+x|.

So evaluating from 1 to3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25*(3 -1) = 0.25*2=0.5.

So putting it all together:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So, a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute 0.5 divided by ln(2).

I remember that ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then, a is the square root of 0.7213.

Square root of 0.7213: let's approximate.

What's 0.85 squared? 0.7225. Oh, wait, 0.85^2 = 0.7225, which is very close to 0.7213.

So, a ≈ 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

So the answer should be B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by analyzing the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \quad \text{for } 1 \leq x \leq 3,
\]
and \( \psi(x) = 0 \) elsewhere. Since no particles are found outside \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the wave function must be zero in those regions, and the given expression is valid only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \).

To normalize the wave function, the total probability must equal 1. The probability density is given by the modulus squared of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} \right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left( \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx + \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 1.
\]

1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln|1+x| \Big|_{1}^{3} = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5.
   \]

Substituting these results into the normalization condition:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately 0.85. Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
