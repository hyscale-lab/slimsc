Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule switching energy states when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. 

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, because in the rigid rotor model, the bond length is fixed, but in the non-rigid one, the bond can stretch a bit. So this molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch to the next state with the lowest energy. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

Wait, okay, the fundamental state in molecular vibrations is the lowest energy state, corresponding to the ground vibrational state, right? So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule moves to the next higher state. But wait, the next state could be either the next vibrational state or the next rotational state. Oh, but the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So maybe it's a vibrational transition? Because typically, the vibrational energy levels are higher than the rotational ones, so moving between vibrational states would require higher energy photons.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused here. Let me think. In the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized and given by E_rot = B * J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. For the non-rigid rotor, I think the model accounts for bond length variation, but maybe for this problem, the approach is similar to the rigid rotor? Or perhaps the problem mainly focuses on the vibrational part.

Wait, the problem says it's using the rotation-vibration model, which probably means it's considering both rotational and vibrational energy states. Hmm, but when it says the molecule is in the fundamental state, that usually refers to the ground state of both rotation and vibration. So the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is J=0 and vibrational state ν=0.

When a photon is absorbed, the molecule can transition to a higher energy state. The next state with the lowest possible energy could be either a transition to a higher vibrational state (ν=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). But which transition requires less energy? Because a higher rotational state would require less energy than a higher vibrational state, because the vibrational energy quantum is much higher.

Wait, wait a second. Let me think about the energy differences. The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib
