Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The operator in question is P, which is a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. The problem is asking for the eigenvector of the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. 

Wait, I remember that for angular momentum operators, the eigenvalue equations are important. Oh right, the operator P here is probably representing the spin angular momentum operator for a muon, which is a spin-1/2 particle. So the eigenvalues would be ±ħ/2.

But wait, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. That probably means that the direction vector n has components (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but since it's in the x-z plane, φ would be zero because it's in the x-y plane? Wait, no, wait, no, the x-z plane would have φ=0 or π/2? Wait, no, x-z plane is where y=0, so the angle φ would be zero, because in spherical coordinates, φ is the angle from the x-axis. Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Oh right, in spherical coordinates, the azimuthal angle φ is measured in the x-y plane. So if the direction is in the x-z plane, then the projection onto the y-axis is zero. So that would mean that the vector n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), since when φ=0, the sinφ term is zero. So the direction is in the x-z plane, meaning the angle φ is zero. So the operator is along (x, 0, z) direction, but with a general angle θ.

So the operator P in the direction n would be the sum of the components multiplied by the direction cosines. So the operator P_n would be P·n, which is P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z. But since n_y is zero, because it's in the x-z plane, P_y doesn't contribute. So P_n = P_x * sinθ + P_z * cosθ.

Wait, but wait, n is a unit vector, so n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, yeah. So P_n = sinθ P_x + cosθ P_z.

The problem says to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So we need to solve (P_n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

But first, I need to write down the matrix representations of P_x, P_y, P_z.

The given matrices are:

P_x = ħ/2 * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = ħ/2 * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = ħ/2 * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Wait, wait. So each component is (ħ/2) multiplied by these matrices. So, the matrices themselves are:

For P_x: [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y: [[0,-i],[i,0]]
P_z: [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So P_n is sinθ*(P_x) + cosθ*(P_z). So substituting the matrices:

P_n = sinθ * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Combine these terms:

Each term is multiplied by ħ/2, so factor that out.

P_n = (ħ/2)[ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute the matrix inside:

The first matrix for P_x contribution is [[0
