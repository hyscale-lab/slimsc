--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the quantum rotation-vibration model, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about a diatomic molecule composed of elements X and Y. They're modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that, when absorbed, switches the molecule to the next lowest energy state.

Hmm, the given data are:
- Mass of X (Mx) = 20 amu
- Mass of Y (My) = 2 amu
- Bond length (R) = 2 angstroms
- Angular frequency (w) = 4e14 rad/s

The options are four momentum values. So, I need to figure out which momentum is required for the transition.

Wait, the question mentions the next state with the lowest possible energy. I think in quantum mechanics, the energy levels for rotation and vibration are quantized. So the molecule's state is a combination of vibrational and rotational energy. The fundamental state is the state with the lowest energy, which is the v=0 vibrational level and the J=0 rotational state. But wait, that's only if we're considering the rigid rotor. Oh, but this is the non-rigid rotor model, which probably allows for some stretching.

Wait, no, maybe the non-rigid rotor model is an extension of the rigid rotor, but considering that the bond length can change. But I'm not entirely sure how that affects the energy levels. Maybe it's beyond what I need for this problem.

Wait, the key here is that the molecule is in the fundamental state, which for a vibration-rotation model would be the lowest vibrational state, and the lowest rotational state. So when the photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next state with the lowest energy. That next state would probably be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But since the question is about the photon's momentum, which relates to the energy difference, I need to find the energy difference between the initial and final states.

Wait, but in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized as E_rot = B J (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant. And in the vibrational model, the energy levels are E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w, where v is the vibrational quantum number.

But since the model here is rotation-vibration, I think the energy levels are a combination of both. So the total energy is the sum of the vibrational and rotational energies. So, the fundamental state would be v=0, J=0. The next possible state would be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1, whichever has a lower energy.

But wait, the question says to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So which of those transitions has the lower energy? Let me calculate the energy differences.

Wait, let's compute the energy difference for a vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1, and for a rotational transition from J=0 to J=1. Then, the photon's energy should match the lower of these two energies.

Wait, no, because the photon's energy is absorbed, which would cause the molecule to go to a higher energy state. So the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest possible — v=0, J=0. The next state would have either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1, whichever is lower in energy. So, I need to calculate the energies for these two possibilities and see which is lower. Then, the photon's energy would be that difference, and from that, I can find the momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'next state with the lowest possible energy' refers to the next state in the energy ordering. So perhaps the first excited state overall is either vibrational or rotational, whichever has a lower energy.

So let's compute the energies.

First, calculate the vibrational energy difference. The vibrational energy for v=0 is (0 + 1/2) h w, and for v=1, it's (1 + 1/2) h w. So the energy difference ΔE_vib is h w.

Then, the rotational energy for J=0 is B*(0)(0+1) = 0. For J=1, it's B*(1)(2) = 2B. So the rotational energy difference is 2B.

Wait, but what's B? The rotational constant B is given by (h^2)/(8 π^2 μ R^2), where μ is the reduced mass of the molecule.

So first, let's compute the reduced mass μ. The formula is μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Since Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu, μ = (20 * 2)/(22) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. But I need to convert that into kg because the standard units for physics are in kg.

1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ let's calculate that. 1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ around 3.01, so 3.01e-27 kg.

Wait, wait wait. Let me compute more accurately.

1.818 * 1.6605e-27 = ?

1.818 * 1.6605 = let's compute step by step.

1 * 1.6605 = 1.6605

0.8 * 1.6605 = 1.3284

0.018 * 1.6605 = approx 0.0299

Adding up: 1.6605 + 1.3284 = 2.9889 + 0.0299 = ~3.0188. So μ ≈ 3.0188e-27 kg.

Now, R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R=2e-10 m.

Compute B: B = h²/(8 π² μ R²)

h is Planck's constant, which is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s.

So let's compute denominator first: 8 π² μ R².

Compute R squared: (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

Compute μ R²: 3.0188e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2075e-46 kg m².

Then, 8 π² times that: 8 * (π²) * 1.2075e-46. π² is about 9.8696, so 8*9.8696 ≈ 78.957.

So 78.957 * 1.2075e-46 ≈ let's compute 78.957 * 1.2075 ≈ (70 * 1.2075)=84.525, (8.957*1.2075≈10.815) total about 95.34. So approx 95.34e-46 = 9.534e-45 kg m².

So denominator is 9.534e-45.

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = approx (6.626)^2 = ~43.9, so 43.9e-68 = 4.39e-67 J² s².

So B = h²/(8 π² μ R²) = (4.39e-67) / (9.534e-45) ≈ 4.39e-67 / 9.534e-45 = approx 4.6e-23 J.

Wait, let me compute that division: 4.39e-67 / 9.534e-45 = (4.39 /9.534) ) * 1e-22.

4.39 /9.534 ≈ 0.46. So 0.46e-22 = 4.6e-23 J.

So B is approximately 4.6e-23 J.

Hmm, now the rotational energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is 2B, because E_rot for J=1 is 2B (since J=0 is 0, J=1 is 2B). So 2B = 9.2e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy difference is h w. w is given as 4e14 rad/s. h is 6.626e-34 J·s. So h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

So we have ΔE_vib = 2.65e-19 J, ΔE_rot = 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, comparing the two: 2.65e-19 J is much larger than 9.2e-23 J. So the rotational transition (from J=0→J=1) has a smaller energy difference. That means the molecule can transition to the next higher state (J=1, v=0) with lower energy than a vibrational transition (v=1, J=0). So the photon's energy would need to match the rotational energy difference.

Wait, but wait a second. The molecule is in the fundamental state, which is v=0, J=0. So the next possible state is the one with the next higher energy state. Since the rotational transition requires less energy (9.2e-23 J) compared to the vibrational (2.65e-19 J), the next state would be the J=1, v=0 state.

So the photon's energy would need to provide this energy difference, which is 9.2e-23 J. Then, from energy, E = p c, but wait, no, E is related to the photon's momentum. Oh, wait, the photon's energy is E = p c, because momentum p = E/(c). So p = E / c.

So let's compute p. E = 9.2e-23 J.

c is the speed of light, approx 3e8 m/s.

So p = E/c = (9.2e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but that doesn't match any of the options. The options are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range. Hmm, did I make a mistake in calculations?

Wait, let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I messed up the exponents.

Wait, 4e14 rad/s is w. Then, h w is 6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626 *4) =26.504, and 1e-34 *1e14 = 1e-20. So 26.504e-20 J, which is 2.65e-19 J. That's correct.

For B: h²/(8 pi² mu R²) = (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 pi² mu R²).

Wait, let's recalculate B carefully.

h = 6.626e-34 J s

h squared: (6.626e-34)^2 = (6.626)^2 * 1e-68 = approx 43.9 *1e-68 = 4.39e-67 J² s².

mu = (20 *2 amu)/(20+2) = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg, so mu = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 = let me compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605 = Let me compute:

1.8 *1.6605= 2.9889, 0.018 *1.6605=0.0299, so total 2.9889 +0.0299 = 3.0188.

So mu =3.0188e-27 kg.

R = 2 angstroms =2e-10 m. R squared is (2e-10)^2=4e-20 m².

So mu * R squared = 3.0188e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.2075e-46 kg m².

8 pi² mu R² = 8 * (pi²) *1.2075e-46.

pi² is about 9.8696, so 8 *9.8696 =78.9568.

78.9568 *1.2075e-46 = let's compute 78.9568 *1.2075.

78 *1.2075 =94.215, 0.9568 *1.2075 ≈ 1.155. So total approx 95.37.

So 8 pi² mu R² =95.37e-46 =9.537e-45 kg m².

So denominator is 9.537e-45.

Then, B = h²/(8 pi² mu R²) = (4.39e-67) / (9.537e-45) = let me compute that.

4.39e-67 /9.537e-45 = (4.39 /9.537) ) * 1e-22.

4.39 /9.537 ≈0.46, so 0.46e-22 =4.6e-23 J, which matches previous calculation.

So rotational energy difference is 2B=9.2e-23 J.

So the photon's energy needs to be 9.2e-23 J.

But wait, earlier calculation of p = E/c gives 9.2e-23 /3e8 = approx 3.07e-31 kg m/s. But the options are much larger, so perhaps I messed up the energy.

Wait, perhaps I was supposed to consider the vibrational transition instead? Because the rotational transition is smaller in energy, but maybe the molecule can't make that transition for some reason, like the selection rules. Oh wait, selection rules! I think in rotational transitions, the selection rule is ΔJ=±1. For vibrational, Δv=±1. But for ro-vibrational transitions, the selection rules allow Δv=±1 and ΔJ=±1. Hmm, but perhaps for this question, the transition is a pure rotational or pure vibrational one.

Wait, but in the question, the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest vibrational state, v=0, and the lowest rotational state, J=0. So the next state would be either v=1, J=0 or J=1, v=0, whichever is lower in energy.

Wait, but I calculated that the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational. So the photon needed would be to provide that rotational energy. But then why isn't the photon's momentum matching any of the options? Because when I calculated p, I got 3.07e-31 kg m/s, which is way smaller than the options given (1e-27 to 1e-28). So perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a vibrational transition. Let me compute the photon's momentum for the vibrational energy.

ΔE_vib = h w = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.65e-19 J / 3e8 m/s = approx 8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, which is smaller, and option A is 1.9e-28.

Wait, 8.83e-28 is not matching any of the options. Hmm. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0, v=0 to J=1, v=1? No, that's a higher energy. Or maybe it's a combination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the model allows for simultaneous changes in J and v. But I'm not sure about that either.

Alternatively, perhaps I confused the rotational energy with something else. Wait, the rotational energy is E= B J (J+1), so the transition from J=0 to J=1 requires 2B. But what if the model is a non-rigid rotor, which has a different formula for B? Or perhaps the bond length R is related to the vibrational energy?

Wait, the vibrational energy is given by (1/2) m ω² R² (for the harmonic oscillator approximation). Wait, but the energy is usually written as E_vib = (h/2π) * (n + 1/2) * ω, where n is the vibrational quantum number. Oh wait, that's the same as (n + 1/2) h ω, which is what I used earlier.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is not about the rotational-vibration coupling but about the model where the molecule can change either rotation or vibration.

Wait, perhaps the 'fundamental state' is the v=0, J=0, and the next state is the first energy level above that, which could be either J=1, v=0 or v=1, J=0. So the photon must provide exactly the energy difference between v=0, J=0 and either the next state.

But since the rotational energy difference is smaller, the next state is J=1, v=0. So the photon's energy is 2B.

Wait, but earlier calculation of 2B is 9.2e-23 J, which gives p=3.07e-31 kg m/s, which is way too small compared to the options given.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculating B. Let me recompute B.

Let me re-calculate B step by step.

B = h^2 / (8 π² μ R²)

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
μ = (20 * 2)/(22) amu = 1.818 amu = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈3.0188e-27 kg
R = 2e-10 m

So R squared is 4e-20 m².

μ * R squared = 3.0188e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2075e-46 kg m²

8 π^2 times that: 8 * (pi^2) ≈ 8 *9.8696≈78.957.

So 78.957 *1.2075e-46 = let me compute:

78 *1.2075e-46 = 94.215e-46 = 9.4215e-45
0.957 *1.2075e-46≈ 1.156e-46
Total: 9.4215e-45 +1.156e-46 ≈9.5371e-45.

So denominator is 9.5371e-45.

h^2 is (6.626e-34)^2 = (6.626)^2 = 43.90, so 43.90e-68 =4.39e-67.

B = 4.39e-67 /9.5371e-45 ≈ 4.39e-67 /9.537e-45 = 4.6e-23 J.

Wait, that's correct. So 2B is 9.2e-23 J, which gives a photon momentum of 3e-31 kg m/s. But the options are around 1e-27 to 1e-28. So this can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, which is (v=1, J=0). So the energy difference is h w, which is 2.65e-19 J.

So the photon's momentum p = E/c = (2.65e-19 J) / (3e8 m/s) ≈ 8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options:

Options are:
A) 1.9e-28
B) 2.3e-27
C)1.1e-27
D)1.4e-28

8.83e-28 is close to option D (1.4e-28), but not quite. But wait, there's a discrepancy. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the change in angular momentum, not the energy. No, because the photon's momentum relates to the energy it imparts.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the energy in the vibrational transition. Let me recheck.

h w: 6.626e-34 J·s *4e14 rad/s = 2.65e-19 J. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps the question is considering the transition from J=0, v=0 to J=0, v=1, which is a pure vibrational transition. Then the photon's energy is h w, which gives p=8.83e-28 kg m/s, which is about 8.8e-28, but the options are 1.4e-28 and 1.9e-28, which are smaller. So maybe I'm not considering something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground vibrational state but a higher rotational state. But I thought the next state would be the lower energy transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition from the fundamental state to the next state, which is the combination of both a rotational and vibrational change. But that would probably require a larger energy, which doesn't match the options.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the change in angular momentum (momentum per unit length?), but that doesn't make sense because the question specifically asks for momentum, which is in kg m/s.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the photon's momentum. Let me recheck. E = h f = pc, so p = E/(c). So for E =9.2e-23 J, p= 9.2e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But this isn't matching any options. So perhaps I should consider that the question is considering the absorption of a photon that causes a transition from v=0, J=0 to v=1, J=0. Then, the energy is h w, which is 2.65e-19 J, and p=8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the reduced mass in the calculation of the vibrational frequency.

Wait, no, the vibrational frequency is given as w. So that's already factored into the energy.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recheck that.

Wait, B is (h²)/(8 pi² mu R²). So, mu is 3.0188e-27 kg, R is 2e-10 m.

So, R squared is 4e-20 m².

Denominator: 8 pi² mu R² = 8 * (pi^2) *3.0188e-27 *4e-20.

Wait, no, wait: 8 pi² mu R² = 8 * pi^2 * (mu * R²). Oh, but mu R squared is 3.0188e-27 kg *4e-20 m²= 1.2075e-46 kg m².

Then, 8 pi² *1.2075e-46 = compute 8 *9.8696 *1.2075e-46. 8 *9.8696 is ~78.957. So 78.957 *1.2075e-46 = let me compute 78.957 *1.2075 = about 95.37. So it's 95.37e-46 =9.537e-45.

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67.

So B =4.39e-67 /9.537e-45 = 4.6e-23 J.

That's correct. So 2B is 9.2e-23 J.

Hmm, given that, perhaps the options have a typo or I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about the transition from J=0 to J=2, which would require more energy, but that's unlikely since the next state is the lowest possible.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the photon's momentum for the vibrational transition, which is 8.8e-28 kg m/s. The options don't have this value, but perhaps I should consider that the question is about the rotational transition, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the bond length is given as 2 angstroms, but the model uses the bond length as an average, and the reduced mass needs to account for the actual bond length. Hmm, but I don't think that affects B.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the rotational energy difference in terms of the vibrational energy. Wait, no, they are separate.

Wait, maybe the energy required is the sum of the rotational and vibrational differences, but that would require more energy than either alone, which isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the transition from v=0, J=0 to v=1, J=1. Then, the energy difference would be ΔE = (h w) + (2B). Let's compute that: 2.65e-19 +9.2e-23 = approx 2.65e-19 J. So the photon's momentum would still be about 8.8e-28 kg m/s, which is still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the change in angular momentum, but that doesn't fit the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the photon's momentum when it is absorbed, leading to a transition that involves both rotational and vibrational changes. But that's making it more complicated, and I'm not sure.

Let me look at the options again:

A) 1.9e-28
B) 2.3e-27
C)1.1e-27
D)1.4e-28

If the correct p is about 8.8e-28, but that's not an option. The closest option is A) 1.9e-28, which is about a fifth of that. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in a calculation factor.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the vibrational energy in terms of h nu, but maybe I forgot a factor. Wait, no, E = h nu, which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition from the (0,0) state to the (1,0) state, which is a pure vibrational transition, but the calculation gives p=8.8e-28, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_vib.

Wait, let me recompute E_vib:

E_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 J·s *4e14 rad/s = 2.6504e-19 J.

So, 2.65e-19 J. p = E/(c) = 2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the question is about the rotational transition, but I'm getting a p that's way too small. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the photon's momentum in a different way. For example, the molecule's reduced mass is used in another calculation. Or perhaps the bond length is used in a different way.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the problem is asking for the photon's momentum when it is absorbed to cause a change in both vibrational and rotational states, but that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the model is the rigid rotor, but the question says non-rigid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next state (v=1, J=0), which requires the photon's energy to be h w, so p=8.8e-28 kg m/s.

But since none of the options match, perhaps there's a mistake in the way I converted the units.

Wait, perhaps in the calculation of B, I made a unit mistake. Let me check the units again.

h is in J s, which is kg m^2/s.

mu is in kg.

R is in meters.

So B has units of J, which is correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is using the harmonic oscillator approximation for the vibrational energy, but considering the rotational energy as part of that.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again about what the question is asking.

The question is about the lowest possible energy state after absorbing a photon. So the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0). The next possible state is the one with the lowest energy, which is the state with the smallest energy difference.

We calculated that the rotational transition (J=0→J=1) has a smaller energy difference (9.2e-23 J) than the vibrational transition (2.65e-19 J). So the photon needs to have energy equal to 9.2e-23 J.

Then p = E/c = 9.2e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options match this, which suggests that perhaps I'm looking at the wrong transition.

Wait, perhaps the model allows for a vibrational transition but with a lower energy. But earlier calculation shows that the rotational transition has lower energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the (v=1, J=1) state, but that's a higher energy.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is about the transition to the (v=1, J=0) state, which requires the vibrational energy. But then p would be 8.8e-28, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the photon's momentum when it's absorbed, and the molecule's angular momentum changes. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me compute B again more accurately.

Compute mu:

Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu. mu = (20 *2)/(20+2)=40/22=1.81818 amu.

1 amu =1.66053906660e-27 kg. So mu =1.81818 *1.66053906660e-27 kg.

1.81818 *1.66053906660 = let's compute:

1.81818 *1.66053906660 ≈ 3.0188e-27 kg.

Yes, correct.

R =2 angstrom =2e-10 m.

B = h²/(8 pi² mu R²) = (6.62607015e-34)^2 / (8*(pi^2)* (3.0188e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 )

Compute denominator:

(2e-10)^2=4e-20 m².

mu * R^2 =3.0188e-27 kg *4e-20 m²=1.2075e-46 kg m².

8 pi² * mu R^2 =8*(9.8696044)*1.2075e-46 = 8 *9.8696044 =78.9568352 *1.2075e-46.

78.9568352 *1.2075= approx 78.9568 *1.2075 = let's compute:

78 *1.2075 =94.215, 0.9568 *1.2075≈1.155. So total 95.37.

So 95.37e-46 =9.537e-45.

h squared: (6.62607015e-34)^2 = (6.62607015)^2 = approx 43.90086e-68 =4.390086e-67.

So B =4.390086e-67 /9.537e-45 = 4.390086 /9.537e-22= (approx 0.46) 4.6e-23 J.

So B=4.6e-23 J.

So 2B=9.2e-23 J.

Hmm. So the photon's energy would be 9.2e-23 J, leading to p=3.07e-31 kg m/s, which is way below the options given.

So perhaps I'm missing a factor. Wait, another possibility: the question refers to the transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=1), which would require both a vibrational and rotational transition. But that's twice as much in rotational and one vibrational. But that's probably not the case since the question asks for the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2, but that's even higher energy.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Maybe the molecule is modeled as a rigid rotor, but the question says non-rigid. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the (v=1, J=0) state, which requires a photon of energy h w. So p=8.83e-28 kg m/s. Looking at the options, the closest is option A:1.9e-28. Hmm, but that's about a fifth of what I calculated. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute h w.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

h w=6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626 *4) =26.504e-20 =2.6504e-19 J.

p= E/c =2.6504e-19 J /3e8 m/s=8.8347e-28 kg m/s.

So approximately 8.8e-28 kg m/s.

The options don't have this value, but option A is 1.9e-28, which is about a fifth.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of h. Because the exact value of h is 6.62607015e-34 J·s. So perhaps the calculation is precise.

Wait, 6.62607015e-34 *4e14 = (6.62607015 *4)=26.5042806e-20 J =2.65042806e-19 J.

p =2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.8347e-28 kg m/s.

Hmm, but no option is near that. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the question is about a diatomic molecule's vibrational transition, but in the model, the molecule's moment of inertia is used, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the molecule's energy but about the photon's momentum when it's absorbed, regardless of the energy. But that doesn't make sense; the photon's momentum must match the energy needed.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to compute the photon's momentum for the vibrational transition, but the question isn't about the photon's energy. No, it must be.

Wait, perhaps the question is a trick question and the correct answer is option C:1.1e-27 kg m/s. Let me think.

Wait, 1.1e-27 is larger than 8.8e-28. How would that happen? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of E_vib.

Wait, no, E_vib is correct. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=2), but that's even higher.

I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think of another approach. Maybe the question is referring to the change in angular momentum, which is L = J ħ. But the photon's momentum relates to the energy, not the angular momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is mixing up rotational and vibrational aspects. Maybe I should compute the vibrational energy in terms of the bond's force constant, but the given data includes w, so that's not needed.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the change in the rotational state but the calculation of the photon's momentum is different. Wait, perhaps I should use the formula p = (h)/(lambda), but how does that relate to the energy.

Wait, another approach: photon's energy E = hc/lambda = pc, so p = E/(c) = (h f)/(c) = h/(lambda) * (1/c) ? No, that's not right. Wait, E=pc for photons, so p=E/c.

So that seems correct.

Given that, I think the photon's momentum for the vibrational transition is 8.8e-28 kg m/s, but the options don't have that value. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the reduced mass in the photon's momentum calculation. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the energy difference is h(w), but in terms of the rotational energy, perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that the rotational energy is quantized and that the next state is J=1, but maybe the question is considering that the molecule can't absorb a photon with such low momentum, so maybe it's the vibrational transition.

But I'm not sure. The only options that are in the same ballpark as 8.8e-28 are option A (1.9e-28) and D (1.4e-28), but mine is about 5.5 times larger than option D.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h w. Let's recalculate.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

h*w=6.626e-34 *4e14= (6.626 *4)=26.504e-20 J=2.6504e-19 J.

p=2.6504e-19 /3e8=8.8347e-28 kg m/s.

Hmm, so perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the energy levels. Maybe the next state is a combination of vibrational and rotational states, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is about the transition from the (0,0) state to (1,1) state, which would require both rotational and vibrational changes. So the energy difference would be (h w) + (2B).

But that would be 2.65e-19 +9.2e-23= approx 2.65e-19 J. So p=8.8e-28 kg m/s again.

Hmm, no change.

Given that, I'm at a loss. Perhaps I should look for the option that's closest to 8.8e-28, but none are. So perhaps the correct option is not present, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the molecule's transition is from J=0 to J=2, but that's higher energy than J=1 and would require more energy, which again isn't matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the photon's momentum when it's absorbed, which would be E/c where E is the sum of the rotational and vibrational energy differences, but that still doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units of R. The bond length is given as 2 angstroms, which is correct as 2e-10 m.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is about the transition from the (0,0) state to the (0,1) state, which is pure rotational. So the energy is 2B=9.2e-23 J, p=3.07e-31 kg m/s. But that's way below the options given.

So I'm stuck. Given the options, maybe I should look for another approach. Perhaps the question is asking about the photon's momentum in a different context, like the change in the molecule's linear momentum. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the transition from the (0,0) state to the (1,0) state, which requires a photon of energy h w, and the momentum is p = E/c =8.8e-28 kg m/s. None of the options match, but perhaps option A is the closest.

But option A is 1.9e-28 kg m/s, which is about a fifth of my calculated value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h. Let me check: no, h is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different value for c, like 3e8 m/s is correct, but perhaps it's using a different approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition as a combination of both rotational and vibrational changes, but I don't see how that would lower the energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition, but I'm using the wrong formula for the energy.

Wait, another formula for vibrational energy is E_vib = (1/2) m ω² R² (1 + cos(theta)), but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, no, the vibrational energy in the harmonic oscillator model is (n + 1/2) h ω, which is what I used.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition in terms of the molecular bond's potential energy, but that's probably beyond the scope.

Given all that, I'm not making progress. Perhaps I should try to see if any of the options align with possible calculations.

Looking at option C:1.1e-27 kg m/s.

p =1.1e-27 kg m/s.

E = p c =1.1e-27 *3e8 =3.3e-19 J.

Which would imply that h w =3.3e-19 J.

But h w is 2.65e-19 J, so that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute E = h w for the rotational transition.

E_rot =2B=9.2e-23 J.

p=9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Which is way smaller than any option.

So perhaps the correct answer is not present, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is about the transition from J=0 to J=1 with v=1. So the energy would be 2B + h w. But that's 9.2e-23 +2.65e-19= approx 2.65e-19 J. p=8.8e-28 kg m/s again.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition from J=0 to J=2, which would require 6B=2.76e-22 J. p=9.2e-23 J. No, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the rotational transition, but the value is in a different unit. Let me see the options again.

The options are in N·s, which is kg·m/s. So the units are correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should compute the photon's momentum using the vibrational energy per mole or something, but that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition from the (v=0, J=0) state to the (v=1, J=1) state. The energy difference would be h w +2B=2.65e-19 +9.2e-23=2.659e-19 J. So p=8.86e-28 kg m/s. Still not matching.

Another thought: perhaps the question is referring to the molecule's transition to the next state, which combines a change in both vibrational and rotational states. But without more info, I can't proceed.

At this point, I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the correct photon momentum for the rotational transition is about 3e-31 kg m/s, which doesn't match any option. For the vibrational transition, it's about 8.8e-28 kg m/s, which also doesn't match. But perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is about a diatomic molecule modeled as a rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator, and the energy levels are given by the sum of rotational and vibrational energies. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state with the lowest energy would be the one with the next higher energy, which is either J=1, v=0 or v=1, J=0.

We calculated that the rotational transition requires less energy, so the photon's energy is 2B=9.2e-23 J, which leads to a momentum of 3.07e-31 kg m/s. Since none of the options match, perhaps I'm missing a key point.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the photon's momentum when it causes the molecule to transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=1), which would require both a vibrational and rotational transition. The energy difference would be h w + 2B=2.65e-19 +9.2e-23= approx 2.65e-19 J. p=8.83e-28 kg m/s.

But again, that doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the energy difference but the angular momentum change. For a rotational transition from J=0→J=1, the change in angular momentum is ΔL=ħ (J+1 - J). So ΔL= ħ (1 -0)=ħ. ħ is h/(2π)=1.0545718e-34 J·s.

But photon's angular momentum is ħ, so perhaps the question is about that. But the question asks about momentum, not angular momentum.

I'm stuck. Based on my calculations, the correct momentum for the rotational transition is much smaller than any option. For the vibrational transition, it's around 8.8e-28 kg m/s, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that can't be right.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is using the rotational constant B in cm^-1, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the energy difference but about the photon's momentum as part of the selection rules, but I don't see how that applies.

At this point, I think the correct approach is to go with the vibrational transition, as it's the only one that could possibly be among the options, even though my calculation doesn't match any. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck B.

Wait, mu R² is 3.0188e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.0188e-27 *4e-20=1.2075e-46 kg m².

Denominator:8 pi² mu R²=8*(pi^2)*1.2075e-46=78.9568 *1.2075e-46=95.37e-46=9.537e-45 kg m².

h squared: (6.626e-34)^2=4.39e-67 J² s².

B=4.39e-67 /9.537e-45=4.6e-23 J.

So 2B=9.2e-23 J, correct.

Hmm. I think I've exhausted all possibilities, and the correct answer isn't matching any options. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option C:1.1e-27 kg m/s. But I'm not sure how to get there.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the reduced mass in a different way. Wait, the reduced mass for vibration is mu = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My), which I correctly calculated. So perhaps that's not the issue.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition from the (v=0, J=0) state to the (v=0, J=2) state, which would require 6B=27.6e-23 J. So p=9.2e-23 J. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from J=0 to J=0, but that's not a transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the photon's momentum in the center of mass frame, but that's probably not relevant here.

In conclusion, I'm stuck, but based on the calculations, the vibrational transition requires a photon momentum of approximately 8.8e-28 kg m/s, which isn't among the options. The closest option is A)1.9e-28, but that's about a fifth of my calculated value. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, but I can't find where.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h w. Let me recheck.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

h*w=6.626e-34 *4e14 =6.626 *4 =26.504e-20 J =2.6504e-19 J.

p=2.6504e-19 /3e8=8.8347e-28 kg m/s.

Hmm, this is correct.

Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option A)1.9e-28 kg m/s, which is approximately a fifth of the correct value. But I can't see why that would be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from J=0 to J=1, but using the rotational energy in a different way. But I don't see how.

Another possible mistake: perhaps I used the wrong value for Planck's constant. Let me check: 6.626e-34 J·s is correct.

In the absence of any other leads, I'll have to make an educated guess. The only option close to the vibrational transition is none, so perhaps the intended answer is option C:1.1e-27 kg m/s, but I'm not sure how to reach that.


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, where the molecule is initially in its fundamental state (v=0, J=0). The goal is to determine the momentum of a photon required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The given data includes the masses of the atoms (Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu), the bond length (R = 2 angstroms), and the angular frequency of vibration (w = 4 × 10¹⁴ rad/s).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Levels in the Rotation-Vibration Model**:
   - The total energy of the molecule is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies:
     - Rotational energy: \( E_{\text{rot}} = B J (J+1) \), where \( B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 \mu R^2} \) is the rotational constant.
     - Vibrational energy: \( E_{\text{vib}} = (v + \frac{1}{2}) h \omega \).
   - The fundamental state is \( v=0, J=0 \). The next possible states are:
     - \( v=1, J=0 \): Pure vibrational transition with energy difference \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega \).
     - \( v=0, J=1 \): Pure rotational transition with energy difference \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B \).

2. **Reduced Mass Calculation**:
   - The reduced mass \( \mu \) is calculated as:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \times 2}{20 + 2} \, \text{amu} = 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
     \]
   - Converting to kilograms: \( \mu = 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.0188 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \).

3. **Rotational Constant \( B \)**:
   - Using \( B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 \mu R^2} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \):
     \[
     B = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 \pi^2 (3.0188 \times 10^{-27}) (2 \times 10^{-10})^2}.
     \]
   - After calculations, \( B \approx 4.6 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \).

4. **Energy Differences**:
   - Rotational transition (\( J=0 \to J=1 \)): \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \).
   - Vibrational transition (\( v=0 \to v=1 \)): \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) (4 \times 10^{14}) = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \).

5. **Photon Momentum**:
   - The photon's momentum is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).
   - For the rotational transition: \( p = \frac{9.2 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s} \), which is far smaller than any of the given options.
   - For the vibrational transition: \( p = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s} \), which also does not match any of the options.

6. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated momentum for the vibrational transition (\( 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s} \)) is approximately 6.3 times larger than the closest option, \( 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s} \) (Option D). No clear explanation for this discrepancy was found.

### Conclusion:
Based on the calculations, the vibrational transition requires a photon momentum of approximately \( 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s} \). However, this value does not match any of the given options. The closest option is **D) \( 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s} \)**, but it is unclear why the calculated value differs so significantly from the provided options.

Answer: D
