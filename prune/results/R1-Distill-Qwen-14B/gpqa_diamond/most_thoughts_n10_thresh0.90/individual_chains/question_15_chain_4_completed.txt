Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, let's think. So the setup is that two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, are being observed for transits. But the researchers have limited time and want to pick the one with the highest chance of transiting.

Wait, both planets were detected via the RV method. So from RV, we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Oh, and they have the same mass. Oh wait, same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is orbiting faster, meaning it's closer to its star.

Also, both have circular orbits. So no eccentricity issues to complicate things. The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radius. Interesting. So Planet_1's star is more massive but same size, which probably means it's younger and not evolved, since evolved stars tend to expand.

Transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. But how does that relate to the other factors given?

Wait, the formula for the probability of a transit is approximately R_star / a, where R_star is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Because the planet must pass in front of the star, which depends on how large the orbit is relative to the star's size.

But wait, the semi-major axis a is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law. Since P is the orbital period, a^3 = (G(M_star + M_planet)/(4π²)) * P². But since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate a^3 ≈ (G M_star) (P/(2π))^2. So a is proportional to (M_star * P^2)^(1/3).

Wait, let me get that right. Kepler's law: a^3 = (G(M + m))/(4π²) * P². Since m (planet mass) is much less than M (star mass), we can ignore it. So a^3 ≈ (G M) (P²)/(4π²). So a is proportional to (M * P²)^(1/3).

Wait, but actually, the exact formula is a = [ (G M_star * P²) / (4π²) ]^(1/3). But for the purpose of comparing probabilities between two planets, maybe I can relate a for Planet_1 and Planet_2.

Given that both have circular orbits, same mass, but different periods and host stars.

Let me collect the given data:

Planet_1:
- Period P1 = P (since P2 is three times longer, P2=3P)
- Star mass M1 = 2 M2 (M2 is the mass of Planet_2's star)
- Star radius R1 = R2 = R (since both stars have same radius)

Planet_2:
- Period P2 = 3 P1 (since P1 is 3 times shorter than P2, or wait, the question says Planet_1 has three times shorter period than Planet_2, so P1 = (1/3) P2 → so P2 = 3 P1)
- Star mass M2 = M* (assuming M1 is 2M*, M2 is M*)
- Star radius R = same as Planet_1.

Wait, no, the host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. So M1 = 2 * M2. Because if M2 is the host of Planet_2, then M1 = 2 M2.

So I can write M1 = 2 M2.

So for each planet, I can compute a1 and a2.

Compute a1: a1 = [ (G M1 * P1²) / (4π²) ]^(1/3)
Similarly, a2 = [ (G M2 * P2²) / (4π²) ]^(1/3 )

But since we're interested in the ratio a1/a2, let's compute that.

a1/a2 = [ (M1 / M2) * (P1² / P2²) ]^(1/3 )

We have M1 = 2 M2 → M1/M2 = 2.

P1 = (1/3) P2 → P1² = (1/9) P2² → P1² / P2² = 1/9.

So, a1/a2 = [ 2 * (1/9) ]^(1/3 ) = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) → around 0.606.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 * a2.

Wait, because a1 is smaller than a2. So Planet_1 is closer in.

Now, the transit probability is roughly (R_star / a). Since R_star is same for both, the transit probability is inversely proportional to a.

So P_transit ∝ 1/a.

So P1's probability is (R / a1) and P2's is (R / a2).

So the ratio P1/P2 = (R/a1)/(R/a2) ) = a2/a1.

Since a1 = 0.606 a2 → a2/a1 ≈ 1.65.

So P1's probability is about 1.65 times higher than P2's.

Wait, that would mean Planet_1 has a higher probability, so they should choose Planet_1.

Wait, but let me think again. Because when a is smaller, the planet is closer, so the chance it transits is higher. Because transit depends on the apparent size of the star relative to the planet's orbital path. So yes, the probability is higher when a is smaller.

So in this case, a1 is smaller than a2, so P_transit for Planet_1 is higher than for Planet_2.

So the ratio is P1/P2 = (R/a1)/(R/a2) = a2/a1.

Earlier calculation: a2 is about 1.65 times a1. So a2/a1 is about 1.65.

So P1's probability is 1.65 times higher than P2's.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, a1 is smaller, so a2 is larger.

Wait, let me recompute a1/a2.

Wait, a1 = [ (G*(2 M2) * P1²) / (4π²) ]^(1/3)

a2 = [ (G M2 * (3 P1)^2 ) / (4π²) ]^(1/3 )

So a1 = [ 2 M2 * P1^2 ]^(1/3) * (G/(4π²))^1/3

a2 = [ M2 * 9 P1^2 ]^(1/3) * same const.

So a1/a2 = [ (2 M2 P1^2) / (9 M2 P1^2) ) ]^(1/3 )

= (2/9)^(1/3) → same as earlier → approx 0.606.

So a1 is about 0.606 a2. So a2 is about 1.65 a1.

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is (R/a1), and planet_2 is (R/a2) → (R/(0.606 a2)) and (R/a2). So (R/a1) = 1.65 (R/a2).

So the probability for Planet_1 is about 1.65 times higher.

Wait, but wait: if a is larger, the probability is lower, right?

Because the planet has to pass in front of the star. If the orbit is larger (a is bigger), the chance is less. So higher a → lower probability.

Thus, Planet_1's a is smaller, so higher transit probability.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher by a factor of (a2/a1) = 1.65.

So the probability ratio is approximately 1.65 times higher for Planet_1.

So the researchers should prefer Planet_1 because it has a higher probability of transiting.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. Option D says ~2.7 times.

Wait, perhaps I did an error in the ratio. Let me recompute.

Wait, the probability is R/(a) multiplied by some function, but in the approximation, it's proportional to R/a. So for each planet, P1 = R/(a1) and P2 = R/(a2). So P1/P2 = (R/a1)/(R/a2) = a2/a1.

We have a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) → which is cube root of 2/9.

2/9 is approximately 0.222, cube root is cube root of 0.222.

Cube root of 0.125 is 0.5 (since 0.5^3=0.125). 0.222 is higher, so cube root is about 0.606, as before.

So a2/a1 = 1/(0.606) ≈ 1.65.

So the probability for Planet_1 is 1.65 times higher than Planet_2.

Which matches option C: "Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit."

So the answer should be option C.


To determine which planet has the higher probability of transiting, we analyze the given data:

1. **Key Parameters**:
   - Both planets have the same mass.
   - Planet_1 has an orbital period \( P_1 \), while Planet_2 has \( P_2 = 3P_1 \).
   - The host star of Planet_1 has a mass \( M_1 = 2M_2 \), where \( M_2 \) is the mass of Planet_2's host star.
   - Both stars have the same radius \( R \).

2. **Orbital Distance**:
   Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is proportional to:
   \[
   a \propto (M \cdot P^2)^{1/3}
   \]
   For Planet_1:
   \[
   a_1 \propto (M_1 \cdot P_1^2)^{1/3} = (2M_2 \cdot P_1^2)^{1/3}
   \]
   For Planet_2:
   \[
   a_2 \propto (M_2 \cdot (3P_1)^2)^{1/3} = (M_2 \cdot 9P_1^2)^{1/3}
   \]
   The ratio of \( a_1 \) to \( a_2 \) is:
   \[
   \frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2M_2 \cdot P_1^2}{M_2 \cdot 9P_1^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
   \]
   Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \), meaning Planet_1 is closer to its host star.

3. **Transit Probability**:
   The transit probability is approximately proportional to:
   \[
   P_{\text{transit}} \propto \frac{R}{a}
   \]
   For Planet_1:
   \[
   P_1 \propto \frac{R}{a_1}
   \]
   For Planet_2:
   \[
   P_2 \propto \frac{R}{a_2}
   \]
   The ratio of probabilities is:
   \[
   \frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R}{a_1}}{\frac{R}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65
   \]
   Therefore, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

4. **Conclusion**:
   Since Planet_1 has a higher transit probability, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.
