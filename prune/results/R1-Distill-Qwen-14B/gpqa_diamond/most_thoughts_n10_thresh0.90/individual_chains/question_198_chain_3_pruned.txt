Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Alright, let's break it down.

The solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) are given for the first to fourth complexes: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, what's a stability constant again? Oh right, the β value is the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex. So for each complex, Co(II) binds with n SCN- ions, and βn is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n), I think.

The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I believe is [Co(SCN)_2]^something. Wait, I'm not exactly sure about the color, but the problem probably refers to the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex as blue. Dithiocyanato means two SCN- ions attached, right?

So the species we're interested in is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+. And we need to find the fraction of all cobalt species that this complex contributes to, then multiply by 100 to get a percentage.

I remember that for such problems, we can model the distribution of metal complexes using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand. The general approach is to consider all possible complexes (from n=0 to n=4, I think) and calculate their concentrations based on the given β values and the ligand concentration.

The main idea is to use the formation constants to find the fraction of each complex. Since the formation constants vary, the higher β complexes are more stable and thus more prevalent.

Let me think about the formula. For each complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n), the concentration can be found using the formula:

[Co(SCN)_n] = βn × [Co^(2+)] × [SCN-]^n / (1 + sum over m of βm [SCN-]^m )

But wait, since the total concentration of Co is c = [Co^(2+)] + sum over n of [Co(SCN)_n], perhaps it's easier to express everything in terms of [Co^(2+)] and the ligand.

Alternatively, because the ligand is in excess, perhaps we can assume that the ligand concentration [SCN-] is roughly constant, which it is given as 0.1 M. So we can model the fraction of each complex based on their β and the ligand concentration.

Wait, another approach is to use the distribution of the metal between the different complexes. The fraction of each complex is determined by the β values and the ligand concentration.

The fraction f_n for each complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) is given by:

f_n = (β_n [SCN-]^n) / (sum from m=0 to 4 of β_m [SCN-]^m )

But wait, m starts at 0
