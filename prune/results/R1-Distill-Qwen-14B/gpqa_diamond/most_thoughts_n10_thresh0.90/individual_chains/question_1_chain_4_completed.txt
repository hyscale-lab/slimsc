Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me read the question again.

The question says that two quantum states have energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find out which energy difference would allow us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A) 10^-9 eV, B) 10^-11 eV, C) 10^-4 eV, D) 10^-8 eV.

Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

In this case, the lifetimes given are the uncertainty in time (Δt) for each state. Wait, but wait—each state has its own lifetime. Oh, but wait, when we're talking about the energy difference between the two states, perhaps we should consider the uncertainty in the energy of each state to determine if they can be distinguished.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference (E2 - E1) between the two states. To distinguish them, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state, I suppose. Because if the energy difference is too small, the uncertainty from the lifetimes might make it hard to tell them apart.

So, let me think. For each state, the uncertainty in energy would be ħ divided by the lifetime. So for E1 with τ1=1e-9 sec, ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1, and similarly for ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So the energy difference should be significantly larger than the uncertainties in each state so that they can be resolved.

Wait, but perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the uncertainty in energy for each state and then ensure that the energy difference is larger than the sum or something. Or maybe the maximum uncertainty in the energy measurement would be the sum of the individual uncertainties, or perhaps the larger of the two.

Wait, let me think. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So, the uncertainty in energy for a state is roughly ħ divided by the lifetime of that state.

So for E1, with τ1=1e-9 s, ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2 τ1), and similarly for E2, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2 τ2).

But since τ2 is longer than τ1 (1e-8 s vs 1e-9 s), ΔE2 will be smaller than ΔE1. Because a longer lifetime means a lower uncertainty in energy. So ΔE1 is ħ/(2 * 1e-9) and ΔE2 is ħ/(2 * 1e-8). Which means ΔE1 is about 10 times larger than ΔE2.

Wait, but the energy difference between E2 and E1 is (E2 - E1). To distinguish them, this difference should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties in each state's energy. Or is it the maximum of the two uncertainties?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should think in terms of how the energy difference relates to the uncertainties. Let's compute the uncertainties.

First, I know that ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But since the options are in eV, maybe I should convert ħ into eV·s.

1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So ħ in eV·s is (1.0545718e-34 J·s) * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) ≈ (1.05457e-34 / 1.602e-19) eV·s ≈ approx 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

Now, for each state:

ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2 τ1) = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-9) eV.

Calculating that: 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = 3.291e-7 eV. So about 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, for ΔE2: ħ/(2 τ2) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-8) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = 3.291e-8 eV, which is about 3.29e-8 eV.

So, the uncertainty in E1 is about 3.29e-7 eV, and E2's uncertainty is about 3.29e-8 eV.

Now, the energy difference between E2 and E1 is (E2 - E1) = ΔE. To clearly distinguish them, this ΔE needs to be greater than the sum of the uncertainties, or the maximum uncertainty. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't tell them apart.

Wait, but wait, I think when considering two states, the maximum possible uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of the individual uncertainties. Because each state's energy has its own uncertainty, so the difference between them would have an uncertainty of ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, but let me think again. The energy difference's uncertainty is actually the root mean square, perhaps, but in many cases, for simplicity, it's considered as the sum. Alternatively, maybe it's the maximum of the two.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about it. Suppose we have two energies, each with their own uncertainties. The uncertainty in the difference would be sqrt(ΔE1² + ΔE2²), assuming the uncertainties are independent and uncorrelated. But if the two states are being measured in the same experiment, perhaps the time uncertainty for the difference is the same as the maximum of the individual lifetimes? Hmm, but I'm not quite certain.

Alternatively, maybe the energy difference's uncertainty is the maximum of the two individual uncertainties. Because if you have two states, each with their own lifetimes, the energy difference's uncertainty might be determined by the shorter lifetime. Because if one state has a much shorter lifetime, its energy is less certain, so the difference's uncertainty could be dominated by that.

Wait, but in this case, E1 has a shorter lifetime (1e-9 s) than E2 (1e-8 s). So E1 has a larger uncertainty (3.29e-7 eV) compared to E2's 3.29e-8 eV. So the uncertainty in E1 is about 10 times larger than E2's.

So, the maximum uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of the individual uncertainties, or perhaps the larger one, since the larger one is already 10 times bigger. Let me calculate both possibilities.

Sum of uncertainties: 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = approx 3.62e-7 eV.

Maximum uncertainty: 3.29e-7 eV.

So, the energy difference must be larger than this. Let's look at the options.

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV. That's much larger than the sum (approx 3.62e-7 eV is 0.000000362 eV). So 1e-4 is way bigger. So option C would definitely be distinguishable.

But let's check the other options. Option A is 1e-9 eV. That's 0.000000001 eV. Which is smaller than the sum and maximum. So that's not enough.

Option B is 1e-11 eV, which is even smaller. So that's worse.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.00000001 eV. That's still smaller than the maximum uncertainty (3.29e-7 eV is 0.000000329 eV). So 1e-8 eV is smaller than the max uncertainty, so the energy difference can't be distinguished.

So the only option that's larger than the sum of the uncertainties is option C, 1e-4 eV. So that's the correct one.


To distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), their energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be larger than the uncertainty in energy, which is determined by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: 

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}.
\]

Here, \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state, and \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \). For each state, the uncertainty in energy is approximately:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate uncertainties for each state
- For \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) (shorter lifetime, larger uncertainty):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

- For \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \) (longer lifetime, smaller uncertainty):
  \[
  \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the energy difference required for distinction
To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties in energy:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{required}} > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{required}} > 3.29 \times 10^{-7} + 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \approx 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it cannot be distinguished.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so it cannot be distinguished.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much larger than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it can be clearly distinguished.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it cannot be distinguished.

### Conclusion
The only energy difference that satisfies the condition for clear distinction is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).
