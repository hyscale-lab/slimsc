Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, first, what do I remember about SMEFT? I think it's a framework where you write down all possible higher-dimensional operators that can describe physics beyond the Standard Model. But these operators have to respect certain symmetries, right?

Let me think about each symmetry:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars. That makes sense because the Standard Model itself is Lorentz invariant. So any operator in SMEFT must transform correctly under Lorentz transformations. So Lorentz symmetry must be respected. So 1 is definitely a must.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Hmm, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like rotational and boost symmetries, plus shifting space and time). Wait, wait. Wait, the SMEFT operators are local, meaning they have to be invariant under Poincare symmetry. Because if they weren't, the theory wouldn't make sense as a local effective field theory. So operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So 2 must also be respected. So options including both 1 and 2 would be correct so far.

3. CP symmetry: CP symmetry is the combination of Charge conjugation and Parity. I don't think SMEFT necessarily requires all operators to respect CP. Because the Standard Model doesn't have CP symmetry, especially due to processes like CP violation in the CKM matrix. So if the operators don't have to respect CP, then this symmetry isn't a must. So 3 might not be a required symmetry, meaning it's not a correct option.

4. CPT symmetry: CPT is Charge, Parity, Time reversal. The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry, and SMEFT is an effective theory based on it. I think that all physics must respect CPT, as it's a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. So any operators in SMEFT must respect CPT. So 4 is a must.

Wait, but wait. Wait, is CPT symmetry automatically respected if the theory is unitary and Poincare invariant? Because I remember that in quantum field theory, Poincare invariant theories that are unitary must respect CPT. So if SMEFT is a unitary effective theory, then CPT symmetry is automatically respected. So the operators don't need to enforce CPT; it comes for free.

Hmm, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if CPT is automatically satisfied due to other symmetries, does the operator need to enforce it? Or is it something that is naturally a part of the setup?

Wait, but the operators are built from fields that already respect CPT. So maybe the operators themselves don't have to explicitly respect CPT because the fields are CPT eigenstates. So perhaps the operators themselves don't need to have any particular CPT properties beyond what's already in the fields. Wait, but the overall theory (SMEFT) must respect CPT. So the operators can have any possible CPT structure, as long as the sum of them respects it. Hmm, maybe that's more complicated.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The SMEFT is built as a low-energy effective theory that respects the same symmetries as the Standard Model. The Standard Model respects Lorentz, Poincare (since it's a local theory), but not necessarily CP or CPT (though it does, actually, but certain terms are allowed that violate CP).

Wait, no, the Standard Model does respect CPT symmetry. So SMEFT, being an extension, must also respect CPT symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must combine in such a way that CPT is preserved. So each operator must be a CPT eigenstate, or perhaps the combination of operators leads to CPT being conserved.

Wait, but when you write down operators, you have to ensure that the entire theory is CPT invariant. So perhaps each operator doesn't have to be CPT symmetric on its own, as long as when you sum them (with coefficients), the total respects CPT. Hmm, that might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe the operators themselves must respect CPT symmetry. For example, each operator must be a CPT eigenstate. Otherwise, you could have terms that violate CPT when combined. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but I think that in SMEFT, the operators are written as local operators with appropriate Lorentz and gauge indices, but they don't necessarily have to be CPT symmetric. Because the SM already has terms that can violate CP (like the CKM terms), but not CPT. So CPT is a bigger symmetry, so perhaps the operators don't have to each respect CPT individually, because the theory as a whole respects it through the structure of the operators. Hmm, this is getting a bit unclear.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So, for example, Lorentz symmetry is definitely required, because each operator is a scalar under Lorentz. Poincare symmetry is also required, because the operators are local. But for CPT, I'm not so sure. Because CPT is a combination of other symmetries, and in the SMEFT, perhaps the operators don't have to individually respect CPT as the theory as a whole does.

Wait, but the SMEFT is constructed to be a valid effective field theory, which requires Poincare symmetry and Lorentz symmetry. CPT is a separate symmetry. Does the SMEFT require CPT symmetry? Well, the Standard Model respects CPT, so SMEFT must as well. So the operators must be arranged such that their sum respects CPT.

But perhaps each individual operator doesn't have to be CPT symmetric. For example, an operator O and its CPT conjugate O' might both be present, with coefficients that could be different. But wait, no, because the effective theory must respect CPT, so the coefficients would have to be the same. Or perhaps that's not the case? I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the operators are constructed in such a way that they are CPT eigenstates, ensuring that the entire theory respects CPT symmetry. So each operator must respect CPT. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, another approach: think about what the SMEFT operators look like. They are built from the fields of the Standard Model, arranged into higher-dimensional operators. Each SM field has a definite CPT transformation. For example, the Higgs is a scalar (so under CPT, it's the same), the fermions are spin-1/2, so their CPT transformation would involve parity, charge conjugation, and time reversal.

But when you form an operator, like (H† H)^2, which is a dimension-4 operator, it's a scalar under Lorentz and CPT. Similarly, other operators are constructed to be CPT invariant.

Wait, but if an operator is not CPT invariant, that would imply a violation of CPT. But the theory as a whole must respect CPT, so any operator must be such that the entire Lagrangian respects CPT. So perhaps each operator must be a CPT eigenstate, but they don't have to be symmetric under CPT. Or maybe each operator can have any CPT properties, as long as when combined with the others, the overall theory is CPT invariant.

Wait, but in SMEFT, the operators are written in a way that they're classified by their quantum numbers, including their CPT properties. So for each operator, its form must be such that it's a scalar under CPT, or perhaps each operator is a CPT eigenstate. Otherwise, the theory could have CPT violation.

But wait, wait. The SMEFT is a high-energy theory, and when you write down the operators, you have to ensure that the theory is consistent, which includes respecting CPT. So the operators must be such that the overall Lagrangian is CPT invariant.

But the question is about whether each operator must respect CPT symmetry. Or whether the entire Lagrangian must, regardless of individual operators.

Hmm. Let's think of an example. Suppose I have an operator that violates CPT, like a term that changes parity but doesn't change charge or time. But that would imply a violation of CPT. So if such a term is present, the theory would not respect CPT. Therefore, each operator must be CPT-symmetric. Because if any operator isn't, the overall Lagrangian would violate CPT.

Wait, but that's not necessarily true. Because perhaps the coefficients of the operators are constrained. For example, if you have two operators that each individually don't respect CPT, but their coefficients are such that when combined, they cancel any CPT violation.

But that seems unlikely because CPT is a fundamental symmetry. So in the SMEFT, each operator must be a CPT eigenstate, and when combined, the Lagrangian (which is a sum of terms) must respect CPT.

Wait, perhaps each operator must be either a CPT eigenstate or combine in a way that overall CPT is preserved. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the SMEFT doesn't require the individual operators to respect CPT symmetry. It's possible to have operators that don't respect CPT, as long as their coefficients are constrained in a way that the overall theory is CPT-symmetric.

But I'm not certain about this. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me think of the symmetries one by one:

Lorentz symmetry: All operators must be Lorentz scalars. So 1 is a must.

Poincare symmetry: Since the theory is local, all operators must be local, so Poincare symmetry is respected. So 2 is a must.

CP symmetry: The SM doesn't respect CP (like in the CKM matrix), so operators can violate CP. So 3 isn't required.

CPT symmetry: The SM respects CPT, so SMEFT must as well. Therefore, the operators must be arranged such that their sum respects CPT. So perhaps each operator must individually respect CPT. Or maybe not. Hmm.

Wait, but CPT symmetry includes both C and T symmetries. So if an operator doesn't respect C or T, but the overall theory must, then perhaps the operators can be a mix as long as their sum is CPT-invariant.

Alternatively, perhaps the individual operators must transform in a way that their contributions to the theory are CPT invariant. So each operator must have a CPT transformation that is either symmetric or anti-symmetric, depending on the term, but the overall theory remains CPT-invariant.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think that the operators must form a basis that's CPT-invariant. So each operator is a CPT eigenstate. So for the operator to be written in the Lagrangian, it must be a scalar under CPT. Or perhaps the operators can have any CPT properties as long as the total Lagrangian is CPT-invariant.

But this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think of some sources. I recall that in SMEFT, the operators are organized into classes that are CPT self-conjugate. For example, an operator O would have a CPT conjugate O', and sometimes O and O' are the same, making them self-conjugate under CPT. So in that case, each operator would be CPT-invariant, but perhaps not necessarily.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure. Maybe the point is that the SMEFT operators must respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model. The Standard Model respects Lorentz and Poincare (since it's a Lorentz-invariant theory), but not CP (as in the case of CP violation). But the Standard Model does respect CPT.

Wait, but the question is about whether the operators must respect each symmetry. So, Poincare and Lorentz are definitely required because the theory is a Lorentz-invariant effective field theory. CPT is a bigger symmetry, which the theory must respect, but perhaps the individual operators don't have to respect it as long as the overall theory does.

But wait, in the case of CPT, if an operator isn't CPT-symmetric, then you might need another operator to compensate for it to maintain CPT symmetry. But that's probably not how it works. Because the SMEFT includes all possible operators, but their coefficients are constrained by the symmetries. So perhaps the operators are allowed to have any CPT properties, but the requirement is that the entire Lagrangian is CPT-invariant.

Wait, but the question isn't about the Lagrangian; it's about the operators. The question says which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if the operators don't individually respect CPT, the Lagrangian could have terms that break CPT unless their coefficients are zero or somehow constrained.

But I think that the SMEFT allows for operators that could break CPT only if the coefficients are zero, but the theory itself must respect CPT because it's a valid quantum field theory.

Wait, but I think that an effective field theory must respect all the symmetries of the underlying theory. Since the underlying theory (Standard Model plus whatever new physics) respects CPT, the effective theory must as well. So the operators can't introduce a CPT violation, so the operators must be arranged in a way that makes the entire theory CPT-invariant.

But does that mean that each operator must respect CPT symmetry on its own? Or can they be a mix as long as the sum is CPT-invariant?

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try another approach. I know that in SMEFT, the operators are classified by their Lorentz, gauge, and CPT properties. Each operator is a CPT eigenstate. So perhaps each operator must be a scalar under CPT, meaning that CPT symmetry is respected for each operator.

Wait, that doesn't sound right. For example, some operators might be CPT-odd, but then you would need their CPT conjugates to appear with the same coefficient to make the theory CPT-invariant.

So, for example, if an operator O is CPT-odd, then the term c * O would require another term c * O' to maintain CPT symmetry. But in SMEFT, operators are written as general terms without such constraints, unless the symmetry enforces it.

Alternatively, perhaps the SMEFT doesn't require each operator to be CPT-symmetric, but the entire Lagrangian must be.

But the question is about the operators, not the Lagrangian. So I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the options.

The options are:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

So, based on what I know, Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2) must be respected because the operators are part of a Lorentz-invariant effective theory.

CPT (4) must be respected because the theory must be CPT-invariant as an effective theory of a valid quantum theory. But whether each operator must respect CPT on its own isn't clear.

Wait, but I think that the operators themselves don't need to individually respect CPT symmetry, because the theory can have a combination of operators that together are CPT-invariant. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the SMEFT includes all possible operators, whether or not they respect CPT, but the coefficients are such that the overall theory is CPT-symmetric. So the operators don't have to respect CPT on their own, but the sum does.

In that case, the individual operators don't have to respect CPT. So option 4 (CPT) isn't a symmetry that each operator must respect. Therefore, the correct answer is 1 and 2 (option A).

Wait, but that can't be right because the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, which is option 1. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translations, so all operators must respect that as well.

But what about CPT? If the theory must respect CPT, but the individual operators don't have to, then option C (1,2,4) isn't correct. Hmm, but earlier reasoning suggested that the entire Lagrangian must respect CPT, but individual operators might not.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. If the operators don't have to respect CPT on their own, then 4 isn't a required symmetry for each operator.

So, the symmetries that all operators must respect are Lorentz and Poincare. So the answer would be option A) 1 and 2.

But wait, wait. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translation symmetry. So if an operator doesn't respect Poincare, the theory isn't a valid effective field theory. So operators must respect Poincare, which is option 2.

So the must-respected symmetries are 1 and 2, so the correct answer is option A (1 and 2), which is option A.

But wait, what about CPT? If the operators can have any CPT properties as long as the entire theory is CPT-invariant, then 4 isn't a must for each operator. So 4 isn't required.

So the correct answer would be 1 and 2, which is option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought that CPT is a must, but perhaps that's not the case for individual operators.

Wait, but another approach: in SMEFT, all the operators are Poincare scalars, so 1 and 2 are correct. And since the theory is Lorentz and Poincare invariant, it must be CPT-invariant, right? Because in Quantum Field Theory, any Poincare-invariant theory is also CPT-invariant.

Wait, no. Wait, CPT symmetry is a consequence of Poincare and hermiticity in QFT. So if a QFT is Poincare-invariant and unitary, then it must be CPT-invariant. So the operators don't need to respect CPT individually; the theory's Poincare invariance ensures that CPT is respected.

But wait, the question is about which symmetries the operators must respect. If the theory is automatically CPT-invariant because of Poincare and unitarity, maybe the operators themselves don't need to individually respect CPT.

Wait, but the question is about the symmetries that all operators must respect, not the theory as a whole. So if the operators don't individually have to respect CPT, then option 4 isn't a must. So the only musts are 1 and 2.

So the correct answer is option A) 1 and 2, which is option A.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a framework that organizes all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with the symmetries of the Standard Model. These operators must respect certain symmetries, but not all symmetries are required for every operator. Let us analyze the given options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, meaning all operators must transform as Lorentz scalars. This is a fundamental requirement for the theory to be consistent with special relativity. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected by all operators.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. Since SMEFT is a local effective field theory, all operators must respect Poincaré symmetry. This is necessary for the theory to be consistent as a local field theory.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry is not a requirement for SMEFT operators. The Standard Model already includes CP-violating terms (e.g., in the CKM matrix), and SMEFT allows operators that can violate CP. Therefore, CP symmetry does not need to be respected by all operators.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. While the SMEFT as a whole must respect CPT symmetry, individual operators do not need to respect CPT symmetry on their own. The overall theory ensures CPT invariance through the combination of operators and their coefficients, not necessarily through each operator individually.

Given this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are **Lorentz symmetry (1)** and **Poincaré symmetry (2)**. CPT symmetry (4) is automatically ensured by the structure of the theory and does not need to be enforced by individual operators. CP symmetry (3) is not required for SMEFT operators.

**Correct Answer: A) 1,2**
