Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, wait, but mass might not be directly relevant here. The question is about luminosity, right? So maybe mass isn't the main factor unless it relates to something else, like temperature or something.

The next part says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a star's emission is related to its temperature. I remember something about Wien's Law. Wien's displacement law states that the peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature T of the blackbody. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 equals T2.

Then, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Wait, but radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. So the observed wavelength is different from the intrinsic peak wavelength. But the problem mentions that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So maybe the observed wavelengths are the same, implying that the Doppler shift has been accounted for, or perhaps the question is considering their rest wavelengths. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think.

Wait, the problem says, "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So does that mean that the observed wavelengths (which might be Doppler shifted) are the same, or their intrinsic peak wavelengths? Because if the observed wavelengths are the same, that would imply that the Doppler effect is making their apparent temperatures the same. But I think the problem is considering the intrinsic emission, so maybe the peak wavelengths are the same, hence same temperature.

So moving on. The astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor of...? And the options are A to D, which are all around 2.2 to 2.35.

So I need to find the ratio of luminosities, L1/L2.

Luminosity of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So if both stars have the same temperature (since same peak wavelength), then L is proportional to R². So L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴) ). But since T1 = T2, this simplifies to (R1/R2) squared.

Given R1 is 1.5 times R2. So (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the luminosity ratio would be 2.25 times. So that would be option A. But wait, let me think again. Because the problem statement mentions something about radial velocities. Oh, right, so they have different velocities, so their observed temperatures might be different, but the peak wavelengths they emit at are the same.

Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me go back. The problem says, "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So perhaps the observed wavelengths (λ_observed) are the same, which would mean that the Doppler effect has shifted their emitted peak wavelengths to the same observed value.

So for each star, λ_observed = λ_emitted × sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) )? Or maybe the Doppler shift formula. Wait, the relativistic Doppler shift formula is λ_observed / λ_emitted = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), but that's for the transverse case. For radial velocity, v is along the line of sight. So the formula is λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, that's the non-relativistic approximation. For small velocities, v << c, this works.

But wait, for Star_2, v_r is 700 km/s. Let's see, the speed of light is about 3e5 km/s, so 700 is about 0.0023c. So non-relativistic approximation should be okay.

So for each star, the observed λ is λ0*(1 + v_r/c), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, how does that impact their temperatures? Because the peak wavelength emitted is λ_emitted, which is related to T via Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.898e-3 m·K).

So if both stars have the same observed λ_max, then:

λ_obs1 = λ_em1 * (1 + v1_r/c)
λ_obs2 = λ_em2 * (1 + v2_r/c)

But λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So λ_em1 * (1 + v1_r/c) = λ_em2 * (1 + v2_r/c)
But from Wien's law, λ_em is inversely proportional to T. Wait, but earlier I thought that T1 = T2 because λ_em1 = λ_em2. But no, that's not the case. Because the observed λ is same, but the emitted λ depends on their actual temperatures. So let's think again.

Let me rephrase: Let’s denote λ1 and λ2 as the emitted peak wavelengths of Star_1 and Star_2. Then, the observed wavelengths are λ1*(1 + v1/c) and λ2*(1 + v2/c).

And according to the problem, these observed wavelengths are the same, so:

λ1*(1 + v1/c) = λ2*(1 + v2/c)

But from Wien's law, λ1 = b / T1, λ2 = b / T2.

So substituting:

(b/T1) * (1 + v1/c) = (b/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

The b's cancel out:

(1 + v1/c)/T1 = (1 + v2/c)/T2

So, T2 = T1 * ( (1 + v2/c) / (1 + v1/c) )

But wait, the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same. So in the problem, Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so v1 = 0. Star_2 has v2 = 700 km/s.

So plugging in, v1 = 0, v2 =700 km/s.

So,

(1 + 0 ) / T1 = (1 + 700/(3e5) ) / T2

So,

1 / T1 = (1 + 700/(3e5) ) / T2

But 700/(3e5) is 700 / 300,000 = 0.002333...

So approximately 0.002333.

So,

1 / T1 = (1.002333) / T2

=> T2 = T1 * 1.002333

So T2 is slightly higher than T1.

Wait, that's interesting. So Star_2 is moving away from us, since its radial velocity is positive (assuming v_r is positive for moving away). So the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted) for Star_2. But since the observed wavelengths are the same, Star_1 must have a higher temperature because it's not moving. Or wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, if Star_2 is moving away, its emitted wavelength is λ2, and the observed would be λ2*(1 + v2/c). For Star_1, since it's not moving, observed λ is λ1. So for their observed wavelengths to be same:

λ1 = λ2*(1 + v2/c)

But λ1 is the emitted wavelength of Star_1, which is b/T1. Similarly, λ2 is b/T2.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

So,

1/T1 = (1 + v2/c)/T2

Which rearranges to T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

So T2 is greater than T1 by a factor of (1 + v2/c). Since v2 is positive (700 km/s), T2 is higher.

So now, the temperatures are not the same as I initially thought. Because I thought the peak wavelengths were same, but that's only considering the rest frame. Oh! Wait, I think I messed up earlier. Because the problem says the stars' apparent brightest wavelengths are the same. So that includes any Doppler shift.

So this changes things. So in reality, the emitted wavelengths are different, but because of their velocities, the observed wavelengths are same. So the actual emitted wavelengths (and hence temperatures) are different.

So now, the luminosity of each star is L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

But wait, the problem says that the stars are radiating as black bodies, so their luminosity is based on their radius and temperature. But the observed wavelength is a combination of their temperature and velocity.

So in this problem, the observed λ_peak is same for both.

But their actual T's are different. So I need to compute L1 and L2.

So first, find T1 and T2.

From earlier, we have:

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

But v2 is 700,000 m/s? Wait, no, 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s.

Wait, 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s. The speed of light is about 3e8 m/s. So 700,000 / 3e8 = 0.0023333..., which is roughly 0.233% of the speed of light.

So (1 + v2/c) ≈ 1 + 0.002333 = 1.002333.

So T2 ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

But wait, what determines the temperature of a star? If the stars are in some equilibrium (like main-sequence stars), their temperature relates to their mass and radius. But the problem gives the radius and mass ratios. Hmm, but wait the problem says that they’re radiating as black bodies, so perhaps their temperatures are determined by other factors, but in this case, their observed wavelengths are same because of Doppler shift.

Wait, but the problem says the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, which are the same. So that's the observed wavelength. So the emitted wavelengths are different, but due to their velocities, the observed λ_max is same.

So now, to compute L1 and L2.

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4

We need to find L1 / L2.

We know R1 = 1.5 R2.

And from earlier, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c) = T1 * (1 + (700,000 m/s)/(3e8 m/s) ) = T1 * 1.002333...

So, T2 = T1 * 1.002333.

So,

L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4 ) / ( R2² T2^4 )

Substituting R1 = 1.5 R2, and T2 = T1 * 1.002333,

= ( (1.5 R2 )² * T1^4 ) / ( R2² * (T1 * 1.002333 )^4 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= ( (2.25 R2²) * T1^4 ) / ( R2² * T1^4 * (1.002333)^4 )

The R2² and T1^4 terms cancel out:

= 2.25 / (1.002333)^4

Calculate denominator: (1.002333)^4.

Let's compute that.

First, let's compute ln(1.002333). Approximately, ln(1+x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x^3/3 - ... for small x.

x = 0.002333.

x ≈ 0.002333.

ln(1.002333) ≈ 0.002333 - (0.002333)^2 / 2 ≈ 0.002333 - (0.00000544) ≈ 0.00232756.

So ln(1.002333)^4 = 4 * 0.00232756 ≈ 0.00931024.

Then, exponentiate: e^0.00931024 ≈ 1 + 0.00931024 + (0.00931024)^2/2 + (0.00931024)^3/6.

Compute each term:

0.00931024 squared ≈ 0.00008667. Divided by 2: ~0.0000433.

0.00931024 cubed ≈ ~0.000000799. Divided by 6: ~0.000000133.

So e^0.00931 ≈ 1 + 0.00931 + 0.0000433 + 0.000000133 ≈ approx 1.009353.

So, (1.002333)^4 ≈ approx 1.009353.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.009353 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

2.25 divided by 1.009353:

First, 2.25 / 1 = 2.25.

But since the denominator is 1.009353, which is 1 + 0.009353, so it's a small increase.

So 1 / 1.009353 ≈ 0.9907 (since 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x for small x).

So 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.227.

So approximately 2.227, which is near option D, which is ~2.23.

Wait, but let me think again. Another approach: compute (1.002333)^4 more accurately.

Alternatively, compute (1.002333)^4:

= (1.002333)^2 squared.

(1.002333)^2 = 1 + 2*0.002333 + (0.002333)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.004666 + 0.00000544 ≈ 1.00467144.

Now, (1.00467144)^2 = ?

Let me compute it:

= 1 + 2*0.00467144 + (0.00467144)^2

= 1 + 0.00934288 + 0.00002182.

Adding up: 1.0093647.

So (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.0093647.

So denominator is 1.0093647.

So 2.25 / 1.0093647 = ?

Calculating 2.25 ÷ 1.0093647.

Let me compute 1.0093647 × 2.227 ≈ 2.249. Wait, maybe it's easier to compute 2.25 / 1.0093647.

Alternatively, compute 1.0093647 × 2.23:

1.0093647 *2=2.0187294

1.0093647 *0.23 = approx 0.232153.

So 2.0187294 + 0.232153 = 2.25088. So 2.23 * 1.0093647 ≈ 2.25088, which is very close to 2.25. So 2.23 is approximately 2.25 / 1.0093647.

So 2.25 / 1.0093647 ≈ 2.23.

So the ratio L1/L2 is about 2.23.

Looking back at the options, option D is ~2.23.

So the correct answer should be D.


To determine the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 and Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for blackbody radiation:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \(R\) is the radius, \(T\) is the temperature, and \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The luminosity is proportional to \(R^2 T^4\). 

### Step 1: Relating the temperatures
The problem states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Using Wien's law, the emitted peak wavelength \(\lambda_{\text{em}}\) is inversely proportional to the temperature \(T\), and the observed wavelength \(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\) is related to the emitted wavelength by the Doppler effect:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{em}} \cdot (1 + v_r/c)
\]

For both stars, the observed wavelengths are the same (\(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\)), so:

\[
\lambda_{\text{em,1}} \cdot (1 + v_1/c) = \lambda_{\text{em,2}} \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
\]

Substituting \(\lambda_{\text{em}} = b/T\) (from Wien's law, where \(b\) is Wien's displacement constant):

\[
\frac{b}{T_1} \cdot (1 + v_1/c) = \frac{b}{T_2} \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
\]

Canceling \(b\) and rearranging:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 + v_1/c}
\]

Given \(v_1 = 0\) (Star_1 has no radial velocity) and \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\), we calculate:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = 1 + \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 1.002333
\]

Thus:

\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.002333
\]

### Step 2: Calculating the luminosity ratio
The luminosity ratio is:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

Substituting \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\) and \(T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.002333\):

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(1.5 R_2)^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 (T_1 \cdot 1.002333)^4}
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{2.25 T_1^4}{T_1^4 (1.002333)^4}
\]

Cancel \(T_1^4\):

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{2.25}{(1.002333)^4}
\]

### Step 3: Approximating \((1.002333)^4\)
Using the approximation \((1 + x)^n \approx 1 + nx\) for small \(x\), where \(x = 0.002333\) and \(n = 4\):

\[
(1.002333)^4 \approx 1 + 4 \cdot 0.002333 = 1.009332
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{2.25}{1.009332} \approx 2.23
\]

### Final Answer:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times that of Star_2.
