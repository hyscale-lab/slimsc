Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Hmm, I remember that |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, the spin-z operator has eigenvalues +ħ/2 for |up> and -ħ/2 for |down>.

But wait, the question is about measuring the eigenstates of another operator. The operator has a matrix representation where the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. Oh, right! That sounds familiar. Oh wait, that's the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2. Because the Pauli matrices usually have 1s and 0s, but here it's scaled. So the operator A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when I multiply it by ħ/2, the operator A becomes [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. So the eigenstates of A would correspond to the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix, which are the spin eigenstates in the x-direction. So, the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, right?

But the problem is about finding the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of this operator A. So, first, I think I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A.

But wait, another approach: perhaps it's easier to diagonalize the operator A. The eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

Wait, the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) for |+x> and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) for |-x>. So if I can express |alpha> in terms of these, then the coefficients squared will give the probabilities.

But wait, our operator A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So the eigenvalues of A would be (ħ/2) times the eigenvalues of Pauli X. Since Pauli X has eigenvalues +1 and -1, the eigenvalues of A are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

So to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>, and then square the magnitudes of the coefficients.

But first, let's normalize |alpha>. The state is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So I should find the normalization factor.

The normalization factor N is such that |N|^2 [ |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2 ] = 1.

Calculating |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

|2 -i|^2: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5.

So the sum is 2+5=7. So |N|^2 *7 =1 → N=1/sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ].

Now, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>. Let's write |+x> and |-x> in terms of |up> and |down>.

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>.

Let’s express |alpha> as c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>.

So,

(1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] = c_+ (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + c_- (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Let’s collect the terms for |up> and |down>.

For |up>:
(1+i)/sqrt(7) = [ c_+ + c_− ] / sqrt(2)

For |down>:
(2 -i)/sqrt(7) = [ c_+ - c_− ] / sqrt(2)

So now I have two equations:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) = (c_+ + c_-)/sqrt(2) → equation 1

(2 - i)/sqrt(7) = (c_+ - c_-)/sqrt(2) → equation 2

Let me solve these equations for c_+ and c_-.

Let me denote equation 1 as (a) and equation 2 as (b).

Adding (a) and (b): 

(1+i + 2 - i) / sqrt(7) = [2 c_+ ] / sqrt(2)

Simplify numerator: 3.

So 3 / sqrt(7) = (2 c_+ ) / sqrt(2)

Multiply both sides by sqrt(2)/2:

c_+ = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) ) = 3/(sqrt(14))

Similarly, subtracting (b) from (a):

(1+i - (2 -i)) / sqrt(7) = [2 c_- ] / sqrt(2)

Compute numerator: 1 +i -2 +i → (-1 + 2i)

So (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(7) = (2 c_-)/sqrt(2)

Multiply both sides by sqrt(2)/2:

c_- = (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7)) ) = (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14)

So c_+ is 3/sqrt(14), and c_- is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Wait, wait, let me compute:

Wait, sqrt(2) over 2 is 1/sqrt(2). So when I multiply (3/sqrt(7)) by sqrt(2)/2, it's 3/(sqrt(14))).

Similarly, for c_-:

The equation after subtraction is [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) = [ (c_+ - c_-) ] / sqrt(2) ?

Wait, no, equation (a) is (1+i)/sqrt(7) = (c_+ + c_-)/sqrt(2)

Equation (b) is (2 -i)/sqrt(7) = (c_+ - c_-)/sqrt(2)

So when I subtract (b) from (a):

[(1+i) - (2 -i)] / sqrt(7) = [ (c_+ + c_-) - (c_+ - c_-) ] / sqrt(2 )

Which simplifies to:

(1+i -2 +i) / sqrt(7) = [ 2 c_- ] / sqrt(2)

So numerator: ( -1 + 2i ) → so (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(7) = (2 c_-)/sqrt(2)

So solving for c_-:

c_- = [ (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7)) )

Which simplifies to [ (-1 + 2i) ] / sqrt(14)

Wait, let me verify.

sqrt(2) divided by (2 sqrt(7)) is 1/(sqrt(14)), because 2 sqrt(7) is denominator, so sqrt(2)/2 = 1/sqrt(2), and then 1/sqrt(2) * 1/sqrt(7) = 1/sqrt(14). So yes, c_- = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)

So now, the coefficients are c_+ = 3/sqrt(14), c_- = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)

Wait, but wait a second, the mod squared of these coefficients will give the probabilities.

The probability of measuring +ħ/2 (eigenstate |+x>) is |c_+|^2, and the probability of measuring -ħ/2 (eigenstate |-x>) is |c_-|^2.

So let's compute |c_+|^2: (3)^2 / (sqrt(14))^2 → 9/14.

Similarly, |c_-|^2 is | (-1 + 2i) | squared divided by 14.

Compute | -1 + 2i |^2: (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5. So 5/14.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.6429 and 5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 → which is close to 9/14 (≈0.6429) and 5/14 (≈0.357). So 0.64 and 0.36 would be approximations. So option A's probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36.

But wait, let's check the average value of A. The average value is given by <alpha| A |alpha>.

Wait, another approach: since A has eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, the expectation value is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

So expectation value = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) ) 

= [ (9 -5) * ħ/2 ] /14 

= (4 * ħ/2)/14 

= (2 ħ) /14 

= ħ /7.

So the expectation value is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options, option A has average value hbar/7. So the options are:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7 → which matches.

But wait, let me double-check the probabilities. 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, which rounds to 0.64. 5/14 is approx 0.357, which rounds to 0.36. So option A is correct for probabilities and expectation value.

But wait, looking at the other options, let me see if any other options have 9/14 and 5/14.

Looking at the given options, option A is the first choice, and it's the only one with hbar/7 as the average. So I think option A is the correct answer.

Wait, but let me think again. Could I have made a mistake in the coefficients?

Hmm, wait, the operator A is given by A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, else 0. So A is a 2x2 matrix:

[[0, ħ/2],
 [ħ/2, 0]]

Which is indeed ħ/2 times the Pauli X matrix.

So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, correct.

Another approach: The expectation value can also be calculated using the original state and the matrix of operator A.

The state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> multiplied by 1/sqrt(7).

So in vector form, |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

The operator A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

The expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

So compute (1/sqrt(7)) (1+i)*0 + (2 -i)*(ħ/2) * (1+i) * (2 -i) * (1/sqrt(7)) ?

Wait, wait, perhaps it's better to compute it as the conjugate transpose times A times the vector.

|alpha> is [a; b] where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b=(2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So <A> = (1/sqrt(7)) (1 - i, 2 +i ) times A times [ (1+i)/sqrt(7); (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Let me compute this.

First, multiply [1 -i
