--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using its spectroscopic data. The options are four different chemical formulas, and I need to pick the right one based on the given data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry.

Alright, first I'll go through each piece of data one by one and see what they tell me.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H groups because of the hydrogen bonding. So that suggests there's an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid or something with an -OH group. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is usually even broader and around 2500-3300, maybe even a bit lower. But the peak here is at 3000, which makes me think it's an alcohol's O-H group.

Then, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Let me think about what those could be. 1700 is a region I associate with carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, or maybe esters. The 1650 peak is a bit lower. Could that be another carbonyl, maybe an amide? Or maybe it's conjugated, like in a conjugated carbonyl group. Wait, another thought: maybe it's an aromatic ring with conjugation, like an aromatic ketone or an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Alternatively, 1650 could be a C=O stretch in an ester or maybe a conjugated carbonyl like in a conjugated ester or something that's maybe an acid. Hmm, but wait, I also remember that the C=O in carboxylic acids is around 1700. So if there's a peak at 1700 and another at 1650, maybe there are two different carbonyl groups?

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Another possibility: maybe the 1650 is not a carbonyl. Could it be an aromatic ring's C=C stretching? Because aromatic C=C stretches typically appear around 1450-1600 cm^-1. So 1650 is a bit high for that, but possible. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide, but I'm not so sure. I'll come back to that after looking at the other data.

Next, the 1H NMR shows several peaks, including ones for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests there's a double bond somewhere in the molecule. That could be part of an alkene or maybe an aromatic ring, but in an aromatic ring, the hydrogens are usually in a multiplet and perhaps more downfield. But since the NMR shows peaks for them, it's definitely an alkene or aromatic.

Then, the mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, I need to think about what that could represent. 45 is a common fragment. Let me think about possible fragments. For example, the CH3CO+ ion is at m/z 45 (molecular weight of 45). Wait, CH3CO+ would be (12+1)+(12+16+1) = no, wait, let me calculate. CH3CO+ would be the fragment C2H3O2+? No, wait, CH3CO+ is (CH3)2CO? No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketene ion or something else.

Wait, the molecular ion at m/z 45 could correspond to something like (CH3)2CO, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl ester group. Let me think about the possible formulas.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2

B) C6H10O

C) C6H10O2

D) C6H12O

So each has varying degrees of unsaturation and oxygen. The formula tells us about the structure.

Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation for each option:

Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens (X) or nitrogen (N), so (2C +2 - H)/2.

Option A: C6H12O2
DoU = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 2/2=1. So one ring or double bond.

Option B: C6H10O
DoU = (14 -10)/2=4/2=2. So two rings, or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2
DoU = (14 -10)/2=2. So two rings or double bonds.

Option D: C6H12O
DoU= (14-12)/2=2/2=1.

Wait, but in the NMR, we have vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond. So each option has DoU of either 1 or 2.

Wait, let's do the DoU again more carefully.

For each formula:

A) C6H12O2: DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1.

B) C6H10O: (14-10)/2=2.

C) C6H10O2: (14-10)/2=2.

D) C6H12O: (14-12)/2=1.

So options B and C have two DoU each. That could mean either two double bonds, or one double bond and a ring, or two rings.

But in the data, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which suggests at least one double bond. So that's in line with all options except perhaps A and D, which have one DoU each. Wait, but A and D have one DoU, which could be a double bond or a ring. But the NMR shows vinyl H, so they must have a double bond. So, for options A and D, their DoU is 1, which could be a ring plus a double bond? Wait no, because 1 DoU is either a ring or a double bond. So if a molecule has a double bond, that's DoU 1, so that would fit options A and D, which have one DoU each.

But wait, the NMR shows vinyl H, which suggests a double bond. So if the compound has a double bond, then any option can have that as long as their DoU includes a double bond.

Wait, but let's think again. If a compound has a ring and a double bond, that would require two DoU. But for example, if option A is C6H12O2 with DoU 1, that suggests either a ring or a double bond, but not both. So if it has a double bond, that would account for one DoU, and no rings.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Each DoU is a ring or a double bond. So a benzene ring (which is three double bonds) counts as three DoU. But in the options, the highest DoU is two, so that could be a benzene ring plus something else, but that would be three DoU. So perhaps the compound isn't a benzene ring.

Wait, but our options have up to two DoU. So maybe it's a cyclopropane (ring) plus a double bond, but that would be two DoU. Or a single double bond and a single ring, but that would be two DoU.

But the presence of vinyl H suggests a double bond (so at least one DoU). So for options with one DoU (A and D), that would be a single double bond or a single ring. But for B and C, which have two DoU, they could have two double bonds, or a ring and a double bond, or two rings.

Now, looking back at the IR data. The two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. If there are two carbonyl groups, that would explain both peaks. So two carbonyl groups would require two DoU each (but wait, each carbonyl is a double bond, so each contributes one DoU). Wait, no, a carbonyl is a double bond, so each carbonyl contributes one DoU. So two carbonyls would contribute two DoU. So that would require the formula to have two DoU.

Looking at the options, only options B and C have two DoU. So that suggests that the compound has two carbonyl groups. So that could mean either two ketones, two esters, a ketone and an ester, or perhaps an acid and an ester, or something else.

Wait, but let's think about a structure that has two carbonyl groups. For example, a compound like an ester with a ketone group? Or maybe a diester? Or perhaps a cyclic ester, but that's less likely.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a cyclic ketone with an ester group or something else.

Alternatively, could the two carbonyl groups be part of an aromatic ring, like in a conjugated system?

Wait, but let's also consider the mass spectrometry data. The fragment at m/z 45. I'm trying to think what structures would break down to give that. Let's see, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CO (which is 58? Wait, no: (CH3)2CO is acetone, which is (2*12) + (6*1) +16=24+6+16=46. Hmm, close but not 45. Alternatively, what about CH3COO- (the acetate ion)? That would be 45 (CH3COO- has a molecular weight of 45: 12*2 +1*3 +16*2=24+3+32=59? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, wait: wait, the acetate ion is CH3COO-: carbon is 12 each, so 2 carbons in acetate. So 12*2=24. Hydrogens: 3 (CH3) + 2 (COO-) but wait, no, the acetate is CH3COO-, which is two carbons, three hydrogens in CH3, two in the COO- (but as a group?), but perhaps the molecular weight is 2*(12) + 3*(1) + 2*(16) =24+3+32=59. Hmm, no, that's 59, but the fragment is at 45. So that's not matching.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a CH2O group. Wait, molecular weight of CH2O is 30 (12+2+16=30). No, that's too low. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH3CHO (acetaldehyde) fragment? The molecular weight of acetaldehyde is 44 (12*2 + 4*1 +16=24+4+16=44). Hmm, that's close. But the fragment is at 45, which is one higher. Maybe it's a CH3CO+ ion, which would be 43 (12*2 + 3*1 +16=24+3+16=43). No, that's 43. Hmm.

Wait another idea: Maybe the fragment is a methyl group attached to something else. For example, if the molecule breaks apart to form a (CH3)COO- group, which would have a molecular weight of 59, but that's not 45. Alternatively, perhaps it's a smaller fragment, like the loss of a larger group leaving a smaller one.

Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of formaldehyde (HCHO) is 30, so that's not it. Wait, 45 is also the molecular weight of acrolein, which is H2C=CHCHO. Wait, no, H2C=CHCHO would be more than that. Alternatively, maybe it's the mass of a fragment like (CH3)2CHO+ or something else.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula of the unknown must be one of the options, and the fragment m/z 45 suggests that part of the molecule has a molecular weight of 45. Looking at each option's possible structures.

Option A: C6H12O2.

Possible structures could be an ester, perhaps. For example, methyl cyclopentanoate or something. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe a cyclic ester (lactone), but that's just a guess.

Option B: C6H10O. That's a lower hydrogen count, so perhaps a diene or something. But I'm not sure about the structure.

Option C: C6H10O2. So two oxygen atoms. Could be an ester with another oxygen, perhaps a ketone. Or maybe two ester groups.

Option D: C6H12O. That's a lower oxygen count. Maybe a cyclic ether with a double bond, but not sure.

Wait, considering the IR data again. There's a broad peak at 3000, which I think is an O-H group, so the compound has an -OH group. So looking at the options, which have O or O2.

Options A and C have two O's. So maybe one O is the O-H, and the other is part of a carbonyl group.

Wait, so if the compound has an -OH group and two carbonyl groups, that would fit the IR data. So two carbonyl peaks at 1700 and 1650. So the presence of two carbonyls suggests that the formula must have two oxygen atoms, because each carbonyl is an O.

So looking at the options, only options A and C have two O's.

Wait, options A: C6H12O2. So two O's.

Option C: C6H10O2. Also two O's.

So that suggests that the compound has two O's, which could be in an -OH and two carbonyls. Wait, but wait. If the compound has an -OH group, that's one O, and two carbonyls (each O), that would require three O's. But the options only have two O's. So that can't be right. Hmm. So maybe one of the O's is in the -OH, and the other is part of a carbonyl group. But then that would only account for one carbonyl group. But we have two peaks in IR, so that suggests two carbonyls. So that would require three O's. But the options don't have any with three O's. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the IR data.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the peaks is not a carbonyl. The 1650 cm^-1 peak could be from an aromatic ring's C=C stretch. So maybe it's not a carbonyl. Let's think about that.

If the 1700 is a carbonyl, and 1650 is an aromatic C=C, then that would fit a structure with a ketone and an aromatic ring. But wait, the 1650 is a bit high for a typical aromatic ring, which is usually around 1450-1600. So 1650 might suggest some conjugation, perhaps a conjugated carbonyl or something else.

Wait, another thought: maybe the 1650 peak is from an amide. But in that case, the NMR wouldn't have shown vinyl hydrogens unless the amide is part of a ring. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl group, like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. So the carbonyl would be at 1700, and the conjugated double bond at 1650.

Wait, but in that case, the structure might have a conjugated system, so perhaps with a double bond next to the carbonyl. That would account for the vinyl H in the NMR.

So putting this together: the compound has an -OH group (from the broad IR peak), a carbonyl (1700), and a conjugated double bond (1650). So the structure could be something like a hydroxy ketone with a conjugated double bond, or perhaps an ester with a conjugated double bond.

Now, considering the mass spectrum with a peak at 45. Let's think about possible fragments. 45 could be (CH3)2CO+ (which is acetone, but wait, acetone is (CH3)2CO, molecular weight 58? No, wait: 12*3=36 (three carbons: two CH3 and one CO), 6 hydrogens (each CH3 has 3 H, but wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is CH3CO-O- something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about possible structures for each option and see which fits the data.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures: ester, such as methyl cyclopentanoate. But does that fit the IR and NMR?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diol ester, but I'm not certain. Another possibility: a cyclic ester (lactone), but that might not have an -OH group. Alternatively, a molecule with an -OH and a carbonyl group.

Wait, but earlier I thought the IR suggests two carbonyl groups, but that would require three O's, which the options don't have. So perhaps I'm making a mistake there.

Wait, perhaps the 1650 peak is not a carbonyl. Let me think again. Could it be an aromatic ring? If the compound has an aromatic ring, that would explain the C=C peak at around 1650. But then, why are there vinyl hydrogens in the NMR? Because an aromatic ring's hydrogens are typically more downfield and more complex. But if the ring is conjugated with a carbonyl, maybe the peaks are simpler.

Wait, if the compound is an aromatic aldehyde, maybe with an -OH group, but that might not fit all the data. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ketone with an -OH group.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a substituted cyclohexenone. For example, cyclohexenone has a conjugated double bond and a carbonyl group. If it has an -OH group, that might fit the IR and the NMR data.

Let me try to imagine the structure. Suppose it's something like 4-hydroxycyclohexenone. Then, the FTIR would show an -OH (broad peak), the carbonyl (around 1700), and the conjugated double bond's C=C (around 1650). The NMR would show vinyl H (maybe as a triplet or something), and the mass spectrum could have a fragment at 45.

But wait, what would the molecular formula be for such a compound? Let's see: cyclohexenone is C6H10O. If it has an additional -OH, that would add an O and a H. So the formula would be C6H11O2. But that's not one of the options. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diethyl acetyl something. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle: the presence of two carbonyl peaks suggests two different carbonyl groups, but perhaps they're part of the same structure, like an ester and a ketone. Let's think about that.

Suppose the structure is an ester, where the carbonyl is at 1700, and the conjugated double bond (maybe in the ester group) gives another peak at 1650. But then, where would the -OH come from? Because the FTIR shows an -OH group.

Wait, but if the ester is part of a conjugated system, perhaps it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. For example, methyl acrylate would have a conjugated system, so the carbonyl would be at around 1700, and the conjugated double bond at 1650. Then, if there's an -OH group somewhere else, perhaps as a substituent, that would account for the broad peak at 3000.

But the molecular formula would then be something else. Let's see: for methyl acrylate, the formula is C4H6O2. But our options are all C6H... So perhaps it's a larger molecule, like a substituted acrylate.

Wait, but perhaps the compound is something like methyl vinyl ketone, but that's C4H6O. But the options are C6, so perhaps it's a cyclohexenone ester or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a substituted cyclohexene with an ester group and an -OH. Not sure.

Another thought: Maybe the compound is a diol with a conjugated carbonyl group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again and try to match each with the data.

Option A: C6H12O2.

Molecular weight is 6*12 +12 +32 =72+12+32=116.

DoU is 1. So either a ring or a double bond.

Option B: C6H10O.

DoU=2. Could be two double bonds or a ring and a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2.

DoU=2. So two rings, two double bonds, or one ring and one double bond.

Option D: C6H12O.

DoU=1.

Now, the IR data suggests an -OH (so O is present), and two carbonyls (so two O's in carbonyls and perhaps another in -OH, but that would require three O's, which is not possible in options A or C, which have two O's.

Wait, wait. Maybe the two carbonyl peaks are from the same group but in different environments. For example, an ester has two carbonyls, but that's not the case. Wait, no, an ester has one carbonyl group. So perhaps it's an acid with an ester group. No, that would require more O's.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the carbonyls is an amide, but that seems less likely without an N in the formula.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think more about the possible structure of the compound.

The presence of two carbonyl peaks suggests two different carbonyl groups. So perhaps it's a structure with two carbonyls, such as a diketone or a keto-ester.

For example, a molecule with both a ketone and an ester group. Let's imagine a structure like ethyl acetoacetate. Its formula is C5H8O3, which is not one of the options, so that's not it.

Another option: perhaps it's a diethyl fumarate or something similar, but again, the molecular formula wouldn't match.

Wait, another approach: the presence of two carbonyl peaks suggests that the compound has two different types of carbonyl groups. For instance, a ketone and an ester.

So if the structure is an ester with a ketone substituent, that could fit. Let's think about the formula. For example, if the main chain is a cyclic ester (like a lactone) and there's a ketone substituent, but that might require more oxygens.

Alternatively, maybe it's a molecule with a conjugated dienone system.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like cyclopentanone with a substituent that has another carbonyl group. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard.

But focusing back on the options, which have C6H... Let me think about each option.

Option C: C6H10O2.

DoU=2.

So possibilities: two double bonds, or a double bond and a ring.

If there's a double bond and a ring, that would account for two DoU. Also, if there are two carbonyl groups, that would require two DoU from the carbonyls, but that's not possible since each DoU accounts for a ring or a double bond. Wait, each carbonyl is a double bond, so two carbonyls would contribute two DoU. So the formula would have to account for that.

So for option C: C6H10O2.

Molecular formula: 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, 2 oxygens.

So number of degrees of unsaturation:

DoU = (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2.

Which matches the two carbonyls (each being a DoU), plus perhaps an -OH group. Wait, no, the -OH doesn't contribute to DoU.

Wait, but having two carbonyls (two DoU) plus an -OH would require the formula to have two O's. So perhaps the structure is something like a diester with an -OH group? Or maybe a ketone and an ester.

Alternatively, maybe it's a structure where one carbonyl is part of an ester group and another is a ketone.

But then, the molecular formula would be C6H10O2.

Let me think about possible structures:

For example, methyl cyclohex-1-enecarboxylate. Wait, that might have a structure with an ester group (O) and a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's something like cyclohexenone with an ester substituent. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe it's a molecule like methyl acrylate substituted with a hydroxyl group on the ring. But again, not sure.

In any case, the mass spectrum shows a peak at m/z 45. So perhaps the fragment is a 45 mass, which could be a small group like (CH3)2CO+ (which is 58? No, that's not 45. Wait, another thought: the fragment could be a (CH2O) group, which is formaldehyde (30), but that's too low. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH3COOH (acetic acid) fragment, but that's 60. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is from the cleavage of the ester group. For example, in an ester like R-O-CO-R', the cleavage could produce a fragment with the R-O- group and the CO-R' part. But I'm not exactly sure how that would lead to a 45 mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the 45 fragment is from a ketene ion, which typically forms at m/z 45. Wait, the ketene ion is CH2=C=O, which has a molecular weight of 45 (12+2+16=30; no, wait, CH2=C=O is actually 12*2 + 2*1 + 16= 24+2+16=42. Hmm, not matching. Maybe it's another ion.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula of the unknown is C6H10O2 (option C), so the molecular weight is 6*12 +10*1 +2*16=72 +10 +32=114. So the molecular ion would be at m/z 114.

In the mass spectrum, the fragment at 45 could be a part of the molecule, perhaps an acylium ion or some other fragment. But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, considering the options, only options C and B have two DoU. Since the IR data suggests two carbonyl groups, which contribute two DoU, the formula must be either B or C.

Option B: C6H10O.

That would have one O, so can't have two carbonyl groups (each O is needed for a carbonyl). So option B is probably out.

So the correct option is likely C: C6H10O2.

Let me think again. FTIR shows O-H (so one O), and two carbonyls (two O's), but that would require three O's, which is impossible. So perhaps one of the carbonyls is an ester, which has one O, and the other is a ketone, which has another O. So two O's in total, fitting the formula C6H10O2.

So the structure could be a ketone and an ester group. For example, a molecule with a ketone and an ester substituent.

In that case, the NMR would show the vinyl H from the conjugated system (like if the ester is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester).

The mass fragment at 45 would then come from a part of the molecule. Maybe the ester group breaks off, leaving a fragment that weighs 45.

Putting it all together, the most likely option is C: C6H10O2.


The unknown compound is characterized using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry. The analysis of the data is as follows:

1. **FTIR Spectrum**:  
   - A broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an -OH group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.  
   - Two strong absorption peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of two carbonyl groups. The 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is typical for a carbonyl group (C=O), while the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak could correspond to a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic C=C stretch.

2. **¹H NMR Spectrum**:  
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens indicate the presence of a double bond, likely in an alkene or conjugated system.

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:  
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45 suggests the presence of a small fragment, possibly related to a carbonyl-containing group.

### Analysis of the Options:
The molecular formulas provided are:  
- **A) C₆H₁₂O₂**  
- **B) C₆H₁₀O**  
- **C) C₆H₁₀O₂**  
- **D) C₆H₁₂O**

#### Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):  
The DoU is calculated as:  
\[
\text{DoU} = \frac{(2C + 2 - H)}{2}
\]

- **A) C₆H₁₂O₂**:  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 6 + 2 - 12)}{2} = \frac{14 - 12}{2} = 1
  \]  
  This formula accounts for one ring or double bond. However, the IR data suggests two carbonyl groups, requiring two DoU, making this option unlikely.

- **B) C₆H₁₀O**:  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 6 + 2 - 10)}{2} = \frac{14 - 10}{2} = 2
  \]  
  This formula accounts for two rings, two double bonds, or one ring and one double bond. However, the presence of two carbonyl groups (requiring two oxygen atoms) is inconsistent with this formula, which has only one oxygen atom.

- **C) C₆H₁₀O₂**:  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 6 + 2 - 10)}{2} = \frac{14 - 10}{2} = 2
  \]  
  This formula accounts for two rings, two double bonds, or one ring and one double bond. The two oxygen atoms fit the IR data, as one oxygen could be part of an -OH group and the other part of a carbonyl group. The presence of two carbonyl groups aligns with the two DoU, and the vinyl hydrogens in the NMR are consistent with a conjugated system.

- **D) C₆H₁₂O**:  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 6 + 2 - 12)}{2} = \frac{14 - 12}{2} = 1
  \]  
  This formula accounts for one ring or double bond. However, similar to option A, the IR data suggests two carbonyl groups, requiring two DoU, making this option unlikely.

### Conclusion:
The IR data indicates the presence of two carbonyl groups, which require two oxygen atoms and two DoU. The molecular formula **C₆H₁₀O₂** (option C) satisfies these conditions, as it has two oxygen atoms and two DoU. The broad IR peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ corresponds to an -OH group, and the peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ correspond to two carbonyl groups, likely in a conjugated system. The ¹H NMR data supports the presence of vinyl hydrogens, consistent with a conjugated system. The fragment peak at m/z = 45 in the mass spectrum further supports this assignment. 

Answer: C
