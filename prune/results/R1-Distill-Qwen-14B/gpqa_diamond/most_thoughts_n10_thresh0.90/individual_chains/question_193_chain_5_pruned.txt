Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what it's asking. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the formula is N ∝ 1/plx^5. I need to figure out how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my parallax and distance relationships. Let me think. Parallax is related to distance, right? The parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that distance (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by the parallax (in arcseconds). So, distance r = 1/plx. Oh wait, that's right. So plx is inversely proportional to distance. So if plx increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So I need to relate N to r, not plx. Since the question gives N ∝ 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/r, I can substitute that in.

Let me write that down: plx = 1/r. So 1/plx is r. So substituting into the original equation, N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me calculate that exponent. (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1 divided by that is r^5. So N ∝ r^5. Oh wait, that would mean the number of stars increases with the fifth power of the distance?

Wait, but wait another thought. When considering how many stars are there per unit volume or per some range, maybe I need to think about how the number changes when you move a small distance dr. Oh, right, the question is about how the number of stars changes per unit distance. So maybe I should consider the number density or something.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think in terms of differential quantities. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance r would be proportional to the surface area of that shell (4πr²) multiplied by the number per unit area. But how is that number per unit area related to parallax?

Alternatively, let's approach it step by step. The question says that the number of stars N varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k * (1/plx^5), where k is a constant. But since plx is 1/r, then N = k * (1/( (1/r)^5 )) = k * r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So as the distance increases, the number of stars increases as r^5.

Wait, but wait, that seems counterintuitive. Because as we go further out, the stars should become less dense, right? Oh wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around. Wait, in reality, the number of stars you can see decreases with distance because they are farther away. But in this question, the number is varying with 1/plx^5, which translates to r^5. So the number of stars increases with r^5? That
