Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about a star covered in dark spots and how that affects its brightness compared to an exoplanet. The goal is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star.

First, let me read the problem again carefully. So, the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots that have a 20% filling factor. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler—so they're at 5000K. Because the star is rotating, when the spots come into view, the observed brightness changes, which mimics what an exoplanet transit would do. The question is, what size exoplanet would cause the same change in brightness (amplitude) as this spotted star.

Wait, the problem says that to produce the same amplitude in the light curve, what's the planet radius relative to the star. Without the spots, so the star's brightness variation comes from the planet blocking part of the star.

I remember that the change in brightness when a planet transits a star is given by the formula (Rp / Rstar)^2. So the depth of the dip is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet radius to the star's radius.

But in this case, the star has spots, so the observed brightness variation isn't just from the planet's transit. Instead, the spots modulate the star's brightness as the star rotates. So when a spot is facing us, it's cooler, so the star appears a bit dimmer. As the star rotates, different spots come into view, but since it's only one hemisphere, I'm not entirely sure how that plays into the brightness variation.

Wait, the problem says that the situation with the spots can closely resemble an exoplanet. So the brightness variation from the spots is similar to what an exoplanet would cause. So the task is to find the planet radius such that the dip caused by the planet equals the dip caused by the star's spots.

So, I need to calculate the change in brightness caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same change.

Let me think about the star's brightness variation due to spots. The star is emitting light from its surface, but parts are cooler (spots) and others are hotter (unspotted areas). Wait, no, wait. The star's Teff is 6000K, but the spots are 5000K. So the spots are darker.

The brightness variation comes from the spots rotating into and out of view. Since it's a hemisphere, perhaps the spots cover 50% of the visible area at some point, but wait, the filling factor is 20%. Oh, right, the filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So the spots make up 20% of the star's surface.

Wait, but the spots are on one hemisphere. So when that hemisphere is facing us, the total area of spots visible is 20% of the star's surface. Wait, no—if the entire hemisphere is covered, but only 20% of the hemisphere is spots. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. The filling factor is 20%—that is, 20% of the entire star's surface is covered by spots. So the spots cover 0.20 × (4π R²) = 0.8 π R² (since a hemisphere is 2π R²). Wait, no, wait. The star's total surface area is 4π R². So 20% of that is 0.2 ×4π R²=0.8π R². But the problem says that one hemisphere is covered. So each hemisphere is 2π R². If 20% of the entire surface is covered, but the spots are all in one hemisphere, then the fraction in that hemisphere is 0.2 / 2 = 0.1, or 10% of each hemisphere? Or wait, I think I'm getting it wrong.

Let me think again. The filling factor is 20%—so 20% of the entire star's surface is covered by spots. So if the star is a sphere, and the spots are all on one hemisphere, then those spots cover 0.2 ×4π R² = 0.8π R². But the area of a hemisphere is 2π R². So the fraction in the hemisphere is 0.8π / 2π = 0.4, so 40% of that hemisphere is covered in spots. Wait, no, because the total spot area is 0.2 of the entire sphere, which is 4π R². So 0.2 ×4π R² = 0.8π R². The hemisphere's area is 2π R², so 0.8/(2) = 0.4. So 40% of the hemisphere is covered in spots. So when that hemisphere is facing us, 40% of the area is spots, each spot is cooler.

So the observed brightness when the spotted hemisphere is facing us is the star's normal flux minus the contribution from the spots. But how do we model this?

I think the approach is to calculate the change in flux when the star's spots rotate into view, and then equate that to the flux change from an exoplanet transit.

Wait, but the planet would cause a dip proportional to (Rp / Rstar)^2. The spots cause a dip because their cooler temperature contributes less flux, but the area covered is 20% of the star's surface.

Wait, no. When the spots are on the visible hemisphere, the flux is reduced. So the flux from the star without spots is F = σTeff^4 × 4π R² / (4π D²) ), but perhaps I don't need to get into the specifics because it's about the relative change.

The key is to calculate the fractional change in brightness when the spots are present. The star's brightness when the spots are facing us would be lower because the spots are cooler.

So the total flux when the star is spot-free is F0 = σ T_eff^4 × (4π R²) / (4π D²) ) → simplifies to σ T_eff^4 R² / D².

When the spots are present and the hemisphere with spots is facing us, the flux is F = F0 - (fraction of spots) × (difference in flux per unit area).

The fraction of spots is 20% or 0.2. But wait, each spot is cooler, so the flux per spot is less. Let me think about the flux per unit area for a spot.

The flux per unit area from the star is σ T^4. So the unspotted area emits σ (6000)^4, and the spotted area emits σ (5000)^4.

So the total flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is F = [ (1 - 0.2) × (6000)^4 + 0.2 × (5000)^4 ] × (R^2/(D^2)).

Wait no, because the star has a radius R, and the total area is 4π R². The area covered by spots is 0.2 × 4π R² = 0.8 π R². But when that hemisphere is facing us, the area we observe is 2π R². So of that, 0.8 π R² is covered by spots, and 1.2 π R² is unspotted. So the observed flux is:

F = [ (1.2 π R²) × (σ (6000)^4) + (0.8 π R²) × (σ (5000)^4) ] / (4π R² D²) ) ?

Wait, maybe I should model it differently. The total flux when the star is viewed with the spotted hemisphere is F = F_unspotted × (1 - filling factor × [ (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) - 1 ]) ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the relative flux change when the spots come into view.

The star's flux when it's completely unspotted is F0 = σ T_eff^4 × (4π R²) / (4π D²) ) → simplifies to (σ T_eff^4 R²) / D².

When the spotted area is visible (the hemisphere with spots is facing us), the flux is F = F0 × [ (1 - f) + f × (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ) ].

Where f is the filling factor. Because the spots have lower temperature, so each spot contributes less flux.

So f is 0.2, T_spot is 5000 K, T_eff is 6000 K.

So F = F0 × [ (1 - 0.2) + 0.2 * (5000/6000)^4 ) ].

Let me compute that.

Compute (5000/6000)^4. 5/6 is approximately 0.8333. 0.8333^4 is about (0.8333)^2= 0.6944, then squared again: 0.6944^2 ≈ 0.4823.

So (5000/6000)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So F = F0 × [ 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.4823 ].

Compute 0.2 * 0.4823 = 0.09646.

So 0.8 + 0.09646 = 0.89646.

So the flux when the spots are visible is 0.89646 × F0.

So the change in flux is F0 - F = F0 × (1 - 0.89646) = F0 × 0.10354.

So the fractional change is 0.10354, or about 10.354% decrease in flux.

Wait, but this is the dip when the spots are visible. But wait, the brightness variation depends on the rotation. If the star is rotating, the hemisphere with spots comes into view and then goes away. So the maximum dip is when the spotted hemisphere is fully visible, which would be a 10.35% dip.

Now, the exoplanet transit would cause a dip in brightness of (Rp / Rstar)^2. Because the area blocked is π Rp², and the star's area is π Rstar², so the fractional area is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

We need this dip to be the same as the 10.35% dip from the spots.

So set (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10354.

Wait, but wait a second. No, wait. Because the dip in the planet transit is (Rp/Rstar)^2, but the dip from the spots is (1 - 0.89646) = 0.10354. So we want (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10354, so Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.10354) ≈ 0.3218.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32, so that's close.

Wait, but wait—am I considering all factors correctly? Let me double-check.

Wait, the problem states that the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. So Rstar = R_sun. The exoplanet's radius is Rpl.

The brightness change when the planet transits is (Rp / Rstar)^2. So if Rp = 0.32 Rstar, then the dip is (0.32)^2 = 0.1024, which is around 10.24%, which is close to the 10.35% we calculated. So that's option D, ~0.32.

But wait, wait another moment. Another way to think about it: when the spots are on the hemisphere, the observed flux is 0.89646 F0. So the change is F0 (1 - 0.89646) = 0.10354 F0, so a 10.35% dip. The planet would cause a dip of (Rp/Rstar)^2 × F0.

So set (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10354 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.10354) ≈ 0.3218.

Yes, so the answer should be D) ~0.32.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the situation as follows:

The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, an effective temperature \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and 20% of its surface is covered by cooler spots (\( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \)). The brightness variation caused by these spots is due to the reduced flux from the cooler regions. The flux from a star is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature, so the fractional change in flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible can be calculated.

The total flux from the star without spots is \( F_0 = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \). When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is reduced because 20% of the surface emits at \( T_{\text{spot}} \). The fractional flux when the spots are visible is:

\[
F = F_0 \times \left[ (1 - 0.2) + 0.2 \times \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right].
\]

Substituting \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), we calculate:

\[
\left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \approx 0.4823.
\]

Thus:

\[
F = F_0 \times \left[ 0.8 + 0.2 \times 0.4823 \right] = F_0 \times 0.89646.
\]

The fractional change in flux is:

\[
\Delta F = F_0 - F = F_0 \times (1 - 0.89646) = F_0 \times 0.10354.
\]

This corresponds to a brightness variation of approximately \( 10.35\% \).

For an exoplanet to produce the same brightness variation, the dip caused by the planet transit must also be \( 10.35\% \). The dip caused by a planet is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius:

\[
\left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.10354.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10354} \approx 0.3218.
\]

Thus, the radius of the exoplanet relative to the star is approximately \( 0.32 \). Comparing this to the options, the closest match is:
