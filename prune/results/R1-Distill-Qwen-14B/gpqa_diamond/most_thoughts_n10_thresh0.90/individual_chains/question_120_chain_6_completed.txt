Okay, so I've got this question about stars and parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I think is that distance is inversely proportional to parallax. Oh right, distance d (in parsecs) is 1 over parallax plx (in arcseconds). So d = 1/plx.

Now the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So I'm thinking about how the number of stars changes with the parallax. Since stars are uniformly distributed, their density in space should be constant. Wait, but when you look at them from Earth, the number you observe in a certain range of parallax depends on how many are at that distance and how the volume works.

Let me think. The number of stars per unit volume is uniform, so n is a constant. But the volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr would be the surface area of the sphere (4πd²) times dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dr.

But since parallax plx is 1/d, d is 1/plx. Let me substitute that in. So d = 1/plx, so dr is the change in distance. But wait, the question is about per unit range of plx, so maybe I should express dr in terms of d plx.

Wait, plx = 1/d. So d plx = - (1/d²) dd. Because derivative of plx with respect to d is -1/d². So when d changes by dd, plx changes by d plx = -dd / d². But since we're dealing with absolute values, I can write d plx = dd / d². Hmm.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the number of stars per unit plx. So let's say we have a small change in plx, d plx. The corresponding change in distance is dd. So from the earlier equation, dd = -d² d plx. But since d is positive, and plx is positive, the negative sign might just indicate direction, but for the magnitude, we can ignore it.

So the number of stars in a shell with parallax between plx and plx + d plx is the number of stars in the corresponding distance shell. The number of stars in the shell is n * 4π d² * dd. Substituting dd from above, it's n *4π d² * (d² d plx). Because from plx=1/d, dd= d² d plx.

Wait, so dd = (d²) d plx? Let me check. If plx = 1/d, then d plx is the derivative of plx with respect to d. So derivative is -1/d². So d plx = (-1/d²) dd. So rearranging, dd = -d² d plx. But since we're dealing with absolute values, it's d² d plx.

So substituting back, the number of stars between plx and plx + d plx is n * 4π d² * (d² d plx) = n *4π (d^4) d plx.

Wait, does that make sense? Because substituting d = 1/plx, so d^4 is (1/plx)^4 = 1/plx^4. So the number of stars is proportional to (1/plx^4) * d plx. But wait, the question is about number per unit plx. So maybe I should express it as dN/d plx.

Wait, dN is the number of stars in a small plx range d plx. So,

dN = n * 4π d² * dd.

But dd = d² d plx (as above), so:

dN = n *4π d^4 d plx.

But d = 1/plx, so d^4 = 1/plx^4.

So substituting,

dN = n *4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

Which implies that the number of stars per unit plx (dN/d plx) is proportional to 1/(plx^4).

Wait, but wait a second. That would imply that the number of stars decreases as plx increases. Because higher plx means closer stars, and more stars in that range. Wait, wait no. Wait, wait, if plx increases, that means the stars are closer, so more stars would be in a small plx range. But according to this, dN is proportional to 1/plx^4. So when plx is larger (closer stars), 1/plx^4 is smaller. That seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me go through the steps again.

The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is N = n * 4π d² * dd.

Expressed in terms of plx, since d = 1/plx, so dd = d² d plx.

Substituting d, dd = (1/(plx)^2) d plx.

So N = n *4π (1/(plx)^2) * (1/(plx)^2) d plx.

Which is N = n *4π (1/(plx^4)) d plx.

So the number per unit plx is dN/d plx = n *4π * (1/(plx^4)).

Hmm, so the number goes as 1/plx^4. But wait, that can't be right because when plx is small (very distant stars), the number per plx should be less, but maybe that's not the case.

Wait, let me think in terms of the volume element. The volume element in spherical shells is 4πd² dd. So for a given thickness dd, the volume is proportional to d². When you look at parallax, plx = 1/d, so d =1/plx. So the volume element becomes proportional to (1/plx)^2 * (d (1/plx)).

Wait, d plx is the change in plx, and since plx = 1/d, dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. So the change in d is proportional to 1/(plx^2) times the change in plx.

So the volume element 4π d² dd becomes 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) d plx. So 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number of stars in that shell is n * 4π (1/plx^4) d plx. So the number per unit plx is n *4π / plx^4.

So as plx increases (d decreases), 1/plx^4 decreases. That suggests that the number of stars per unit plx decreases as plx increases, which seems counterintuitive because closer stars (higher plx) should be more in number in a given plx range.

Wait, that's not making sense. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's consider that the number of stars as a function of distance. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd is proportional to d^2 dd. So N = k d² dd, where k is a constant of proportionality.

But parallax plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So substituting, we have N = k (1/plx)^2 * dd.

But dd is the change in d, which can be expressed in terms of d plx. So since d =1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) d plx.

So substituting, N = k (1/plx^2) * ( - (1/plx²) d plx ). The negative indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but since we're considering the magnitude, we can ignore the sign. So N = k (1/plx^4) d plx.

Which again suggests that the number of stars in a given d plx interval is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

But this would mean that the number of stars per unit plx decreases as plx increases. That is, for higher plx (closer stars), the number per unit plx is lower. That doesn't make sense because closer stars are more numerous in a given volume. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused because the volume element when translated into plx involves the inverse square and the derivative.

Wait, another approach: Let's model the density of stars as being uniform in space. So the number of stars in a volume element dV is n dV, where n is the number density (number per volume).

The volume element dV for a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4π d² dd.

So number of stars = n * 4π d² dd.

But since plx = 1/d, we can write d = 1/plx.

So, dd = (d plx)/ (d²) ) → wait, no, better to take the derivative. Since plx = 1/d, then d plx = - (1/d²) dd → so dd = -d² d plx. Again, take magnitude, so dd = (1/plx^2) d plx.

Substituting into number of stars:

N = n *4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) d plx.

Which is N = n *4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number of stars per unit plx is N/(d plx) )= 4π n / plx^4.

Which means the number of stars per unit plx decreases as 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that's not matching my intuition. Because if the stars are uniformly distributed, then for a given volume, more stars are present when the volume is larger. For a given plx range, say from plx to plx + d plx, the corresponding distance is from d=1/plx to d=1/(plx + d plx). The volume in between is 4π (d^2) dd. But when plx increases, the corresponding d decreases, so the volume for a small d plx would be smaller, leading to fewer stars. So perhaps the number of stars per unit plx does decrease as plx increases.

Wait, perhaps this is correct. Because as you look at closer stars (higher plx), the volume element (dV) for a small change in plx decreases. Because for a small change in plx, the corresponding change in distance is smaller, and since d is small, the volume (4π d² dd) is smaller.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about plx increasing by a small amount, say from plx to plx + Δplx. The corresponding distances are d =1/plx and d'=1/(plx + Δplx). The change in d is dd = d' - d = 1/(plx + Δplx) - 1/plx ≈ ( -1/plx² ) Δplx (using a Taylor expansion). So dd ≈ -Δplx/(plx^2).

The volume element is 4π d² dd. So substituting, it's 4π (1/plx^2) ( -Δplx / plx² ) ) = -4π Δplx / plx^4.

The negative indicates direction, but the magnitude is 4π Δplx / plx^4. So the number of stars in that volume is n *4π Δplx / plx^4.

So per unit plx (Δplx), the number is n4π / plx^4.

So the number of stars per unit plx is inversely proportional to plx^4. So the answer would be option A, which is ~1/plx^4.

But wait, another approach: let's think about the volume in terms of plx.

The number of stars in a thin shell at plx is n * (volume of shell).

Volume of shell is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d (1/plx)) ) = 4π (1/plx^2) * ( -1/plx² d plx ). The negative comes from the derivative, but we can ignore the sign for magnitude.

So volume is 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) d plx = 4π / plx^4 d plx.

Thus, number of stars per unit plx is n *4π / plx^4.

So the number decreases as 1/plx^4.

So the correct option is A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely related to distance: \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). 

Expressing \( dd \) in terms of \( \text{plx} \), we use the relationship \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), so \( dd = -\frac{1}{d^2} d\text{plx} \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we find \( dd = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). 

The number of stars in the shell becomes proportional to \( 4\pi d^2 dd \), which substitutes to \( 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx} \). 

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of \( \text{plx} \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). This means the number of stars decreases as \( \text{plx} \) increases, consistent with the fact that the volume element for a given \( d\text{plx} \) shrinks as \( \text{plx} \) increases.

The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
