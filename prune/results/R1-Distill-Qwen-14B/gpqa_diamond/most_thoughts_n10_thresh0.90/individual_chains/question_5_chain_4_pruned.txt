Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. 

Wait, I remember that for angular momentum operators, the eigenvalues are related to the components. Each component (like P_x, P_y, P_z) has eigenvalues ±ħ/2 for spin-½ particles. Since the operator here is written in terms of Pauli matrices, maybe it's the spin operator for a muon, which is a lepton with spin ½.

The operator components are given as matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Let me note them down:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Wait, but the question is about the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So P is like the component of angular momentum along direction n, right? So P would be the dot product of the vector operator P (which is [P_x, P_y, P_z]) with the direction vector n. So if n is in the x-z plane, it has components (n_x, 0, n_z), since y-component is zero.

So n is a unit vector, so n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1. Let me denote n_x as cosθ and n_z as sinθ, maybe? Because in spherical coordinates, θ is the angle from the z-axis. So n would be (cosθ, 0, sinθ).

Therefore, the operator P along n is P · n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z + 0*P_y. So substituting:

P_n = cosθ * P_x + sinθ * P_z

Substituting the matrix expressions:

P_n = (ħ/2)[ cosθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + sinθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute this matrix:

First, cosθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] becomes [[0, cosθ], [cosθ, 0]]
Second, sinθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] becomes [[sinθ, 0], [0, -sinθ]]
Adding them gives:

Top left: sinθ
Top right: cosθ
Bottom left: cosθ
Bottom right: -sinθ

So the matrix is:

[ [sinθ, cosθ],
  [cosθ, -sinθ] ]

Wait, no. Wait, let me recheck. Oh wait, no: adding the two matrices:

Top left: 0 (from P_x) + sinθ (from P_z) → sinθ
Top right: cosθ (from P_x) + 0 → cosθ
Bottom left: cosθ + 0 → cosθ
Bottom right: 0 (from P_x) + (-sinθ) → - sinθ

Yep, so the matrix for P_n is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix.

So the operator is (ħ/2) times the matrix:

[[sinθ, cosθ],
 [cosθ, -sinθ]]

Now, we need to find the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = (ħ/2)|v>.

Wait, but wait, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so (ħ/2)|v> = P_n |v>.

So the matrix equation is:

[[sinθ, cosθ],
 [cosθ, -sinθ]] * [a; b] = (1) * [a; b]

Because when we factor out the (ħ/2), the eigenvalue equation would have (ħ/2) on both sides, so when we write the matrix equation, the matrix is (2/ħ P_n) which would be the matrix [[sinθ, cosθ],[cosθ, -sinθ]], and the eigenvalue equation becomes:

[[sinθ, cosθ],
 [cosθ, -sinθ]] [a; b] = [a; b]

Because (P_n |v> ) = (ħ/2) |v> → (ħ/2) M |v> = (ħ/2)|v>, so M |v> = |v>, where M is the matrix.

So the equation is:

sinθ * a + cosθ * b = a
cosθ * a - sinθ * b = b

So equation 1: (sinθ -1) a + cosθ b = 0
Equation 2: cosθ a + (-sinθ -1) b = 0

Wait, perhaps rearranging equation 1:

(sinθ * a) + (cosθ * b) = a → (sinθ - 1) a + cosθ b = 0
Equation 2: cosθ a - sinθ b = b → cosθ a + (- sinθ -1) b = 0

Now, for a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficients must be zero. So the equations are:

(sinθ -1) a + cosθ b = 0
cosθ a + (-sinθ -1) b = 0

Wait, but we can solve this as a linear system. Let me write the equations:

Equation 1: (sinθ -1) a + cosθ b = 0
Equation 2: cosθ a + (-sinθ -1) b = 0

We can write this as a matrix:

[ (sinθ -1)   cosθ       ] [a]   = [0]
[ cosθ         (-sinθ -1) ] [b]     [0]

The determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero for non-trivial solutions.

So determinant D = (sinθ -1)(-sinθ -1) - (cosθ)(cosθ)

Compute D:

= ( (sinθ)(-sinθ) - sinθ*(-1) -1 * (-sinθ) -1 * (-1) ) ) - cos²θ
Wait, perhaps expanding (sinθ -1)(-sinθ -1):

= (sinθ)(-sinθ) + (sinθ)(-1) + (-1)(-sinθ) + (-1)(-1)
= -sin²θ - sinθ + sinθ + 1
= -sin²θ + 1

So D = (-sin²θ + 1) - cos²θ

But 1 = sin²θ + cos²θ, so substituting:

D = (1 - sin²θ) - cos²θ = cos²θ - cos²θ = 0.

Ah, so determinant is zero. So the system has non-trivial solutions. Now, from the first equation:

(sinθ -1) a + cosθ b = 0 → (1 - sinθ) a = cosθ b → a = [cosθ/(1 - sinθ)] b

Let me see if I can simplify this. Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + sinθ):

a = [cosθ (1 + sinθ) ] / [ (1 - sinθ)(1 + sinθ) ) ] * b
Denominator: 1 - sin²θ = cos²θ

So:

a = [ cosθ (1 + sinθ) ) / cos²θ ] b
Simplify:
a = [ (1 + sinθ) / cosθ ] b

So a = (1 + sinθ)/cosθ * b

So the ratio a/b is (1 + sinθ)/cosθ.

Let me write the eigenvector as [a; b] = [ (1 + sinθ) / cosθ * b ; b ] = b [ (1 + sinθ)/cosθ , 1 ]

But for simplicity, let me choose b = cosθ to make the expressions simpler. So then a = (1 + sinθ)

So the eigenvector is:

[ (1 + sinθ), cosθ ]

But wait, wait a second. Because (1 + sinθ)/cosθ could be written as tan(theta/2 + pi/4), but perhaps it's better to find a normalized vector.

Wait, the eigenvector should be normalized. So the elements are a and b, which I've expressed in terms of theta. Let's compute the normalization factor.

The vector is [a, b] = [ (1 + sinθ), cosθ ]

So the norm squared is a^2 + b^2 = (1 + sinθ)^2 + cos²θ.

Expanding:

(1 + 2 sinθ + sin²θ) + cos²θ = 1 + 2 sinθ + (sin²θ + cos²θ) ) = 1 + 2 sinθ + 1 = 2(1 + sinθ )

So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(2(1 + sinθ)).

So the normalized eigenvector is:

[ (1 + sinθ) / sqrt(2(1+sinθ)) , cosθ / sqrt(2(1+sinθ)) ) ]
Simplify:

a = sqrt( (1 + sinθ) / 2 )
b = cosθ / sqrt(2(1 + sinθ)) )

Wait, let me compute these terms.

Alternatively, we can express (1 + sinθ) as 2 sin(theta/2 + pi/4)^2 or something, but perhaps it's easier to express in terms of theta/2 parameters.

Wait, another approach: using the substitution theta = 2phi, or maybe using trigonometric identities.

Alternatively, note that (1 + sinθ) = 2 sin^2(theta/2 + pi/4) ?

Wait, I think there's a better way. Let me think about the angle theta.

Wait, perhaps using tan(theta/2) substitution.

But maybe I should proceed differently. Let me consider the eigenvector in terms of spin-½ states.

In quantum mechanics, the eigenstates of the spin component along a direction n are given by the spin-up and spin-down states along that axis. For a spin-½ particle, the spin-up state along direction n is usually written as:

|+n> = cos(theta/2)|+z> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)|-z>

But wait, in this problem, the direction n lies in the x-z plane, so phi (the azimuthal angle) is zero. Because in the x-z plane, the angle phi is zero because the vector is in the x-z plane, so the projection onto the y-axis is zero. Hence, phi = 0, so e^{i phi} = 1.

Wait, but wait: the direction n is in the x-z plane. So the polar angle is theta, and the azimuthal angle phi is 0. So the state would be:

|+n> = cos(theta/2)|+z> + sin(theta/2)|-z>

Wait, but wait, no— that's when the state is aligned along the z-axis. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the eigenstates of the Pauli matrices.

Wait, the general eigenstate for spin along n is given by:

|+n> = e^{-i phi/2} [ cos(theta/2) |↑> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |↓> ]

But since phi is zero in this case (because n is in the x-z plane), this becomes:

|+n> = cos(theta/2) |↑> + sin(theta/2) |↓>

Wait, but wait, |↑> is the eigenstate of P_z with eigenvalue +ħ/2, and |↓> has eigenvalue -ħ/2.

So in the standard basis, |↑> is (1, 0)^T and |↓> is (0, 1)^T.

So the state |+n> is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )^T.

Wait, but according to our earlier calculation, the normalized eigenvector is (sqrt( (1 + sinθ)/2 ), sqrt( (1 + sinθ)/2 ) * something else?), but perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me recheck. Earlier, I found that for the eigenvector, a = (1 + sinθ)/cosθ * b.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me double-check.

From the first equation:

sinθ a + cosθ b = a → a (sinθ - 1) + cosθ b = 0 → a (1 - sinθ ) = cosθ b → a = [ cosθ / (1 - sinθ) ] b.

Alternatively, I can factor a negative sign: 1 - sinθ = -(sinθ - 1), so a = [ cosθ / -(sinθ -1) ] b = [ -cosθ / (sinθ -1) ] b.

But perhaps I should consider using a different approach, such as diagonalizing the matrix.

Another approach: The matrix for P_n is (ħ/2) multiplied by [[sinθ, cosθ], [cosθ, -sinθ]]

Wait, no, earlier I had P_n = (ħ/2) [ [sinθ, cosθ], [cosθ, -sinθ] ]

Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Because P_x is (ħ/2) [[0,1], [1,0]], P_z is (ħ/2)[[1,0],[0,-1]], so when you take cosθ P_x + sinθ P_z, you have:

(ħ/2) [ cosθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + sinθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Which is (ħ/2) * [ [ sinθ, cosθ ], [ cosθ, - sinθ ] ]

Wait, no, let me compute term by term:

cosθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] is [[0, cosθ], [cosθ, 0]]

sinθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] is [[sinθ, 0], [0, - sinθ]]

Adding them:

Top left: 0 + sinθ = sinθ
Top right: cosθ + 0 = cosθ
Bottom left: cosθ + 0 = cosθ
Bottom right: 0 + (- sinθ) = - sinθ

So the matrix is indeed [[sinθ, cosθ], [cosθ, - sinθ]], multiplied by ħ/2.

So the operator for P_n is (ħ/2) M, where M is [[sinθ, cosθ], [cosθ, - sinθ]]

The eigenvalues of M can be found by solving det( M - λ I ) = 0.

The equation is (sinθ - λ)(- sinθ - λ) - cosθ * cosθ = 0 → (λ^2 - sin²θ) - cos²θ = 0 → λ^2 = sin²θ + cos²θ = 1 → λ = ±1.

So the eigenvalues are +1 and -1.

So the eigenvalues of P_n (since it's (ħ/2) M) are (ħ/2)(±1), so ± ħ/2, as expected.

We're looking for the eigenvalue +ħ/2, which corresponds to λ = 1 in matrix M.

So the eigenvector equation is ( M - I ) [a; b] = 0 → [[sinθ - 1, cosθ], [cosθ, - sinθ -1]] [a; b] = [0; 0]

So the two equations are:

( sinθ - 1 ) a + cosθ b = 0 → equation (1)
cosθ a + ( - sinθ -1 ) b = 0 → equation (2)

From equation (1): (sinθ -1) a = - cosθ b → a = [ cosθ / (1 - sinθ) ] b

Let me factor this as a = [ cosθ / (1 - sinθ) ] b

Let me simplify cosθ/(1 - sinθ). Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + sinθ):

a = [ cosθ (1 + sinθ) ] / [ (1 - sinθ)(1 + sinθ) ) ] b

The denominator becomes 1 - sin²θ = cos²θ.

So a = [ cosθ (1 + sinθ) ) / cos²θ ] b → a = [ (1 + sinθ) / cosθ ] b

So the ratio a/b is (1 + sinθ)/cosθ.

So the eigenvector can be written as [ a; b ] = [ (1 + sinθ)/cosθ * b ; b ]

Let me choose b = cosθ to make it simple. Then a = (1 + sinθ)

So the vector is (1 + sinθ, cosθ )

But let's normalize it.

The norm squared is (1 + sinθ)^2 + (cosθ)^2.

Expanding:

1 + 2 sinθ + sin²θ + cos²θ → 1 + 2 sinθ + 1 → 2(1 + sinθ)

So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(2(1 + sinθ)).

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ (1 + sinθ) / sqrt(2(1 + sinθ)) ), cosθ / sqrt(2(1 + sinθ)) ) ]

Simplifying:

= [ sqrt( (1 + sinθ) / 2 ), sqrt( cos²θ / (2(1 + sinθ)) ) ) ]

Wait, the second term can be simplified by noticing that cos²θ = (1 - sin²θ ) = (1 - sinθ)(1 + sinθ)

So cosθ / sqrt[2(1 + sinθ)] = sqrt( (1 - sinθ)(1 + sinθ) ) / sqrt( 2(1 + sinθ) )

= sqrt( (1 - sinθ) (1 + sinθ) ) / sqrt(2(1 + sinθ)) )

= sqrt( (1 - sinθ) ) * sqrt(1 + sinθ) ) / sqrt( 2 (1 + sinθ) )

= sqrt( (1 - sinθ) ) / sqrt(2)
