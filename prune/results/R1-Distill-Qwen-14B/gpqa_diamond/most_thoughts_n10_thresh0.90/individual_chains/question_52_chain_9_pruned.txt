Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. So, the question is about a star with some specific characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels.

Alright, let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand all the details. So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, but when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). They've observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find by what factor this ratio changes when the star isn't spotted compared to when it is.

Wait, okay, so the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher. We need to find the factor by which it changes, so (ratio without spots) / (ratio with spots) equals the factor.

The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Å. So, that's in the near-ultraviolet perhaps? Maybe Ti I lines.

The problem says to assume the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so we can use the Boltzmann equation for populations of energy levels.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two energy levels to the temperature. The equation is:

n2 / n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the number of atoms in levels 2 and 1 respectively.
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of each level.
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels.
- k is Boltzmann's constant.
- T is the temperature.

The ratio we're looking at is n1/n2, since the problem states that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. Wait, no. Wait, the question says the ratio of the number of neutral Ti in two levels. So, they're looking at n1/n2. Or is it n2/n1? Wait, let's read the problem again: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)".

So, the ratio is level 1 to level 2. So, n1/n2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So, n1/n2 is lower when the star has spots.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think. The Boltzmann equation gives n2/n1 as proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)), multiplied by g2/g1. So, if the temperature decreases, then the exponential term becomes smaller because the denominator gets bigger. So, n2/n1 decreases with lower temperature, which means n1/n2 increases. But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. Hmm, that's the opposite of what I thought. So maybe I have the ratio backwards.

Wait, let me correct this. The problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So, the star is cooler when it has spots. The observed ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. So, when T goes down, n1/n2 goes down. So, normally, when T is higher (without spots), n1/n2 is higher. Wait, but what's n1/n2 as a function of T?

From the Boltzmann equation, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )

If E2 > E1, then the exponent is positive. Let's call ΔE = E2 - E1. So,

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE / (k T) )

If T decreases, exp(-ΔE/(k T)) increases because the denominator is smaller, making the exponent more negative? Wait, no. Wait, T is in the denominator. So, as T decreases, 1/T increases, making the exponent more negative. So, exp(-ΔE/(k T)) becomes smaller as T decreases.

Wait, no: Let me take an example. Suppose ΔE is positive, k is positive. So, when T is higher, ΔE/(k T) is smaller. So, exp(-x) where x is smaller (since T is higher) would be larger. So, as T increases, exp(-ΔE/(kT)) increases because the exponent becomes less negative. So, n2/n1 increases with higher T.

Therefore, when the star has spots, T decreases. So, n2/n1 decreases. Therefore, n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) increases. But wait, the question says that when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So, that would mean that when T is lower, n1/n2 is lower. Which would imply that n1/n2 is higher when T is higher. But according to the above, when T is higher, n2/n1 is higher, so n1/n2 is lower.

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

The Boltzmann equation says that the higher energy level (level 2) is less populated than the lower level (level 1) because of the exponential factor. So, when the temperature increases, the population in the higher level increases, because the exponential term grows. So, n2 increases relative to n1.

So, without spots, T is higher (6000 K), so n2 is higher, meaning n1/n2 is lower. Wait, no: n1 is the lower energy level. So, for higher T, more atoms are in higher energy levels. So, n2 is higher than n1, but also, the ratio n2/n1 is higher.

Wait, let's take numbers. Suppose without spots, T is 6000 K, so n2/n1 is, say, 0.1. Then when T drops to 5500 K, n2/n1 is 0.05. So, n1/n2 is 10 at 6000 K, and 20 at 5500 K. So, when T decreases, n1/n2 increases. But the problem says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So that's the opposite of what the numbers say. So, perhaps I got the ratio backwards.

Wait, perhaps the ratio observed is n2/n1, not n1/n2.

Wait the problem states: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)". So, the ratio is n1/n2.

Wait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, because n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, flipping that, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T) )

So, if
