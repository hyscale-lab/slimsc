Okay, so I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific organic compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, the target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me break that down.

First, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with C≡CH attached.

The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and a formyl (carbaldehyde) group. Wait, the formula is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main cyclohexane ring has a substituent at position 1. Let me visualize this.

The substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)—so that's a cyclohexyl group connected to a CH2-OH. Wait, no, actually, the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH), but wait, perhaps it's a methyl group substituted with a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group? Wait, the name might be a bit tricky. Let me reconstruct.

The main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, a cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde group (CHO). Then, at position 1 (adjacent?), there's a substituent which is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So, maybe that substituent is a CH2 group where one substituent is cyclohexyl and the other is OH. So, the structure would be:

The cyclohexane ring has a CHO group at one position. At the adjacent position (position 1), there's a CH2 group. This CH2 has a cyclohexyl group attached (so it's a cyclohexylmethyl group), but also a hydroxyl group. Wait, that doesn't seem possible because a carbon can't have four substituents if it's CH2. Oh wait, perhaps it's (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl—so a CH group with a cyclohexyl, hydroxyl, and two cyclohexyls? No
