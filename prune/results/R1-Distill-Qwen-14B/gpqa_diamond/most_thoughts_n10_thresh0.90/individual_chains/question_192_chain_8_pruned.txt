Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric fields around a conductor with a cavity. Let me see what the question says.

So, there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity, which isn't at the center. The center of the cavity is separated by distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor, which is a distance L from the conductor's center. Point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center, and l is greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, I remember that when charges are inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. So when a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the conductor must respond.

Wait, right. For a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the charges inside the conductor must reside on the surface. But here, the conductor is uncharged, but there's a charge inside the cavity. So, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge. Let me think. The charge +q inside the cavity will induce a charge of -q on the inner surface of the conductor. But since the conductor as a whole is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q.

Wait, no. Wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. So when +q is placed in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (cavity wall) must have an induced charge of -q. But since the conductor as a whole must remain neutral (because it was uncharged and no other charges are added), the outer surface must have a charge of +q.

But how does this affect the electric field outside the conductor? I remember that the electric field outside a conductor depends on the total charge enclosed within the conductor. So, when you have a charge inside a cavity, the conductor's outer surface will have a charge equal to the cavity's content. So, the external field would be as if the charge +q was at the center of the conductor, because the induced charges on the outer surface act as if the charge is uniformly distributed.

Wait, no, not exactly. Wait, in the case of a spherical cavity, when the charge is placed inside the cavity, the induced
