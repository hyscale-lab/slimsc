Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light traveling through glass that's moving. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the laboratory frame. The options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, wait. So the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v, and the light is going in the same direction as the beam. I need to find the speed of light in the glass as seen by someone in the lab.

I remember that when dealing with relative velocities, especially in different reference frames, we might need to use the velocity addition formulas from special relativity. Oh man, that's been a while since I studied that.

In special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/(cÂ²)), where u is the velocity in one frame and u' in another. But wait, that's when you're moving at velocity v relative to the other frame. But wait, this is about light, so the speed should remain c in all frames, right? Because light always travels at c in a vacuum, regardless of the source's motion. But wait, the scenario here is different because the light is inside a medium, glass, which has an index of refraction n.

So the speed of light in the glass is v_light = c / n. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the problem states that the speed of light in vacuum is c=1 (so units are in terms where c=1, which simplifies things). So in the glass, the speed would be 1/n because the index of refraction is n. So in the glass's rest frame, light moves at v = 1/n.

But now, the glass itself is moving at speed v (in the lab frame). So I need to find the speed of the light in the lab frame when the glass is moving.

Wait, no. The glass is moving, so the light's speed in the lab frame depends on both the speed of the light within the glass and the motion of the glass itself.

But wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me clarify the reference frames. Let's say in the lab frame, the glass is moving at
