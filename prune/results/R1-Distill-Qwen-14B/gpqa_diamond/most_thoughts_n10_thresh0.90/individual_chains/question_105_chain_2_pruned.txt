Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question involves a star with some dark spots and trying to find the equivalent exoplanet radius that would cause the same brightness variation.

Alright, let me start by reading the question carefully. So the star has the same radius as the Sun, and one hemisphere is covered with dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, and the star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots are cooler, and their temperature is 1000 K less than the star's. Because of this, when the star rotates, the spots come into view and cause a dip in brightness, which can mimic an exoplanet transit. The question is asking, if there were no spots, what exoplanet radius would produce the same brightness variation amplitude.

Wait, so I need to compare the brightness dip caused by the spots to that of a planet transiting the star. The key here is to find the ratio Rpl/Rstar such that the change in brightness (the amplitude of the dip) is the same in both cases.

I remember that the change in brightness (delta F) when a planet transits a star is given by the formula:

delta F = (R_planet / R_star)^2

But wait, is that right? Because when a planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's light. So the fractional change in brightness is (R_p / R_s)^2. So for the planet, the dip is proportional to the square of the planet's radius over the star's radius.

But in this case, the star has spots. So when the star rotates and the spots come into view, it's not exactly the same as a planet transit. Because the spots are cooler, the star's total brightness when spots are visible is less than when they're not. So the amplitude of the brightness variation depends on the temperature difference and the area covered.

Hmm, so the star's brightness variation due to spots would be the sum of the spots' contribution. Let me think about how that works.

The star's total luminosity without spots is L = 4πRstar² σ Teff^4.

When the spots are present, part of the star's surface is cooler. The total brightness observed is the normal star plus the spots. But when the spots rotate into view, a part of the star that was contributing less (because it's cooler) comes into view, so the observed brightness decreases compared to when the spots are not facing us.

Wait, no. Because when the spots are on the hemisphere facing us, that part of the star is emitting less light than the rest. So the total flux is lower. So the variation in brightness is the difference between when the spots are visible and when they're not.

So to model this, I think we can calculate the change in flux when spots are visible.

The flux from the star without spots is F0 = σ Teff^4.

Wait, no, because the star's total flux is actually F0 = (Rstar^2 σ Teff^4) / D^2, but when considering the flux variation, the distance D cancels out. So the change would be based on the area and temperature difference.

The star emits flux F0 = σ Teff^4 * (area). The area of the star is 4π Rstar², but perhaps in terms of the flux per unit area, it's σ Teff^4.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to compute the fractional change in flux when the spots are visible.

The spots cover a certain area. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. Wait, but the problem says one hemisphere is covered, and the filling factor is 20%. So the total area covered by spots is 20% of the area of one hemisphere.

Wait, the area of a hemisphere is 2π R². So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π Rstar²? Or wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the stellar disk covered by spots when viewed from Earth. So if the entire hemisphere is spotted with a filling factor of 20%, then the area of the spots is 0.2 * π Rstar² (since one hemisphere is π R²), because a hemisphere is half the star's disk.

Wait, no. The star's total surface area is 4π R². A hemisphere is 2π R². So if the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, the spotted area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

Wait, maybe the filling factor is the fraction of the entire star's surface that's covered by spots. But the problem says one hemisphere is covered, and the filling factor is 20%. So when the star's not rotating, we see one hemisphere. So the total area of spots is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere we see, which is 0.2 * π R².

But regardless, the key is that when the spots are on the side facing us, their presence reduces the total flux because they're cooler.

The total flux without any spots would be F0 = (Rstar² σ Teff^4) * (π / (4π)) )? Wait, no. The star's total flux is F0 = (Rstar² σ Teff^4) / D². But when considering the variation, the distance D is constant, so when the spots are present, the flux is reduced by the area of the spots times the difference in their flux.

Alternatively, the change in flux when the spots are visible is the area of the spots times (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) times a factor. Because each spot contributes less flux.

Hmm, perhaps the fractional change in flux is given by:

ΔF/F0 = (Area of spots / Area of star) * ( (T_spot^4 - Teff^4) / Teff^4 )

Wait, no. Because when the spots are present, the flux is F = F0 - (Area of spots) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) * (σ) / (Area of star). Or maybe I should think in terms of the part of the star that is cooler.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute the relative change in flux when the spots are on the visible side.

The star's flux without spots is F0 = σ Teff^4 * (Rstar² / D²) * (π / (4π)) ), wait, maybe I'm complicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that the star's total flux is F = σ Teff^4 * (Rstar² / D²).

When the spots are visible, the flux comes from two regions: the normal surface and the spots.

So the flux when spots are visible would be F_spots = F0 - (A_spots * σ (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)) / (A_total) )

Wait, no, I think that's not correct. Each part of the star's surface emits flux density of σ T^4, so the total flux is the sum over each point. So the spots have an area A_spots, each with a flux density of σ T_spot^4. The rest of the area (A_rest) has σ Teff^4.

So the total flux when the spots are present is F = (A_rest) *
