Okay, so I've got this question about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located in the qubits space. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. So, this is a density matrix, right?

Wait, I think when a density matrix can be written as a mixture of projectors onto orthogonal states with equal coefficients, it's a mixed state. Each of these projectors, |0><0| and |1><1|, are pure states. Since they're orthogonal and have the same coefficient (1/2 each), this must be a completely mixed state.

Oh, right! For a single qubit, the state space is a Bloch sphere in three dimensions. The pure states are on the surface of this sphere, and mixed states are inside. So, a completely mixed state would be at the center of the sphere because it's the maximally mixed state.

Wait, the completely mixed state for a qubit is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. So that's exactly what this ρ is. So, it should be at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

In Bloch sphere coordinates, the state is represented by a vector (x, y, z). For a pure state |ψ> = cos(θ/2)|0> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|1>, the Bloch vector is (x, y, z) = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But for a mixed state, like the completely mixed one, all these components would be zero because it's the average of |0> and |1>, which are at opposite poles of the Bloch sphere.

Wait, more precisely, the maximally mixed state has no preferred direction, so it's at the center, which is (0,0,0). That makes sense because the Bloch vector would have no components in any direction.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), so that's the center. Option B is (0,0,1), which is the north pole corresponding to |0> state. Option A is (1,1,0), which I think is a point on the equator. Option D is (1,1,1), which is outside the Bloch sphere, which can't be right because the Bloch sphere has radius 1, and all components can't be 1 simultaneously.

So, the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a completely mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation of qubit states, pure states lie on the surface, while mixed states are inside. The completely mixed state is at the center of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the coordinates \((0,0,0)\). 

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A (\(r=(1,1,0)\))**: This represents a point on the equator of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to a pure state, not a mixed state.
- **Option B (\(r=(0,0,1)\))**: This is the north pole of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the pure state \(|0\rangle\), not a mixed state.
- **Option C (\(r=(0,0,0)\))**: This is the center of the Bloch sphere, representing the completely mixed state, which matches the given density matrix.
- **Option D (\(r=(1,1,1)\))**: This point lies outside the Bloch sphere, which is not physically meaningful for a qubit state.

Thus, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is \((0,0,0)\).

Answer: C
