Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let's see.

First, the nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So what's the atomic number of lithium? Oh right, Li is element 3, so the atomic number Z is 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number A is Z + N = 3 +3=6. So X is Li-6, which is actually a common isotope of lithium. So the nucleus we're dealing with is a Li-6 nucleus.

I think the energy of the collider is related to the kinetic energy of the ions. But wait, in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of the collider, they usually mean the total energy, which includes both kinetic and rest mass energy. Or wait, no, the kinetic energy might be the key here. Oh wait, no, I think in colliders, the energy usually refers to the kinetic energy per particle. Or wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

The speed is given as 0.96c, which is pretty high. So relativistic effects are definitely significant here. So I'll need to use the relativistic equations for energy.

The total energy of a particle is given by E = gamma * m c^2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So with v = 0.96c, I can calculate gamma.

Wait, let me compute gamma first. So v = 0.96c → v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. Then 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Let me check that more accurately:

Wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So gamma is 1/(sqrt(0.0784)) = 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... Approximately 3.5714.

So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, the energy of the nucleus is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. But wait, the rest mass of the nucleus is the mass of the Li-6 isotope.

So I need to find the rest mass of a Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a nucleus can be approximated using the mass of the individual protons and neutrons, considering binding energy, but maybe I can look up the approximate value. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate it using the atomic mass.

Wait, lithium-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0151 atomic mass units (u). Wait, I think the exact value might be around 6.0151 u. Because I remember that the mass of a carbon-12 atom is exactly 12 u, so for Li-6, which is about half, it's around 6.0151.

But wait, I should be precise. Let me think about the precise mass. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula where the mass of the nucleus is the sum of the masses of protons and neutrons minus the binding energy, but that's complicated.

Alternatively, I can remember that the mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u, and a neutron is about 1.008665 u. So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total mass would be 3*(1.007276 + 1.008665) u.

Let me compute that: 3*(2.015941) = 6.047823 u. But wait, this is the sum of individual nucleon masses. The actual nucleus has a mass less than this due to binding energy. The binding energy for Li-6 would make the nucleus mass lower. Hmm, but maybe for this problem, they approximate the mass using the atomic mass.

Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0151 u. Let me confirm. I think that's correct. So the rest mass energy is m c^2 = 6.0151 u * c^2.

But wait, the question is about the energy of the collider. Assuming that the collider imparts kinetic energy to the ions, but I'm not sure if the energy given is the total energy (kinetic + rest) or just the kinetic.

Wait, in colliders, the energy usually refers to the kinetic energy per particle. Or sometimes, the total energy is given as the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no. In high-energy physics, the "energy" of a particle in the collider is usually given as the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy. Or wait, no. The energy is typically the total energy, which is gamma * m c^2, as I thought earlier.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is asking for the kinetic energy. Because sometimes in problems, the kinetic energy is the term you're interested in. Let me read the question again: "What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?"

Hmm, so the energy would be the total energy of the ion, which is gamma times m c^2. So I think that's the approach.

So first, compute gamma: 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96c)^2 / c^2 ) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = approximately 3.5714.

Then, the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus is its mass (6.0151 u) multiplied by c^2. But wait, 1 u is
