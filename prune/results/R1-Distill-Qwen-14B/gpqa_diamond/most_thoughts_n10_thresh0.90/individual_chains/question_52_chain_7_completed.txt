Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem talks about a star with certain characteristics: 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So, the presence of spots is causing the star to emit less light overall, hence a lower effective temperature.

Then, the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, so the ratio is N1/N2, the number of atoms in level 1 over level 2. And this ratio is lower when the star has spots. So, when there are no spots, the ratio is higher. We need to find the factor, which is (N1/N2)_no_spots divided by (N1/N2)_spots.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. Oh, wait, that's in the ultraviolet range, I think. But more importantly, this is probably a forbidden line or something else, but more likely, it's just a specific transition we can model.

The problem says to assume LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), so the usual Saha and Boltzmann equations apply.

So, the ratio N1/N2 is given by the Boltzmann equation, right? Because it's about the distribution of atoms in energy levels. The Boltzmann equation says:

N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where g2 and g1 are the statistical weights of the levels, and E2 > E1, since the transition is from lower to higher energy (if emission) or higher to lower (if absorption). But in any case, E2 - E1 is positive.

Wait, wait. The transition corresponds to a specific wavelength, which relates to the energy difference between the two levels. So the energy difference ΔE can be found using the relation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c speed of light, and λ the wavelength.

But I remember that the energy difference is ΔE = hc/λ. So for λ = 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

So let's compute ΔE. But wait, maybe I don't need the exact value because it might cancel out. Let me think.

The ratio N1/N2 is N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, because N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So the ratio depends on the temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

But the energy E is proportional to T? No, the energy difference is a fixed value for the transition. Because the transition is between two specific energy levels in the atom, so ΔE is a constant, determined by the wavelength.

So the ratio N1/N2 depends on the temperature because the exponential term depends on T.

Wait, but the star's temperature is changing when there are spots. The overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. But wait, when the star has spots, the surface is cooler in those spots, but the rest is the same. Hmm, but the problem says the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. So, I think in this problem, the star's overall temperature is considered to change. So when there are spots, the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is 5500 K, but when there are no spots, it's 6000 K.

Wait, but wait a second. Spots on the star are cooler regions. So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature is lower. But the photosphere outside the spots is still at 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, say T_spot lower than 6000 K. But the problem doesn't give T_spot directly; it just says that when 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K.

Hmm, but maybe for this problem, the assumption is that the entire photosphere's temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. Because the question says, "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K." So perhaps the photosphere is uniformly at 5500 K when spots are present. But wait, that can't be right because spots are cooler regions. Oh wait, perhaps the problem is oversimplifying and just wants us to consider the effective temperature of the entire star as 5500 K when spots are present, regardless of the actual surface temperature distribution.

But for the purposes of this problem, maybe we can model the change in the ratio based on the effective temperature change. So when there are no spots, the star has T = 6000 K, and when it has spots, T = 5500 K. But wait, no, wait: no, the star's surface isn't uniformly at 5500 K when spots are present; the spots are cooler, but the rest is at 6000 K. But the problem states that the effective temperature (the average) of the star is 5500 K when 40% is covered.

Wait, but the problem says that when the surface is not covered, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, Teff drops to 5500 K. So perhaps the star’s overall emission is a combination of the spotted and unspotted regions.

But the question is about the photosphere when the star does or doesn't have spots. The photosphere in the spots would be cooler, but the rest would remain at 6000 K. So perhaps the effective temperature isn't the same everywhere, but the question is considering the overall effect.

Wait, but the problem says that the photosphere's effective temperature decreases. Hmm, maybe the star's overall photosphere has a lower average temperature when spots are present. But I'm a bit confused here because the photosphere is the outer layer of the star, and spots are regions where the photosphere is cooler. So perhaps the problem is considering the photosphere to be at a lower average temperature when spots are present, but the actual temperature varies across the surface.

But for this problem, perhaps the key is to model the average temperature of the photosphere when spots are present as 5500 K, and when they're not, it's 6000 K. So we can model the star's average T as 6000 K and 5500 K in the two cases.

Wait, but the effective temperature of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: Luminosity L = 4πR²σTeff⁴. But when parts of the star are cooler, the total luminosity is less than if the entire star were at Teff. So when 40% of the surface is spots at a lower temperature, the total luminosity would be the sum of the luminosity from the spotted and unspotted regions.

But the problem says that when 40% is covered, the effective temperature is 5500 K, which is the star's overall Teff. So to find the factor by which the ratio N1/N2 changes, we need to compare the ratio at 6000 K and 5500 K.

Wait, but if the star's overall Teff is lower, that would imply that the average photon emission is lower. But the photosphere's temperature varies across the surface, but the question says that the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K when 40% is covered. Hmm.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the ratio N1/N2. Since the ratio is given by the Boltzmann factor, which depends on T, the temperature of the region where the transition occurs.

Wait, but the star's photosphere isn't uniform in temperature. When spots are present, part of the photosphere is at a lower temperature, and the rest is at 6000 K. The observed ratio would be a mix of the two regions. But the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the spots are present, N1/N2 is lower than when there are no spots.

Wait, so without spots, the ratio is determined by T=6000 K. When spots are present, the ratio is determined by a lower T. But perhaps the overall ratio is a combination of the emission from the spots and the rest.

Wait, but the problem is about the ratio in the stellar photosphere. So perhaps the effective temperature is the average, and the photosphere (as seen from the star's surface) is at a certain temperature on average. But wait, the photosphere is the layer from which the star emits most of its light, and the effective temperature is the temperature that a blackbody would emit the same total radiation as the star.

But when 40% is covered by spots, the total luminosity is L = 0.6 L_6000 + 0.4 L_spot, where L_6000 is the luminosity per unit area at 6000 K, and L_spot is the luminosity per unit area at T_spot.

The overall luminosity must satisfy L = sigma Teff^4 * 4 pi R^2. When the star has spots, Teff is 5500 K, so L = sigma*(5500)^4 *4 pi R^2.

But when no spots, L = sigma*(6000)^4 *4 pi R^2.

When spots are present, the star's luminosity is the sum of the unspotted and spotted regions. So:

L = (0.6 * sigma T_unspot^4 + 0.4 * sigma T_spot^4) * 4 pi R^2

Set this equal to sigma*(5500)^4 *4 pi R^2.

So:

0.6 T_unspot^4 + 0.4 T_spot^4 = (5500)^4.

In the no-spot case, the entire star is at 6000 K, so T_unspot is 6000 K.

But when spots are present, T_unspot is 6000 K, and the spots have T_spot.

But wait, the problem says that when the surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. So when you have spots, the rest is still 6000 K. So T_unspot is 6000 K.

So plugging in:

0.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*T_spot^4 = (5500)^4.

We can solve for T_spot. Let me compute the numbers.

Compute each term:

(6000)^4 = 6^4 *1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

Multiply by 0.6: 0.6 *1.296e15 = 7.776e14.

(5500)^4 = (5.5e3)^4 = (5.5)^4 *1e12 = 915.0625 *1e12 = 9.150625e14.

So equation:

7.776e14 + 0.4*T_spot^4 = 9.150625e14.

Wait, no, wait: Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let's do this properly. Let me compute (6000)^4 and (5500)^4 in terms of 1e12 or similar.

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

5500^4 = (5.5e3)^4 = (5.5)^4 * (1e3)^4 = 5.5^4 is 915.0625, so 915.0625e12 = 9.150625e14.

So the equation:

0.6*(1.296e15) + 0.4*(T_spot^4) = 9.150625e14.

Calculate 0.6 *1.296e15 = 0.7776e15 = 7.776e14.

So 7.776e14 + 0.4*T_spot^4 = 9.150625e14.

Subtract 7.776e14 from both sides:

0.4*T_spot^4 = 9.150625e14 -7.776e14 = (9.150625 -7.776) e14 = 1.374625e14.

So T_spot^4 = (1.374625e14) / 0.4 = 3.4365625e14.

Take the fourth root to find T_spot.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have messed up the exponents. Because (6000)^4 is 6^4 *1e12, which is 1296e12, which is 1.296e15. So, 0.6 *1.296e15 = 7.776e14.

Similarly, (5500)^4 is 5.5^4 *1e12 = 915.0625e12 = 9.150625e14.

So, 0.6*(6000)^4 = 7.776e14.

Set up: 7.776e14 + 0.4*(T_spot^4) = 9.150625e14.

So, 0.4*T_spot^4 = 9.150625e14 -7.776e14 = 1.374625e14.

T_spot^4 = 1.374625e14 / 0.4 = 3.4365625e14.

So T_spot = (3.4365625e14)^(1/4).

Let me compute that.

We can write 3.4365625e14 = 3.4365625 x 1e14.

Take the fourth root:

(3.4365625)^(1/4) * (1e14)^(1/4).

(1e14)^(1/4) = (1e3)^ (14/4) = (1e3)^3.5 = 1e3^3 * sqrt(1e3) )= 1e9 * approx 31.62 = 3.162e10.

But wait, more accurately, (1e14) = (1e3.5)^4, because (1e3.5)^4 = (1e3.5)^2 squared = (1e7)^2 = 1e14.

Wait, (1e3.5 ) is 3.162e3.

Wait, no: 1e3.5 is 10^(3.5) = 10^3 *10^0.5 = 1000 * 3.1623 ≈ 3162.3.

So 3.1623e3.

So (3.1623e3)^4 = (3.1623)^4 * (1e3)^4 = approx (95.99) * 1e12 = 9.599e13, which is less than 3.43656e14.

Hmm, perhaps better to compute (3.4365625e14)^(1/4) numerically.

Let me compute the fourth root of 3.4365625e14.

Let me take the logarithm first.

log10(3.4365625e14) = log10(3.4365625) + 14 ≈ 0.536 +14 =14.536.

Divide by 4:14.536 /4 =3.634.

So antilog is 10^3.634 ≈ 4340 K.

Wait, 10^3 is 1000, 10^0.634 ≈ 4.28.

So 4.28 *1e3 = 4280 K.

Wait, but wait:

Alternatively, compute 4340^4.

4340^2 = 4340 *4340.

4340 *4340 = (4300 +40)^2 = 4300² + 2*4300*40 +40² = 18,490,000 + 344,000 + 1,600 = 18,835,600.

Then squared again: (4340^2)^2 = (18,835,600)^2.

Hmm, but that's a huge number, but perhaps I can approximate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculation. Let me try another approach.

Compute T_spot^4 = 3.4365625e14.

But 1e14 is (1e3.5)^4. So 3.43656e14 is 3.43656e14 = 3.43656 * 1e14.

So, 3.43656^(1/4) ≈ 1.36, because 1.3^4 = 2.8561, 1.36^4=?

Compute 1.36^2 = 1.8496; 1.36^4 = (1.8496)^2 ≈ 3.419.

Which is close to 3.43656.

So, 1.36 * (1e3.5) )= 1.36 * 3.162e3 ≈ 4.317e3 K.

So T_spot ≈ 4317 K.

Hmm, so the spots are at around 4300 K.

But wait, the problem says that when the surface isn't covered, Teff is 6000 K, when 40% is covered, Teff is 5500 K. So now, when the star has spots, 40% of the surface is at ~4300 K, and the rest at 6000 K. So how does that affect the observed ratio N1/N2.

Wait, the ratio N1/N2 is in the photosphere. So when the star has spots, the photosphere consists of regions at 6000 K and 4300 K.

But the ratio N1/N2 is a function of temperature. So the observed ratio would be a combination of the two regions. But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when spots are present, the average ratio is lower than without spots.

Wait, but the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when there are spots, the ratio N1/N2 is lower than when there are no spots. So when spots are present, the effective temperature is lower, but the ratio is lower because of the lower T.

Wait, but the ratio N1/N2 is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Because N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So as T increases, the exponent increases, making the ratio N1/N2 larger. So if T decreases, the exponent decreases, leading to a smaller ratio.

Wait, let me think about it. The energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1 is positive. So for a higher T, (ΔE)/(k T) is smaller. So the exponential factor is larger. So N1/N2 increases with T.

So when T decreases, N1/N2 decreases. So when the star has spots, the average T is lower, so the ratio is lower.

But here's the thing. The spots are cooler, but the rest of the photosphere is still at 6000 K. So the observed ratio would be a combination of the two regions, weighted by their areas.

Wait, but in the problem, the question is about the ratio in the stellar photosphere when the star has spots. So perhaps the overall ratio is a flux-weighted average of the two regions, since the spots and unspotted regions contribute differently to the total flux.

Wait, but the emitted flux F from a region is proportional to its temperature to the fourth power. So when considering the overall spectrum, the contributions from different regions are weighted by their area and their emission.

But the problem is about the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels. Hmm.

Wait, no, perhaps the ratio is determined by the temperature of the region. So in regions where T is lower, the ratio N1/N2 is lower. So when the star has spots, the ratio would be a function of the average T of the photosphere. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the average T of the photosphere as 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K when they're not. Thus, we can compute the ratio N1/N2 at 6000 K and at 5500 K, and then find the factor by which the ratio changes.

Wait, but that would ignore the fact that when spots are present, 60% of the surface is at 6000 K and 40% is at ~4300 K. But perhaps for the sake of simplifying the problem, we can model the average T as 5500 K when spots are present.

So, let's proceed under that assumption.

So the ratio N1/N2 is given by (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ).

But since the ratio is only dependent on the transition's energy and the temperature, the factor by which the ratio changes is the ratio of the values at 6000 K and 5500 K.

So the factor is (N1/N2)_6000K / (N1/N2)_5500K.

But wait, the ratio is when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So the factor would be (N1/N2)_6000K divided by (N1/N2)_5500K.

So the factor is [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k*6000)) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k*5500)) ) ].

The g1/g2 terms cancel out, so the factor is exp( ΔE/(k) [1/(6000) - 1/(5500)] )

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) [ (5500 -6000) / (6000*5500) ] )

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) [ (-500) / (33,000,000) ] )

= exp( -ΔE/(k) * (500)/(33e6) )

Hmm, but we can compute ΔE from the wavelength.

ΔE = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant: 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light: 3e8 m/s.

λ is 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (1448e-10 )

Calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So ΔE = (1.9878e-25 ) / (1.448e-7 ) = approx (1.9878 /1.448) * 1e-18 J.

1.9878 / 1.448 ≈ 1.373.

So ΔE ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

Now, Boltzmann's constant k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/(k) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ (1.373/1.38) * 1e5 K ≈ 0.995 * 1e5 ≈ 99500 K.

So approximately 1e5 K.

So the exponent becomes - (1e5 K) * (500)/(33e6 ) )

Wait, 500/(33e6) = 5e2/(3.3e7) = (5/3.3) * 1e-5 ≈ 1.515e-5.

So:

exponent = - (1e5) * 1.515e-5 = - (1e5 * 1.515e-5 ) = -1.515.

So the factor is exp(-1.515) ≈ e^-1.515 ≈ 0.22.

Wait, what's e^-1.515? e^1.5 is about 4.48, so e^-1.5 is about 0.223. So approx 0.22.

But wait, the factor is (N1/N2)_6000 / (N1/N2)_5500 = exp(1.515) ≈ 4.54.

Wait, because the exponent in the factor is positive because [1/(6000) - 1/(5500)] is negative. Wait, let's recompute the exponent.

Wait, let's re-express the exponent:

(ΔE/k) [1/6000 - 1/5500] = (1e5 K) * [ (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) ) ]

= (1e5) * [ (-500) / (33e6) ) ]

= (1e5) * (-500/33e6 )

= (1e5) * (-5e2 / 3.3e7 )

= (1e5) * (-5/(3.3e5) )

= (1e5) * (-5/(3.3e5)) ) = (1e5) * (-5/(3.3e5)) )

= (1e5) * (- (5/3.3e5) )

= (1e5) * (- (5/(3.3e5)) )

= (1e5) * (- 5/(3.3e5) )

= (-5e5) / (3.3e5) ) = -5/(3.3) ≈ -1.515.

So exponent is -1.515.

So the factor is exp(-1.515) ≈ 0.22.

Alternatively, exp(1.515) is about 4.54.

So the factor (N1/N2)_6000 / (N1/N2)_5500 = exp( (ΔE/k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) ) = exp( ( -1.515 )) ≈ 0.22.

But wait, the question is phrased as the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So the factor is (no spots) / (spots) = 0.22.

Wait, but 0.22 is not one of the options. The options are A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9.

Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculations.

Wait, let's check the exponent again.

Wait, the ratio (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_spots = exp( (ΔE/(k)) [1/(6000) - 1/(5500)] )

Which is exp( (ΔE/(k)) [ (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) ] )

Which is exp( (ΔE/(k)) * (-500)/(33,000,000) ) )

= exp( (ΔE/(k)) * (-5e2)/(3.3e7) ) )

= exp( (ΔE/(k)) * (-5/(3.3e5) ) )

We have ΔE/k ≈ 1e5 K.

So,

= exp( (1e5) * (-5/(3.3e5) ) )

= exp( (-5e5) / (3.3e5) )

= exp( -5/3.3 ) ≈ exp(-1.515) ≈ 0.22.

Hmm. So the factor is 0.22. So when there are no spots, the ratio is 0.22 times when there are spots. So the ratio decreases.

But the question is, what is the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So the factor is (no spots) / (spots) = 0.22. So the ratio is lower when there are spots, which matches the problem statement.

But the options don't include 0.22. The options are:

A) ~1.1

B) ~7.8

C) ~4.5

D) ~2.9

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the exponent. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, the transition's wavelength is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 m.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

So ΔE = hc / λ.

Plugging in the numbers:

ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / 1.448e-7 = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7.

Calculate 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-18 = approx 1.373e-18 J.

Then ΔE/k = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ (1.373/1.38) * 1e5 ≈ 0.995 *1e5 ≈ 99500 K ≈ 1e5 K.

So that part is correct.

Then, the exponent is (ΔE/k) * (1/6000 -1/5500) = 1e5 * [ (5500-6000)/(6000*5500) ) ] = 1e5 * (-500)/(33e6) )= 1e5 * (-5e2)/(3.3e7) ) = 1e5 * (-5/(3.3e5)) )= -5e5/(3.3e5) )= -5/(3.3) ≈ -1.515.

So exp(-1.515) ≈ 0.22.

But the options don't have 0.22; perhaps I got the ratio reversed.

Wait, no. The ratio is (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_spots = 0.22.

So when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is 0.22 times lower than when it has spots. So the ratio decreases by a factor of 0.22, but that's not matching any options.

But wait, another possibility is that I should have considered the reciprocal.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is N2/N1 instead of N1/N2. Let me think about that.

The problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when spots are present, the ratio is lower.

If the ratio is N1/N2, then with spots, it's lower. So when no spots, it's higher.

But perhaps I got the ratio backwards.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation says N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

If the energy levels are such that E2 > E1, then when T increases, N2/N1 increases.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. So N1/N2 is lower. That implies that N2/N1 is higher.

Wait, let me think again.

N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T) )

If T decreases, then the exponential term becomes smaller. So N1/N2 decreases.

So when T is lower (with spots), N1/N2 is lower. So when the star has spots, N1/N2 is lower, which is what the problem states.

So the factor (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_spots = exp( (ΔE/k) [1/6000 - 1/5500] ) = 0.22.

But that's not matching any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's re-calculate the exponent.

Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (1/6000 - 1/5500).

(1/6000) is approximately 0.000166667.

(1/5500) is approximately 0.000181818.

So (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (0.000166667 - 0.000181818) = -0.000015151.

So, the exponent is (ΔE/k ) * (-0.000015151 ).

Wait, but with ΔE/k ≈ 1e5 K,

So exponent = 1e5 K * (-0.000015151 ) = -1.5151.

Which brings us back to the same calculation.

Hmm. So the factor is 0.22, but that's not in the options. So perhaps I should compute the reciprocal.

Wait, perhaps the factor is (N1/N2)_spots / (N1/N2)_no_spots = 0.22.

Which would mean that the ratio when no spots is 1/0.22 ≈4.54 times higher than when spots are present.

So the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does is approximately 4.54.

Ah! So the factor is (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_spots = 1/0.22 ≈4.54.

Wait, but earlier I thought that's what I did. No, I think I got confused between the ratio.

Wait, the ratio (N1/N2) is higher when T is higher. So when the star has no spots (T=6000 K), (N1/N2) is higher than when spots are present (T=5500 K).

So the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does is (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_spots = 4.54.

Which is approximately option C, which is ~4.5.


The problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, \( N_1/N_2 \), changes when a star transitions from having no spots (effective temperature \( T = 6000 \, \text{K} \)) to having 40% of its surface covered by spots (effective temperature \( T = 5500 \, \text{K} \)). The ratio \( N_1/N_2 \) is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{N_1}{N_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the two levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The transition corresponds to a wavelength \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \), so the energy difference is calculated as:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light). Substituting \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \), we find:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

The ratio \( N_1/N_2 \) depends on the exponential term \( \exp(\Delta E / kT) \). Boltzmann's constant is \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), so:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99500 \, \text{K}.
\]

The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{N_1}{N_2}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{N_1}{N_2}\right)_{\text{spots}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting \( T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} = \frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500} = -0.00001515.
\]

Thus, the exponent becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}}\right) = (99500)(-0.00001515) \approx -1.515.
\]

The factor is then:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(-1.515) \approx 0.22.
\]

However, the problem asks for the factor by which the ratio increases when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. This is the reciprocal:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{1}{0.22} \approx 4.54.
\]

This matches option C, which is approximately \( 4.5 \).
