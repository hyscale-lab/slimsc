Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

Astronomers are looking at two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. They found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. The radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The question is about the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. So the first thing I remember is that for black bodies, the peak wavelength emitted (the wavelength where they appear brightest) is given by Wien's Law. Wien's Law says lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K) and T is the temperature in Kelvin. So if both stars have the same lambda_max, that means their temperatures must be the same. Because lambda_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait. Are they emitting at the same peak wavelength in their own rest frames, or observed? Oh, the question says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. Hmm, but the radial velocities are given. So I think this refers to the observed wavelength. Because if the stars are moving, their emission would be Doppler shifted.

Oh wait, the problem statement says that the astronomers found the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest to be the same. So if Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s, its light is Doppler shifted. So their rest frame lambda_max could be different, but their observed lambda_max is the same.

Wait, no. Let me think. The problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed wavelengths are same. So the Doppler shifting due to their velocities must be taken into account.

So for Star_1, radial velocity is zero. So its observed lambda_max is the same as its rest frame lambda_max. For Star_2, radial velocity is 700 km/s. Assuming it's moving away (since the velocity is positive in radial direction; not sure if it's positive or negative, but usually radial velocity positive implies moving away, leading to redshift). So the observed wavelength would be longer (redshifted) if it's moving away.

Wait, but the problem states that the observed lambda_max is the same for both stars. So for Star_2, its rest frame lambda_max must be such that when shifted by its velocity, it matches Star_1's observed lambda_max.

Wait, no. Because the problem says the wavelengths they appeared brightest are the same. So if Star_2 is moving, its observed lambda_max is shifted, but it's equal to Star_1's observed lambda_max. So to get the same observed lambda_max, the rest frame lambda_max of Star_2 must be different from that of Star_1. Because Star_1 isn't moving, so its observed lambda_max is the same as its rest frame.

So let me model this.

Let me denote:

For Star_1:

v1 = 0 km/s.

So observed lambda_max1 = rest lambda_max1.

For Star_2:

v2 = 700 km/s.

Assuming it's moving away, so the observed lambda_max is lambda_max2_obs = lambda_max2_rest * (1 + v2/c), where v2 is in terms of c. But first, let's compute the Doppler shift.

Wait, the Doppler effect for wavelength is given by:

lambda_observed = lambda_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

Wait, no, actually, the relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

lambda_observed = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + beta) / (1 - beta) ), where beta = v/c.

But beta is small (since 700 km/s is about 0.00233c), so perhaps a non-relativistic approximation is better.

Wait, non-relativistic Doppler shift for radial velocity is approximately:

lambda_observed ≈ lambda_rest * (1 + v/c), when v is much less than c (v << c). Since 700 km/s is 0.007 million meters per second, while c is about 3e5 km/s. So 700 / 3e5 is about 0.00233, so a small fraction. So the approximation should be acceptable.

So for Star_2, the observed lambda_max is lambda2_obs = lambda2_rest * (1 + v2/c), where v2 is 700 km/s.

But according to the problem statement, lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs.

Because both have the same observed lambda_max.

So:

lambda1_rest = lambda2_rest * (1 + v2/c )

Because lambda1_obs = lambda1_rest, since v1 is zero.

So from this, we can find the ratio of their rest frame lambda_maxes.

But since both stars are black bodies, their rest frame lambda_max is determined by their temperatures.

Using Wien's Law: lambda_max = b / T.

So,

lambda1_rest = b / T1,

lambda2_rest = b / T2.

Putting these into the equation:

lambda1_rest = lambda2_rest * (1 + v2/c )

=> (b / T1) = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c )

The b cancels:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c )

Rearranging,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c )

Wait, wait, let me solve that correctly.

Wait, 1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c )

=> (1/T1) = (1 + v2/c ) / T2

=> T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c )

Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check.

Wait, 1/T1 = (1 + v2/c ) * (1/T2 )

=> T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c )

Yes, that's correct.

So the temperature of Star_2 is higher than Star_1 by a factor of (1 + v2/c ).

Wait, but wait, v is 700 km/s. Let me compute v/c:

v2 = 700 km/s.

c ≈ 3e5 km/s.

So v2/c ≈ 700 / 3e5 ≈ 0.002333.

So (1 + v2/c ) ≈ 1.002333.

So T2 = T1 * 1.002333.

So approximately, T2 is 0.233% higher than T1.

Hmm. So that's a small temperature difference.

Now, knowing the temperatures, we can compute the luminosity.

Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

L = 4π R^2 σ T^4.

Since 4π σ is a constant, the ratio L1/L2 would be (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4).

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2.

So R1/R2 = 1.5.

So R1^2 = (1.5)^2 R2^2 = 2.25 R2^2.

So R1^2 = 2.25 R2^2.

So the ratio becomes (2.25 R2^2 * T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4 )

The R^2 cancels, so it's 2.25 * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * (T1 / T2 )^4.

But from earlier, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c ) ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

So T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c ) ≈ 1 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.99768.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.99768)^4.

Let me compute that.

0.99768^2 is approximately (1 - 0.00232)^2 ≈ 1 - 2 * 0.00232 + (0.00232)^2 ≈ ~0.99536.

So squared again: (0.99536)^2 ≈ ~0.99072.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to compute ln(0.99768) and then exponentiate.

But for approximation, it's about 0.99072.

Wait, wait, let me compute 0.99768^4 more accurately.

Compute 0.99768^2 first.

0.99768 * 0.99768:

Let me compute 10000 * 0.99768 = 9976.8.

So 9976.8^2 = (10000 - 23.2)^2 = 10000² - 2*10000*23.2 + 23.2².

Wait, but that's in terms of 10000 units.

Wait, perhaps a better way: 0.99768 is approximately 0.9977.

So 0.9977^2 = (1 - 0.0023)^2 = 1 - 2*0.0023 + 0.0023^2 ≈ 1 - 0.0046 + 0.00000529 = 0.99540529.

Then 0.9977^4 = (0.995405)^2.

0.995405 squared: 0.99081.

So approximately 0.9908.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9908.

So now, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9908 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9908.

Compute 2.25 * 0.9908.

Well, 2.25 * 0.99 is 2.2275, and 2.25 * 0.0008 is 0.0018.

So total is approximately 2.2275 + 0.0018 = 2.2293.

So about 2.229.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the approximation is a bit rough. Maybe I should compute (1/(1.002333))^4 more accurately.

Alternatively, since (1 + x) is small, we can use a Taylor expansion.

Let me let x = v2/c = 0.002333.

So (1 + x) is 1.002333.

So 1 / (1+x) ≈ 1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + ... for small x.

So (1/(1+x))^4 ≈ (1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 -4x + 6x² -4x^3 + x^4.

x is 0.002333.

So 4x = 0.009332.

6x² = 6 * (0.002333)^2 ≈ 6 * 0.00000544 ≈ 0.00003264.

4x^3 is 4*(0.002333)^3 ≈ 4*(1.28e-8) ≈ 5.12e-8, which is negligible.

x^4 is even smaller.

So,

(1/(1+x))^4 ≈ 1 - 4x + 6x² ≈ 1 -0.009332 + 0.00003264 ≈ 0.99070064.

Which is consistent with the earlier calculation of ~0.9907.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907.

Compute 2.25 * 0.9907:

2 * 0.9907 = 1.9814.

0.25 * 0.9907 = 0.247675.

Adding together: 1.9814 + 0.247675 ≈ 2.229075.

So approximately 2.229.

Looking at the options:

Options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

So 2.229 is closest to option D, which is ~2.23.

Wait, but wait. I'm making an assumption here. What if the Doppler shift formula was applied in the opposite way? Let me think.

Wait, when a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted). So Star_2 has a higher observed wavelength, but the problem states that both have the same observed lambda_max. So Star_2's rest frame lambda_max must be shorter than Star_1's. Because when you redshift it, it becomes the same as Star_1's.

Wait, no, because earlier I had the equation:

lambda1_rest = lambda2_rest * (1 + v2/c )

Because when you have a source moving away, the observed lambda is longer than the rest frame lambda. So for Star_2, its rest frame lambda is smaller than the observed lambda. So if Star_2's observed lambda is same as Star_1's, which is same as its rest frame lambda, then the rest frame lambda of Star_2 must be smaller, because when you redshift it, it becomes equal to Star_1's.

Wait, no, let me think again.

If Star_2 is moving away, the observed lambda is higher than the rest frame lambda.

So for Star_2, observed lambda = lambda2_rest * (1 + v2/c )

Star_1's lambda1_obs = lambda1_rest.

Given that lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs,

lambda1_rest = lambda2_rest * (1 + v2/c )

So lambda2_rest = lambda1_rest / (1 + v2/c )

Which means that lambda2_rest is smaller than lambda1_rest.

Thus, using Wien's law, since lambda_max = b / T, a smaller lambda_max implies a higher temperature.

So T2 = b / lambda2_rest = b / (lambda1_rest / (1 + v2/c )) ) = T1 * (1 + v2/c )

So T2 is higher than T1 by a factor of (1 + v2/c ), as before.

Which brings us back to the same calculation.

So the calculations are correct, and the ratio L1/L2 is approximately 2.229, which is close to option D, ~2.23.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let's check the calculation again.

Wait, 700 km/s is the radial velocity of Star_2. Radial velocity can be towards or away from us. If it's moving towards us, the observed lambda_max would be blue-shifted, meaning smaller than rest frame. But in that case, Star_1's observed lambda_max is same as Star_2's observed, which would require Star_2's rest frame to be even smaller, making T2 higher. But that would make L1/L2 even larger. Or if it's moving away, as considered earlier, which gives us the smaller ratio.

Wait, the problem states that Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s. Radial velocity is often given as a positive number when moving away. So I think the initial approach is correct.

So the calculations seem correct. Thus, the answer should be around 2.23, which is option D.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we analyze the problem using the given data and relevant physical laws.

### Key Information and Assumptions:
1. **Radius and Mass Ratios**:  
   - Radius of Star_1: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \)  
   - Mass of Star_1: \( M_1 = 1.5 M_2 \)  
   - These ratios are not directly relevant to the luminosity calculation but are provided for context.

2. **Observed Wavelengths**:  
   - The observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same (\( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \)).  
   - Star_1 has no radial velocity (\( v_1 = 0 \)), so \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}} \).  
   - Star_2 has a radial velocity of \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), which causes its observed wavelength to be redshifted (\( \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot (1 + v_2/c) \)).

3. **Wien's Law**:  
   - The peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature:  
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{rest}} = \frac{b}{T}, \quad \text{where } b \text{ is Wien's displacement constant}.
     \]
   - Since \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \), it follows that:  
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot (1 + v_2/c).
     \]
   - Using Wien's law, \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} \propto 1/T \), we find:  
     \[
     T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + v_2/c).
     \]

4. **Luminosity Calculation**:  
   - The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:  
     \[
     L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4.
     \]
   - The ratio of luminosities is:  
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(R_1^2 T_1^4)}{(R_2^2 T_2^4)}.
     \]
   - Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + v_2/c) \):  
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(1.5)^2}{(1 + v_2/c)^4}.
     \]

### Numerical Calculation:
1. **Temperature Ratio**:  
   - \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \):  
     \[
     \frac{v_2}{c} \approx 0.002333.
     \]
   - \( 1 + v_2/c \approx 1.002333 \).  
   - \( T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.002333 \), so:  
     \[
     \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1.002333}.
     \]
   - Using a Taylor expansion for small \( x \), \( (1 + x)^{-1} \approx 1 - x + x^2 - \dots \):  
     \[
     \frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx 0.99768.
     \]
   - Raising this to the fourth power:  
     \[
     \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \approx 0.9907.
     \]

2. **Luminosity Ratio**:  
   - Substituting \( R_1/R_2 = 1.5 \) and \( (T_1/T_2)^4 \approx 0.9907 \):  
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(1.5)^2}{1} \cdot 0.9907 = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.229.
     \]

### Final Answer:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2. This corresponds to **Option D**.

**Answer: D**
