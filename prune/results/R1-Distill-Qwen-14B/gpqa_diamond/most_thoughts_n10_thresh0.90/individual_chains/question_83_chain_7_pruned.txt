Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with titrations, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so it should form a salt when they react. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I need to calculate both values.

First, let me outline what I know. The initial solution is 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20.00 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³. Oh wait, because 20 + 20 is 40. So the concentration of acetic acid will change upon dilution.

Wait, the initial concentration is 0.05 M. When we dilute it by half (since volume doubles), the new concentration should be 0.025 M, right? Because M1V1 = M2V2. So 0.05 M * 20 cm³ = M2 * 40 cm³ → M2 = 0.025 M.

So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M. Then, we titrate it with 0.1 M NaOH. So the first part is finding the pH at 25% titration. The second part is the pH at equivalence point.

Let me tackle the 25% titration first. At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So I need to find out how much moles of acetic acid are present initially, and then figure out how much NaOH is added at 25% titration.

Wait, the total volume of the acetic acid after dilution is 40 cm³. So moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) initially is concentration times volume in liters. So 0.025 M * 0.04 L =
