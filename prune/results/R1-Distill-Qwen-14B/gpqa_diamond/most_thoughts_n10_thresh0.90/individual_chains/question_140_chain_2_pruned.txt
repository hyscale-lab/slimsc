Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question talks about Substance X reacting with liquid Y, releasing gas W, and forming a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, whose melting point is close to 277 K. I know that 277 K is around 4 degrees Celsius because water freezes at 273 K. So maybe B is something that's a solid at that temperature, like maybe ice? But wait, ice melts at 273 K, so 277 K is just a bit higher, so maybe B is a different substance. Hmm.

Gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecule must be something like H2O, where each molecule has 8 protons and 8 neutrons for oxygen, but wait, H2O's molecule would have H (1 proton, 0 neutrons each) and O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So for each molecule, the total protons are 1*2 + 8 = 10, and neutrons are 0*2 +8=8. That doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe it's a gas like CO2. Carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, oxygen has 8 each. So CO2 would have 6+8=14 protons and 6+8=14 neutrons. Oh, that fits! Because each molecule, CO2, has 14 protons and 14 neutrons in total. So gas W is CO2.

So when X reacts with Y, CO2 is released. That suggests a reaction that produces carbon dioxide. What reactions produce CO2? Maybe a carbonate reacting with an acid, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe a reaction between a hydrocarbon and something else, but I'm not certain.

The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. So maybe G is a carbonate that when heated gives B and CO2. For example, heating calcium carbonate gives CaO and CO2. So if G were a carbonate, B would be the metal oxide. Then, B's melting point is around 277 K. Wait, CaO has a high melting point, way higher than 277 K. Hmm, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe B is a metal, not an oxide. Wait, if G is a hydroxide, maybe when heated, it decomposes into metal oxide and water. No, because that wouldn't release CO2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the other parts of the question. Substance X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X has an isotope with a heavier mass. So maybe it's something like Cl or something else with common isotopes. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Hmm, common reagents in organic chemistry... maybe something like HCl, but that's a gas. Or maybe NaOH? Or perhaps something like THF (tetrahydrofuran) but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, the reaction of a certain keto acid with X gives a product that contains 2 oxygen atoms. Keto acid is something like acetic acid (CH3COOH), which is a keto acid. If X reacts with a keto acid, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution or something else. But the product has two oxygen atoms. Wait, maybe X is something like H2O? No, because a keto acid reacting with water wouldn't give much. Or perhaps X is something else.

Wait, another approach: think about the isotopes. X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So the elements in X have at least two isotopes, with the heavier one being present. So perhaps X is something like Cl- or maybe a compound with Cl, which has isotopes like Cl-35 and Cl-37.

Wait, and the product of the reaction with a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms. Keto acid has a structure like RCOOH. If X is something like H2O (but that's probably not right), or perhaps a base. Wait, maybe X is an acid, but it's used in organic reactions. Hmm.

Let me go back to the reaction. X reacts with Y to produce CO2 and G. If CO2 is released, perhaps Y is a carbonate and X is an acid. For example, H2SO4 (sulfuric acid) reacting with a carbonate would produce CO2, but then X would be H2SO4, but I'm not sure if that fits.

Alternatively, maybe X is a metal, and Y is an acid. But then the reaction would produce H2 gas, not CO2. So that's probably not it.

Wait, another thought: maybe Y is a carbonate, and X is an acid. So X could be a strong acid like HCl or H2SO4. Wait, but in that case, X would be the acid. So when X (acid) reacts with carbonate Y, it produces CO2, water, and a salt.

So if X is HCl, then when it reacts with Na2CO3 (Y), it would produce CO2, H2O, and NaCl. The precipitate G could be NaCl, but NaCl is soluble. Hmm, maybe Y is a different carbonate, like CaCO3. Then X, HCl, would react to produce CO2, water, and CaCl2. But CaCl2 is soluble, so G wouldn't precipitate. Wait, but if Y is a carbonate of a metal that gives an insoluble salt with HCl? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a bicarbonate. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a base. For instance, if X is a hydroxide and Y is an acid, but that would produce water and a salt, but not CO2. Unless the acid is carbonic acid, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution that when reacted with X produces CO2. Maybe Y is a bicarbonate, like KHCO3, and X is an acid. Then the reaction would produce CO2, water, and the corresponding salt.

But then, what's the precipitate G? If X is an acid, and Y is NaHCO3, the reaction would produce CO2, H2O, and NaCl, which is soluble. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a carbonate of a group 1 metal, which when reacted with an acid gives a salt that's soluble. Wait, but I'm stuck on the precipitate part.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal. When a metal reacts with an acid, you get hydrogen gas. But the problem says gas W is CO2, so that can't be hydrogen. So maybe metal is not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like sodium bicarbonate, but that's Y perhaps.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck so maybe I should think about the other clues.

The melting point of B is about 277 K. Let me think of substances that melt near that temperature. Water freezes at 273 K, so 277 K is just a bit higher. Maybe B is something else. Alternatively, maybe B is a solid at that temperature, like maybe a metal or an oxide. Or perhaps it's a different form of water, like ice. Wait, but ice melts at 273 K, so 277 K is slightly above. So if B is a solid at 277 K, perhaps it's a solid with a low melting point. Maybe something like paraffin or another organic compound? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a chloride. For example, if G is a hydroxide that when heated gives a metal chloride and water, but that wouldn't involve CO2. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, let's think about the precipitate. When X reacts with Y, a precipitate forms, which upon heating releases B. So maybe G is a carbonate, which when heated decomposes into a metal oxide and CO2. So if G is a carbonate, and when heated, it produces B (the metal oxide) and CO2. The metal oxide (B) has a melting point around 277 K. So what metal oxides have a melting point near 277 K?

Wait, that seems low. Most metal oxides have high melting points. For example, Na2O has a melting point around 1380 °C (which is way higher than 277 K, which is about 4°C). So maybe B isn't a metal oxide. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a metal itself. If when G is heated, it releases B, which is a metal. But what metal would have a melting point near 277 K (4°C)? Let me think. Mercury has a melting point of about -39°C, and it's a liquid at room temperature. But 277 K is 4°C. Maybe something like cadmium? Wait, cadmium's melting point is around 321 K (48°C). Hmm, that's higher than 277 K. What about something like gallium? No, gallium's melting point is about 30°C. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, 277 K is 4°C. So the melting point is near that. So what substances are solids near 4°C? Well, water is a solid (ice) at 273 K and melts at 273 K. So if B is ice, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, maybe B is a solid at 277 K but doesn't necessarily melt there. Maybe it's a solid that's stable at that temperature. Not sure.

Wait, another angle: the product of a keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms. Keto acid is something like RCOOH. If X adds to it, the product could have 2 oxygen atoms. Maybe X is something like H2O, but that wouldn't change the number of oxygen atoms. Hmm, perhaps X is something that when added to the keto acid, combines in a way to add an oxygen or remove some. Alternatively, maybe X is a base that deprotonates the keto acid, but that wouldn't add oxygen atoms.

Wait, perhaps X is a halogen? Like Cl2 or something. If a keto acid reacts with Cl2, maybe some substitution occurs. For example, in the presence of H2O, Cl2 could add to the keto acid. But I'm not sure how that would result in a product with two oxygen atoms. Alternatively, maybe X is something like HCl, which could protonate the keto acid, but again, not sure.

Wait, let me think about the problem again. The product of the reaction between a keto acid and X contains two atoms of oxygen. The keto acid itself has two oxygen atoms in the carboxylic group (like RCOOH has two O's in COOH). So if X reacts with the keto acid and the product has two O's, perhaps X doesn't add any O's or removes some. Or maybe the reaction is something like esterification, where another O is added, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe X is a reducing agent. Like, it reduces the keto acid. For example, a keto acid might be reduced to an alcohol, which has one O less. Wait, RCOOH becomes RCH2OH. That would change the number of O's. Wait, RCOOH has two O's (in COOH: one in C=O, two in -OH?), no, wait, the structure is R-C(=O)-OH, so that's two O's in the COOH group. If it's reduced to R-CH2-OH, the product would have one O (in the -OH). But the question states that the product has two O's. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps X is something else. If the product has two O's, maybe X adds another O. But that's a bit unclear.

Let me try to think about the isotopes again. X has a heavier isotope. So perhaps X is chlorine, which has Cl-35 and Cl-37. Or maybe it's something like sulfur, which has multiple isotopes. But the problem says X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. So perhaps X is something like THF (tetrahydrofuran), but that doesn't have isotopes. Or maybe it's a solvent like DCM (dichloromethane), but again, not sure.

Alternatively, X might be something like NaOH. Sodium hydroxide is used in many organic reactions. But when NaOH reacts with a carbonate, it would produce CO2. Wait, but NaOH is a strong base. So if Y is a carbonate, like Na2CO3, then X (NaOH) reacting with Y (Na2CO3) would not produce a precipitate because NaCO3 is soluble. Hmm.

Wait, maybe Y is a carbonate of a metal that isn't very soluble. For example, CaCO3. If X is NaOH, then NaOH and CaCO3 would react, but CaCO3 is not very soluble, so maybe it would form a precipitate. But NaOH reacts with CaCO3? Wait, no, CaCO3 is not very reactive with NaOH unless it's heated. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a bicarbonate. Like NaHCO3. Then X, which is something else, reacts with it. So for example, X could be HCl. Then, HCl reacting with NaHCO3 would produce CO2, H2O, and NaCl. But NaCl is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a base, and Y is a salt. Maybe Y is a sulfide or something else. Not sure.

Another thought: maybe Y is a solution of sodium carbonate, and X is a strong acid like H2SO4. Then the reaction produces CO2, water, and Na2SO4. But Na2SO4 is soluble, so no precipitate. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe X is a metal. Suppose X is magnesium, Y is a solution of a carbonate. Mg reacts with Na2CO3 in water. Mg would displace CO3^2- from the solution, producing MgCO3, which is a precipitate. Then, when heated, MgCO3 decomposes into MgO and CO2. So G is MgCO3, which upon heating gives MgO (B) and CO2. The melting point of MgO is around 2800°C, which is way higher than 277 K, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the precipitate is something like CaCO3. So if X is Ca, and Y is Na2CO3, then CaCO3 precipitates. Heating CaCO3 gives CaO and CO2. CaO's melting point is about 2600°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe B is not a metal oxide but something else. Let's think about other possibilities. Suppose B is a non-metal oxide. For example, CO2 is a gas, but that's the gas emitted. Maybe B is something like sulfur. But sulfur's melting point is around 315 K (42°C), which is a bit higher than 277 K. Hmm.

Wait, 277 K is 4°C. So perhaps B is a solid that's stable at 4°C. Maybe it's a solid organic compound with a low melting point. For example, maybe something like glycerol? No, glycerol's melting point is around 18°C. Or maybe something like camphor, which has a higher melting point. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is an element that's a solid at 4°C and has a low melting point. For example, maybe mercury is a liquid at 0°C, so maybe another metal. Or perhaps it's not a metal at all.

Wait, maybe B is a solid that's formed when G is heated. So if G is a carbonate, heating it gives B (the metal oxide) and CO2. So metal oxide with a melting point near 277 K. But I can't think of any metal oxides with such a low melting point. So perhaps my initial assumption that G is a carbonate is wrong.

Wait, let's think of another possibility. Maybe G is hydroxide. For example, if X is a metal, Y is an acid. Then the reaction would produce a salt and water. If the salt is insoluble, it would precipitate as a hydroxide. But heating a hydroxide would produce an oxide and water. So for example, if G is Cu(OH)2, heating it gives CuO and water. But CuO has a high melting point. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe G is a sulfide. But then heating wouldn't produce CO2.

Wait, perhaps the reaction between X and Y produces a carbonate which upon heating decomposes into CO2 and a metal oxide. But the problem is the melting point of the oxide is around 277 K.

This is getting a bit too tricky. Maybe I should think about the options given in the question. The options are A) 35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

The question is about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in Substance X. So if X is made of elements with atomic masses, say, 12 and 14, the sum would be
