Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the density matrix and its geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The question gives the density matrix ρ as (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled. Pure states are density matrices with trace 1 and rank 1, but this looks like it's a mixed state because it's an average of two projectors.

Wait, so |0⟩⟨0| is a projector onto the state |0⟩, and similarly for |1⟩⟨1|. So when you add them together and multiply by 1/2, each term has a coefficient of 1/2. That makes sense because each state is equally likely, right? So this ρ is actually a classical mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩, each with 50% probability. So it's a completely mixed state for a single qubit.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I'm not entirely sure what that refers to. Oh, right! I think it's referring to the representation of the density matrix in terms of the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Pure states lie on the surface, and mixed states inside.

The Bloch sphere is parameterized by angles θ and φ, but I'm trying to remember how the density matrix translates into coordinates on the sphere. Oh, wait. The density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector (the Bloch vector) and σ represents the Pauli matrices. So, r would be (x, y, z) components.

So, let me try to express the given ρ in that form. The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me write out |0⟩ and |1⟩ in terms of computational basis. Wait, |0⟩ is (1,0) and |1⟩ is (0,1). The projectors are:

|0⟩⟨0| = [[1,0],[0,0]]
|1⟩⟨1| = [[0,0],[0,1]]

Adding these gives [[1,0],[0,1]] which is the identity matrix. So ρ is (I)/2. So ρ = I/2.

But according to the Bloch representation, ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. So if ρ is I/2, then (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. Subtract I/2 from both sides: r·σ /2 = 0. So r·σ must be zero. That implies that r is the zero vector. Because σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are the Pauli matrices, each being non-zero and their sum with coefficients would only be zero if all coefficients are zero.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0), which is the origin. But wait, on the Bloch sphere, the origin is the completely mixed state (since the density matrix is (I/2) for a single qubit). So if r is (0,0,0), then the density matrix is (I + 0·σ)/2 = I/2, which matches our ρ. So the geometrical position is at the origin.

Looking at the options:

A) (1,1,0): That's a point on the Bloch sphere, but the magnitude would be sqrt(1+1+0)=sqrt(2), which is greater than 1, so it's outside the Bloch sphere. So it's not possible.

B) (0,0,1): That would correspond to the state |0⟩ if it's on the sphere, but wait, the Bloch vector for |0⟩ is (0,0,1), but here r is (0,0,0), which is inside the sphere.

C) (0,0,0): That's the origin, which fits our conclusion.

D) (1,1,1): Sum is sqrt(3), which is bigger than 1. Again, outside the sphere.

So the correct answer should be option C, r=(0,0,0).


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a classical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal probability (50%). It is a completely mixed state for a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch vector \(r\) is related to the density matrix by the formula:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + r \cdot \sigma}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\sigma\) represents the Pauli matrices, and \(r = (x, y, z)\) is the Bloch vector. For the given \(\rho\), we have:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

Comparing this with the general form, it follows that \(r \cdot \sigma = 0\). This implies that the Bloch vector \(r\) must be the zero vector, i.e., \(r = (0, 0, 0)\). The origin on the Bloch sphere corresponds to the completely mixed state, which matches the given \(\rho\).

Analyzing the options:

- **A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** This vector has a magnitude \(\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{2}\), which is greater than 1, placing it outside the Bloch sphere. Not valid.
- **B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\):** This corresponds to the pure state \(|0\rangle\), not the mixed state in question. Not valid.
- **C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\):** This corresponds to the origin on the Bloch sphere, which matches the completely mixed state \(\rho = I/2\). Valid.
- **D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\):** This vector has a magnitude \(\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{3}\), which is greater than 1, placing it outside the Bloch sphere. Not valid.

Thus, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).
