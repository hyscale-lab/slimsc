Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm. Let me try to think through it.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms in energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels. The formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), right? Here, n_i is the number of atoms in the higher energy level, and n_j in the lower.

In this problem, the energy difference between the levels is given as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. So E_i is higher than E_j by this amount. Since star_1 has twice as many excited as star_2, I think n_i1 / n_j1 = 2 * (n_i2 / n_j2), but wait, maybe star_1's ratio is twice star_2's. Or alternatively, maybe for each star, n_i / n_j is the ratio for their respective stars.

Wait, the question states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So for star_1, the ratio n_i1 / n_j1 is twice the ratio for star_2, n_i2 / n_j2. So n_i1/n_j1 = 2 * (n_i2/n_j2).

But wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is twice, meaning that for star_1, the population in the upper level is twice that of star_2's upper level. Hmm, but perhaps I should model each star's ratio on their own.

Wait, let's think more clearly. For each star, the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state (n_i) to the ground state (n_j) is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star_1: n_i1/n_j1 = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ). Similarly, for star_2: n_i2/n_j2 = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). 

Assuming that the statistical weights g_i and g_j are the same for both stars (since they're iron atoms), then the ratio (n_i1/n_j1) / (n_i2/n_j2) equals exp( -(ΔE/(k T1)) + (ΔE/(k T2)) ) ). Because when you take the ratio, the (g_i/g_j) terms cancel out.

But according to the problem, n_i1/n_j1 is twice n_i2/n_j2. So that ratio is 2. So:

exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ) = 2.

Taking the natural logarithm on both sides:

(ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

Wait, let me make sure I got the signs right. Because the exponent is -(ΔE/(k T1)) plus (ΔE/(k T2)), which is ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1). So yes.

Let me write this equation again:

ΔE/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

Hmm, I can rearrange this equation. Let me let's factor the terms:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) * k / ΔE.

But wait, I might need to express T1 and T2 in terms of each other. Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as:

(1/T2) - (1/T1) = [ln(2) * k ] / ΔE.

Wait, but what is the value of ΔE? The problem gives ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. Hmm. Wait, k is Boltzmann's constant, which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, that's interesting because ΔE is exactly k. Because 1.38e-23 J is k (since k = 1.380649e-23 J/K). So ΔE = k * 1 K, assuming ΔE is 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, let me calculate. k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE = k * T, where T is 1 K? Wait, wait, no. Because ΔE is the energy difference, which is ΔE = k * T_avg, where T_avg is some temperature. Wait, but in this case, ΔE is fixed, given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k * 1 K. Because k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So k*T where T=1 K gives that value.

So substituting ΔE = k * 1 K into the equation:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE.

But since ΔE = k, this becomes:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2) * (k) / (k) ) → (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2).

Hmm, wait, that's (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2). So I can rearrange this equation.

Let me write it as (1/T2) - (1/T1) = ln(2). Or, 1/T2 = 1/T1 + ln(2).

But I'm looking for an equation relating T1 and T2. Let me think about how to express this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2). Let's factor this.

Take 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

So, (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Wait, but when I have 1/a - 1/b, it's (b - a)/(a b). So in this case, 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Wait, but wait: (1
