Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about an electron's state and calculating probabilities and the average value of an operator. I'm a bit rusty, but let me think.

The state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Wait, so |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. Oh right, so the spin-z operator's eigenstates are these |up> and |down> states.

First, I think I need to normalize the state |alpha>. Because the coefficients given might not be normalized yet. The state is a linear combination of |up> and |down>, so the normalization condition would be |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1, where a and b are the coefficients.

So let me compute |1+i|^2 and |2 - i|^2. The modulus squared of a complex number a + bi is a^2 + b^2.

For 1+i: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.
For 2 - i: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So the total squared magnitude is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the actual state |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the operator we're looking at has a matrix A where A_ij = hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. What's this operator? Let me think about the basis. Since we're in a two-level system (like spin-up and spin-down), the matrix would be 2x2.

So the operator A would look like:
[ [0, hbar/2],
  [hbar/2, 0] ]
Because for i≠j, the elements are hbar/2, and diagonal elements are zero. So this is an off-diagonal matrix. Wait, that looks familiar. Oh! That's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2.

Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A = (hbar/2) * X.

So the operator A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X operator. So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of X. The eigenstates of X are the |+x> and |-x> states, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

Wait, but the question says, we need to find the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of A. So the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of A, which would be (hbar/2)*1 and (hbar/2)*(-1), so hbar/2 and -hbar/2. But the probabilities depend on the state |alpha> being expressed in the eigenbasis of A.

Hmm, so perhaps I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A. Alternatively, since A is proportional to X, maybe I can compute the expectation value and probabilities using the X matrix.

But perhaps it's easier to proceed by treating the operator A as given and using the basis |up> and |down>.

Alternatively, perhaps I can diagonalize the operator A. Since A is diagonal in the |+x> and |-x> basis, any calculation involving expectation values or probabilities would be straightforward in that basis.

Wait, but the state |alpha> is given in the |up> and |down> basis, which is the computational basis. So I might need to change the basis or find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A.

Let me think. The eigenstates of A (since it's proportional to X) are |+x> and |-x>:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Alternatively, is that correct? Wait, no, perhaps I mixed the signs. Let me recall: the eigenstates of X are the same as the eigenstates of (X/2), so the eigenstates would be |+x> = (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) and similar. Wait, but in our case, the states are |up> and |down>, which are the same as |0> and |1> in some conventions.

So the eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) multiplied by some phase, maybe. Wait, I think the correct expressions are:

|+x> = 1/sqrt(2) (|up> + |down>)
|-x> = 1/sqrt(2) (|up> - |down>)

But sometimes there's an i factor, depending on convention. Hmm, maybe I should double-check. The Pauli X matrix eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which satisfy X|+x> = |+x> and X|−x> = −|−x>.

So writing X as [[0,1],[1,0]], the eigenvectors are [1,1] and [1,-1]. So when normalized, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, I can write |alpha> = c1 |+x> + c2 |-x>.

Let me compute c1 and c2. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the expansion coefficients of |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A, which is the same as X's eigenbasis.

Wait, but another approach is to compute the probabilities. The probability of measuring the eigenvalue +hbar/2 is the square of the amplitude of |+x> in |alpha>, and similarly for -hbar/2.

So let me proceed. Let me compute the components. Let me denote |+x> as (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> as (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

The state |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Let me express |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>:

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>

So substituting the expressions for |+x> and |-x>,

|alpha> = a [ (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) ] + b [ (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) ]

Combine terms:

= [ (a + b)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (a - b)/sqrt(2) ] |down>

But we know that |alpha> is [ (1+i) |up> + (2 -i) |down> ] / sqrt(7). So,

( a + b ) / sqrt(2) = (1 +i ) / sqrt(7)
( a - b ) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i ) / sqrt(7)

Let me write these as two equations:

Equation 1: a + b = (1+i) / sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)
Equation 2: a - b = (2 -i) / sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)

Wait, no, perhaps better to write without scaling. Let me multiply both sides by sqrt(2):

Equation 1: a + b = (1 + i) / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)
Equation 2: a - b = (2 - i) / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me set up variables:

Let me denote (a + b) = (1+i) / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)
and (a - b) = (2 -i) / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to solve for a and b.

Let me add and subtract the two equations.

From the two equations:

a + b = [ (1 + i) ] / sqrt(2) * (1/sqrt(7)) ) ? Wait, no, perhaps it's better to write the equations as:

( a + b ) = ( (1 +i) ) / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me express it properly.

We have:

[ (a + b) ] / sqrt(2) = (1 + i) / sqrt(7)
and 
[ (a - b) ] / sqrt(2) = (2 - i) / sqrt(7)

Multiplying both sides by sqrt(2):

a + b = (1+i) sqrt(2) / sqrt(7)
a - b = (2 -i) sqrt(2) / sqrt(7)

Now, adding the two equations:

2a = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2) / sqrt(7)
Simplify numerator: 1+2 =3, i -i =0, so 3.

So 2a = 3 * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
a = (3/2) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7))

Similarly, subtracting the two equations:

2b = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= [ (1-2) + (i +i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

So b = (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7)).

Now, the coefficients a and b are the amplitudes for |+x> and |-x> respectively.

The probabilities are the square of the modulus of a and b.

So |a|^2 is [ (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) ]^2
= (9 * 2) / (4 *7)
= 18/(28)
= 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, |b|^2 = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7)) ]^2
First compute (-1 +2i)(-1 -2i) = (1 + 4i - 2i +4 )? Wait, no, it's (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5.

So |b|^2 = (5) * (2) / (4 *7)
Wait, let me compute:

[ (sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7))) ]^2 is (2)/(4*7) = 1/(14).

Multiply by | (-1 +2i) |^2, which is 1 +4=5.

So |b|^2 =5 * (1/14) =5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, and 5/14 is approximately 0.3571. Let me check 9 +5=14, so that adds up correctly.

Wait, but wait a second. The probabilities should add up to 1. 9/14 +5/14=14/14=1. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A has probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, which are approximately 64% and 36%. But 9/14 is about 64.28% which is close to 0.64, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357 or 35.7%, which is close to 0.36. Hmm, so perhaps option A is a candidate.

But wait, let me check the average value of the operator A. The average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is proportional to X, and |alpha> is in the z-basis, perhaps it's easier to compute <A>.

A is given as [[0, hbar/2],[hbar/2, 0]].

So <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Let me compute this.

|alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So <alpha| is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ].

So compute <alpha| A |alpha>:

A is the matrix [[0, hbar/2],[hbar/2, 0 ]].

So when we apply A to |alpha>, we get:

A |alpha> = (0*(1+i) + (hbar/2)*(2 -i)) |up> + ( (hbar/2)*(1+i) + 0*(2 -i) ) |down> 
divided by sqrt(7).

Wait, let me do the matrix multiplication properly. So:

Each component of A |alpha> is computed as:

First component (row 1):

(0)(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7)
= (hbar/2)(2 -i) / sqrt(7)

Second component (row 2):

(hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (0)(2 -i)/sqrt(7)
= (hbar/2)(1+i) / sqrt(7)

So |A alpha> is [ (hbar/2)(2 -i) , (hbar/2)(1+i) ]^T / sqrt(7).

Now, compute <alpha| A |alpha>:

Take the conjugate of <alpha| and multiply by A|alpha>.

So <alpha| is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ].

Wait, no, |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7), so <alpha| is the conjugate transpose, so [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ].

So the inner product is:

[ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (hbar/2)(2 -i) / sqrt(7) , (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) ]

So first term: (1-i)(2 -i) * (hbar/2) / (7)
Second term: (2+i)(1+i) * (hbar/2) / (7)

Add them together.

Compute each part:

First part: (1 -i)(2 -i)
= 1*2 + 1*(-i) -i*2 -i*(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i^2
= 2 -3i -1 (since i^2 =-1)
= 1 -3i

Second part: (2 +i)(1 +i)
= 2*1 + 2*i +i*1 +i*i
= 2 + 2i +i +i^2
= 2 +3i -1
= 1 +3i

So summing the two parts:

(1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

So the entire expression is (2) * (hbar/2) /7
= (hbar) /7.

So the average value is hbar/7, which matches option A, which has average hbar/7.

Wait, but option A's probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, which are 9/14 ≈0.642857 and 5/14≈0.35714. So 0.64 is close to 9/14, and 0.36 is close to 5/14.

So option A's average is hbar/7 and probabilities around 0.64 and 0.36, which would make option A a possible answer.

Wait, but let me check other options for the average. Option D's average is 2hbar/sqrt(7), which is larger than hbar, which doesn't fit because the operator's maximum eigenvalue is hbar/2. So average can't be more than hbar/2. Let me see.

Wait, operator A has eigenvalues ±hbar/2. So the average value must be between -hbar/2 and hbar/2. So any option with average larger than that is wrong. Let me check the options.

Option A: hbar/7 ≈0.14 hbar (since hbar/7 ≈ 0.1428 hbar). So that's plausible.

Option B: 3hbar/sqrt(7) ≈ 3*3.14/2.645 ≈ 3.675? Hmm, but sqrt(7) is about 2.645, so 3*2.645 = 7.935, divided by 2.645 is about 3, so 3hbar/sqrt(7) is about 3 hbar/(2.645) ≈ 1.13 hbar, which is higher than hbar/2 (~0.5 hbar), so that can't be correct.

Option C: hbar/sqrt(7) ≈0.37 hbar. Which is plausible, but we calculated hbar/7 which is about 0.14 hbar.

Option D: 2hbar/sqrt(7) ≈0.755 hbar, which is greater than hbar/2, so impossible.

So option A's average is correct, but what about the probabilities?

We have |a|^2 =9/14≈0.6428 and |b|^2=5/14≈0.3571. So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. Option A gives 0.64 and 0.36 as the probabilities, which matches.

Wait, but let me think again. Because I might have made a mistake in the expansion. Let me double-check the calculation of |a|² and |b|².

a was (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)).

So |a|² = (9 * 2) / (4 *7) )= 18/(28)=9/14≈0.6428.

b was [(-1 +2i) * sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7) )

So |b|^2 is [ ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) * 2 ] / (4 *7 )

Which is (1 +4)*2/(28)=5*2/(28)=10/28=5/14≈0.357.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which correspond to approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Thus, the correct answer would have probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, and average hbar/7. Looking back at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and average hbar/7. So that would be the correct option.

Wait, but let me check the other options' averages just to be sure.

Option C's average is hbar/sqrt(7) which is about 0.377 hbar. But our calculation gave hbar/7≈0.142 hbar, which is smaller.

So the correct answer is option A.


The problem involves an electron in the state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator **A**, whose matrix representation is given by Aij = ℏ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Additionally, the average value of **A** must be computed.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α⟩
The state |α⟩ is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. To normalize it, compute the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:
- |1+i|² = 1² + 1² = 2
- |2-i|² = 2² + (-1)² = 4 + 1 = 5

The total squared magnitude is 2 + 5 = 7. Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha⟩ = \frac{(1+i)|\text{up}⟩ + (2-i)|\text{down}⟩}{\sqrt{7}}
\]

### Step 2: Operator **A** and its eigenstates
The operator **A** has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\]
This is proportional to the Pauli X matrix, and its eigenstates are the |+x⟩ and |-x⟩ states:
\[
|+x⟩ = \frac{|\text{up}⟩ + |\text{down}⟩}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x⟩ = \frac{|\text{up}⟩ - |\text{down}⟩}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

### Step 3: Express |α⟩ in the eigenbasis of **A**
To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, express |α⟩ in terms of these states:
\[
|\alpha⟩ = c_1 |+x⟩ + c_2 |-x⟩
\]
Substituting the expressions for |+x⟩ and |-x⟩:
\[
|\alpha⟩ = \frac{c_1 + c_2}{\sqrt{2}} |\text{up}⟩ + \frac{c_1 - c_2}{\sqrt{2}} |\text{down}⟩
\]
Comparing with the normalized |α⟩:
\[
\frac{c_1 + c_2}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}, \quad \frac{c_1 - c_2}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}
\]
Solving these equations:
\[
c_1 + c_2 = \frac{(1+i)\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{7}}, \quad c_1 - c_2 = \frac{(2-i)\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{7}}
\]
Adding and subtracting:
\[
2c_1 = \frac{(1+i) + (2-i)}{\sqrt{7}} \sqrt{2} \implies c_1 = \frac{(3)\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}
\]
\[
2c_2 = \frac{(1+i) - (2-i)}{\sqrt{7}} \sqrt{2} \implies c_2 = \frac{(-1+2i)\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}
\]

### Step 4: Compute probabilities
The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of \(c_1\) and \(c_2\):
\[
|c_1|^2 = \left(\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}\right)^2 = \frac{9 \cdot 2}{4 \cdot 7} = \frac{18}{28} = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64
\]
\[
|c_2|^2 = \left(\frac{(-1+2i)\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}\right)^2 = \frac{5 \cdot 2}{4 \cdot 7} = \frac{10}{28} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36
\]

### Step 5: Compute the average value of **A**
The average value of **A** is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle
\]
Substituting the matrix representation of **A** and the normalized |α⟩:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)}{7} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]
Simplify the numerator:
\[
(1-i)(2-i) = 2 - i - 2i + i^2 = 1 - 3i, \quad (2+i)(1+i) = 2 + i + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 3i
\]
\[
\text{Total} = (1-3i) + (1+3i) = 2
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{2}{7} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}
\]

### Step 6: Match with options
The probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is \(\hbar/7\). This matches **Option A**.

Answer: A
