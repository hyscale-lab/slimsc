Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that interplanar distance is related to the crystal structure and the lattice parameters.

Hmm, the given information includes the interatomic distance, which is 10 Angstroms. Wait, the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter 'a' in a simple cubic structure, but rhombohedral crystals are a bit more complicated because all the edges are the same length, but the angles between them aren't 90 degrees. Oh right, in a rhombohedral structure, the lattice parameter is 'a', and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are equal. Here, they're each 30 degrees.

The question is about the (111) plane. I remember the formula for interplanar distances in crystals. The general formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl)cos\alpha}}}

Wait, wait, no, I think I might be mixing something up. Oh right, in a cubic system, the formula is simpler because the angles are 90 degrees, making cos(alpha) zero for the cross terms. But in a rhombohedral system, the angles aren't 90 degrees, so the formula must account for that.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is more accurately expressed using the metric tensor. Oh right, the general formula for d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(h² + k² + l²)/a² + 2(hk + hl + kl)/(a² cosθ)}}}, where θ is the angle between the axes. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach. For a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice can be considered as a special case of a hexagonal system, but perhaps better to think in terms of the general interplanar distance formula. I think the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos\gamma}}} 

Wait, but wait, since all angles are the same (alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees), that might simplify things. So the formula would be:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) * cos(theta)) )

But wait, in a rhombohedral system, the angles between the axes are equal. So for the (111) plane, h=k=l=1.

Plugging in the values: h=1, k=1, l=1, theta=30 degrees. So cos(theta)=sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So let's calculate the denominator first. The expression inside the square root is:

1² + 1² + 1² + 2*(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) * cos(30)

That simplifies to:

3 + 2*(3) * (sqrt(3)/2 )

Because 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 is 3, and 2*(3) gives 6. Then, 6 * (sqrt(3)/2) is 3*sqrt(3).

So the denominator becomes sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)).

Wait, but let me compute that step by step.

Denominator after expansion:

3 + 2*(3) * cos(30)

Which is:

3 + 6 * (sqrt(3)/2) 

Simplify 6 * sqrt(3)/2 to 3*sqrt(3). So it's 3 + 3*sqrt(3).

So the denominator is sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)).

Wait, let me compute sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)):

Compute 3 + 3*1.73205 ≈ 3 + 5.19615 ≈ 8.19615.

So the denominator is sqrt(8.19615) ≈ 2.863.

So d = a / 2.863.

Given a is 10 Angstroms.

So d ≈ 10 / 2.863 ≈ approximately 3.492 Angstroms? Wait, that can't be right because the options are in the 9-10 range. Did I mess up the formula?

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

Wait, another formula I've seen for d_{hkl} in rhombohedral is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Yes, same as before. But let's check the calculation again.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, when h=k=l=1, the denominator is sqrt(3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2)).

Wait, 6*(sqrt(3)/2) is 3*sqrt(3), so 3 + 3*sqrt(3) = 3*(1 + sqrt(3)) ≈3*(2.73205)=8.19615.

So sqrt(8.19615)= approx 2.863.

So d=10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.492 Angstrom. But the options are all around 9-10, so that can't be right. Hmm, what's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Wait, another possibility: maybe the formula uses a different expression. Let me think.

Wait another approach: perhaps in the rhombohedral structure, the unit cell is a cube but with angles not 90 degrees. Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is for a hexagonal system, and I'm confusing it with rhombohedral.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d^2 = a² (h² + k² + l² + 2 hk cosα + 2 hl cosβ + 2 kl cosγ )^{-1}

Wait, but in rhombohedral, alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees. So the formula would be:

d^2 = a² [ h² +k² +l² + 2 hk cosα + 2 hl cosα + 2 kl cosα ]^{-1}

Which simplifies to:

d^2 = (a²) [ (h² +k² +l²) + 2 cosα (hk + hl + kl) ]^{-1}

So for (111):

d^2 = (10)^2 / [3 + 2 cos(30) * (3)] 

Wait, 3 comes from 1+1+1 in h,k,l. Wait, wait, cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So 3 + 2*(0.8660)*3 = 3 + 6*(0.8660) = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196

So d^2 = 100 / 8.196 ≈12.196 → d ≈ sqrt(12.196) ≈ 3.492 Angstroms. Same as before.

But the options start at ~8.95. So clearly, I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Maybe the formula for d is a/(sqrt(h² +k² + l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )) ? No, that doesn't make sense because when angles are 90 degrees, it should reduce to the cubic case. Let me recheck.

Wait, let me think of the cubic case. If alpha=90 degrees, cos(alpha)=0. So the denominator becomes sqrt( h² +k² +l² ), so d= a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² ). For (111), that would be a/sqrt(3) → for a=10, that's about 5.77 Angstrom. But the options are higher, so perhaps I'm using the wrong formula entirely.

Wait, maybe the formula is for the interplanar distance in a different crystal system. Because in a hexagonal system, the formula is different, but in rhombohedral, which is a type of trigonal system, perhaps the formula is similar to hexagonal.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me look for another approach. Perhaps I should use the general formula for interplanar spacing. The general formula for d_{hkl} in a crystal is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 a^2)/(a^2) + (k^2 b^2)/(b^2) + (l^2 c^2)/(c^2) + 2 (hk a b cos γ )/(a^2 b^2) + 2 (hl a c cos β )/(a^2 c^2) + 2 (kl b c cos α )/(b^2 c^2) ) } }

Wait, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, for a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and the angles are all alpha = beta = gamma. So the formula simplifies.

In rhombohedral, a = b = c = a0 (say), and alpha = beta = gamma = theta (30 degrees here).

So the interplanar distance formula becomes:

d^2 = [ (h a0)^2 + (k a0)^2 + (l a0)^2 + 2 h k a0^2 cos theta + 2 h l a0^2 cos theta + 2 k l a0^2 cos theta ]^-1

Divide numerator and denominator by a0^2:

d^2 = [ a0^2 (h² +k² + l²) + 2 a0^2 cos theta (h k + h l +k l) ]^-1 * (1/a0^2 )

Wait, no, perhaps I should think of it as:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2)/a^2 + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha)/a^2 )

But since alpha = beta = gamma = theta
