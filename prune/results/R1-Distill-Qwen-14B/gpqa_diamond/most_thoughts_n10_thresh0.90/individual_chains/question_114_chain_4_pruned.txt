Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's about selecting the right reagents for two different reactions. Let me try to think through each step carefully.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and another reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form a butanoic acid derivative. The options are A, B, C, D with different combinations of A and B.

Hmm, starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, a ketone. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, let me draw this out. Butan-2-one has a carbonyl group at position 2. The product has a hydroxyl group and a cyano group at the same position. That suggests some substitution is happening at the carbonyl carbon.

So NaCN is a nucleophile. In the presence of a ketone, perhaps a nucleophilic addition is happening. But ketones typically don't react with HCN or CN- directly unless under specific conditions. Oh wait, wait! I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide source, it's usually via a nucleophilic addition followed by elimination, but that would form an alkene. Alternatively, maybe it's an addition-elimination mechanism leading to a nitrile group and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think: butan-2-one has (CH3)2CO. If a cyanide ion adds to the carbonyl, the oxygen would have a negative charge. Then, perhaps something happens to form the nitrile and hydroxyl groups. Oh! Maybe it's a condensation reaction where the cyanide adds, and water is removed, but not exactly sure.

Wait, I think this is a hydroxy nitrile formation. Oh right, the Beckmann rearrangement? No, that's for oximes. Or maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Yeah, a cyanohydrin is when a nucleophile like CN- adds to a carbonyl to form a compound with both OH and CN groups.

So the reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN under certain conditions to form the cyanohydrin. The conditions for forming a cyanohydrin typically involve an acid catalyst. Because the cyanide ion is a weak nucleophile, so you might need to protonate the carbonyl oxygen to make it more electrophilic.

So for the first step, reagent A is probably an acid, like H3O+. Since NaCN is a source of CN-, and then adding acid would help in the protonation of the carbonyl, making it more reactive towards nucleophilic attack.

Now, looking at the options, options A and B have A = H3O+, options C and D have A = NaHSO3. Wait, what's NaHSO3? That's sodium bisulfite, which is a source of HSO3^- ions. Hmm, but in this case, it's more likely that the acid (H3O+) is the catalyst for the cyanohydrin formation. So for the first reaction, A is H3O+. So the options are A or B for reagent A.

Now, moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The product is the corresponding butanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.

What reagents are needed to convert nitriles to carboxylic acids? One common method is hydrolysis. Under acidic conditions, a nitrile can be hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, under basic conditions it might form a sodium salt, which can be acidified.

Wait, the reagent B in this case is H2O. Oh, no, wait the description says that reagent B is H2O. But no, looking back, the reaction is: ... + B (H2O) ---> ... So the reagent B is H2O. But that doesn't make much sense. Wait, no, perhaps I misread. Let me check.

No, the question states: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> ... So I think that the reagent used here is H2O, but with some other condition. Because just water and H2O alone might not cause the nitrile to hydrolyze.

Wait, no, that's not right. The nitrile to carboxylic acid usually requires a strong acid or base as a catalyst. For example, in acidic conditions, you can have H3O+ as a catalyst. Alternatively, in basic conditions, using NaOH and heat.

Wait, but the reagent B is H2O, as per the question. But in that case, perhaps reagent B is an acid or base. Let me think. The reaction is written as the starting material plus B (H2O) gives the product. So B is either an acid or a base that is used in the presence of water.

Wait, but the reaction is hydrolysis. So for nitrile to carboxylic acid, the conditions are typically either strong acid with heat, or strong base with heat, followed by acid workup.

Wait, when converting nitrile to carboxylic acid, one method is hydrolysis under strong acidic conditions. Alternatively, using a strong base like aqueous NaOH and then acidifying.

But in the second reaction, the starting material already has a hydroxyl group. So when you hydrolyze the nitrile, you might get a ketone or carboxylic acid. Wait, in this case, the product is a carboxylic acid. So the nitrile must be hydrolyzed all the way.

Wait, but the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the structure is: CH2(CN)CH(OH)CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Hmm, but I'm not sure about the structure, but the key point is that the nitrile group is adjacent to a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but in the product, the nitrile is converted to a carboxylic acid. So the reaction is nitrile â†’ carboxylic acid. So that's hydrolysis.

Typically, to hydrolyze nitriles to carboxylic acids, you can use either a strong acid (like H2SO4) with heat, or a strong base (like NaOH) with heat, followed by acid workup.

In the question, the reagent is B, which is H2O, but perhaps B is a catalyst. Let me look at what options are given.

The options for B are:
Option A: B = HCl
Option B: B = CH3COOH
Option C: B = HCl
Option D: B = CH3COOH

Wait, no, looking back, the options are:

Options:
A) A = H3O+, B = HCl
B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH
C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl
D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So for the second reaction, reagent B is either HCl or CH3COOH.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the reagent is B. So B is either HCl or CH3COOH.

So for the second reaction, we have 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (which is either HCl or CH3COOH in the options) along with H2O to form the corresponding acid.

Wait, no, the question says:

2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2
