Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem describes a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. The reaction is violent, producing a gas W, a precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Then there's another part about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with 2 oxygen atoms. Finally, X is a reagent in organic chemistry, and I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I'll try to identify what each substance might be.

Starting with the reaction: X reacts with Y violently. I'm thinking metals reacting with acids often produce gases, maybe hydrogen. So perhaps Y is a strong acid, like HCl or H2SO4. Wait, but when metals react with acids, they typically produce hydrogen gas. Let's think about that.

Gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecule must be something where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. H2 is H2, but that's only two protons and two neutrons in the molecule? Wait, no, H2 has each hydrogen with 1 proton and 1 neutron (if it's deuterium), but H2 would be H-H, so each H is 1 proton and 1 neutron. Wait, no. Wait, Wait, the molecule's protons and neutrons sum. So for H2, total protons are 2, total neutrons are 2 (if each H is protium, lightest isotope). So 2 each. So that fits. So W could be H2.

Then the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K. What's 277 K in Celsius? 277 - 273.15 = 3.85, so about 3.85°C. So B is a substance that's solid at that temperature. Wait, but water freezes at 273 K (0°C), so 277 is just a bit above that. Maybe B is something like water? But no, because when you heat a precipitate and get water, that's not likely. Alternatively, maybe B is something else. Alternatively, perhaps B is sodium hydroxide? No, that's solid at room temp. Wait, maybe B is something like NaOH, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps G is a carbonate. If X is a metal reacting with acid Y, maybe the reaction is something like Mg reacting with HCl. Mg + HCl → MgCl2 + H2. But then the precipitate G... Hmm, but MgCl2 is soluble. So maybe Y is not an acid, but something else. Alternatively, maybe Y is water, but that's not likely to cause violent reaction.

Wait, another angle. The product of X with a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms. Keto acid is like an acid with a ketone group, like acetoacetic acid. Maybe X is something that adds to or reacts with the carbonyl group. Wait, but X is a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents include things like LiAlH4, which is a strong reducing agent. Oh, wait, LiAlH4 is used to reduce carbonyl groups, like in the reduction of ketones or aldehydes to alcohols.

Wait, if X is LiAlH4, let's see. Then, the reaction with a keto acid... well, LiAlH4 is a strong reducing agent. But when LiAlH4 reacts with a keto acid, maybe it reduces the carbonyl group. For example, a keto acid like acetoacetic acid would have two carbonyl groups. But when X reacts with it, perhaps it adds hydrogen. Wait, but the product contains two oxygen atoms. Hmm, maybe the product is an alcohol, which has OH groups, but that might not directly tie in.

Wait, the problem says the product of X with a keto acid contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So maybe the product is something like a diol? Or perhaps the product is an alcohol with two O's. Alternatively, maybe the product is a carboxylic acid derivative. Hmm, not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe X is sodium borohydride, NaBH4, which is another reducing agent. But sodium borohydride is less reactive than LiAlH4 and doesn't reduce as many carbonyl compounds.

Wait, but the question says that the product has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps the product is something like an alcohol with two oxygen-containing groups, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe the product is a diol, but I'm not certain.

Let me go back to the initial reaction.
