Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I remember that in general relativity, the metric describes the geometry of spacetime. But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh right, a pseudosphere is like a surface of constant negative curvature, right?

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Hmm, that looks a bit familiar. I think this might be a 2-dimensional metric because it's in terms of dx and dy. So it's probably describing some kind of surface embedded in higher dimensions, maybe like a 2D manifold with a specific curvature.

Wait, the denominator is 4 - x² - y². So when x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator goes to zero, which would make the metric blow up. That suggests some sort of event horizon or boundary at x² + y² =4. But how does that relate to the pseudosphere?

Oh, the radius of the pseudosphere is given as r=2. I think the usual pseudosphere, or tractricoid, has a certain area. Wait, the area of a pseudosphere is something I've heard before. Isn't it 4π times something? Oh right, the area of a pseudosphere is 4π a², where 'a' is the radius. But wait, I might be mixing it up with something else. Or is it like the area of a sphere, which is 4π r². But pseudosphere is different—it's a surface of constant negative curvature, so maybe the area is related in a different way.

Wait, let me think about the metric again. The given metric is conformally flat, right? Because it's (32/(4 - x² - y²)) times (dx² + dy²), which is a scaling of the Euclidean metric. So this is like a 2-dimensional space with a conformal factor that depends on x and y.

To find the area, I think I can compute the area element. The area element in such a metric would be sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. But wait, in 2D, for a metric ds² = E dx² + 2F dx dy + G dy², the determinant is EG - F². But here, since it's diagonal (F=0), the determinant is just EG. So here, E = G = 32/(4 - x² - y²), so the determinant is E*G = (32)^2/(4 - x² - y²)^2.

Wait, no. Wait, the metric is ds² = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²). So E = 32/(4 - x² - y²), F=0, G= same as E. So determinant is E*G - F² = (32^2)/(4 - r²)^2, where r² = x² + y².

So the area element is sqrt(determinant) dx dy. But wait, in 2D, the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy. So the sqrt of (32^2)/(4 - r²)^2) is 32/(4 - r²). So area element is (32)/(4 - r²) dx dy.

Wait, but that's for a 2-dimensional surface. But wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. Hmm, but the pseudosphere is a 2D surface with infinite area, isn't it? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Or maybe the metric given describes a pseudosphere, and I need to compute its area.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is that of a 2D space which is a pseudosphere. So the area would be the integral of the area element over the whole space.

But wait, the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), so the domain is where 4 - r² >0, so r² <4, meaning r <2. So the metric is defined only within x² + y² <
