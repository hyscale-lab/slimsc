Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. We're supposed to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, interplanar distance. Oh right, that's the d-spacing. The formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal structure depends on the crystal system. Since this is a rhombohedral crystal, the formula might be a bit different than cubic.

I remember for cubic systems, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²), where a is the lattice parameter and (hkl) are the Miller indices. But rhombohedral is a bit more complex because the angles aren't 90 degrees. So the formula must involve the angles somehow.

Right, the general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral lattice is d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk cos gamma) - 2(hl cos beta) - 2(kl cos alpha) )) ) ... wait, no, wait. Or is it using the unit cell parameters including the angles? Maybe the formula uses the volume of the unit cell or something.

Alternatively, another approach. The interplanar distance for a crystal is given by the formula involving the reciprocal of the plane's indices and the metric tensor. The metric tensor for a rhombohedral crystal. Oh, the metric tensor relates the reciprocal lattice vectors to the direct lattice.

Wait, the metric tensor g for rhombohedral is such that g_ij = a² δ_ij + a² (cos α δ_ij - cos α (if i=j=k? No, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, the general formula for d-spacing when the lattice isn't cubic includes terms for the angles.

Wait, I think the formula is d^2 = (a^2 (h² +k² +l²) - 2 a² hk cos γ - 2 a² hl cos β - 2 a² kl cos α ) )^{-1}.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. The interplanar distance d is given by (1/d²) = (h² + k² + l²)/a² - 2 (h k cos γ + h l cos β + k l cos α ) / a². Oh wait, that might be the case. Because in a cubic system, all angles are 90 degrees, so the cosine terms would be zero, and the formula reduces to d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²), which is correct.

So in this case, since the crystal is rhombohedral, alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees, and all three angles are same. So the formula becomes:

1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/a² - 2 [ hk cos(30) + hl cos(30) + kl cos(30) ] / a²

Wait, but in our case, the (hkl) plane is (111), so h=k=l=1.

So plugging in h=1, k=1, l=1.

So 1/d² = (1 + 1 + 1)/a² - 2 [ (1)(1) cos(30) + (1)(1) cos(30) + (1)(1) cos(30) ] / a²

Simplify that.

So numerator:

(3) - 2 * [ 3 * cos(30) ] 

Because each of the terms is cos(30), and there are three terms. So 3 * cos(30).

So 1/d² = [3 - 6 cos(30)] / a²

Wait, cos(30 degrees) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So let's compute the numerator.

3 - 6 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 3 - 3 sqrt(3)

So 3 (1 - sqrt(3)).

Wait, wait, that can't be right because sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so 1 - 1.732 is negative. That would make 1/d² negative, which is impossible. Oh wait, did I make a mistake in the formula?

Hmm, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me double-check.

I think the formula is:

d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) a² - 2 a² (hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) ]^{-1}

Yes, that's what it should be. So 1/d² would be [ (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) ] / a²

Wait, no, d is given by (a² [ (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) ] )^{-1/2} }

Wait, no, wait: Let me clarify. The formula for d is:

d = [ (h² +k² +l²) a² - 2 a² ( hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α ) ]^(-1/2)

Wait, no, the correct formula is:

d = ( (h² +k² + l²) a² - 2 a² [ hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α ] )^{-1/2} / a 

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. The general formula for the interplanar distance in a hexagonal or rhombohedral crystal is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha) }} } \cdot \frac{1}{a}

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

d^2 = \frac{1}{a^2} [ h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2hk \cos \gamma - 2hl \cos \beta - 2kl \cos \alpha ]

So 1/d² = [h² +k² +l² - 2hk cos γ - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos α ] / a^2

Wait, but in our case, a is the lattice parameter, which is the interatomic distance. The question says the interatomic distance is
