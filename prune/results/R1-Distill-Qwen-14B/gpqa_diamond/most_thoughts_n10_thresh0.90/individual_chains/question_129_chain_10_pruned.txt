Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about identifying compound E in a reaction scheme. There are several steps involved, and some hints provided. Let's break it down.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (probably nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints are a and b. Let's look at them.

Hint a: Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on ylides, but I remember that phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes by reacting with ylides. So compound A must be a carbonyl compound because it reacts with a Wittig reagent to form an alkene.

The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, propan-2-ylidene is a CH2CH(CH3) group attached via the ylidene (double bond) to the cyclopentane. So the Wittig reaction product is an alkene, meaning that compound A must have a carbonyl group that's adjacent to a methyl group, probably?

Wait, the structure is cyclopentane with substituents. Let's imagine the structure: positions 1 and 2 are methyl groups, and position 4 has a propan-2-ylidene group. So the starting material for the Wittig reaction must have a carbonyl group that, when reacted, forms that alkene at position 4.

Wait, the ylide reacts with the carbonyl. So the carbonyl is part of a ring? Because the product is a cyclopentane with substituents. So perhaps compound A is a cyclopentanone derivative. For example, if the carbonyl is at position 3 or 4, reacting with the ylide would form a double bond.

Wait, let me think. The Wittig reaction forms an alkene from a carbonyl. So if compound A is a cyclopentanone with substituents, the reaction would add a new group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure of the Wittig product can help me figure out the structure of A. The product has a cyclopentane ring with a substituent that's a propan-2-ylidene group. So the substituent would be a CH2-CH(CH3)- group, but connected via the double bond. Wait, no, the ylide would have a double bond. Let me think about the general Wittig reaction.

The ylide has a structure like Ph3P=CH-R. When it reacts with a carbonyl (like R'CO), it forms R'CH2-R and Ph3
