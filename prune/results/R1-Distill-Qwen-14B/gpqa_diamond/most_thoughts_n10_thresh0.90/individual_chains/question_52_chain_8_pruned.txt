Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem, and honestly, it's a bit complicated, but I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm. I remember that in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the populations of two energy levels depends on the temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels (n1 and n2) is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp(-(E1 - E2)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy), E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, so the ratio depends on the temperature. In this case, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature decreases. But wait, the spots are cooler regions. How does that affect the photosphere's overall temperature?

Wait, the problem says when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. So the average temperature of the photosphere has gone down. But wait, if spots are cooler, does that mean the rest of the surface is hotter? No, because the problem says the overall Teff is 5500 K—so it's the effective temperature of the entire star, considering the spots.

But how does this affect the photospheric temperature? I'm a bit confused here. Wait, the star's photosphere is the outer layer where most of the light is emitted, right? So when the spots are present, the average Teff is lower. So the effective temperature being considered is 5500 K in that case.

Now, the ratio of Ti atoms in levels 1 and 2 is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2)*exp(-ΔE/(kT)). If the temperature changes, this ratio changes. But wait, the problem says that when there are spots, this ratio decreases. Because when Teff decreases, the exponent becomes a larger negative number, so the ratio (n1/n2) would decrease if ΔE is positive. Wait, but let me think: if the temperature is lower, exp(-ΔE/(kT)) becomes smaller because the denominator (kT) is smaller. So if ΔE is positive (E1 > E2), then (n1/n2) would decrease as T decreases. That makes sense because lower temperatures make it harder for atoms to be in higher energy levels.

So when the star has spots, T_eff is lower (5500 K), so the ratio (n1/n2) is lower. The question is, by what factor is the ratio when the star is spotless (T=6000 K) compared to when it has spots (T=5500 K)?

So the factor is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.

But wait, let's write the ratio as R = (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)).

Assuming that g1/g2 is the same in both cases (same element, same levels), then the ratio R is proportional to exp(-ΔE
