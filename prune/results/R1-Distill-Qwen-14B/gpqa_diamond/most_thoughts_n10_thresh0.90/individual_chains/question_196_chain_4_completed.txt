Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this.

Alright, the problem says it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. The question is about finding the maximum speed v_max. And the options are given with various expressions involving c, the speed of light.

Wait, I remember that in the classical harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is given by v_max = sqrt(kA/m). But here, it's relativistic, so I think we have to consider relativistic effects, probably using the relativistic equation of motion or energy.

So, in the non-relativistic case, the total energy is (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA². So v_max is sqrt(kA²/m). Looking at the options, option C gives exactly that, but since this is relativistic, option C probably isn't the right answer. So the actual answer should be one of the other options that involve c somehow.

In relativity, we have to consider that as speeds approach c, the relativistic effects become significant. So the energy should be the total relativistic energy, which is gamma mc². Wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², but in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore.

Wait, maybe the total energy is the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. Or perhaps it's treated as a system where the potential is (1/2)kx², and the total energy is conserved. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the oscillator's motion is governed by the relativistic equation. The force in relativity might involve terms with gamma. Wait, F = d(p)/dt where p is relativistic momentum, so p = gamma m v. So F = m gamma³ a, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait, maybe energy is a better approach. In the harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy is conserved. The potential energy is (1/2)kA², and at maximum amplitude, the kinetic energy is zero. As it moves, the potential converts to kinetic. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². So at the maximum speed, the potential energy would be equal to the total energy minus the rest energy.

Wait, no. Wait, the total mechanical energy in the non-relativistic case is (1/2)kA². In the relativistic case, I think the total energy is the sum of rest energy and kinetic, but that might not directly apply because the potential is still (1/2)kx². Hmm, perhaps I should set the total energy as the sum of the potential energy and the relativistic kinetic energy.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's try a different approach. Let's think about the energy. At maximum displacement A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero. At the equilibrium point (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. So the maximum kinetic energy equals the potential energy at maximum displacement.

In the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is not (1/2)mv², but (gamma - 1) mc². So the maximum kinetic energy is (gamma_max - 1) mc². But wait, in the non-relativistic case, this would be (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA². So in the relativistic case, that equals (gamma -1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

So we have (gamma - 1) mc² = (1/2)kA². Solving for gamma: gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me call (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a term for simplicity, say, let η = (k A²)/(2 m c²). Then,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + η.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + eta).

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + eta)^2.

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + eta)^2.

v^2 = c² [1 - 1/(1 + eta)^2 ]

= c² [ ( (1 + eta)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + eta)^2 ) ]

Expanding numerator: (1 + 2 eta + eta² -1 ) = 2 eta + eta².

So,

v² = c² (2 eta + eta²) / (1 + eta)^2.

Hmm, but if eta is small, this would simplify, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Wait, let's plug eta back in. eta = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v^2 = [ (2 * (k A²/(2 m c²)) ) + (k A²/(2 m c²))^2 ] * c² / [ (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )^2 ]

Wait, simplifying numerator inside the brackets:

2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) ) = (k A²)/(m c² )

Adding the square term: (k A²/(m c² )) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4 ) = ?

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ ( (k A²)/(m c^2 ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m^2 c^4 )) ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, let me think about the expression for v_max. From the equation above, I had:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2 )

So,

sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2 ) = 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )

Squaring both sides:

1 - (v^2/c^2) = 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2))^2

Rearranging,

(v^2/c^2) = 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2)))^2

Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2)))^2:

v^2/c^2 = [ (1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2 ))^2 - 1 ) ] / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, wait. Let me compute the numerator:

(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 - 1 = 1 + 2*(k A^2/(2 m c^2)) ) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 -1 = 2*(k A^2/(2 m c^2)) ) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ 2*(k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ] / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me set x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Then,

gamma = 1 + x.

And,

1 - (v^2/c^2) = 1/(1 + x)^2

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + x)^2 = [ (1 + x)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + x)^2.

Expanding numerator: 1 + 2x + x^2 -1 = 2x + x².

So,

v^2 = c^2 (2x + x²) / (1 + x)^2.

Now, substituting x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ 2*(k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ] / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2

Simplify numerator:

2*(k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) = k A^2/(m c² )

Plus (k A^2/(2 m c² ))^2 = k² A^4/(4 m² c^4 )

So numerator becomes:

k A^2/(m c² ) + k² A^4/(4 m² c^4 )

Denominator:

(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )^2 = 1 + 2*(k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2

Which is 1 + (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should factor out terms.

Wait, let's factor out (k A^2/(m c^2 )) from numerator and denominator.

Numerator: [ (k A^2/(m c^2 )) ] * [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]

Denominator: [ (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) ]^2.

Wait, let me see:

Numerator expression:

k A²/(m c^2 ) + [ (k A^2)^2 ]/(4 m² c^4 ) = (k A^2/(m c^2 )) [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ].

Yes, because:

k A²/(m c^2 ) * (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ) = (k^2 A^4)/(2 m² c^4 )

But the actual numerator is k A²/(m c^2 ) + k² A^4/(4 m² c^4 ), which is the same as:

= (k A^2/(m c^2 )) [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ].

So, the numerator is (k A^2/(m c^2 )) (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

And the denominator is (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ (k A^2/(m c² )) (1 + x) ] / (1 + x )^2 )

Canceling (1 + x ) from numerator and denominator,

v^2 = c^2 * (k A^2/(m c^2 )) / (1 +x )

So,

v^2 = (k A^2/m ) / (1 + x )

But x is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v^2 = (k A^2/m ) / [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]

Which is,

v^2 = (k A^2/m ) * [ 1/( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ) ]

Hmm, so that's the expression. Let me write it as:

v^2 = (k A²/m ) / [ 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ) ]

So,

v^2 = (k A^2) / ( m [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ] )

Which can be written as:

v^2 = (k A^2) / [ m + (k A^2)/( 2 c^2 ) ]

Alternatively, v^2 = [ (k A^2) ] / [ m (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) ]

Wait, perhaps I can factor out m from the denominator.

But I'm not sure if that's the most helpful way. Maybe I can factor it differently.

Wait, let's consider that in terms of terms within square roots when looking at the options. Let me look at the options.

Option B is v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, let me compute 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )).

Hmm, but in our expression, we have v² = (k A²/m) / [ 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ) ]

Which can be written as,

v² = (k A²/m) * [1/(1 + x)] where x = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Hmm, but none of the options seem to directly match this expression. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the harmonic oscillator's maximum velocity under relativity is when the total energy equals the sum of rest energy and the potential energy. Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, the maximum kinetic energy equals the potential energy.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the total energy is (1/2) k A², and all of that goes into kinetic at maximum speed.

In the relativistic case, perhaps the total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy, which equals the potential energy. Or maybe that's not the correct approach.

Wait, another approach: the potential energy is (1/2)kA² when x=A, and when the mass is at x=0, it's moving, so the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c². So the total energy is (gamma - 1) m c² + (1/2 k A² ) = m c² (since at x=0, the potential is zero, but wait no, the potential is (1/2)k x², so when x=0, potential is zero. Wait, but the potential energy when x=A is (1/2)kA². So setting the total energy (kinetic at x=0 plus potential at x=A) should be equal.

Wait, that's probably the right way. So,

Total energy E = K.E. at x=0 + Potential energy at x=A.

But at x=0, the potential energy is zero, so E equals the kinetic energy at x=0.

But in the harmonic oscillator, the maximum potential energy is (1/2)kA². So when the mass is at x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero. So this must equal the total energy of the system.

Wait, but in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c². So,

(gamma - 1) m c² = (1/2) k A².

So solving for gamma,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Which is the same as before.

So,

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Let me call (k A^2)/(2 m c² ) as x, so,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = 1 + x.

Square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + x )^2.

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 +x )^2.

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + x )^2.

= [ (1 +x )^2 - 1 ] / (1 +x )^2.

Which,

= [ 1 + 2x + x² -1 ] / (1 +x )^2.

= [ 2x + x^2 ] / (1 + x )^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 * (2x + x^2 ) / (1 +x )^2.

But x is (k A²)/(2 m c² ), so,

v^2 = c^2 * [ 2*(k A²/(2 m c² )) + (k A²/(2 m c² ))^2 ] / [ (1 + (k A²/(2 m c² )) ) ]^2.

Simplify numerator:

2*(k A²/(2 m c² )) = (k A²)/(m c² )

Plus (k A²/(2 m c² ))^2 = k² A^4/(4 m^2 c^4 )

So numerator is (k A²/(m c² )) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )

Denominator: [1 + (k A²/(2 m c² )) ]^2 = 1 + (k A²)/(m c² ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )

Hmm, so numerator is (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]

Denominator is [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2 )

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ (k A^2/(m c^2 )) * (1 + x ) ] / (1 + x )^2 )

Where x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v^2 = c^2 * (k A^2/(m c^2 )) / (1 + x )

Simplify:

v^2 = (k A^2/m ) / (1 + x )

Which,

v^2 = (k A^2/m ) / [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]

Hmm, maybe factor numerator and denominator.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 2 m c^2:

v^2 = (k A^2/m ) * 2 m c^2 / [ 2 m c^2 + k A^2 ]

= (2 k A^2 c^2 ) / ( m (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) )

Wait, that might not lead me anywhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write v in terms of sqrt( (k A^2/m ) / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Which is v = sqrt( (k A^2/m ) / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

= A sqrt( k/m [ 1 / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) ] )

Hmm, but I'm not seeing a clear match with the options.

Wait, perhaps I can factor out the 1/(1 + ... ) term.

Alternatively, let me write the expression as:

v = sqrt( (k A^2/m ) ) / sqrt( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )

Which is,

v = sqrt( (k A^2/m ) ) * 1 / sqrt( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )

Hmm, but none of the options match this expression.

Let me look at the options again.

Option A: c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2/(2m )) ) )

Wait, let me compute 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2m )) )

Hmm, perhaps this isn't matching.

Option B: c * sqrt( 1 + 1/( 1 - (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) )

Wait, that's 1 over (1 - (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, our expression for v was:

v = sqrt( (k A^2/m ) / ( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ) )

But in terms of option B, perhaps it's better to express it in terms of c.

Wait, another approach. Let me write the expression as:

v = sqrt( [ (k A²/m ) ] / [ 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ) ] )

= sqrt( (k A²/m ) / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ) ] )

= sqrt( (k A^2/m ) * (2 m c^2 ) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) )

= sqrt( (2 k A^2 c^2 ) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) )

= A sqrt( (2 k c^2 ) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) )

Wait, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Another thought: perhaps the maximum possible speed in this scenario can't exceed c, but that's obvious from relativity.

Looking at the options:

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2 m c^2 )) ) )

Wait, that would be v = c * sqrt( [ (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) + 1 ] / [ (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) ] )

Which would be sqrt( (2 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) / (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

= sqrt( 2 [ 1 - (k A^2)/(4 m c^2 ) ] / (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Hmm, not sure.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Wait, let me compute the term inside sqrt.

1 - [ 1/(1 + x )^2 ] where x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

= [ (1 + x )^2 - 1 ] / (1 +x )^2

= (1 + 2x + x^2 -1 ) / (1 +x )^2

= (2x + x^2 )/(1 +x )^2

So,

v^2 = c^2 (2x +x^2 )/(1+ x )^2

Which matches what I had earlier. So,

v = c sqrt( (2x + x² )/(1 + x )^2 )

= c sqrt( x (2 + x ) / (1 +x )^2 )

But x is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the same as what I have.

Wait, wait. Let me compare with option B and D.

Wait, in our earlier calculation, we have:

v = sqrt( (k A²/m ) / (1 + x ) )

= sqrt( (k A²/m ) / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )) )

But none of the options directly match this.

Wait, perhaps I should express the entire expression in terms of c. Let me see.

If I factor out (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) from denominator:

Denominator is 1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) = (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v^2 = (k A^2/m ) * (2 m c^2 ) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

= (2 k A^2 c^2 )/( m (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) )

Hmm, so,

v = sqrt( (2 k A² c^2 )/( m (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ) )

= A sqrt( 2 k c^2 / ( m (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ) )

Not sure if that helps.

Looking back, perhaps the correct approach is to set the total relativistic energy equal to the potential energy plus the rest mass energy.

Wait, no, because the potential energy is (1/2)kA² and the rest energy is mc². So,

E_total = K.E. + U

But K.E. = (gamma - 1) mc², and U = (1/2)k A².

So,

(gamma -1) mc² + (1/2)k A² = mc² + (1/2)k A².

Wait, that can't be right, because gamma is greater than 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy, which should be equal to the potential energy at maximum displacement.

So,

(gamma -1) mc² + mc² = (1/2)k A².

Wait, that would be gamma mc² = (1/2)k A².

Which would lead to gamma = (k A²)/(2 m c² ), but that would require that (k A²)/(2 m c² ) ≥1, which is not possible because gamma must be at least 1. So this approach must be wrong.

Hmm, maybe I should think about energy in terms of the oscillator's maximum potential energy. So, at maximum displacement, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy is (1/2)kA². But in relativistic terms, the total energy should also be the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy, but that would be (gamma) m c² = (1/2)kA².

So,

gamma = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ), so,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

Which would imply that (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ) ≥1, but that's impossible because gamma is always ≥1.

So this suggests that this approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the problem isn't considering the potential energy as (1/2)kx², but as (kA^2/2) when x=A. So the maximum potential is (1/2)kA².

But in the relativistic case, when the mass is at x=0, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc², and the potential energy is 0, so the total energy is (gamma) mc² = (1/2)kA² + mc².

So,

gamma mc² = (1/2)k A² + mc².

Subtract mc²,

(gamma -1 ) mc² = (1/2)k A².

Which brings us back to the same equation as before.

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Which gives,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c^2 ) =1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Which leads to v = c * sqrt( [ (1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 -1 ]/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Wait, which is same as earlier steps.

Hmm, so from this I have:

v = c * sqrt( [ (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 - 1 ] ) / [ (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) ]

Wait, so,

v = c * sqrt( [ (1 + x )^2 -1 ] ) / (1 +x )

Where x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

sqrt( (1 + 2x +x^2 -1 ) ) = sqrt( 2x + x^2 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2x + x^2 ) ) / (1 +x )

Factor numerator:

sqrt( x (2 +x ) )

So,

v = c * sqrt( x (2 +x ) ) / (1 +x )

But x is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them directly match this. Let me see.

Wait, option B is v = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, let's compute 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )).

Suppose I have y = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ).

So,

sqrt(1 + 1/(1-y) ) = sqrt( (1 - y +1 )/(1 - y ) ) = sqrt( (2 - y )/(1 - y ) )

Hmm, so v = c * sqrt( (2 - y )/(1 - y ) )

Which is,

v = c sqrt( (2 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) / (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

But from our earlier expression, it's more like sqrt( (2y + y² ) / (1 + y )^2 )

Wait, perhaps I can factor other terms.

Wait, another approach: let me compute the expression for v in terms of option B and see if it matches.

Option B: v = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )

= c sqrt( [ (1 - (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) + 1 ] / (1 - (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) )

= c sqrt( (2 - (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) / (1 - (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) )

Hmm, which is different from our earlier expression.

Wait, our earlier expression for v^2 was:

v^2 = c^2 (2y + y^2 ) / (1 + y )^2.

Where y = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ y (2 + y ) ] / (1 + y )^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

v = c sqrt( y (2 + y ) ) / (1 + y )

But I don't see any option that directly matches this.

Alternatively, perhaps none of the options are matching, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let's try to re-express the equation for v in terms of the given options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in our expression, the denominator is (1 + y ), and in option B, the denominator inside the sqrt is (1 - y ).

So perhaps if I can write the expression in terms of (1 - y ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I can write the expression for v in terms of (1 + y ) in the denominator.

Wait, according to our expression, v^2 = (k A^2 / m ) / (1 + y )

Because y = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v^2 = (k A^2 / m ) / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )

= (k A^2 / m ) * [ 2 m c^2 / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ]

= [ 2 k A^2 c^2 ] / ( m (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) )

Hmm, perhaps expressing in terms of c:

v^2 = [ 2 k A^2 c^2 ] / [ m (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ]

Hmm, but none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about when the speed is maximum. The maximum occurs when all the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy.

Wait, but in relativistic terms, the kinetic energy is the total energy minus rest energy.

So,

E_total = K.E. + rest energy.

At maximum speed, the potential energy is (1/2) k A^2, which must equal the total energy.

So,

(1/2) k A^2 = (gamma - 1 ) m c^2 + m c^2.

Wait, that can't be right, because then,

gamma m c^2 = (1/2) k A^2 + m c^2.

But this is the same as before.

Hmm, maybe I should re-express this in terms of the given options.

Looking back, option B is v = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2 m c² )) ) )

Which would be:

v = c * sqrt( [ (1 - (kA²/(2 m c^2 )) ) + 1 ] / (1 - (kA^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) )

= c * sqrt( (2 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) / (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Not sure if that's useful.

Wait, another approach: perhaps let's compute the expression for (1 - v^2/c^2 ) from our earlier steps.

We had,

1 - (v^2/c^2 ) = 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 ]

= c^2 [ ( (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 - 1 ) / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 ]

Which,

= c^2 [ (1 + 2*(k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 - 1 ) / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 ]

= c^2 [ ( (k A^2/m c^2 ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m^2 c^4 ) ) / ( (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 ) ]

Hmm, perhaps I can factor numerator:

= (k A^2/(m c^2 )) [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ] / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

= (k A^2/(m c^2 )) / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )

Which brings us back again to v^2 = (k A^2/m ) / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )

So,

v = sqrt( (k A^2/m ) / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) )

= A sqrt( k/(m) ) / sqrt(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )

Which is the same as:

v = (A sqrt(k/m )) / sqrt(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

v = (A sqrt( k/m )) * [ 1 / sqrt( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )) ) ]

= A sqrt( k/m ) * sqrt(2 m c^2 ) / sqrt(2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

= A * sqrt( (k * 2 m c^2 ) ) / sqrt( m (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) )

Hmm, I'm not making progress towards matching the options.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps option D is the correct one. Let me see.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Which would be,

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

= c * sqrt( (2 (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ) ) / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )

Which simplifies to,

c * sqrt( (k A^2/(m c^2 ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m^2 c^4 )) ) / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, but that's similar to our earlier expression, except I'm not sure.

Wait, comparing to our earlier expression, my v is:

v = sqrt( (k A^2/m ) / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) )

Which can be written as sqrt( k A^2/( m (1 + y ) ) ), where y = (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

Hmm, perhaps another approach: express everything in terms of the options.

Wait, perhaps I can write the denominator as 1 + y, where y = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v = sqrt( (k A^2/m ) / (1 + y ) )

= sqrt( (k A^2/(m )) ) * 1 / sqrt(1 + y )

= (A sqrt( k/m )) / sqrt(1 + y )

But I don't see any option that matches this.

Wait, looking at option A:

A) v_max =c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2m )) )

But the denominator is 1 - (k A²/(2m ))  which is different, as it's missing the c^2 in denominator.

So perhaps option B is the only one that has the correct denominator term.

Wait, option B is v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )

Which would imply,

v^2 = c² ( 1 + [ 1/(1 - y) ] )

= c² [ (1 - y +1 )/(1 - y ) ]

= c² [ (2 - y )/(1 - y ) ]

= c² (2 - y )/(1 - y )

Hmm, but our expression for v^2 is (k A^2/m ) / (1 + y )

= (k A^2)/( m (1 + y ) )

Wait, perhaps I can relate k A^2 to m c^2.

Wait, from earlier steps, we have:

gamma = 1 + y, where y = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

And gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the initial setup. Maybe the potential energy isn't (1/2)k x^2 in the relativistic case. Or perhaps the equation of motion is different.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the relativistic equation for the harmonic oscillator. I think the equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator is F = -k x, but with relativistic momentum, p = gamma m v.

So, F = dp/dt = d(gamma m v)/dt.

But F = -k x, so,

d(gamma m v)/dt = -k x.

This is a more complicated differential equation, which might be difficult to solve, but perhaps we can find the maximum speed at the equilibrium point.

Alternatively, perhaps using energy conservation is the better approach, as before.

Wait, another thought: since the maximum speed is v_max, the derivative of the potential energy with respect to x is F = -k x. But in the relativistic case, the equation of motion involves gamma.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck and should try to look at the options again.

Another approach: let's consider the case where the amplitude A is very small, so that relativistic effects are negligible. Then, the maximum speed should approach the non-relativistic solution, sqrt(k A^2/m ), which is option C.

Looking at the options,

Option C: v_max = sqrt( k A^2/m )

Which would be the correct non-relativistic case.

So, let's check which options approach this when A is very small.

So, if A approaches zero, then (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) is very small, so y = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ≈0.

For option B:

v = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - y ) )

When y is small, 1/(1 - y ) ≈ 1 + y + y^2 + ... So,

v ≈ c sqrt( 1 + 1 + y ) = c sqrt(2 + y )

Which is not equal to sqrt(k A^2/m ), which is correct for small A.

So option B can't be right.

Option D:

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + y )^2 )

When y is small, 1/(1 + y )^2 ≈ 1 - 2 y + 3 y^2 ...

So,

1 - 1/(1 + y )^2 ≈ 1 - (1 - 2 y ) ) = 2 y.

So,

v ≈ c sqrt( 2 y ) = c sqrt( 2 (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ) = c * sqrt( k A^2/(m c^2 ) )

= (A c ) sqrt( k/m ) * (1/c )

= A sqrt( k/m )

Which is correct as it matches the non-relativistic case.

So, option D gives the correct non-relativistic limit. So perhaps option D is the correct one.

Wait, but according to our earlier analysis, when y is small, v should be approximately sqrt(k A^2/m ), which is option C. So this suggests that option D can't be correct because option D in the non-relativistic limit gives v = A sqrt(k/m ), which matches option C.

Wait, but wait, the non-relativistic maximum speed is v_max = sqrt( (k A^2)/m ). So, in option D, when y is small, v approaches sqrt(2 y ) * c, which is sqrt( (2 (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) ) * c = sqrt( (k A^2)/(m c^2 )) * c = sqrt( k A^2/m ), which is correct.

So, option D gives the correct non-relativistic limit.

Wait, but earlier when I did the expansion for option B, it didn't match the non-relativistic limit, so perhaps option D is the correct one.

But wait, earlier when I derived the expression for v^2, it was (k A^2/m )/(1 + y ), where y is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v^2 = (k A^2/m ) / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )

= (k A^2/m ) * [ 1 / ( (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ) ]

= (k A^2/m ) * (2 m c^2 )/(2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

= (2 k A^2 c^2 )/( (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) m )

Hmm, but none of the options directly match this. But looking back at the options, perhaps option D is the correct one, given that it correctly approaches the non-relativistic limit.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

Another approach: To find the maximum speed when the potential energy is maximum, which is (1/2)k A^2.

In the relativistic case, the total energy is E = gamma m c^2 = (1/2)k A^2.

So,

gamma = (1/2) k A^2/(m c^2 )

Which would be,

gamma = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

But gamma must be greater than or equal to 1, so this would require that (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) >=1.

But this would imply that (k A^2) >= 2 m c^2.

Which is a very large value, but perhaps it's possible.

Wait, but then,

gamma = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Which would give,

1 - v^2/c^2 = (2 m c^2 )^2/(k A^2 )^2 )

But this leads to a negative v^2 if (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) <1.

Hmm, this suggests that my initial assumption is wrong, which brings me back to the previous approach.

So, perhaps the maximum speed is calculated when the potential energy equals the total relativistic energy.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the maximum potential energy is (1/2)k A^2, and this must equal the total energy.

So,

(1/2)k A^2 = gamma m c^2.

Therefore,

gamma = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Which requires that (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) >=1.

So,

gamma = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Then,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

1 - v^2/c^2 = (2 m c^2 )^2/(k A^2 )^2 )

Which would give,

v^2 = c^2 [ 1 - (4 m² c^4 )/(k² A^4 ) ]

But this might not make sense if (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) <1, which is likely.

So, perhaps this approach is wrong.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Considering the time I've spent, perhaps the correct option is option B.

Wait, earlier when calculating the non-relativistic limit, option D gives the correct speed, so I'll go with option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the relativistic energy conservation. The total energy of the system is conserved, and at maximum displacement \( x = A \), the potential energy is \( U = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), while the kinetic energy is zero. At \( x = 0 \), the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is at its maximum.

In the relativistic case, the total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the relativistic kinetic energy. The total energy at \( x = A \) is equal to the potential energy \( U = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). Thus, the total energy is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = \gamma m c^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. Solving for \( \gamma \), we find:

\[
\gamma = \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}.
\]

From the definition of \( \gamma \), we have:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \), we get:

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**: \( v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{1 - \frac{kA^2}{2m}}} \)  
   This option incorrectly omits \( c^2 \) in the denominator of the fraction, which is inconsistent with the relativistic energy framework. **Eliminated**.

2. **Option B**: \( v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{1 - \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}}} \)  
   This option has the correct denominator structure but does not match the derived expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \). **Eliminated**.

3. **Option C**: \( v_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}} \)  
   This is the non-relativistic result, which does not account for relativistic effects. **Eliminated**.

4. **Option D**: \( v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}\right)^2}} \)  
   This matches the derived expression exactly and correctly accounts for relativistic effects. **Correct**.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option D**, as it aligns with the relativistic energy conservation framework and reduces to the non-relativistic result in the appropriate limit.
