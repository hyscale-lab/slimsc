Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the minimum energy of a system of charges. Alright, let me read it again.

The setup is an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their masses are negligible, which probably means we don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that—just potential energy maybe. So, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system.

Wait, okay, so the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 meters from P, which has the 13th charge. But wait, since all the charges are identical, this must be a configuration where each of the 12 is equally spaced around P? Maybe arranged in some symmetrical pattern.

But wait, the question is about the minimum energy. So I guess I'm looking for the potential energy of this system. Because in the case of just charges, the potential energy is the work done to assemble them, or the energy stored in the system due to their positions.

I remember that the potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula: U = (k * q1 * q2) / r. But since there are multiple charges, I need to calculate the potential energy between each pair and sum them all up.

Wait, but how many pairs are there? Let me think. There are 13 charges in total. So the 13th is fixed at P. The other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of those 12 will have a potential energy contribution due to their interaction with the fixed charge at P. Also, the 12 charges at 2 meters from P must interact with each other as well. So I need to calculate both the interactions between the 12 and the fixed charge, and the interactions among the 12 themselves.

Wait a second, but the 12 charges are all at the same distance from P. So perhaps they form a spherical shell around P? Or maybe arranged in some other symmetric way, like equally spaced on a circle or something. But the exact arrangement might not matter for the potential energy calculation if they're all equidistant from the center, but I'm not entirely sure. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So each of their distances from P is 2 m, but their mutual distances could vary unless they are fixed in a symmetric arrangement like the vertices of a regular polygon or something. But the question doesn't specify their arrangement beyond that they're all 2 m from P. So perhaps for the minimum energy, we can assume that they're arranged in the most symmetric way possible, which would minimize the potential energy between them. Or wait, no—wait, actually, for the potential energy, arranging them symmetrically would spread out the interactions, maybe resulting in a lower total potential energy. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure if symmetry affects the total potential energy in this case. Maybe because all the charges are the same, the potential energy between them would just be the sum of each pair's contribution, regardless of their arrangement. So perhaps the arrangement doesn't affect the sum, as each pair contributes the same amount. Wait, but that's only true if every pair of the 12 charges is at the same mutual distance. Which isn't the case because if you have 12 charges on a sphere, each charge is at a different distance from every other charge. So their mutual distances vary, making the potential energy between each pair different. So summing all of them would be complicated.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy. So maybe the charges can arrange themselves in a way that minimizes the total potential energy. But wait, for a system of identical charges, the configuration that minimizes the potential energy is when they are as far apart as possible. So, for example, if you have multiple charges, they would spread out as much as possible to minimize repulsion, but in this case, they are constrained to stay at 2 meters from point P. So perhaps they arrange themselves on the surface of a sphere of radius 2 m, which would maximize the minimal distance between each other.

Wait, but if all the 12 charges are on a sphere of radius 2 m, the distance between any two adjacent charges would depend on the arrangement. For a regular dodecahedron or something, perhaps. But calculating the exact distances between each pair and then summing the potential energies would be complicated. But maybe, for the sake of this problem, we can ignore the mutual interactions of the 12 charges and only consider their interactions with the central charge. Because the options given are in the order of 1e-26 J, which is really tiny, suggesting that maybe the mutual interactions are negligible compared to the interactions with the central charge.

Wait, but let's think about the numbers. Each charge is 2e, which is 2 times the elementary charge. So each charge is 2 * 1.6e-19 coulombs = 3.2e-19 C.

The Coulomb's constant k is approximately 8.988e9 N m²/C².

The distance from the central charge is 2 meters. The mutual distances between the 12 charges would be around maybe 2 * 2 m * sin(theta/2), but without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to say. But perhaps for an order of magnitude estimate, the mutual distances are on the same order as 2 meters, maybe a little less.

But let's see. Let's first calculate the potential energy due to the central charge and the 12 charges. Each of the 12 charges is at 2 m from P. So each pair (central and one of the 12) contributes U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2 m). Let me compute this.

So U per pair is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2). Since there are 12 such pairs, the total from central charge is 12 * U.

Wait, but wait a second. The central charge is fixed, and the other 12 are moving, but they are fixed in place (since they are constrained). So the potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies of each 12 charges with the central charge. So each contributes (k * (2e)^2 ) / (2 m). So for each, it's (8.988e9) * ( (2e)^2 ) / 2.

Wait, but e is 1.6e-19 C. So (2e)^2 is 4e^2 = 4*(1.6e-19)^2.

So per pair, U = (8.988e9) * 4*(1.6e-19)^2 / 2.

Wait, let's compute that. Let's compute the numerator and denominator.

Wait, (2e)^2 is 4e². So (4e²) / (2m) = 2e²/(m). Then multiplied by k.

So each pair's potential energy is U = k * (2e)^2 / (2 m) ?

Wait, wait, no. The formula is U = k * q1 * q2 / r. So q1 is 2e, q2 is 2e, and r is 2 m.

Thus, U per pair = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2 m) = k * (4 e²) / (2 m) = (k * 2 e² ) / m.

But wait, 2e is 2 * 1.6e-19 C = 3.2e-19 C. So e is 1.6e-19, so e² is 2.56e-38 C².

So substituting:

U = (8.988e9 N m²/C²) * (4 * (1.6e-19 C)^2) / (2 m).

Wait, wait, let me compute that correctly. Each U = k * (2e)^2 / (2 m). So that's (k * 4 e²) / (2 m) = (k * 2 e²) / m.

So plugging in the numbers:

k = 8.988e9 N m²/C².

e = 1.6e-19 C.

So e² = (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

Thus, 2 e² = 5.12e-38 C².

So U per pair is (8.988e9) * (5.12e-38) / (2 m).

Wait, no, wait the r is 2 m. So the denominator is 2 m. Oh wait, no, the denominator is 2 m. So it's (8.988e9) * 5.12e-38 / (2 * 2).

Wait, no, wait. The formula is U = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2 m). So that's k * (4e²) / (2 m) = (4k e²) / (2 m) ) = (2 k e²) / m.

Wait, so 2k e² over m, but m is 2 meters.

Wait, no, the denominator is r, which is 2 meters. So the denominator is 2 m. So U per pair is (k * 4 e²) / (2 m) = (2 k e²) / m.

Wait, let's compute that. So 2 k e² / r, where r is 2 m.

Wait, 2 * (8.988e9) * ( (2e)^2 ) / (2 m).

Wait, perhaps I should compute the numbers step by step.

Compute each pair's potential energy:

U = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 m).

So,

k = 8.988e9 N m²/C².

2e = 2 * 1.6e-19 C = 3.2e-19 C.

So (2e) * (2e) = (3.2e-19)^2 = 10.24e-38 C².

Wait, no, wait: (2e)^2 is 4e²,
