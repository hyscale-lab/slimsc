Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, first, I need to remember what each of these symmetries entails. Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance of the laws of physics under Lorentz transformations, like rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, so it's a bigger symmetry group. Then there's CP which is charge conjugation combined with parity, and CPT which combines charge, parity, and time reversal.

In the SMEFT, the operators are built from the Standard Model fields and are organized by their dimension. The theory is an effective theory, so it's valid up to some high energy scale. SMEFT respects the symmetries of the Standard Model, I think. But wait, what about the symmetries that the operators must respect individually?

Do all operators in SMEFT have to respect Poincare symmetry? Well, Poincare includes translations (momentum conservation) and Lorentz. Since the SMEFT is a field theory, it must respect all the symmetries of a local field theory. So Lorentz and Poincare should definitely be there. So options 1 and 2 must be correct.

What about CP and CPT? The Standard Model doesn't have CP symmetry except in some limits (like in the Standard Model, CP is broken, but some interactions are CP-symmetric). Wait, but the SMEFT is an effective theory of the SM. So does that mean the operators have to respect CP or CPT?

Wait, no. Because the operators in SMEFT are constructed to be renormalizable or not? No, they're non-renormalizable, but the point is, the SMEFT is supposed to include all possible higher-dimension operators that preserve the symmetries of the SM. So the SM has CPT symmetry, but not necessarily CP. So operators in SMEFT might violate CP if the SM does. For example, in the SM, the CKM matrix leads to CP violation. So operators in SMEFT can violate CP, which would mean that the operators don't need to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 would not have to
