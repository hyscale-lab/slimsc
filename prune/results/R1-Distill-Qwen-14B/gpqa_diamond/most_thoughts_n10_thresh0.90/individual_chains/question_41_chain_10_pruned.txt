Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the speed of light in glass when the glass itself is moving. Alright, let me read it again carefully.

The problem says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? And the options are given as A, B, C, D.

Wait, wait. So the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, and towards the observer. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, noâ€”the beam is moving through the glass, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So if the glass is moving towards the observer, but the beam is moving through it in the same direction. Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, the beam is propagating through the glass, which is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam. So if the beam is moving in a certain direction, the glass itself is moving in that same direction. But the glass is moving towards the observer. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Wait, maybe the setup is that the glass is moving towards the observer in the lab, but the light is going in the same direction as the glass is moving. So the light is coming towards the observer, same as the glass's motion.

Wait, no, the question says the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as
