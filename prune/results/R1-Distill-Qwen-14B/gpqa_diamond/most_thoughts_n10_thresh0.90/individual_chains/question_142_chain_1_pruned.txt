Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through.

The question is asking about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in the qubit space. The matrix provided is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). And there are four options to choose from, A to D, each with different r coordinates.

Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. A pure state is a density matrix that's a projector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, while a mixed state is a statistical mixture of such projectors.

So looking at the given ρ, it's (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). That looks like an equal mixture of the |0⟩ and |1⟩ states. Each of those projectors is a pure state, and when you average them with equal weights, you get a mixed state. So ρ describes a completely mixed state for a single qubit.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position. Geometric representation of density matrices... I think this relates to the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states, where pure states are on the surface and mixed states are inside.

But how exactly is the density matrix represented on the Bloch sphere? Let me recall. For a single qubit, any density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector in three-dimensional space. The vector r determines the point inside or on the Bloch sphere.

So if I can write ρ in that form, then r will give me the geometrical position.

The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute each term. |0⟩⟨0| is the projector for |0⟩, and |1⟩⟨1| is for |1⟩. Adding them gives the identity matrix, because |0⟩ and |1⟩ form an orthonormal basis. Wait, no, because |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| is actually the identity matrix for a single qubit, right?

But wait, the identity matrix is 2x2. Let's compute it. |0⟩ is [1; 0], so |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]]. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I.

So ρ becomes (1/2) * I. That is, ρ = I/2.

But how does that fit into the (I + r·σ)/2 formula? Let me write ρ as:

ρ = (I + r·σ) / 2

Wait, but I can rearrange this. So 2ρ = I + r·σ. Then, r·σ = 2ρ - I.

But since ρ is I/2, substituting that in, 2*(I/2) = I + r·σ
