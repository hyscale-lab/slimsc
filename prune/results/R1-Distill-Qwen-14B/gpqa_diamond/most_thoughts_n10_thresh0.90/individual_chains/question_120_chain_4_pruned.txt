Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, specifically how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance in astronomy. The parallax formula is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs), right? So a smaller parallax means the star is farther away.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed, so the number of stars should depend on the volume of space they occupy. Because if the distribution is uniform, the number density is constant, so the number depends on the volume. 

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of parallax, so we're looking at how many stars fall into a certain change in parallax (dplx). Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so as plx increases, distance decreases. 

Let me think about the relationship between the number of stars and parallax. Suppose I want to find how many stars are there between parallax plx and plx + dplx. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number should be proportional to the volume in that shell of space. But wait, each shell at a particular distance has a certain volume.

The volume element in spherical coordinates is 4πr² dr, where r is the distance. Since plx = 1/r, then r = 1/plx. So dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, because when plx increases, r decreases, so maybe I need to adjust that.

Let me write it out step by step. The number of stars in a thin shell between r and r + dr is proportional to the volume of that shell, which is 4πr² dr. Since the number density n is constant (uniform distribution), the number of stars N is n * 4πr² dr.

But since plx = 1/r, r = 1/plx. So plx = p, so r = 1/p. Therefore, dr = - (1/p²) dp. Hmm, but when plx increases by dp, the radius decreases. So the shell's volume in terms of parallax would relate to how dr changes with dp.

Wait, maybe it's better to express everything in terms of plx. So if I have dr = - (1/p²) dp. But when plx increases by dp, the radius r goes from 1/p to 1/(p+dp), but for small dp, it's approximately 1/p to 1/p minus (dp)/(p²). So dr is negative when dp is positive because as plx increases, r decreases.

But in terms of volume, I'm looking at the change in r. So the volume is 4πr² dr. But dr is (d r) = - dp/(p²). So the number of stars between plx p and p + dp is N = n * 4π (1/p²)² * (-dp/(p²)) ) ? Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that.

Wait, r = 1/p, so dr = derivative of (1/p) w.r. to p is -1/p². So dr = (-1/p²) dp. So when plx increases by dp, r decreases by dr = (-1/p²) dp.

So the volume of the shell between p and p+dp is 4π r² dr. Substituting r = 1/p, dr = (- dp)/(p²).

So volume shell = 4π (1/p²) * (- dp)/(p²) ) = -4π (dp) / p^4.

But since dp is positive (we're considering a small positive change in plx), the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, r decreases, so the shell volume is getting smaller as plx increases. But the number of stars is a positive quantity, so I think I should take the absolute value, which would be 4π dp / p^4.

But wait, the number of stars is the volume times the number density n. So N = n * (4π dp / p^4 ). 

But the question is about the number per unit range of plx, which is N divided by dp. So N/dp would be proportional to 1/p^4. So the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/(p)^4. 

Wait, but wait. The options don't have 1/p^4 as an option. Let me check the options again. The options are A) ~1/plx^4, B) 1/p², C) 1/p, D) 1/p^3.

Oh, option A is 1/p^4. So that would mean the number per unit plx decreases as plx increases, which makes sense because higher plx (closer stars) would have more stars in a given plx interval, but wait no, because when plx increases, the volume shell decreases, so the number of stars in each shell (per unit plx) would be smaller. So higher plx (closer stars) have more stars in each shell, so the number per unit plx would be higher. Wait, but looking at the expression N/dp ~ 1/p^4. So as p increases (star is closer), 1/p^4 becomes smaller. That suggests that the number per unit plx decreases as plx increases, which would mean more stars at lower plx (farther away), but that's not right. Because closer stars (higher plx) should be more numerous, but each unit of plx would have more stars in it. Or wait, maybe I got the math wrong.

Wait, let me rethink. The number of stars in a shell between plx p and p+dp is N = n * 4 π r² dr. But r = 1/p, dr = - dp / p². So N = n * 4 π (1/p²) * (- dp / p²) ) = -4 π n (dp)/(p^4). The negative indicates that as p increases, N decreases, which is correct because higher p (closer) have more stars, but each unit step in p includes more stars (since the shell is smaller, but density is higher? Or maybe not, because the shell volume is smaller.

Wait, maybe I should think about the number per unit plx. So N per dp (unit plx) is (N)/(dp) = (4 π n) * (1/p^4). So the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/p^4. So as p increases (higher plx), the number per unit plx decreases, which implies that you find more stars in lower plx (farther away) when you consider each unit of plx. That doesn't seem right. Because if the distribution is uniform in space, shouldn't the density be uniform, so the number per unit volume is the same everywhere. So considering a thin shell at a large r (small p), the volume of the shell is 4 π r² dr. Since r is large, each shell's volume is bigger, but dr is smaller for the same dp. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's think in terms of number density. Number density n is constant. So the number of stars in a volume V is n * V. The volume between r and r + dr is 4 π r² dr. So the number of stars between r and r + dr is n * 4 π r² dr.

But r is 1/p, so dr = - dp / p². So substituting, the number of stars between p and p + dp is n *4π (1/p²) * ( - dp / p² )= -4 π n dp / p^4.

But since we're considering dp as a positive increment, the negative sign indicates that as p increases, r decreases, so the number of stars is decreasing. So the number of stars in the shell between p and p+dp is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So the number per unit p is (number of stars) / (dp) = -4 π n / p^4. The negative sign just indicates that as p increases, the number decreases, so the magnitude is 4 π n / p^4.

So the number per unit parallax (d p) is proportional to 1/p^4. So the correct option would be A) ~1/plx^4.

But wait, the options for A is 1/p^4, but I thought the number of stars would decrease with distance, but each unit of parallax would have more stars at larger distances. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake because as p decreases (distance increases), the volume of each shell (for p) increases. Wait, no, let's think. For a given change in p, say dp, when p is small (large distance), the change in r is dr = - dp/(p²). So if p is small, dr is larger. So the volume of the shell at p is 4 π r² dr = 4 π (1/p²) * (dp/(p²)) ) = 4 π dp / p^4.

Wait, but when p is small (like p approaches zero), 1/p^4 is large, so the volume of each shell is larger for smaller p. So more stars would be in the shells with smaller p (farther away). So the number per unit p would be higher for smaller p. Which would imply that as p increases (closer), each unit p has fewer stars. So if you have a given range of p, like from 1 to 2, the number of stars per unit p would be higher for lower p.

But according to our earlier calculation, the number per unit p is proportional to 1/p^4. So as p increases, the number per unit p decreases. Which would mean that for higher p (closer stars), the number per unit p is lower. That doesn't seem right. Because closer stars (higher p) are more numerous in absolute numbers, but when considering per unit p, maybe the density drops.

Wait, let me think about this again. Suppose we have a number density n (stars per volume). The number of stars in a shell between p and p + dp is N = n * 4 π (1/p)^2 * ( - dp / p^2 ). The negative is because as p increases, r decreases, so the shell volume is decreasing. But the number of stars should be proportional to the shell volume.

Wait, but if p is small (distance large), then each shell has a larger volume, so more stars in each shell. But when you look at the number per unit p, for each dp, you have more stars when p is small, so the number per unit p would be higher. So the number per unit p (N/dp) is proportional to 1/p^4, which as p increases, this number decreases. So at high p (close stars), the number of stars per unit p is lower. But in reality, close stars are more numerous, so in each unit of p, you might have more. I'm getting confused here.

Wait, maybe I should consider the cumulative number. The total number of stars with plx less than p is the integral from 0 to p of n *4 π (1/p')^2 * ( - dp'). But that's getting complicated. Alternatively, considering that the number per unit p is proportional to 1/p^4, but that seems to suggest that as p increases, the number of stars per unit p decreases. So when p is higher, each unit of p (like from 1 to 2) has fewer stars than when p is low (like from 0.1 to 0.2). 

But in reality, as p increases, the distance decreases, so more stars are closer. Wait, but the number of stars per unit volume is the same everywhere, so in a small
