Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected using the Radial Velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits. Also, their host stars have the same radii, but the star of Planet_1 is more massive—twice as much as Planet_2's star. Hmm.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers want to observe the one with the higher probability. The options give different ratios for the probabilities, so I need to calculate which planet has a higher chance.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the relative size of the planet's orbit compared to the star's size. The formula I think is something like P = (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e^2)), but since both orbits are circular, the eccentricity term (e) is zero, so it simplifies. So P is proportional to (R_star / a_planet).

Wait, but wait—no, actually, I think the formula for the probability (p) of a transit is given by:

p = (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet

But wait, the R_planet is usually much smaller than R_star, so sometimes it's approximated as p ≈ (R_star) / a_planet. But in reality, since we don't have the planet radii here, maybe that term is negligible. So perhaps we can proceed with p ≈ R_star / a_planet.

But wait, the problem says that both host stars have the same radii. So R1 = R2 = R. So for both planets, the R_star is same.

So the probability depends on 1/a_planet. The shorter the orbital period, the smaller the semi-major axis (since a is determined by Kepler's third law, which relates period to a^3 and the mass of the star).

Wait, right. Kepler's third law says that P^2 = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a^3. But since the planet mass is much smaller than the star, M >> m, so P^2 ∝ a^3 / M. So a^3 = (G M P²)/(4π²), but for our purpose, a is proportional to (P² M)^(1/3).

Wait, yes. So a = [(G M * P^2) / (4π²)]^(1/3). Since M is in the denominator? Wait, no, the formula is a^3 = (G(M+m) P^2)/(4π²). So a^3 is proportional to (M * P^2). So a is proportional to (M)^(1/3) * (P)^(2/3).

So when comparing a1 and a2, given that M1 = 2 M2, and P1 = P2 /3. Wait, P1 is three times shorter than P2. So P2 is 3 P1.

Wait, let me write that:

Given:

M1 = 2 M2

P1 = P2 / 3

So for a1:

a1 ∝ (M1)^(1/3) * (P1)^(2/3) = (2 M2)^(1/3) * ( (P2/3) )^(2/3 )

Similarly, a2 ∝ (M2)^(1/3) * (P2)^(2/3)

Let me compute a1 / a2 = [ (2)^(1/3) * (1/3)^(2/3) ) ] * (M2^(1/3) * P2^(2/3)) / (M2^(1/3) * P2^(2/3)) )

Wait, no, more accurately, a1 = k * (2 M2)^(1/3) * (P2/3)^(2/3 )

a2 = k * (M2)^(1/3) * (P2)^(2/3 )

So a1 = k * (2)^(1/3) * (M2)^(1/3) * (P2)^(2/3) * (1/3)^(2/3 )

So a1 = a2 * (2)^(1/3) * (1/3)^(2/3 )

Calculate that factor:

2^(1/3) is cube root of 2 ≈ 1.26

1/3 is 0.333...; (1/3)^(2/3) is the same as (3^(-1))^(2/3) = 3^(-2/3) ≈ 1/(3^(2/3)) ≈ 1/(2.08) ≈ 0.4807.

So 1.26 * 0.4807 ≈ 0.606.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 * a2.

So a1 is about 0.606 times a2. So a2 is about 1.65 times a1.

But wait, because a is in the denominator of the probability. So p1 = R/(a1), p2 = R/(a2). Since R is same for both, the probability is inversely proportional to a.

So p1 / p2 = a2 / a1 ≈ (1.65 a1) / a1 = 1.65.

Wait, no, let me think. Because if a1 is 0.606 a2, then p1 = R/a1 = R/(0.606 a2) ≈ (1/0.606) * (R/a2) ) = approx 1.65 * (R/a2).

But p2 is R/a2. So p1 is 1.65 times p2.

So the probability for Planet_1 to transit is higher than Planet_2's by about 1.65 times.

But wait, wait. Let me clarify.

If a1 is smaller than a2, because a is in the denominator, the probability p is higher when a is smaller.

Since a1 is smaller than a2, p1 = R/a1 is larger than p2=R/a2.

So a1 is smaller, so p1 is higher.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher. So the researchers should prefer to observe Planet_1.

So which option says that Planet_1 is preferred with a probability ~1.65 times higher? Let me look at the options.

Options:

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to 2.25 times higher.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to 1.5 times higher.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to 2.7 times higher.

So option C says 1.65 times, which matches our calculation. So the correct answer should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps using a formula directly.

The transit probability is p = (R_*/a) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e^2)), but e is zero here, so p = R_*/a.

Since R* is same for both, p is inversely proportional to a.

So a1 is (M1)^(1/3) * (P1)^(2/3) / (M_total)^(1/3), but perhaps another approach is better.

We can compute the ratio a2/a1.

Because a ∝ (M P²)^1/3.

So a2/a1 = [ (M2 P2²) / (M1 P1²) ) ]^(1/3)

Given that M1 = 2 M2 and P1 = P2 /3.

So substituting:

a2/a1 = [ (M2 * P2²) / (2 M2 * (P2/3)^2) ) ]^(1/3)

Simplify denominator: 2 M2 * (P2² / 9 ) = (2/9) M2 P2²

So numerator is M2 P2².

Ratio inside becomes [ (M2 P2²) / ( (2/9) M2 P2² ) ) ] = (1) / (2/9) ) = 9/2.

So [9/2]^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65.

So a2 = a1 * 1.65.

Which means a1 = a2 / 1.65 ≈ 0.606 a2.

Thus, p1 = R/a1 = R/(0.606 a2) ≈ 1.65 R/(a2) = 1.65 p2.

So p1 is 1.65 times p2. So probability for Planet_1 is higher. So they should choose Planet_1.

Thus, option C is correct.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula:

\[
p = \frac{R_\text{star}}{a_\text{planet}}
\]

where \( R_\text{star} \) is the radius of the host star, and \( a_\text{planet} \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_\text{star,1} = R_\text{star,2} \)), the probability depends inversely on \( a_\text{planet} \). A shorter orbital period (\( P \)) and a more massive host star (\( M_\text{star} \)) result in a smaller semi-major axis (\( a_\text{planet} \)), increasing the transit probability.

Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis is proportional to:

\[
a_\text{planet} \propto \left( M_\text{star} \cdot P^2 \right)^{1/3}
\]

For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) (Planet_1's host star is twice as massive as Planet_2's host star).
- \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) (Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's).

The ratio of the semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{M_1 \cdot P_1^2}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2} \right)^{1/3}
\]

Substituting \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) and \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \):

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{2M_2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \). Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a_\text{planet} \), the probability ratio is:

\[
\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.

**Correct Answer:**

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.
