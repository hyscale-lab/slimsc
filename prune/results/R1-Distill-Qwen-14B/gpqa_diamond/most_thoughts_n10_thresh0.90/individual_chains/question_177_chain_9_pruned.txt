Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times Star_2's. The problem says that the wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember from my studies that the wavelength of maximum emission for a black body is given by Wien's Law. So Wien's Law says that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature, right? So lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant.

If both stars have the same peak wavelength, that means their temperatures must be the same. Because if lambda_max is the same, then T must be the same. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but the question is about their luminosities. Oh right, luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula for luminosity when considering a star as a black body is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Since both stars have the same temperature, T, the ratio of their luminosities should depend on the square of their radii. Wait, because L is proportional to R² T⁴. Since T is same, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2.

Wait, the problem states that Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. So (R1/R2)^2 is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 would be 2.25 times L2. But wait, the options don't have exactly 2.25 as the first choice, but let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, A is ~2.25, D is ~2.23. Hmm, but wait I might have missed something. Because the question also mentions radial velocities. Oh right, the radial velocities are given as 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Hmm, how does that affect things?

Wait, radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. Does that affect the observed wavelength? Because when a star is moving towards or away from us, there's a Doppler shift. If Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, its light would be blueshifted. But the question says that the wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. So if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed wavelength would be shorter than its rest wavelength. But the problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So perhaps the Doppler shift is accounted for in the observed wavelengths.

Wait, but if Star_2 is moving, then when the astronomers calculate the temperature, they would correct for the Doppler shift. Because the observed wavelength is affected by the star's velocity. So the actual temperature of Star_2 would be different from what we observe, right?

Wait, no, because the problem says that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So perhaps the Doppler shift affects the temperature calculation. Because if Star_2 is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter, implying higher temperature. But the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same, so their temperatures as measured from the spectrum would be the same. So, perhaps the actual temperatures are different, but when you correct for the Doppler shift, you get the same temperature.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.

Wien's Law: lambda_max = b / T_observed. If Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed wavelength is shorter, so we would infer a higher temperature. But the problem says that the peak wavelengths are the same. So if Star_1 is stationary (radial velocity 0), its lambda_max is based on its actual temperature T1. For Star_2, which has a velocity v, its observed lambda_max would be lambda_max_obs = lambda_max2 * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), if v_r is the radial velocity as a fraction of the speed of light. Or wait, no, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) ), assuming v_r is the radial velocity towards us (so positive if moving towards, negative away). So if Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, its observed wavelength is shorter.

But in the problem, the observed wavelengths are the same. So lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2. So lambda_rest1 / T1 = lambda_rest2 / T2 (because Wien's law says lambda_rest is b/T). But wait, no, because lambda_obs is lambda_rest * sqrt(...), but the problem says lambda_obs is same for both. So let me write that.

Let me denote:
lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

But for Star_1, v is 0, so lambda_obs1 = lambda_rest1.

For Star_2, v is 700 km/s towards us, so lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + (700e3)/(c)) / (1 - (700e3)/(c)) )

But the problem states that lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2. So:

lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c) )

But lambda_rest is related to the star's temperature. From Wien's law, lambda_rest = b / T. So:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c) )

The b's cancel out, so:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c) )

So,

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c) )

Hmm, because solving for T1/T2:

T1 / T2 = sqrt( (1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c) )

So T1 is less than T2 because Star_2 is moving towards us, making its observed lambda shorter, implying higher T. But since lambda_rest1 is same as lambda_rest2 multiplied by that Doppler factor, which depends on velocity.

Wait, but the problem states that lambda_obs are the same. So after Doppler shift, Star_2's lambda_obs equals Star_1's lambda_obs.

Let me calculate the factor. The velocity is 700 km/s. The speed of light c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So 700 is about 0.002333... times c. So v2 is 700e3 m/s, but wait, c is 3e5 km/s, which is 3e8 m/s. So 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s, which is approximately (7e5)/(3e8) ) = 0.002333 c.

So the Doppler factor sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) is sqrt( (1 + 0.002333)/(1 - 0.002333) ) ≈ sqrt( 1.002333 / 0.997667 ). Let me compute that.

1.002333 / 0.997667 ≈ (approx 1.002333 * 1.002345) ) Wait, maybe I can approximate it. Let's compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 1 + 0.002333 = 1.002333
Denominator: 1 - 0.002333 = 0.997667

So the ratio is approximately 1.002333 / 0.997667 ≈ 1.0047.

So the square root of that is sqrt(1.0047) ≈ 1.00234.

Wait, wait, let me compute it more accurately. Let me compute 1.002333 / 0.997667.

1.002333 / 0.997667 = (1 + 0.002333) / (1 - 0.002333) 

Using the approximation (1+x)/(1-x) ≈ 1 + 2x for small x. Here x is 0.002333, which is small.

So (1+ x)/(1 -x) ≈ 1 + 2x. So 2x is 0.004666, so the ratio is approximately 1.004666.

So the square root is sqrt(1.004666) ≈ 1 + (0.004666/2) = 1.002333.

So sqrt(1.004666) ≈ 1.002333.

So, the Doppler factor is approximately 1.002333.

So, 1/T1 = (1/T2) * 1.002333 → T1 = T2 / 1.002333 ≈ T2 * 0.99767.

So T1 is about 0.99767 times T2. So T1 is slightly less than T2.

Wait, but isn't that the opposite? Because Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed lambda is shorter, which would make us think it's hotter. But since the observed lambda_obs is same as Star_1, which is stationary, the rest lambda of Star_2 must be longer, which would mean its actual temperature is lower? Hmm, wait.

Wait, let me get this straight: when a star moves towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter. So if lambda_obs is same for both, to have the same observed wavelength, the rest wavelength of Star_2 must be longer than Star_1's rest wavelength. Because when Star_2's wavelength is stretched (due to moving towards us), the observed is same as Star_1's. Wait, no, that's not correct. When a star moves towards us, the observed wavelength is blueshifted (shorter). So if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed lambda is shorter than its rest lambda. But in this problem, both have same observed lambda, so Star_2's rest lambda must be longer than Star_1's rest lambda because when you apply the Doppler shift (shortening), they match.

Wait, let's think again. Let me denote lambda_rest for Star_1 as lambda1, Star_2 as lambda2. Their observed lambdas are lambda1_obs = lambda1 (since v1=0), and lambda2_obs = lambda2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) ). And lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs.

So lambda1 = lambda2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But from Wien's Law, lambda_rest = b / T. So:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Canceling b:

1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

So, T1 = T2 / sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Which is T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

So with v2 = 700 km/s, which is about 0.002333 c.

So (1 - v2/c) ≈ 0.997667, (1 + v2/c) ≈ 1.002333.

The ratio (0.997667 / 1.002333) is approximately 0.99537.

Taking square root: sqrt(0.99537) ≈ 0.99768.

So T1 ≈ T2 * 0.99768.

So T1 is about 0.99768 times T2, which is a temperature a bit lower than T2.

Wait, but earlier I thought the opposite. Maybe I got that wrong. Let me think: If Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed wavelength is shorter. So the observed lambda is same as Star_1, which is stationary. So Star_2 must have a longer rest wavelength than Star_1. Because when you blueshift it (shorten), it's same as Star_1's lambda, which is not blueshifted. So Star_2's rest lambda is longer, which implies that T2 is lower than T1. Because lambda is inversely proportional to T.

Wait, that's conflicting with what I got earlier. Because when I plugged the numbers, I found T1 ≈ 0.99768 T2, which would mean T1 is lower than T2. But if Star_2 is moving towards us, and we see the same lambda, then Star_2's rest lambda must be longer, implying T2 is lower than T1. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculation.

Let me re-examine the equations.

From lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2:

lambda1 = lambda2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c) )

Because lambda_obs is lambda_rest multiplied by the Doppler factor.

Wait, no, wait. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

lambda_observed = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

Wait, no. The exact Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving towards the observer is:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me recall: if the source is moving towards the observer, the observed wavelength is shorter: blueshifted. The formula is:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ), where beta = v/c.

Wait, let me double-check the Doppler shift formula. For a source moving towards the observer with speed v, the observed frequency is higher, so wavelength is shorter.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Where beta = v/c.

Similarly, frequency is observed as f_obs = f_rest * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So, with beta = 700e3 / 3e5 = 7e5 / 3e5 = 7/3 ≈ 2.333...e-3, which is about 0.002333.

So, the factor inside the square root is (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) = (1 - 0.002333)/(1 + 0.002333) ≈ (0.997667)/(1.002333) ≈ 0.99537.

The square root of that is about 0.99768.

So, lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 * 0.99768.

But lambda_obs1 = lambda_rest1 because Star_1 is stationary.

So, since lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2:

lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 * 0.99768.

But lambda_rest is proportional to 1/T. So lambda_rest1 / lambda_rest2 = 0.99768 → (1/T1) / (1/T2) )= 0.99768 → T2/T1 = 0.99768 → T1 = T2 / 0.99768 ≈ T2 * 1.00234.

So, T1 is approximately 1.00234 times T2. So Star_1 is a bit hotter than Star_2.

Wait, that makes sense now. Because if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed wavelength is shorter, so we would infer a higher temperature. But in this case, their observed wavelengths are same, so to get the same observed lambda, Star_1 must be hotter than Star_2. Because when Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed lambda is shorter, so to match, Star
