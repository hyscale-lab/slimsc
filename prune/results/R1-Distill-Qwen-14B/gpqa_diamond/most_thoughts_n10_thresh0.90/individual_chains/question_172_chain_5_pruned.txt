Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's break it down.

The question states that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, when atoms are excited, they're in higher energy states, which relates to their temperature because thermal energy causes electrons to jump to higher energy levels.

I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution. Oh yeah, it's used to determine the population of particles in different energy states based on temperature. The formula is something like the ratio of populations being proportional to the exponential of the energy difference divided by k*T. So the population ratio (n_upper/n_lower) is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)).

Wait, but wait. In this case, star_1 has twice as excited atoms as star_2. So, the fraction of excited atoms in star_1 is higher. Let me think. Let's denote the fraction for star_1 as n1 and star_2 as n2. So n1 = 2 * n2? Or is it the other way around? Wait, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited". Oh, maybe the excitation is higher, so more atoms are in that specific excited energy level in star_1 compared to star_2. So n1 is greater than n2.

Wait, but wait, in the Boltzmann equation, the ratio is n_i / n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Assuming E_i is higher than E_j, so E_i - E_j is positive. So higher T would lead to a lower ratio, because the exponential would be small when (E_i-E_j)/(kT) is small.

Wait, in this question, the energy difference ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let's denote ΔE as E_upper - E_lower. So for each star, the population ratio is n_upper / n_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, but wait, the problem says the energy difference is approximately 1.38e-23 J. So that's the ΔE between the two levels. So for each star, the ratio of excited atoms (n_upper) to ground (n_lower) is given by the Boltzmann factor
