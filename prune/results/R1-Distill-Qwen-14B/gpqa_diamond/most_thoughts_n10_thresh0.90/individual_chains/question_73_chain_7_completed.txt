Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, you can't just add the velocities like you would in classical mechanics. Oh right, that's the addition of velocities in special relativity.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the relative speed between them. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed isn't just the difference of their speeds. But wait, no—actually, in relativity, you can't just subtract the velocities directly. I should use the velocity addition formula. Oh wait, no, wait. The velocity addition formula is for transforming between different reference frames. But here, both are moving in the same direction relative to the same observer. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, no. Wait, the relative speed is how fast one is moving from the other's perspective. Oh right, the velocity of astronaut B as seen from astronaut A's frame. So I need to calculate that using the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula for relative velocity is (v - u) / (1 - (v u)/c²), where v is the speed of B in the lab frame, and u is the speed of A in the lab frame. Or wait, wait. Let me get this straight. Let me denote the velocities: astronaut A is moving at v_A = 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at v_B = 0.5c. But wait, both are in the positive x-direction. So from A's frame, what's B's speed?

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think from the perspective of A. So A is at rest, and B is moving at (v_B - v_A) divided by (1 - (v_B v_A)/(c²)).

Wait, wait no—wait, the velocity of B as seen from A's frame is (v_B - v_A)/(1 - (v_A v_B)/(c²)). Because A is moving at 0.6c in the lab frame, so in A's frame, the lab is moving at -0.6c, and B's velocity is 0.5c in the lab. So from A's frame, B's velocity is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²) = (-0.1c) / (1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/(0.7) ≈ -0.1428c. So the magnitude is about 0.1428c, which is roughly 0.14c. Hmm, so the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. So the options that have 0.14c are C and D.

Now for the total energy, I think I need to calculate the rest energy plus the kinetic energy or total relativistic energy. The total energy of each astronaut is gamma times their rest mass energy. So for astronaut A: gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v_A²/c²)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy of A is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B: gamma_B = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So energy of B is approximately 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy of the system is 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c², which is approximately 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c, which matches. Option D has E=5 mc², which is lower.

So the correct answer would be option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².


To determine the relative speed and total energy of the system, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Relative Speed
The relative speed of astronaut B as seen from astronaut A's frame is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_B - v_A}{1 - \frac{v_A v_B}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_A = 0.6c\) and \(v_B = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The magnitude of the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For astronaut A (\(v_A = 0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_A = \gamma_A (2m c^2) = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For astronaut B (\(v_B = 0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_B = \gamma_B (3m c^2) \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: C**
