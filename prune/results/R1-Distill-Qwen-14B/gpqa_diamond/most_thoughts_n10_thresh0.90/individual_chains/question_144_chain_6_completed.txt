Okay, so I have this physics problem about meson resonance and its decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question gives me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are A to D, with various numbers.

Wait, mesons are subatomic particles, right? And when they're produced, they can decay after some time. The mean decay distance would depend on how long they live on average and how fast they're moving.

So, I remember that the decay width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime τ. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Or wait, no, actually, Γ is the total decay rate, and τ is the mean lifetime. The relation is τ = ħ / Γ. Because Γ has units of energy, and ħ has units of energy times time, so dividing ħ by Γ (energy) gives time. Yeah that's right.

But wait, the decay width Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is in eV·s. So I'll need to convert units correctly.

Next, the mean lifetime τ is the average time the meson exists before decaying. Once I have τ, I can find out how far it travels. But how fast is it moving?

The meson is produced with energy E_X =8 GeV. So I need to find its velocity, which depends on its energy. Since its mass is 1.2 GeV, the kinetic energy is high, so it's probably moving relativistically.

The energy of a relativistic particle is E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. The mass is m_X =1.2 GeV/c². So E =8 GeV.

So let's compute γ first. γ = E / (m c²). But since m is in GeV/c², and E is in GeV, it's just γ = E/(m) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666... So γ is about 6.6667.

Now, the velocity v can be found from γ. Because γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Solving for v.

Alternatively, another approach: the beta factor β = v/c. For high energies, β ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) ≈ 1 - (1/(2γ²)), but maybe it's better to compute it precisely.

Wait, yes, let's compute β. We can rearrange γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). So 1/γ² = 1 - β² → β² = 1 - 1/γ² → β = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²).

So γ is 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666..., which is 20/3. So 1/γ² is (3/20)^2 = 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - 1/γ² is 0.9775. The square root of that is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ let's see, 0.9887 approx. So β is about 0.9887. So the speed is about 0.9887c.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(0.9775) more accurately. Let's see, 0.9775 is 1 - 0.0225. The square root of (1 - x) is approximately 1 - x/2 - x²/8 for small x. So x is 0.0225, which is 2.25%. So sqrt ≈ 1 - 0.01125 - (0.0225)^2/8. (0.0225)^2 is about 0.00050625, divided by 8 is about 0.00006328. So sqrt ≈ 1 - 0.01125 - 0.00006328 ≈ 0.98868672. So about 0.9887, so v is approximately 0.9887c.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute it more accurately. Let's compute 0.9775. Let's see, sqrt(0.9775)= ?

Let me think, 0.98^2 is 0.9604. 0.988^2 = (0.98 +0.008)^2 = 0.98² + 2*0.98*0.008 + 0.008² = 0.9604 + 0.01568 + 0.000064 ≈ 0.976144. Wait, that's less than 0.9775.

Wait, 0.988^2= (0.98 + 0.008)^2 = (0.98)^2 + 2*(0.98)(0.008) + (0.008)^2.

0.98^2 = 0.9604.

2*0.98*0.008 = 0.01568.

0.008^2 = 0.000064.

Adding them: 0.9604 +0.01568 = 0.97608 +0.000064 = 0.976144.

So 0.988^2 = 0.976144. But we have 0.9775, which is 0.001356 higher.

So let's find x such that (0.988 + x)^2 = 0.9775.

Expanding: (0.988)^2 + 2*0.988*x + x² = 0.9775.

We know (0.988)^2 is 0.976144. So:

0.976144 + 2*0.988*x + x² = 0.9775.

Subtract 0.976144: 2*0.988*x +x² = 0.001356.

Assuming x is small, x² is negligible. So, 2 *0.988 *x ≈ 0.001356 → x ≈ 0.001356/(2*0.988) ≈ 0.001356/(1.976) ≈ approx 0.000687.

So x is about 0.000687. So beta is approximately 0.988 +0.000687= 0.988687. So v=0.988687 c.

So v ≈ 0.9887c.

Now, the mean lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, wait. Γ is the total width, which is 320 MeV. So Γ = 320 MeV, but ħ has units of eV·s. So I need to convert Γ into eV.

Wait, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. So 320 MeV is 320e6 eV.

So ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, let me get the exact value. Planck constant ħ is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm, but wait, more precisely, I think ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm, but we might have to be careful.

Wait, ħ is approximately 6.582 ×10^-25 GeV·s. Or if we use units in terms of MeV and seconds, perhaps it's better to convert.

But perhaps it's easier to use natural units where c=1 and ħ=197.33 MeV·fm. Wait, but no, because I'm dealing with time and distance.

Wait, let me think. We can use the formula τ = ħ / Γ, but Γ should be in the same units as ħ.

So I need to express Γ in the same units as ħ. Let me check the value of ħ in eV·s.

The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 ×10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, GeV is 1e9 eV. So 6.582e-25 GeV·s is 6.582e-25 * 1e9 eV·s = 6.582e-16 eV·s.

Alternatively, in MeV units, ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s = 6.582e-25 * 1e3 MeV·s = 6.582e-22 MeV·s.

Wait, no, 1 GeV = 1000 MeV. So 1 GeV = 1e3 MeV. So 6.582e-25 GeV·s is 6.582e-25 * 1e3 MeV·s = 6.582e-22 MeV·s.

So ħ ≈ 6.582e-22 MeV·s.

Wait, no, wait. Let me confirm:

ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 J·s.

But 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So 1 MeV = 1e6 eV = 1.602e-13 J.

So 1 MeV·s = 1.602e-13 J·s.

So ħ in MeV·s is (6.582e-25 J·s) / (1.602e-13 J/eV) ) = (6.582e-25 / 1.602e-13) eV·s.

Wait, 6.582e-25 / 1.602e-13 = (6.582 / 1.602) )e-12 ≈ approx 4.107e-12 eV·s.

But wait, that can't be right. Because 6.582e-25 J·s is equal to ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 J·s.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me find the value of ħ in MeV·s.

I think another approach: ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm. Because I remember that ħ c ≈ 197 MeV·fm. So 1 fm is 1e-15 meters.

So if ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm, then ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm) / c.

But I'm not sure if that's helpful here. Maybe just look up the correct value.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me use the following approach:

The mean lifetime τ is τ = ħ / Γ.

Γ is given as 320 MeV. So in units where ħ is in MeV·s, τ is in seconds.

So, I need the value of ħ in MeV·s.

Looking up, Planck constant ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

Since 1 GeV is 1e3 MeV, 6.582e-25 GeV·s = 6.582e-25 * 1e3 MeV·s = 6.582e-22 MeV·s.

So ħ = 6.582e-22 MeV·s.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-22 MeV·s ) / (320 MeV) ) = (6.582e-22 / 320 ) s.

Compute that:

6.582e-22 / 320 → 6.582 / 320 = approx 0.02056875 → 2.056875e-2 → then times 1e-20? Wait, wait, 6.582e-22 divided by 320 (which is 3.2e2) is (6.582 / 3.2e2 ) )e-22 → (approx 2.056e-2 )e-22 → 2.056e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait no: the exponents. 6.582e-22 / 3.2e2 = (6.582 / 3.2 )e-24 → 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, that seems extremely short. Is that correct? Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 6.582e-22 MeV·s divided by 320 MeV is indeed 6.582e-22 / 320 = 2.056875e-24 seconds. Okay, that's correct.

Now, the mean decay distance is the speed multiplied by the lifetime: L = v * τ.

v is approximately 0.9887c. c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute this:

First, 0.9887 *3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s: 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875 )e-16.

Compute 2.966 *2.056875. Let's see:

2 *2.056875 =4.11375.

0.966 *2.056875 = let's compute 0.966*2 =1.932, 0.966*0.056875≈ 0.055. So total about 1.987. So total 4.11375 + 1.987 =6.099 approx.

Wait, let me compute it accurately:

2.966 *2.056875.

Breakdown:

2 *2.056875 =4.11375.

0.966 *2.056875.

Compute 0.966 * 2 =1.932.

0.966 *0.056875 = 0.055 approximately.

So total 1.932 + 0.055=1.987.

So total 4.11375 +1.987=6.099 approx.

So 6.099e-16 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A: 5.0223 * 10^-16 m

Option C:5.0223e-15.

Hmm, my calculation gives about 6.1e-16 m, but none of the options match that. Wait, did I make a mistake?

Ah, maybe I messed up the calculation of beta. Let me double-check.

Wait, gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 ≈6.6667.

So, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/ gamma^2 )) = sqrt(1 - (3/20)^2 )= sqrt(1 - 9/400)= sqrt(391/400)=sqrt(0.9775)= approximately 0.9887 as before.

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the lifetime.

Wait, I used ħ =6.582e-22 MeV·s. Let me confirm that value.

Yes, because 1 GeV is 1e3 MeV, so 6.582e-25 GeV·s is 6.582e-22 MeV·s.

So that's correct.

Γ is 320 MeV, so 6.582e-22 / 320 = indeed 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So that seems correct.

Then, L = v * tau = 0.9887 c * tau.

c is 3e8 m/s, so 0.9887 *3e8 = approx 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s: 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 *2.056875 )e-16 m.

As before, approx 6.09e-16 m.

But none of the options are near 6e-16. The options are around 4e-15, 5e-15, 4e-16, 5e-16.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, the energy E is given as 8 GeV. The mass is 1.2 GeV.

Wait, the formula for gamma is E/(m c²). But E here is the total energy, which includes rest mass energy. So E = gamma m c².

So gamma is E/(m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) )=6.6667, which is correct.

Wait, another thought: the decay width is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ → τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, in particle physics, the width Γ is often given in MeV, and the relation is τ = ħ / Γ. So perhaps, when Γ is given in MeV, what is the correct way to compute τ?

Wait, I think I should use Γ in units of energy, so MeV, and ħ in units appropriate for that.

Another thought: perhaps I should use the formula L = c * tau * beta.

Because tau is the proper time, and the lab frame sees the lifetime as longer due to time dilation. Wait, but tau is the proper time, so in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau.

Wait, no, wait: the proper lifetime is tau_0 = tau = ħ / Γ. The lab frame sees the lifetime as longer by gamma: tau_lab = gamma * tau_0.

Because the particle is moving at high speed, its lifetime is longer in the lab frame.

So earlier mistake: I used tau = ħ/Γ. But in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by gamma. So I should have multiplied tau by gamma.

Ah! There's the mistake. So let me correct that.

So, the proper lifetime tau_0 is ħ / Γ. But in the lab frame, the lifetime is tau_lab = gamma * tau_0.

So, in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * (ħ/Γ).

So that changes the calculation.

Let me recalculate.

Tau_lab = gamma * (ħ/Γ).

Now, gamma is 6.6667.

So Tau_lab = (6.6667) * (6.582e-22 MeV·s) / (320 MeV).

Compute this:

6.6667 * (6.582e-22 ) / 320.

Let me compute numerator:

6.6667 *6.582e-22 ≈ (approx 6.582 * 6.6667) = let's compute 6*6.582=39.492, 0.6667*6.582≈4.388 → total ≈43.88e-22.

Divide by 320: 43.88e-22 / 320 ≈ 1.371e-23 seconds.

So Tau_lab is approximately 1.371e-23 seconds.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute more accurately.

6.6667 *6.582e-22 = ?

6.6667 *6.582 = ?

6 *6.582 =39.492.

0.6667 *6.582 ≈ 4.388.

Total is approximately 39.492 +4.388=43.88.

So 43.88e-22 seconds.

Divide by 320: 43.88e-22 / 320 = (43.88 / 320 )e-22 → approx 0.1371e-22 → 1.371e-23 seconds.

So tau_lab = 1.371e-23 seconds.

Now, the mean decay distance is L = v * tau_lab.

v is beta * c = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So L = 2.966e8 m/s * 1.371e-23 s.

Multiply them: 2.966e8 *1.371e-23 = (2.966 *1.371 )e-15.

Compute 2.966 *1.371.

2 *1.371 =2.742.

0.966 *1.371 → approx 1.322.

So total approx 2.742 +1.322=4.064.

So 4.064e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m and option C is 5.02e-15.

So 4.06e-15 is very close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m.

So the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we start by analyzing the given parameters: production energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \), and decay width \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} \). The mean decay distance \( L \) depends on the particle's velocity \( v \), its lifetime \( \tau \), and the relationship \( L = v \tau \).

### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \)
The total energy of the particle is related to the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) by \( E = \gamma m c^2 \). Since \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \) and \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), we find:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the velocity \( v \)
The velocity \( v \) can be derived from \( \gamma \) using the relation \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Rearranging, we find:

\[
v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{44.444}} = c \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887c
\]

Thus, \( v \approx 0.9887c \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).

### Step 3: Calculate the lifetime \( \tau \)
The mean lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

The reduced Planck constant \( \hbar \) is approximately \( 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \). Converting \( \Gamma \) to GeV (\( 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \)):

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \, \text{s} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
The mean decay distance is given by \( L = v \tau \). Substituting \( v \approx 0.9887c \) and \( \tau \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = (0.9887c)(\tau) = (0.9887)(3 \times 10^8) \times (2.056875 \times 10^{-24})
\]

\[
L = (2.966 \times 10^8) \times (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) \, \text{m}
\]

\[
L = 6.106 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Correct for time dilation
The proper lifetime \( \tau_0 \) is related to the lab frame lifetime \( \tau \) by \( \tau = \gamma \tau_0 \). Thus, the lab frame lifetime is:

\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau_0 = \gamma \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \), \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), and \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \frac{6.6667 \times 6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \, \text{s} \approx 1.371 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}
\]

Now, calculate \( L \) using \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \):

\[
L = (0.9887c)(\tau_{\text{lab}}) = (0.9887)(3 \times 10^8) \times (1.371 \times 10^{-23})
\]

\[
L = (2.966 \times 10^8) \times (1.371 \times 10^{-23}) \, \text{m}
\]

\[
L = 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Final Answer:
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
