Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. It's about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator for a muon. Hmm, I remember that eigenvectors are vectors that only change by a scalar factor when an operator is applied. So, the operator here is P, and we're looking for its eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, the problem gives me the components of the operator P in terms of 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So P_x, P_y, and P_z each are ħ/2 times these specific matrices. Let me write them down.

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]. P_y is (ħ/2)*[[0,-i],[i,0]], and P_z is (ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]]. Oh right, these look familiar. These are the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2, which often come up in spin-1/2 systems. Like for the spin operators S_x, S_y, S_z, but scaled by ħ/2 here.

The operator in question is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, which means the y-component is zero. So n can be represented as (nx, 0, nz). Since it's a unit vector, nx² + nz² = 1.

The operator vector P is given by P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z) = nx P_x + nz P_z. So, we need to find the eigenvector of this operator with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So, let's write the equation:

P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Breaking it down, P = nx (P_x) + nz (P_z), so:

(nx P_x + nz P_z) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Let me compute the matrix form of P. Let's factor out ħ/2:

P = (ħ/2) [ nx * [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ].

So, the matrix inside the brackets is:

[ nz, nx ]
[ nx, -nz ]

So, the entire operator P is:

(ħ/2) * [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ].

So, the eigenvalue equation is:

(ħ/2) * [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ] * |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Multiplying both sides by 2/ħ to simplify:

[ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ] |ψ> = |ψ>.

So, the matrix equation becomes:

[nz a + nx b, nx a - nz b]^T = [a, b]^T.

So, the equations are:

nz a + nx b = a,
nx a - nz b = b.

Hmm, let's write them as:

(nz - 1) a + nx b = 0,
nx a + (-nz - 1) b = 0.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. Wait, the first equation is nz a + nx b = a, which can be written as (nz - 1) a + nx b = 0.

Similarly, the second equation is nx a - nz b = b, which becomes nx a + (-nz -1) b = 0.

So, the system of equations is:

(nz -1) a + nx b = 0,
nx a + (-nz -1) b = 0.

This is a homogeneous system, so we can write the determinant of the coefficients as zero for non-trivial solutions.

The matrix for the coefficients is:

[ (nz -1), nx       ]
[ nx,       (-nz -1) ]

The determinant is (nz -1)(-nz -1) - (nx)^2 = 0.

Calculating that:

(nz -1)(-nz -1) = (-nz^2 -nz + nz + 1) = (-nz^2 + 1).

So, determinant is (-nz² + 1) - nx² = 0.

But since n is a unit vector in x-z plane, nx² + nz² = 1. So, nx² = 1 - nz².

Substituting into determinant equation:

(-nz² + 1) - (1 - nz²) = 0 → -nz² +1 -1 + nz² = 0 → 0=0.

So the equations are dependent, which makes sense because the operator is 2x2 and we're looking for eigenvectors.

So, let's take the first equation:

(nz -1) a + nx b = 0 → (nz -1) a = -nx b → a = [ -nx / (nz -1) ] b.

Hmm, but perhaps it's easier to express in terms of a ratio. Let me let b = 1 (or any constant), then solve for a.

So, from the first equation:

a = [ -nx / (nz -1) ] * b.

Let me compute this:

a = [ -nx / (nz -1) ].

But perhaps I can find a better way. Let me write the eigenvector as [a, b], and express a in terms of b.

So, a = [ (1 - nz) / nx ] * b. Because rearranging (nz -1)a = -nx b → a = (nx (1 - nz))^{-1} b.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the ratio a/b.

Let me denote the ratio r = a/b.

So from the first equation:

(nz -1) a + nx b = 0 → (nz -1) r + nx = 0 → r = -nx/(nz - 1).

Hmm, wait, let's compute (nz-1)*r + nx = 0 → r = -nx/(nz -1).

Alternatively, perhaps I can find an expression in terms of the angles, since the direction is in x-z plane.

The direction vector n is (nx, 0, nz). So, since it's in the x-z plane, the angle θ would be measured from the z-axis, perhaps. So, nx = sinθ, nz = cosθ. Or wait, perhaps the other way around. Wait, if θ is the angle from the z-axis, then nx = sinθ cosφ, but since φ=0 (since in x-z plane), so nx = sinθ. And nz = cosθ. Wait, no, actually, in spherical coordinates, the unit vector is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since we're in the x-z plane, φ=0, so y-component is zero, x = sinθ, z = cosθ.

So, nx = sinθ; nz = cosθ.

So, using that substitution, r = a/b = (-nx)/(nz -1) = (-sinθ)/(cosθ -1).

Hmm, let's compute that:

r = (-sinθ) / (cosθ -1 )

Multiply numerator and denominator by (cosθ +1):

r = [ -sinθ (cosθ +1) ] / [ (cosθ -1)(cosθ +1) ) ] = [ - sinθ (cosθ + 1) ] / ( cos²θ -1 ) = [ - sinθ (cosθ + 1) ] / (-sin²θ )

Because cos²θ -1 = - sin²θ.

So, r = [ - sinθ (cosθ +1) ] / ( - sin²θ ) = [ sinθ (cosθ + 1) ] / sin²θ = (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ.

Simplify that: (1 + cosθ)/sinθ = 2 cos²(θ/2) / (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ) = cot(θ/2).

So, r = cot(θ/2) = (cos(θ/2))/(sin(θ/2)).

So, the ratio a/b is cot(θ/2) → a = b cot(θ/2) = [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] * b.

So, let me let b = sin(θ/2), then a = cos(θ/2).

Wait, but then a and b would be in terms of θ/2. Let me see.

So, the eigenvector is [a, b] = [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ] multiplied by some normalization factor.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the calculation.

I have a = [ (1 - nz) / nx ] * b.

Since nz=cosθ, 1 - nz = 1 - cosθ.

nx=sinθ.

So a = (1 - cosθ)/sinθ * b.

But 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So,

a = [ 2 sin²(θ/2) ] / [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] * b

= [ sin(θ/2) / cos(θ/2) ] * b.

= tan(θ/2) * b.

Wait, wait, earlier I thought a/b was cot(theta/2), but now it's tan(theta/2). Oh, maybe I made a mistake in the signs.

Wait, earlier calculation:

r = a / b = [ (1 - nz) / nx ].

Since nz = cosθ, 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2), and nx = sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So,

r = [ 2 sin^2(theta/2) ] / [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] = [ sin(theta/2) ] / [ cos(theta/2) ) ] = tan(theta/2).

So, a = tan(theta/2) * b.

Hmm, so if I set b = 1, then a = tan(theta/2).

But wait, for the eigenvector, the choice of the overall factor (a scalar multiple) is arbitrary because eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar. So, let me pick b = 1, then a = tan(theta/2).

But wait, let's think again about the eigenvector components. Let me write the vector as (a, b). The eigenvector must be normalized, so a^2 + b^2 = 1.

But if a = tan(theta/2) * b, then:

tan^2(theta/2) * b^2 + b^2 = 1 → b^2 [ tan^2(theta/2) + 1 ] = 1 → b^2 = 1/(1 + tan^2(theta/2)) ) = cos^2(theta/2).

Because 1 + tan²x = sec²x → 1/(1 + tan²x) = cos²x.

So, b = cos(theta/2) or -cos(theta/2). Let's take positive for simplicity.

So, b = cos(theta/2), then a = tan(theta/2) * cos(theta/2) = sin(theta/2).

So, the eigenvector is [ sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ].

Wait, no. Because a = tan(theta/2) * b, and if b=cos(theta/2), then a = tan(theta/2) * cos(theta/2) = sin(theta/2).

So, the vector is [ sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ].

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought it would be [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], but maybe I mixed up a and b.

Alternatively, perhaps I should choose b to be sin(theta/2) and a to be cos(theta/2), but let's double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me re-express.

We have a = tan(theta/2) * b.

If I set b = 1, then a = tan(theta/2).

But then the vector is [ tan(theta/2), 1 ], and to normalize, we need to compute sqrt( tan²(theta/2) + 1 ) ) → sqrt( sec²(theta/2) ) = 1 / cos(theta/2).

So, the normalized vector is [ sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ].

Wait, no:

Wait, when you have [ a, b ] = [ tan(theta/2), 1 ].

The normalization factor is 1 / sqrt( tan²(theta/2) + 1 ) ) = cos(theta/2).

So, the normalized vector is [ sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ].

Hmm, but let me think about it again. Another approach is to write the eigenvector in terms of the eigenvalue equation.

Wait, perhaps I can approach it by using the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The operator is P · n, which is a spin-1/2 operator in the direction of n. The eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

So, the eigenvectors for +ħ/2 are |+n> states. For spin-1/2, the eigenvectors are typically ( cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) )^T, but since our direction is in x-z plane, phi=0. So, the eigenvector should be ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )^T.

Wait, because when the spin is pointing in direction n, the state is |+n> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Since here phi is zero because n is in x-z plane, so e^{i phi} =1. So, the normalized eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ).

Wait, but earlier I thought the ratio was a= sin(theta/2), and b= cos(theta/2). So, perhaps the vector is ( sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ), but this is conflicting.

Wait, maybe I should think about the spin-up state along the x-axis. Along x, theta=0, so phi is undefined (but since in x-z plane, phi=0). So, the state would be ( cos(0/2), sin(0/2) ) = (1, 0 ), which is correct, as the spin up along x would be (1,0).

Alternatively, along z, theta=0 (since direction is along z). Wait, no: when direction is along z, theta is 90 degrees? Wait, no, perhaps my coordinate system is the other way around.

Wait, in spherical coordinates, theta is the polar angle from the z-axis. So, if n is along +z, then theta is 0, phi=0. So, the state would be ( cos(0/2), sin(0/2) ) = (1, 0 ), which is correct, as spin up along z is (1,0).

Wait wait, no. Spin up along z is (1,0). Spin up along x is (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)) ), which corresponds to theta=90 degrees, because it's in the x direction, which is perpendicular to z. So, theta=90 degrees, so theta/2=45, cos(45)=sqrt(2)/2, sin(45)=sqrt(2)/2. So, the vector is [ sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2 ].

Which is correct for spin up along x. So, this suggests that the correct eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ).

So, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but earlier I thought a = tan(theta/2) * b. So, if a/b = tan(theta/2), then a = tan(theta/2) * b.

So, if I set b = 1, a = tan(theta/2). Then, the vector is [ tan(theta/2), 1 ].

But to normalize, we have a^2 + b^2 = tan^2(theta/2) + 1 = sec^2(theta/2). So, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt( sec^2(theta/2) ) ) = cos(theta/2).

So, the normalized vector is [ sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ].

Wait, wait. Because [ tan(theta/2)*cos(theta/2), cos(theta/2)
