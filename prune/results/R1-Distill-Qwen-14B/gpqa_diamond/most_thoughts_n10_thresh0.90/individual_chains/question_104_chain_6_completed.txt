Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let's break it down. The question is comparing two planets orbiting stars with the same mass as the Sun. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune, so their masses are probably similar.

The main point here is about the periodic shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit.

So, the Doppler shift formula is something like delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, right? Where v is the velocity of the star and c is the speed of light. Since milliangstroms are 1e-3 of an angstrom, I can convert the shifts into velocity.

Let me think. Let's denote the shift for planet 1 as delta_lambda1 = 5e-3 angstroms and for planet 2 as delta_lambda2 =7e-3 angstroms. Since the stars are similar (same mass as the Sun), the relationship between the star's velocity and the planet's parameters depends on mass and orbital period.

Wait, the RV method measures the velocity semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity the star moves due to the planet. The formula for K is K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) ) )^(1/3) * ... Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, but I know that K is proportional to (M_planet sin i) / (M_star) * (1 / sqrt(a)), where a is the semi-major axis.

Wait, but given that both planets have similar masses (Neptune-like) and the stars have the same mass, but the shifts (which relate to K, the velocity) are different. So, the shift is proportional to K. So, K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, so K2 is 1.4 times K1.

But how does K relate to the orbital period P? I remember that K is also related to the orbital period. Because the star's velocity depends on the mass of the planet and the period.

Let me think of the formula again. The RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = [ ( (G * M_planet^3 ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^2 ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * c) )

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, another approach is to consider the relation between the star's velocity and the orbital period, along with the mass of the planet.

Wait, another way: The velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2πG) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) )

But since M_planet is much smaller than M_star (Neptune is smaller than Sun), M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So, the denominator becomes M_star^(2/3) * (1 + ... )^(1/3) ≈ M_star^(1).

So, K ≈ ( (2πG) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / M_star^(2/3)

But both planets have the same M_planet and same M_star, so K is proportional to (1/sqrt(a)), because the orbital period P is related to a via Kepler's third law.

Wait, Kepler's third law: P^2 = (4π² G M_star) a^3.

Wait, the exact formula is P² = (4π² a³)/(G (M_star + M_planet)).

Since M_planet is much less than M_star, it's approximately P² ≈ (4π² a³)/(G M_star).

So, a^3 = (G M_star P²)/(4π²).

Wait, but how does a relate to K? Let's go back to K.

K = (v) = (2π a sin i) / P.

Because the star moves in a circular orbit with radius a_star, and a_star = (M_planet/(M_star + M_planet)) a. Since M_planet is much less than M_star, a_star ≈ (M_planet/M_star) a.

So, K ≈ (2π a_star) / P = (2π (M_planet a) / M_star ) / P.

But from Kepler's law, a^3 = (G M_star P²)/(4π²), so a = [ G M_star P²/(4π²) ]^(1/3).

Substituting a into K:

K ≈ (2π (M_planet / M_star) * [ (G M_star P²/(4π²) )^(1/3) ]) / P.

Simplify this:

K ≈ (2π M_planet / M_star) * [ (G M_star P²/(4π²) )^(1/3) ) ] / P.

Let me compute that exponent:

(G M_star P²/(4π²) )^(1/3) = (G M_star )^(1/3) (P²)^(1/3) (4π²)^(-1/3).

So,

K ≈ (2π M_planet / M_star) * (G M_star )^(1/3) * (P)^(2/3) * (4π²)^(-1/3) ) / P.

Simplify the terms:

Combine the constants: 2π * (4π²)^(-1/3) = 2π * (4^(-1/3) π^(-2/3)) ) = 2 * 4^(-1/3) * π^(1 - 2/3) ) = 2/(2^(2/3)) ) * π^(1/3) ) = 2^(1 - 2/3) π^(1/3) ) = 2^(1/3) π^(1/3).

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let's see.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to express the ratio of K1 and K2.

Given that K1 = 5, K2=7.

So, K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

But earlier, I found that K is proportional to (M_planet / M_star) * a^(1/3) * (1/P)^(1/3) ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to find the relation between K and P.

Let me think of K and P.

We have:

K = (v) = (2π a sin i) / P.

But from Kepler's third law:

a^3 = (G M_star P²)/(4 π²).

So, a = [ (G M_star P²)/(4 π²) ) ]^(1/3).

Substituting a into K:

K = (2 π sin i) / P * [ (G M_star P²)/(4 π²) ) ]^(1/3).

Simplify this expression:

Let me write it as:

K = (2 π / P ) * [ (G M_star P² / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3).

Take cube root of the terms inside:

= (2 π / P ) * [ G M_star )^(1/3) * (P²)^(1/3) * (1/(4 π²) )^(1/3) ) ]

= (2 π / P ) * [ (G M_star )^(1/3) ) * P^(2/3) * (4 π²)^(-1/3) ) ]

Now, multiply the terms:

= (2 π) / P * (G M_star )^(1/3) * P^(2/3) * (4 π² )^(-1/3).

Combine the P terms:

P^(-1) * P^(2/3) = P^(-1 + 2/3) = P^(-1/3).

So,

K = (2 π) * (G M_star )^(1/3) * (4 π² )^(-1/3) ) * P^(-1/3).

Now, combine the constants:

(2 π) * (4 π² )^(-1/3) ) = 2 π * [4^(-1/3) π^(-2/3) ) ]

= 2 * 4^(-1/3) * π^(1 - 2/3) )

4^(-1/3) is (2²)^(-1/3) = 2^(-2/3).

So,

= 2 * 2^(-2/3) * π^(1/3) )

= 2^(1 - 2/3) ) * π^(1/3)

= 2^(1/3) * π^(1/3)

= (2 π )^(1/3).

So, putting it all together:

K = (2 π )^(1/3) * (G M_star )^(1/3) * P^(-1/3).

Wait, that's interesting. So K is proportional to (G M_star )^(1/3) * P^(-1/3).

But wait, wait. Let me wait. Wait, but both stars have the same mass as the Sun, so M_star is the same for both. So, K is proportional to P^(-1/3).

Because (G M_star ) is a constant, so K ∝ P^(-1/3).

So, if K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4, then (P2^(-1/3)) / (P1^(-1/3)) ) = 1.4.

Which is (P2/P1)^(-1/3) ) = 1.4.

Taking reciprocal: (P1/P2)^(1/3) ) = 1/1.4.

Cube both sides: P1/P2 = (1/1.4)^3.

Wait, wait, let me see:

K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3) ) = 7/5 = 1.4.

Wait, wait, because K is proportional to P^(-1/3).

So K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3) ) = 7/5.

Wait, no, because K ∝ P^(-1/3), so K2 = K1 * (P1/P2)^(1/3).

So,

7/5 = (P1/P2)^(1/3).

Raise both sides to the power of 3:

(7/5)^3 = P1/P2.

So,

P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1.

So P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3 = P1 * (125/343).

So, (P2/P1) = 125/343 ≈ 0.364, which is approximately 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I got the ratio right.

Because K2 is larger than K1, so the star moves more for planet 2. So the velocity semi-amplitude is higher, which implies a shorter period. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

If K2 > K1, then P2^(1/3) < P1^(1/3), so P2 < P1.

So, the ratio P2/P1 is (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Wait, no, the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

So P2 is shorter than P1, so it's not longer. So the question is, is the orbital period of planet #2 longer or shorter? If K is higher, the period is shorter because for the same mass planet, the star moves more when the planet is closer (shorter period).

Wait, wait, no. Let me think. The star's velocity (semi-amplitude K) depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period. For a given planet mass, a shorter period leads to a larger K. Because for a given a, if P is smaller, then K is larger (since K is (2π a sin i)/P, so for fixed a, smaller P gives larger K).

So, if K2 =7 is larger than K1=5, that implies that planet #2 has a shorter period than planet #1.

But wait, the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1.

So if P2 is shorter, the ratio would be less than 1. So the answer would be less than 1, which is option A or D.

Wait, but the options given are:

A ~0.36,

B ~1.4,

C ~1.96,

D ~0.85.

So if P2 is ~0.36 times P1, that would mean P2 is shorter, so it's not longer. But the question is asking how many times longer P2 is than P1. That would be P2/P1. If P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's 0.36 times as long, so not longer. Wait, perhaps I have the ratio reversed.

Wait, no, let me re-express.

We have K ∝ P^(-1/3).

So, K2 =7, K1=5.

So, K2/K1 =7/5 = (P1/P2)^(1/3).

So, (P1/P2)^(1/3) = 1.4 → (P1/P2) = (1.4)^3 ≈2.744.

So, P1/P2 ≈2.744 → P2 = P1 /2.744 → P2/P1 = 1/2.744 ≈0.364.

So, P2 is 0.364 times P1, which means it's shorter. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? That would be (P2)/(P1) =0.364. So it's 0.36 times as long, meaning it's shorter. So the answer is 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but the question says 'how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?' So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's shorter, not longer. So the correct answer is 0.36, but that would be how many times shorter, not longer.

Wait, but the options are given, and the question is about how many times longer. So the answer should be 0.36, which is option A. So the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter. So the answer is A: ~0.36.


To determine how many times the orbital period of Planet #2 is longer than that of Planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \), the orbital period \( P \), and the given data.

### Key Information:
1. **Planet #1**: \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \).
2. **Planet #2**: \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \).
3. Both stars have the same mass (\( M_{\text{star}} \)), and both planets have masses similar to Neptune, meaning \( M_{\text{planet}} \) is the same for both.

### Relationship Between \( K \) and \( P \):
The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), i.e.,  
\[
K \propto P^{-1/3}.
\]
Thus,  
\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{P_1}{P_2}^{1/3}.
\]

### Solving for \( P_2 / P_1 \):
1. From the given data,  
\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{7}{5} = 1.4.
\]
2. Substituting into the proportionality:  
\[
1.4 = \frac{P_1}{P_2}^{1/3}.
\]
3. Rearranging:  
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = (1.4)^3.
\]
4. Calculating \( (1.4)^3 \):  
\[
(1.4)^3 = 2.744.
\]
5. Therefore,  
\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{1}{2.744} \approx 0.364.
\]

### Conclusion:
The orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately \( 0.36 \) times the orbital period of Planet #1. This means Planet #2's period is shorter, not longer, than Planet #1's. However, the question specifically asks how many times longer Planet #2's period is compared to Planet #1's. Based on the calculation, the answer is \( \approx 0.36 \).
