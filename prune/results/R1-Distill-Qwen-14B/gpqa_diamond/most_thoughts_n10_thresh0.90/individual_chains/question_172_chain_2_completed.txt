Okay, so I've got this question about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, the question is about the excitation of iron atoms and how that relates to the effective temperatures of the stars. Let me try to break this down.

Alright, the problem states that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited as those in star_2. Wait, I think that means the excitation level is higher, so maybe the population of a higher energy state is more in star_1. Oh right, in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation.

The Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy states is given by (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's the energies, k the Boltzmann constant, and T the temperature. Oh wait, but the question mentions the energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. Hmm, I should note that.

So in this case, the energy difference ΔE is E2 - E1 = 1.38e-23 J. Let's call the lower level E1 and the higher E2. So the excitation here refers to the higher level.

Star_1 has twice as many excited atoms as star_2. So the ratio for star_1 is N1_upper / N1_lower, and for star_2 it's N2_upper / N2_lower. The problem says N1_upper / N2_upper = 2? No wait, wait. No, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." Wait, maybe the population in the excited state is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. Or perhaps the excitation potential is such that the level is more populated.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of the excited level to the ground level. Let me clarify. The question says: "iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So perhaps the number of atoms in that specific excited level (say, level 2) is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. Wait, but that might not directly translate to the ratio of the populations because temperatures and other factors could influence it.

Alternatively, the excitation could refer to the ratio of the populations in the two energy levels. Let's assume that. So, for each star, the ratio of the upper level to the lower level is given by the Boltzmann factor.

So, let's denote for star_1: n1_upper / n1_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly, for star_2: n2_upper / n2_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the problem says that the excitation for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So I think the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So:

(n1_upper / n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower)

Wait, but wait: if the excitation is higher, meaning more atoms are in the upper level. So perhaps the ratio is higher. So for star_1, the ratio n_upper/n_lower is higher than for star_2.

Alternatively, maybe the question says that the number of excited atoms is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. But that's not exactly the same as the ratio of populations. Let me read the problem again.

The problem states: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Hmmm, perhaps the term 'excited' here refers to the excitation state. So perhaps the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to some other state (maybe the ground state) is twice as high in star_1 as in star_2.

So if I have for star_1: (n_upper / n_lower) = 2 * (n_upper' / n_lower') for star_2.

Wait, but maybe the number of excited atoms in star_1's photosphere is twice that in star_2's. That is, N1_upper = 2 * N2_upper. But I'm not sure because the question says "twice as excited in a specific energy level", which may imply that the ratio is twice.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is twice in star_1 compared to star_2. So for each star, let's say the ratio is:

For star 1: R1 = (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star 2: R2 = (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Problem states R1 = 2 R2.

So, R1 / R2 = 2.

Which simplifies to exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ) = 2.

Because the (g_upper/g_lower) terms would cancel out if they are the same for both stars, which they are since it's the same element and same energy levels.

So, the ratio becomes exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ) = 2.

Wait, let's compute that. The exponents are [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] and [ -ΔE/(k T2) ], so when we take the ratio, it's exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) ) - ( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) )

Wait, let me re-calculate the ratio:

R1/R2 = [ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Because [ -ΔE/(k T1) ) - ( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] = ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

So, R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE / k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2.

Take the natural log of both sides:

ln(2) = (ΔE / k) ( (1/T2) - (1/T1) )

Wait, but rearranging terms, (1/T2) - (1/T1) = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE.

Wait, let me compute this expression.

Alternatively, I can rearrange (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )

Hmm, so let's see:

ln(2) = (ΔE / k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

= (ΔE / k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ]

So,

ln(2) = (ΔE (T1 - T2)) / (k T1 T2 )

Hmm, but the question is about the equation relating T1 and T2.

Wait, the options given don't have ΔE or k in them, so I guess the equation is set up in a way that these constants are factored out, perhaps because the ratio is given.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J, but I don't think the options involve that value. So perhaps the equation is in the form of ln(2) equals some combination of T1 and T2.

So, the equation I derived is:

ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

But wait, if I rearrange that:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (k ln(2)) / ΔE.

But perhaps we can express it in terms of (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which is (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = (k ln(2)) / ΔE.

But in the multiple-choice options, we don't see ΔE or k. So perhaps the equation is to be expressed as ln(2) equals a function of T1 and T2.

Wait, let's see the options.

Option A: ln(2) = T2 / T1.

Option B: ln(2) = (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2).

Option C: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)^2.

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Hmm. From my derivation, the equation is:

ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which can be written as:

ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2 )

So that's ln(2) equals (ΔE (T1 - T2)) / (k T1 T2 )

Which can be rearranged as ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So, if I factor out the constants, the equation relates ln(2) to (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ), scaled by (ΔE/k).

But the question doesn't provide the values of ΔE or k, so perhaps the options assume that the equation is in terms of the temperature ratio, or perhaps the constants are normalized.

Looking at the options, none directly match this form, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should have considered the reciprocal. Let me recheck the steps.

Wait, R1 = 2 R2.

R1 = (g_upper/g_lower) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

R2 = (g_upper/g_lower) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

So R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE/k)(1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = 2.

ln(2) = (ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which is the same as (ΔE/k) * [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2).

Hmm, so the equation is ln(2) = (ΔE (T1 - T2)) / (k T1 T2 )

But the given options don't have ΔE and k in them, so perhaps the options are assuming that (ΔE/k) is a constant, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the excitation difference is such that the ratio is (n_upper / n_lower) = 2, with star 1 having n_upper = 2 * n_lower. But wait, that's not exactly what the problem says.

Wait, the problem says that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps for each star, the ratio is R1 = 2 * R2.

So, R1 = 2 R2.

Which gives:

(g_U / g_L) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * (g_U/g_L) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Cancel g_U/g_L from both sides:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Take natural log:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2 )

Rearrange:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) ) = ln(2)

Which brings us back to the same equation.

So, which option correctly represents this?

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So, substituting, the equation becomes:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * ( (T1 - T2) )/( T1 T2 )

But the options don't include ΔE or k, so perhaps the equation is presented as ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) multiplied by a constant. But the options don't show that.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an option where ln(2) equals (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) multiplied by something. But the options don't include that, so perhaps the equation is in the form of (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) equals ( ln(2) * k ) / ΔE.

But that's not one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait another approach: considering the ratio of populations.

Let me think: for each star, the ratio R = N_upper / N_lower.

For star 1, R1 = 2 * R2.

So,

R1 = (g_upper/g_lower) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = (g_upper/g_lower) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So R1 = 2 R2 → exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Take ln of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2 )

Rearrange:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) = ln(2)

Which is the same as before.

Hmm, but none of the options directly match this equation unless the constants are being absorbed, which doesn't seem to be the case.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the reciprocal. Let's see:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which can be written as:

(T1 - T2) = [ ln(2) * T1 T2 ] * (k) / ΔE )

But without knowing ΔE or k, I can't proceed further. So perhaps the equation is to be expressed as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (k ln(2)) / (ΔE )

But the options don't include k or ΔE. Therefore, perhaps the equation is presented in terms of the ratio of temperatures.

Wait, but the options are all in terms of ln(2) equaling some function of T1 and T2 without any other factors.

So, perhaps the equation is ln(2) equals (T1 - T2) divided by (T1 T2 ), but that would require that (ΔE/(k) ) is 1, which isn't the case.

Wait, but in the problem statement, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me compute (ΔE)/(k) to see what it is.

Boltzmann's constant, k, is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE is 1.38e-23 J.

So, ΔE/k = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Ah! That's an important point. So ΔE = k * (1 K). So ΔE/(k) = 1 K. So the equation becomes:

ln(2) = (1 K) * ( (T1 - T2) )/( T1 T2 )

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which is option D.

Wait, let me confirm that calculation. If ΔE=1.38e-23 J, and k=1.38e-23 J/K, then ΔE/k = (1.38e-23) / (1.38e-23) ) = 1 K.

So, the equation simplifies to:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 )

Which is exactly option D.

So the correct equation is option D.


The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (star_1 and star_2) based on the excitation levels of iron atoms in their photospheres. The key is to use the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the ratio of populations in two energy levels to temperature. The energy difference between the levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and the Boltzmann constant is \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \).

For star_1 and star_2, the ratios of the populations in the excited and lower energy levels are given by:

\[
R_1 = \frac{N_{\text{upper}}}{N_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
R_2 = \frac{N_{\text{upper}}}{N_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2, i.e., \( R_1 = 2 R_2 \). Dividing the two equations for \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \), the statistical weights \( \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \) cancel out, leaving:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting \( R_1 / R_2 = 2 \), we get:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), the equation becomes:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Since \( \Delta E = k \cdot 1 \, \text{K} \) (because \( \Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K} \)), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A**: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_2}{T_1} \) does not match the derived equation.
- **Option B**: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 + T_2}{T_1 T_2} \) introduces an incorrect additive term.
- **Option C**: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{(T_1 T_2)^2} \) incorrectly squares the denominator.

Thus, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
