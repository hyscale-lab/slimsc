Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance and its decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through step by step.

The question says that X is a meson resonance with given production energy, mass, and width. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are all on the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. So, decay length is usually calculated using the particle's lifetime and velocity, right?

Wait, decay distance formula I remember is something like c multiplied by the lifetime. But wait, particles moving at relativistic speeds, so velocity is close to c. Or maybe the formula is (c * τ) where τ is the mean lifetime. Alternatively, I think it's also called the proper lifetime, but wait, no, the mean lifetime is the same as the proper lifetime, right? Because in the particle's rest frame, the lifetime is τ, and when you boost to the lab frame, the lifetime appears longer, but the decay distance is still c multiplied by the lifetime as observed. Or... wait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, the decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. So in the lab frame, that would be velocity multiplied by lifetime. But if the particle is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, like in high-energy physics, then the velocity v is approximately c. So the decay length L is approximately c * τ. But wait, wait, no. Or am I mixing things up?

Wait, no. The mean lifetime τ is the proper time, the time measured in the rest frame of the particle. The lifetime observed in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. But wait, no, the decay length is calculated using the lifetime in the lab frame. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, no. Decay length L is given by L = v * γ * τ, but since v ≈ c, and γ is the Lorentz factor, which is E/(m c²), so maybe that's a way to compute it.

Wait, hold on. Let me get this straight. The mean lifetime in the rest frame is τ. The lifetime in the lab frame is γ τ, because of time dilation. Then, the velocity v is approximately c, so the decay distance is v multiplied by the lab frame lifetime: L = v * (γ τ). But since v is close to c, L ≈ c * γ τ.

Wait, but another approach is to compute the total decay width, which relates to the lifetime via the uncertainty principle. The width Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, that's right! The width is the energy width, and the uncertainty principle says that ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2. So the mean lifetime τ would be ħ / Γ (since Γ is the width, which is the uncertainty in energy). But wait, I'm not sure about the exact relation. Let me think: the relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. Yes, that's correct.

So first, I need to compute the mean lifetime τ using τ = ħ / Γ. Then, the decay distance is c multiplied by τ, but wait, no, because the particle is moving. So actually, the decay length is L =
