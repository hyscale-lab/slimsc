Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, we can't just use classical mechanics. We need to use Einstein's theory of relativity, right?

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. So I'm guessing I need to calculate two things: their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Let me start with the relative speed. Wait, I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). But wait, which one is moving faster? Oh, astronaut A is 2m moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is 3m moving at 0.5c. So from B's frame, what's the speed of A?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question is about the relative speed between them. So which one is moving faster? Since 0.6c is faster than 0.5c, from the perspective of the one moving slower (B), the other (A) is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Calculating the numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. So about 0.14c. That's the relative speed.

Wait, but wait, the options have 0.14c as an option. So looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So that's one part.

Now, what about the total energy of the system? Hmm, I think the total energy would be the sum of each astronaut's relativistic energies. Relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for astronaut A (2m moving at 0.6c):

Gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E_A = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

For astronaut B (3m moving at 0.5c):

Gamma_B = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E_B ≈ 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Adding them together: 2.5 + 3.464 = ~5.964 mc². Hmm, looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², which matches closely. Option D says E=5 mc², which is lower; probably not.

So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c and the total energy is about 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, that's option C.

Wait, but wait, another thought: Is the rest energy of each astronaut included? Because rest energy is mc², but their relativistic energy is higher. So yes, I think I did it right because each E is (gamma * m) c², so 2m and 3m would multiply by their gammas.

So the correct answer should be option C
