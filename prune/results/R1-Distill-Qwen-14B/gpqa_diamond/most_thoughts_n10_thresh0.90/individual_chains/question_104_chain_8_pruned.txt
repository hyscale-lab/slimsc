Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The more the star moves, the bigger the shift, right? 

The question says that two stars with the same mass as the Sun have planets similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is about the ratio of their orbital periods.

Wait, how does the Doppler shift relate to the orbital period? I think the RV method gives us the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which relates to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Oh right, the formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v0) * (M_planet / M_star) * ( (P/(2π)) )^(-1/3) * (1/(1 + M_planet/M_star))^(1/3) ), but since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, we can approximate it as K ≈ (v0) * (M_planet/M_star) * (P/(2π)) ^ (-1/3). 

Wait, another approach: the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet sin i) / (M_star) ) * (P/(2π)) ^ (-1/3) ) * (1/(1 + M_planet/M_star) )^(1/3). But since M_planet << M_star, the (1 + ... ) term is nearly 1, so we can ignore it. So K ≈ (M_planet sin i) / M_star * (P/(2π)) ^ (-1/3) * v0, where v0 is some constant based on the star's characteristics, like its rotation and spectral line width.

But wait, maybe I should think about the relationship between the velocity semi-amplitude K and the orbital period P. Since both planets have similar masses, let's assume M_planet is the same for both. And the stars have the same mass, so M_star is the same. Therefore, K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)) because K ∝ P^(-1/3). 

Wait, no, let's think again. The RV method measures the star's velocity, which depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period. The formula for K is given by:

K = [ (G * P) / (2π c ) ]^(1/3) * [ (M_planet sin i) / (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ]

But since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So K simplifies to something like K = ( (G * P)^(-1/3) ) multiplied by other terms, but I'm not getting the exact proportionality right. Alternatively, I can think in terms of the relation between K and P.

Let me think about the dependence. Since K is proportional to (M_planet / M_star) * (P)^(-1/3). So if M_planet and M_star are the same for both planets, then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). That is, K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so P ∝ (1/K)^3.

Wait, maybe that's the key. So if K1 is 5 milliangstroms and K2 is 7 milliangstroms, then P1 and P2 are related by P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

Wait no, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So P is inversely proportional to K^3. So P ∝ 1/K^3. So P2 / P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, let's clarify: since K ∝ (M_p / M_s) * (1/P^(1/3)), and M_p and M_s are same for both, K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3). So K ∝ P^(-1/3). Therefore, P ∝ K^(-3). So P2 = (K1 / K2) )^3 * P1.

Wait, but K is velocity. Let me think again. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = (2π G)^{1/3} * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) (P)^{1/3} ) )

But since M_p << M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So,

K ≈ (2π G)^{1/3} * (M_p sin i) / ( M_*^{2/3} P^{1/3} )

So K ∝ (M_p / (M_*)) * (1 / P^{1/3} )

But since M_p and M_* are same for both planets, K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). 

So P ∝ 1/K^3.

So if K_planet1 = 5 and K_planet2 =7, then P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

Wait, wait. P is proportional to 1/K^3. So P2 / P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

So if K1 is 5 and K2 is7, then (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is about 0.364 times P1, meaning that P2 is shorter than P1 by that factor. But the question asks, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So the ratio is P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is approximately 0.36 times as long as P1. So the period of planet #2 is shorter than planet #1 by about 0.36 times.

Wait, but the question is phrased as: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So if P2 is 0.36 of P1, then P2 is 0.36 times P1. So planet #2's period is shorter, and the question is about how many times longer P2 is than P1. So the answer would be 0.36 times. So looking at the options, option A is ~0.36.

Wait, but maybe I have the ratio backwards. Let me double-check. Because K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)), so P is proportional to (1/K)^3. So if K2 is larger than K1, then 1/K2 is smaller than 1/K1. So P2 is (K1/K2)^3 * K1's P? No, wait. Let me think of it this way: K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K = C * (1/P^(1/3)), where C is some constant that depends on the planet and star masses. Since both planets have same masses and same star mass, C is same for both. So K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3). Taking the ratio, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). So (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

So yes, P2 is (5/7)^3 times P1. So if I compute 5/7: 5 ÷7 is approximately 0.714. 0.714 cubed is about 0.714 *0.714=0.51, then 0.51 *0.714≈ 0.364. So P2 is 0.364 times P1. So the period of planet #2 is 0.364 times that of planet #1. So how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1? It's shorter, so the factor is less than one. So the period ratio P2/P1 is approximately 0.36, which is option A.


The radial velocity (RV) method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, \( K \), is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Since the masses of the planets and their host stars are the same, the constant of proportionality is identical for both planets. Thus, the relationship between the orbital periods of the two planets can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Here, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

Calculating \( \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714 \), and then cubing this value:

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 \approx 0.714^3 \approx 0.364
\]

This means that the orbital period of planet
