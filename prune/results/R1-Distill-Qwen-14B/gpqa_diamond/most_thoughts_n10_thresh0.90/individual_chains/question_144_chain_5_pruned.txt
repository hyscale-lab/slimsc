Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the mean decay distance of a meson resonance. Hmm, I remember from my studies that particles like mesons can decay, and the mean distance they travel before decaying is related to their properties like energy, mass, and width. But I'm a bit rusty, so I'll need to think this through step by step.

The question gives me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance, and the options are A to D, with some numbers in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance involves the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula, I think, is something like distance = c * τ * β, where c is the speed of light, τ is the mean lifetime, and β is the velocity divided by the speed of light.

But how do I get τ from the given parameters? Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ. I recall that Γ is the total decay width, and the relation is τ = ħ/(Γ), where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But wait, since we're working in natural units probably, because the given energies are in GeV and mass in GeV. So in natural units, ħ = c = 1, but when converting to meters, we have to be careful.

Wait, natural units are tricky. Let me think. In natural units (where ħ = c = 1), the width Γ is in energy units, which is inverse time. But when calculating proper time τ, which is in seconds, I would use τ = ħ / Γ. Oh wait, no: the natural unit system has ħ = 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. So to convert Γ from GeV to seconds, τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, the width is given in MeV. So I should convert it to GeV. Γ is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = let's compute that. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32. Let me calculate that. 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 seconds. Wait, 6.582 / 0.32 is 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s?

Wait, no, let me do the math again. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32. Let's compute 6.582 / 0.32. 0.32 × 20 is 6.4, which leaves 0.182. 0.32 × 0.568 ≈ 0.1818. So 20.568... So yeah, 20.56875e-25 seconds is the same as 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, no, wait: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 = 20.56875e-25 = 2.056875e-24 seconds. That makes sense.

Now, I need to find β, the velocity over c. For a relativistic particle, beta can be approximated by sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)). Wait, E is the total energy, which is gamma m c^2. So beta is sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)).

Wait, but in natural units where c=1, E^2 = p^2 + m^2
