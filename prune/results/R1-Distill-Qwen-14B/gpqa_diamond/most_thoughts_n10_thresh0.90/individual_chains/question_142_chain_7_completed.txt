Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in the qubit space. The matrix provided is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But wait, what's the geometric interpretation here?

I think I should first write out the matrix ρ explicitly to visualize it. Let me recall that |0><0| is a 2x2 matrix with a 1 in the (1,1) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has a 1 in (2,2) position. So adding them together gives a diagonal matrix with 1s on the diagonal. But since ρ is multiplied by 1/2, each of those 1s becomes 1/2. So ρ would be a diagonal matrix with [0.5 0; 0 0.5].

Wait, I've heard that in the Bloch sphere representation, a qubit state can be represented as a point on a unit sphere. But that's for pure states. For mixed states, like density matrices, maybe the representation is different. Oh right, the density matrix for a pure state is a projector, like |ψ><ψ|, but ρ here is a mixture of |0> and |1>, each with equal probability, right?

So the density matrix given is a completely mixed state for a single qubit. Because when you have equal probabilities, it's like being in a maximally mixed state. But how does that translate into the geometric picture?

I remember that any single-qubit state can be represented as a vector on the Bloch sphere. The general form of a density matrix for a single qubit can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a 3-dimensional vector (the Bloch vector) and σ are the Pauli matrices. So when this is the case, the density matrix ρ can be expressed as (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2.

In our case, ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let's compute that. The identity matrix I is 2x2 with 1s on the diagonal. So (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|) = (1/2) I. So comparing that to the general form (I + r·σ)/2, we get that (I + r·σ)/2 = (1/2) I. That implies that r·σ must be zero.

If r·σ is zero, then all the components of r must be zero. Because the Pauli matrices are independent, the only way their linear combination is zero is if each coefficient (r_x, r_y, r_z) is zero. So r is the zero vector.

Wait, so the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That makes sense because a completely mixed state would be at the origin in the Bloch sphere, right? Because it's equally likely to be in |0> or |1>, so it's in the center of the sphere. That's different from a pure state, which would lie on the surface.

Looking back at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit, where the system is equally likely to be in the states \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\). To analyze its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. Any single-qubit density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r}\) is a 3-dimensional vector (the Bloch vector). Comparing this general form to the given \(\rho\), we see that \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\), which implies that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\). Since the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, the only solution is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\).

This means the density matrix corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere, which is consistent with the maximally mixed state being at the center of the sphere. Among the given options, the correct Bloch vector is \((0, 0, 0)\).

Answer: C
