Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem here. So, the question is about the possible decays of a boson X. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly.

The interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by the Lagrangian:
L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Hmm, so I think this means that the boson X couples to fermions because it's part of the interaction term in the Lagrangian. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So the question is asking what are the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different fermion pairs.

I remember that for a boson to decay into fermions, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because in decay processes, you can't have a particle with less mass than the total rest mass of the products. So, the key here is to figure out which fermions have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV each, since 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the fermions and their masses. The known fermion masses are:

- e- (electron): about 0.0005 GeV
- mu- (muon): ~0.105 GeV
- tau- (tau): ~1.78 GeV
- u and d (up and down quarks): very light, like a few MeV, so around 0.003 GeV each.
- s (strange): ~95 MeV, so 0.095 GeV
- c (charm): about 1.25 GeV
- b (beauty): around 4.5 GeV
- t (top): way too heavy, like 173 GeV

Wait, wait, so each of these fermions would have a mass m such that 2m ≤ 6 GeV. So m ≤ 3 GeV. So which fermions have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV?

Let's list them:

1. Electron (e): 0.0005 GeV → yes
2. Muon (mu): 0.105 → yes
3. Tau (tau): 1.78 → yes
4. Up (u): ~0.003 → yes
5. Down (d): ~0.003 → yes
6. Strange (s): ~0.095 → yes
7. Charm (c): ~1.25 → yes
8. Beauty (b): ~4.5 → 4.5 >3 → no
9. Top (t): 173 → way too big, so no.

So the fermions that X can decay into are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c. But wait, each decay would produce a pair of these fermions, like e+ e- or mu+ mu-, etc.

But wait, the problem is about the possible decay channels. So X can decay into any of these pairs as long as the mass allows it.

But looking at the options:

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-

Wait, but b quarks are about 4.5 GeV. So each b quark is 4.5 GeV, and since X is 6 GeV, 2m_b would be about 9 GeV, which is more than 6. So X can't decay into b quarks. So option A is wrong because it includes b and s. Wait, no, s is 0.095 GeV, which is fine.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

Hmm, c quark is 1.25 GeV, so 2m_c = 2.5 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So that's allowed. So option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's good.

Option C: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, t tbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

But wait, t quarks are about 173 GeV, way too heavy. So X can't decay into t quarks. So option C is wrong because it includes t.

Option D: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

Again, the b quark (4.5 GeV) would require 9 GeV for two of them, but X is only 6. So D is wrong.

So the correct options are those that include c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Looking at the options, only option B fits this. Let me check the options again.

Wait, option B says c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Yes, that's all the allowed fermions.

Wait, but what about the strange quark? Oh, yes, strange is 0.095 GeV, so it's allowed. So option B includes all the allowed fermions.

So the answer should be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. For a boson to decay into fermions, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion pair. The fermion masses are as follows:

- Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( \sim 0.003 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( \sim 0.003 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( \sim 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.25 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Beauty quark (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

For \( X \) to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the fermion mass \( m \) must satisfy \( 2m \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), i.e., \( m \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This allows the following fermions:

- \( e, \mu, \tau, u, d, s, c \)

The top quark (\( t \)) and beauty quark (\( b \)) are too heavy for \( X \) to decay into, as \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^{+}\tau^{-}, \mu^{+}\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-} \), all of which are allowed. This option is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.

The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \).

Answer: B
