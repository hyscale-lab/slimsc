Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on some spectroscopic data. The options are four different formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. Let's go through each piece of data step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum. The peaks are at 3000 (very broad), 1700, and 1650 cm⁻¹. Broad peak around 3000 usually suggests O-H stretching, like in an alcohol or carboxylic acid. But wait, a very broad peak could be either. Carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H stretch around there. Alternatively, if it's an alcohol, the peak is usually a bit less broad but still around 3300 maybe. Hmm, but the given peak is at 3000, which is a bit lower. Maybe it's a different functional group. Wait, another possibility is an amide or something else, but the other peaks might help more.

The other strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is likely a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. The 1650 could be another carbonyl, perhaps an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds or an amide. Wait, but 1650 is also in the range for conjugated carbonyl groups, like in an aromatic ester or maybe a conjugated ketone. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic ring with double bonds. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's think about possible structures.

The 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to double bonds, like in alkenes. So the compound has a double bond, perhaps conjugated with something else. So maybe it's an ester with a double bond nearby.

Mass spectrum shows a fragment at m/z 45. That's a key clue. Let me think about what fragments give 45. 45 is the mass of (CH3)2O, which is 15 (CH3) *2 +15 (O), but wait, 45 is C2H5O. Wait, another way: 45 could be from a methyl group attached to something else. Wait, 45 = 45. So perhaps a fragment that's a CH3 group attached to an O, like perhaps an alkoxy group. Or maybe a carbonyl group breaking off. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on mass spec, so let me think of common fragments. The molecular ion for CH3COOH (acetic acid) would have a fragment at m/z 45, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketene fragment? Or perhaps the fragment is from an ester group. Wait, another option: 45 could be the mass of a ketone group. Wait, the formula for a methyl group is 15, but that's without O. So maybe a fragment like OCH2CH3? No, that would be 45? Let me calculate: O is 16, C2H5 is 29 (2*12 +5*1=24+5=29). 16 +29=45. Oh right, so OCH2CH3 would have m/z 45. That's the ethoxy group. So if the compound is an ester, maybe, then the fragment comes from losing the R group and retaining the ester part. Hmm.

Wait, but the compound has a molecular formula from the options. Let's consider each option:

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures could be an ester, maybe a cyclic ester, or a diester. Another possibility is a ketone with an alcohol group, but more likely an ester.

Option B: C6H10O. That's a degree of unsaturation of (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two double bonds or rings. Or one of each. But the presence of vinyl H suggests a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degree of unsaturation is (2*6+2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two rings, or one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds.

Option D: C6H12O. Degree of unsaturation is (12*2 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one ring or one double bond.

But the NMR shows vinyl H, so at least one double bond. So options with one or two double bonds would fit.

Looking back at the IR data: 1700 is likely a carbonyl. 1650 could be another carbonyl, but maybe it's an aromatic ring's C=C. Wait, but aromatic C=Cs typically have peaks around 1500-1600. So 1650 might be conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester adjacent to a double bond.

Wait, another approach: The IR shows a broad peak at 3000. If it's a carboxylic acid, that would explain the broad O-H. Carboxylic acids have a strong peak around 1700 (carbonyl) and a broad O-H around 3000. But if that's the case, the molecular formula would have at least a COOH group. Let's see the options: option C is C6H10O2. So a carboxylic acid would fit that—for example, hexanoic acid. But wait, hexanoic acid would have a formula of C6H12O2. Oh wait, but our options have O2 in option A and C. Let me recount the formulas.

Wait, the options are:

A: C6H12O2 → molecular formula with 6 C, 12 H, 2 O.

B: C6H10O → 6 C, 10 H, 1 O.

C: C6H10O2 → 6 C, 10 H, 2 O.

D: C6H12O → 6 C, 12 H, 1 O.

If the compound is a carboxylic acid, the formula would have two O's and the degree of unsaturation would be (2*6 +2 -12)/2=(14-12)/2=1. So that would be one double bond or ring. But hexanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, which has a formula C6H12O2. So that would match option A. But in that case, the IR would show a broad peak for O-H, and a strong peak at ~1700 for the carbonyl.

But the other peak at 1650—does that fit? Hexanoic acid might not have another carbonyl. Oh wait, maybe the 1650 is from the O-H bending in the carboxylic acid? No, O-H bending is usually around 1500. Hmm.

Alternatively, the compound could be an ester. Esters have two oxygen atoms. Their IR would show a strong carbonyl around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹, and no broad O-H unless it's another functional group. But in our case, the FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000, which suggests an O-H. So if it's an ester plus an alcohol group? But wait, that would mean the compound is an ester and an alcohol, but that's not likely unless it's an hemiacetal or something, which seems complicated.

Wait, another thought: maybe the compound is a ketone and an alcohol. So two O groups. Then the IR would show a broad peak for the alcohol O-H (around 3300 maybe, but in this case it's 3000, which is a little lower). The strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 would be a ketone (around 1700) and maybe an aromatic ring or conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, but if it's a ketone and an alcohol, the formula would be C6H12O2 (since ketone is R2CO, which uses one O, and alcohol is R-OH, another O). So that would fit option A.

But the NMR says there are vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. So the structure would have a ketone, a double bond, and an alcohol group. Let's think: a cyclic structure perhaps? Or maybe it's an acyclic compound with a double bond and a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an aromatic ester. For example, something like methyl benzoate— but wait, benzoate would have a benzene ring, which would have different IR peaks. The FTIR of benzoate would show strong C=O around 1700, and the benzene ring would have peaks around 1500 and 1450. But our IR shows 1700 and 1650. Maybe substitution on the benzene ring could shift the peaks.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Lactones have a cyclic ester structure. That would have a carbonyl group, and perhaps an alcohol group, but wait, lactones are cyclic esters, so O is present. For example, a gamma or delta lactone. But the formula would be C6H10O2 if it's a six-membered ring with two oxygen atoms. Wait, gamma butyrolactone has a five-membered ring (but that's C4H6O2). For a six-membered ring, like valerolactone, the formula is C5H8O2. Hmm. Not quite matching our options.

Wait, perhaps the compound is an ester with a vinyl group. Like an allyl ester. So for example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3. But that's longer than six carbons. Alternatively, a smaller ester with a double bond.

But wait, let's think about the mass spec. The fragment at m/z 45 suggests the ethoxy group (OCH2CH3), as I thought earlier. So if the compound is an ester, the ethyl group would break off as a fragment, giving 45. So in that case, the ester would have an ethoxy group.

But wait, the molecular formula of the options is given as either C6H12O2, C6H10O, etc. If the ester is R-O-CO-R', then the formula would depend on R and R'. For example, if it's ethyl something, like ethyl benzoate would be C6H5COOCH2CH3, which is C9H10O2. But that's more than six carbons. So perhaps it's a smaller ester.

Wait, let's see. If the compound is an ester with a vinyl group. Suppose it's methyl vinyl benzoate or something? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a diester. But not sure.

Another approach: let's think about the molecular formula and possible structures. The options are:

A) C6H12O2: Degree of unsaturation is (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one ring or one double bond.

B) C6H10O: DoU is (2*6 +2 -10)/2=(14-10)/2=2. So two rings, or one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds.

C) C6H10O2: DoU is (2*6 +2 -10)/2=(14-10)/2=2.

D) C6H12O: DoU is (2*6 +2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1.

The NMR shows vinyl H, so at least one double bond. So all options except B and D, which have DoU 2, have at least one double bond (DoU=1) or more.

Wait, no: option A has DoU 1, which could be a double bond. So if the compound has a double bond and a ring, that would require DoU 2, but A has only 1, so that's not possible. So perhaps option C, which has DoU 2, would have a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds.

Wait, but the question says "several peaks... including vinyl hydrogens." So the presence of vinyl H implies at least one double bond. Thus, the structure must have at least one double bond.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C has C6H10O2. DoU is 2. So that could be one double bond and one ring, or two double bonds.

Now, the IR shows a strong peak at 1700 (carbonyl, probably ester or ketone) and 1650 (maybe conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ring). If the structure is an ester with a conjugated double bond, such as an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, then the IR would show the ester carbonyl at 1700 and the conjugated double bond (C=C) around 1650.

So, for example, methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. Formula would be C4H6O2. But that's not matching the options. Our options are all C6.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester with a double bond adjacent. Not sure.

Another angle: the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So likely, the structure has a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl, making it an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. These structures are common and have specific NMR and IR features.

In IR, the carbonyl would be around 1700, and the conjugated C=C would show a peak around 1650. That fits the data.

In NMR, the vinyl protons would be deshielded and appear downfield, maybe around 5-6 ppm, as doublets or triplets depending on substitution.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment at m/z 45. If the compound is an ester with an ethoxy group, the ethoxy would break off, giving a fragment of 45 (OCH2CH3 is 16+29=45). So if the compound is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3, the formula is C5H8O2, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps it's a different ester.

Wait, another possibility: if the parent compound is an ester with a longer chain. Let's see. Let's say the ester is something like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH2CH2CH3 (but that would be C9H14O2, which is longer than our options). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an orthoester, but that's probably too complicated.

Wait, another approach: let's think of the molecular formula of each option and see which one could produce a fragment of 45 in the mass spectrum.

Option A: C6H12O2 → molecular weight is (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16)=72+12+32=116. So the molecular ion would be m/z 116. The fragment at 45 would imply losing 71 (since 116-71=45). What would lose 71? 71 is the molecular weight of something like C3H7O (but 71 is more likely to be a ketene or similar). Alternatively, 71 is the molecular weight of something like (CH3)2CO (acetone), which is 58. Hmm, perhaps not.

Option B: C6H10O → molecular weight (6*12)+(10*1)+(16) =72+10+16=98. So a fragment at 45 implies losing 53. Not sure what that would be.

Option C: C6H10O2 → molecular weight is 6*12 +10*1 +2*16=72+10+32=114. A fragment at 45 would imply losing 114-45=69. 69 could be a fragment. 69 is C3H7O (3*12 +7 +16=36+7+16=59, nope). Or maybe C4H9O (4*12 +9 +16=48+9+16=73, no). Hmm, not helpful.

Option D: C6H12O → molecular weight is 6*12 +12*1 +16=72+12+16=100. Fragment at 45 implies losing 55. 55 is C3H5O (3*12 +5 +16=36+5+16=57). Not quite. Or perhaps a different group.

Wait, another approach: the fragment at 45 is likely an ethoxy group. So the molecular formula would have an ethoxy (OCH2CH3). So the molecular formula would have O in it. Looking back at the options, options A and C have two O's. So maybe the compound is an ester with ethoxy group. Let's see:

Ester formula is R-O-CO-R'. For example, ethyl something ester.

If the compound is ethyl something ester, then the formula would be (R')COOCH2CH3. Let's say R' is CH2CH2CH2CH2- (but that would make the formula C6H10O2 if R' is CH2CH2CH2. Wait, perhaps the ester is ethyl pentanoate: CH2CH2CH2CH2COOCH2CH3. That's C7H12O2. Not matching any options.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester with an ethoxy group?

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diethyl ester, but that would require more O's.

Wait, perhaps it's an aromatic ester but with a smaller substituent. Like methyl benzoate is C7H6O2, which is still more than 6 carbons.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me get back to the IR. The broad peak at 3000 is probably an O-H. So either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. If it's a carboxylic acid, the molecular formula should have two O's. So possible options are A and C.

Carboxylic acids have the formula RCOOH. So for a six-carbon carboxylic acid, it's C6H12O2. That fits option A. But would the IR show a peak at 1650? Only if there's another functional group. Or maybe the 1650 is from the O-H bending, but usually that's around 1500. Hmm.

Alternatively, the compound is an ester with an alcohol group. Like an ester and a hydroxyl group. But that would require a specific structure, which might not be as common.

Another thought: the IR peak at 1650 could be an aromatic ring. So maybe the compound is an aromatic ester with an alcohol group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the mass spec again. The fragment at 45 is likely the ethoxy group, so the compound must have an ethoxy substituent. So in the structure, there's an OCH2CH3 group.

So if the compound is an ester with ethoxy, the formula would include OCH2CH3. Which would be an O and an ethyl group.

Looking at the options, the formula must have O2. So options A (C6H12O2) and C (C6H10O2) have two O's.

If the compound is an ester with ethoxy, then the formula would be RCOOCH2CH3. Let's calculate for RCOOCH2CH3:

R is (C6H10O2 - OCH2CH3 - COO) → wait, maybe better to think of the formula.

The formula of RCOOCH2CH3 would be (R)COOCH2CH3 → R is (C5H10O), because:

RCOOCH2CH3 → (CnH2nO) COO (C2H5) → overall formula would be C(n+3) H2n+10 O3. Wait, perhaps better to calculate the molecular formula.

Let me think: the molecular formula of an ester RCOOR' is (R has m carbons, R' has n carbons) → (m+2 + n) carbons. Wait no: R is alkyl, so RCOO is (m+1) carbons, R' is n carbons. So total is m+1 +n =6. So m+1 +n=6.

In our case, R' is ethyl (n=2), so m+1 +2 =6 → m=3.

So R would be a 3-carbon group. So the ester would be CH2CH2COOCH2CH3. Wait, but that's pentanoic acid ethyl ester, which is C5H10O2. But our options have C6. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is part of a ring. For example, a cyclic ester with ethyl group. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the compound is not an ester but a ketone with an ethyl group. But then, the O count wouldn't fit unless there's another O.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a diethyl ester of a dicarboxylic acid. But that would have more O's, which isn't in the options.

Hmm. Maybe I need to approach this differently.

Let me outline what each clue tells us.

1. FTIR:
   - Broad peak at 3000 → likely O-H (alcohol or carboxylic acid).
   - Strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 → carbonyl groups (ester, ketone, etc.) and maybe another group.

2. 1H NMR:
   - Peaks for vinyl H → double bond present.

3. Mass Spec:
   - Fragment at 45 → likely OCH2CH3 (ethyl group).

So combining these, the compound has O-H (so either -OH or COOH), a carbonyl group, a double bond, and an ethyl group.

Looking at the options, the formula must have two O's (so options A and C) and include an ethyl group.

Let me think of specific structures.

Option C: C6H10O2.

If the structure is an ester with an ethyl group and a double bond. For example, ethyl acrylate: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. Formula is C5H8O2. That's not C6. So perhaps a longer chain.

Wait, maybe the structure is an ester with a double bond, like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. That's C6H10O2. Let me count the carbons: CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3 → 2 (from CH2=CH) + 1 (CH2) + 2 (COO) + 2 (CH2CH3) → total 7. No, that's not right. Wait, no: the ester group is O connected to the ethyl. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. Carbon count: CH2=CH (2) + CH2 (3rd) + COO (4th and 5th) + CH2CH3 (6th and 7th). Wait, that's 7 carbons, so formula would be C7H10O2. Not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps a different structure. How about methyl vinyl benzoate? No, that's larger.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a six-membered ring with an ester group and an ethyl substituent. For example, something like a cyclohexene ring with an ester. But I'm not sure.

Another thought: the compound could be a cyclic ester (lactone) with an ethyl substituent. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is an ester with a double bond and an ethyl group, but arranged in a way that the molecular formula is C6H10O2. Let me think: perhaps the structure is CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2CH3. No, that's longer than six carbons.

Wait, perhaps it's not an ester but a ketone with an ethyl group and an O-H group. So the structure could be something like CH2CH2COCH2CH2OH. But that would have a ketone (O) and an alcohol (O), so two O's. The formula would be C6H12O2. That's option A.

But wait, the NMR shows vinyl H. So the structure must have a double bond. So maybe it's CH2=CHCOCH2CH2OH. Let me count the H's. Structure: CH2=CH-C(OH)-CH2-CH2-OH? No, that would have more O's. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH2CH3. Then the formula would be C6H10O2, which is option C.

Wait, let me calculate that. CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3: that's 2 (from CH2=CH) + 2 (from COO) + 2 (from CH2CH3) → total 6 C. H's: CH2=CH (4 H) + COO (2 O, no H) + CH2CH3 (5 H, but wait, the ester oxygen is in the middle). Let me count H properly:

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3: 

CH2=CH group: 3 H (since CH2 has two H, CH has one, but double bond reduces H). Wait, no: the structure is CH2=CH-CO-O-CH2CH3.

So CH2=CH → 2 H (from CH2) + 1 H (from CH) = 3 H.

COO → no H.

OCH2CH3 → 5 H (since CH2 has 2 H, CH3 has 3 H).

And the COO is connected to the CH2=CH group. So in total: 3 (from CH2=CH) + 5 (from OCH2CH3) plus any H on the carbonyl? No, carbonyl doesn't have H. Wait, the COO group is O=C-O-. So the carbonyl is double bonded, no H.

So total H would be 3 +5 =8? But the molecular formula for that structure would be C5H8O2. But option C is C6H10O2. So perhaps I'm missing a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. No, that's getting too long.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester with an ethyl group and a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. Let me count carbons: CH2=CH (2) + CH2 (3) + COO (4,5) + CH2CH3 (6,7). No, that's seven carbons. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic structure with five members. For example, a cyclopentene ring with an ester substituent. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an aromatic ester with a substituent. For example, phenyl acrylate: but that would have more carbons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is methyl vinyl acetate. Wait, methyl vinyl acetate is CH3COOCH2CH2CH2CH2=CH2? No, wait, methyl vinyl acetate is CH3COOCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2=CH2? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, methyl vinyl ester would be CH2=CHCOOCH3. Formula is C4H6O2. Not matching our options.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an acyclic ester with a double bond, along with an ethyl group. For example, CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3, but that would be C6H10O2. Let me count:

CH2=CHCOO is C3H4O2.

OCH2CH2CH3 is C3H7O.

Wait, no. The ester is O connected to ethyl, so OCH2CH3. So the formula for RCOOCH2CH3 is (R is C3H5O), but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an ester with a vinyl group and an ethyl group.

Another angle: the molecular formula must be one of the options. Let's see what each option's molecular weight is.

A) C6H12O2 → (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16)=72+12+32=116.

C) C6H10O2 →72 +10 +32=114.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment at m/z 45. If the compound is C6H10O2, the molecular weight is 114. The fragment at 45 implies that a part of the molecule with mass 45 was lost. So 114-45=69. So the rest would be 69. 69 corresponds to something like C3H7O (3*12+7+16=36+7+16=59) no. Or C5H11O (5*12+11 +16=60+11+16=87, no). Or 69 could be a different group.

Wait, 69 could be a fragment with the formula C4H9O. Let's calculate: 4*12=48 +9*1=9 +16=16 → total 73. No, that's not 69. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is not losing a part but retaining a part. For example, the fragment at 45 could be a neutral loss. For example, in some esters, the ester group can break off. The ester group is O-CO-O-R, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: in the mass spectrum, the fragment at m/z 45 could be the molecular ion of a smaller molecule. For example, if the compound is an ester with a ethyl group, the fragment could be the ethoxy group (OCH2CH3)=45. So the rest would be 114-45=69. But what would have a mass of 69?

69 could be something like C3H7CO (57), no. Alternatively, perhaps the rest is a ketone or an alcohol.

Alternatively, if the structure is an ester with an ethyl group, the loss of OCH2CH3 (45) would leave the rest of the molecule (which is RCOO-) with a mass of 69. RCOO- would have R being (69-44)=25. 44 is the mass of COO- (12+16*2=44). So R would have a mass of 25. 25 is C1H3O (12+3+16=31, no). Or maybe R is C2H5 (29), which would leave 69-44=25, which is not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me go back to the IR.

Option A: C6H12O2. If it's a carboxylic acid, the structure would be CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. IR would show a broad O-H (around 3000), strong C=O at 1700, and perhaps a peak at 1650 for something else. But a straight-chain carboxylic acid wouldn't have a peak at 1650. Unless it's conjugated with a double bond, which would require a DoU of 2, but option A has DoU 1. So that can't be.

So perhaps the compound isn't a carboxylic acid. Maybe it's an ester with an alcohol group.

Wait, but that would require more O's. Hmm.

Another approach: let's think about the molecular formula of each option and see which one can have a structure that fits all clues.

Option A: C6H12O2.

Structure possibilities: ester, carboxylic acid, ketone with an alcohol.

If it's an ester, the structure would be RCOOR'. Let's see if that can fit.

The FTIR would show C=O around 1700, and if there's an O-H (like an alcohol), a broad peak at 3000. So the compound would be an ester and an alcohol.

But how would that structure look? It would need an ester group and a hydroxyl group. For example, a structure like CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2CH2OH. But that would have more O's. Wait, no, the formula is C6H12O2. So perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester with an alcohol group, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a diol diester, but that might not fit.

Hmm, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester (lactone) with an additional hydroxyl group, but that would require more O's.

Alternatively, maybe it's not an ester but a ketone and a carboxylic acid. But that would require three O's, which isn't in the options.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to think of the possible structures for each option.

Option C: C6H10O2.

DoU is 2, so possible structures include a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

If it's an ester with a double bond and an ethyl group, that might fit.

Structure: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2. No, but that would be longer than six carbons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. Wait, that's five carbons. Not six.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. That's six carbons (CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3 → 2 from CH2=CH, 1 from CH2, 2 from COO, 2 from CH2CH3 → total 7? No, that's seven. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester with a double bond. For example, a six-membered ring with an ester group and a double bond. But I'm not certain.

Another possibility: the compound is a substituted cyclohexene with an ester group. For example, if the structure is cyclohexene with an ester substituent, that would have a double bond and an ester group.

But without more info, it's hard to pin down.

Let me think of the mass spec again. If the fragment is 45, which is OCH2CH3, then the parent must have an ethoxy group. So the formula must include OCH2CH3. So for option C, C6H10O2.

The structure would be something like RCOOCH2CH3, where R is C4H7O. Wait, RCOO- would have R as C3H5O, because RCOO is C4H7O2.

Wait, no: RCOOCH2CH3 has R as C4H7O. No, because the formula is RCOOCH2CH3 → R is C4H7O → but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, R is C4H9O.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH2=CHCH2)COOCH2CH3. That would be CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3, which is C6H10O2. Let's count:

CH2=CH (2 C, 3 H) + CH2 (1 C, 2 H) + COO (2 C, 2 O) + CH2CH3 (2 C, 5 H). Total C: 2+1+2+2=7 → no, that's seven C. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm
