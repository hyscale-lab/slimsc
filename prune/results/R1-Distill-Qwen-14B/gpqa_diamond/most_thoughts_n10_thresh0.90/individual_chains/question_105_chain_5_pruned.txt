Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem here. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. They're saying that when you observe the star's brightness over time, the spots cause variations because the star rotates and the spots come into and out of view. This makes the star's light curve look similar to an exoplanet transiting in front of it.

The question is asking: what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (Rpl) relative to the host star (Rstar) so that it produces the same amplitude in the light curve as these spots do?

Hmm, right. So the key here is to compare the brightness variations caused by the spots with those caused by a planet transit.

Let me think about how the brightness variations work in both cases.

First, when a star has spots, the observed brightness changes as the spots rotate into and out of view. Darker spots (cooler) lower the brightness when they're facing us. So the overall effect is a dip in brightness each time a spot is in the visible hemisphere. But since only one hemisphere is spotty, the spots would be moving in and out of our line of sight as the star rotates. So the photometric variations (light curve) would show a periodic dip as the spots rotate into and out of view.

In the case of a planet transiting the star, the planet blocks a part of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of this dip depends on the size of the planet relative to the star.

But wait, the problem says that the star's brightness variation due to the spots should have the same amplitude as the exoplanet's transit. So we need to find Rpl/Rstar such that the transit depth is equal to the variation caused by the spots.

Let me break this down into steps.

First, calculate the brightness variation caused by the spots.

The star has an effective temperature Teff of 6000 K. The spots are 1000 K cooler, so their temperature is 5000 K.

The filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So the total area covered by spots on the hemisphere is 0.2.

But wait, the star is a sphere, so each hemisphere is a spherical cap. The area of a hemisphere is 2πR² (but wait, no: the area of a sphere is 4πR², so a hemisphere is 2πR²). But the spots are covering 20% of the hemisphere, so the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the star's surface as a collection of bright and dark regions. The overall flux (brightness) from the star is the sum of the flux from each region.

When the star rotates, different parts of its surface come into view. For the spots, they affect the brightness when they are on the facing side.

Wait, but in this problem, only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the star rotates, that hemisphere comes into view or goes away. So the maximum variation would occur when the entire spotted area is visible, and when it's not.

Wait no, that's not quite right. Since the star is rotating, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots. When it's not, we don't. But the star's rotation period would cause a modulation in brightness as the spots come in and out of view. But the problem says that the variations in brightness would be periodic because of the rotation.

Wait, but how does the brightness vary as the star rotates? Let me think about the brightness variation caused by the spots.

The star's total flux is F = σTeff^4 * (Area of the star). 

The spots are cooler, so each spot contributes less flux. The total flux from the star when the spots are visible is less when more of the spots are in view.

But the star is rotating, so the spots come into view as the star turns. But wait, this is a bit more complicated because the spots are on a hemisphere. So when the star's rotation brings the spotted hemisphere to face us, its brightness will dip because the cooler spots are blocking more of the hotter surface.

Wait, no, the spots are cooler, so when they're on the facing side, the total flux is less than when the unspotted side is facing us.

Wait, but the star's surface has a certain area. Let me model the star as being composed of normal surface and spotted surface.

The star's total surface area is 4πR², but the spots are only on one hemisphere, so the total area of the spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Wait, no, the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So the area covered by spots on that hemisphere is 0.2 * (area of hemisphere) which is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

So the rest of the star's surface is the unspotted area.

The star's total emitted flux without any spots would be F0 = σTeff^4 * 4πR².

But with spots, when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, part of the star's surface (the spots) emits less flux.

So when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the total flux F is:

F = (Area without spots) * σTeff^4 + (Area of spots) * σ(Teff - ΔT)^4

Wait, more accurately, the unspotted area is (2πR² - 0.4πR²) = 1.6π R².

Wait no, the area of the spotty hemisphere is 2πR², so the spots take up 20% of that, which is 0.4π R². So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the unspotted area we see is (2πR² - 0.4πR²) = 1.6π R². But wait, that's not correct because the spotty hemisphere is the one being observed entirely. Or is it that when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, all the spots are visible, so the unspotted area is 1.6πR², and the spotted area is 0.4π R².

Wait, perhaps I should model the surface as such: When the star's unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the entire hemisphere (2πR²) is at Teff, so the flux is F_unspotted = σTeff^4 * 2πR².

When the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotted = (2πR² - 0.4π R²) * σTeff^4 + 0.4π R² * σ(Teff - 1000K)^4.

But wait, that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the average flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible.

Alternatively, the maximum and minimum fluxes as the star rotates would cause the amplitude of the brightness variation.

Wait, but the problem states that the brightness variation is due to rotationally-modulated spots.
