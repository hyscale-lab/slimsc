Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but let's try.

The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species in solution. The given data includes the concentration of Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, and the stability constants for the complexes.

Wait, stability constants (β) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex is favored. So, each β corresponds to a complex with more SCN- ligands. Let me recall: for each βn, it's the formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ions.

So, the possible complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)2], [Co(SCN)3]^-, and [Co(SCN)4]^3-. The β values given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait a second, β4 is lower than β3. That's interesting. So the most stable is the [Co(SCN)3]^- complex with β3=63.

But the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the [Co(SCN)2] complex. So we're looking for the fraction of Co that's in the form [Co(SCN)2], which is the second complex in the series.

The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. Wait, but the solution contains both Co(II) ions and SCN-; so the Co can form complexes with varying numbers of SCN-.

To find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, I think I need to calculate the distribution of Co among all possible complexes. This involves setting up the formation reactions and using the stability constants to find the fractions.

So, the general approach is to model the distribution of Co(II) among its complexes. The formation of each complex is a stepwise process, so each βn is the formation constant for the nth ligand.

Wait, I remember that the fraction of a particular complex can be found using the formula involving the product of the stability constants up to that point, divided by the sum of all such products. But I might be mixing things up. Let me think.

Another approach is to consider the stepwise formation of complexes. The total concentration of all Co species is the sum of [Co], [CoSCN+], [Co(SCN)2], [Co(SCN)3^-], [Co(SCN)4^3-]. But because the concentration of free Co^2+ is low, but the SCN- is in excess, perhaps the majority forms the most stable complex?

Wait, no. The concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 M. The total Co is 0.01 M. Since each complex uses multiple SCN-, but the solution has enough SCN- (since 0.01 M Co would require up to 4 * 0.01 = 0.04 M SCN- for all complexes; but since we have 0.1 M SCN-, which is more than 0.04 M, so SCN- is in excess. So the formation of complexes is mainly controlled by the stability constants.

So, the distribution of Co among the complexes can be found by considering the relative formation constants. Let me outline the complexes:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}

The stability constant βn is given for each n=1,2,3,4. So β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, but stability constants are usually written as Kf, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. For each step, the βn is the cumulative constant for n ligands. Wait, no, I think each βn is the overall constant for forming the complex with n ligands. So, for example, β2 is the constant for [Co(SCN)2], which is the product of the first two stepwise constants, K1 and K2: β2 = K1 * K2.

But for the purpose of calculating the fraction, perhaps we need to think in terms of the stepwise or cumulative constants.

Wait, another way: the fraction of each complex can be determined using the ratios of the stability constants.

The fraction fn of the nth complex is proportional to (β1 * β2 * ... * βn) multiplied by some function of the concentrations of the ligands.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model each complex's concentration in terms of the others, using the stability constants and the concentrations.

Let me define:

Let’s write the expressions for each complex’s concentration.

Let’s denote:

[Co^2+] = c0

[Co(SCN)^+] = c1

[Co(SCN)_2] = c2

[Co(SCN)_3^-] = c3

[Co(SCN)_4^3-] = c4

The total cobalt concentration is c_total = c0 + c1 + c2 + c3 + c4 = 1e-2 M.

The formation of each complex is governed by the stability constants.

The β for each complex is the equilibrium constant for:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}

So, βn = [ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} ] / ( [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n )

So,

c1 = β1 * c0 * [SCN-]

c2 = β2 * c1 * [SCN-]

Wait, no, because β2 is [ [Co(SCN)_2] ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN-]^2 )

So rearranged,

c2 = β2 * c0 * [SCN-]^2 / (1)

Wait, no, let me correct this.

Wait, the correct way is:

βn = [ [Co(SCN)_n] ] / ( [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n )

So,

[Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n

But wait, that's if βn is for the overall formation to n ligands. So each complex is given by βn.

So, for each complex, [Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n

But wait, that can't be correct because each step would build on the previous. For example, [Co(SCN)_2] is formed by adding a SCN- to [Co(SCN)^+], which itself is formed by adding a SCN- to Co^2+.

So maybe a better approach is to express each complex in terms of Co^2+ and [SCN-] raised to the appropriate power, multiplied by the product of βs up to that point.

Alternatively, the fractions can be found by considering the ratios of the concentrations of each species relative to Co^2+.

Let me think. Let me denote f0 as the fraction of Co in the free form (Co^2+), f1 as the fraction in [CoSCN]^+, etc., up to f4.

Then, f0 + f1 + f2 + f3 + f4 = 1.

Each fraction fn can be expressed in terms of the previous fractions and the stability constants.

Alternatively, the fractions can be determined using the following approach. Since [Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n / (1 + ... ), but it's getting complicated. Maybe it's better to model it as a set of equations.

So, let's define:

c0 = [Co^2+] = c_total * f0

c1 = [Co(SCN)^+] = c_total * f1

c2 = [Co(SCN)_2] = c_total * f2

c3 = [Co(SCN)_3^-] = c_total * f3

c4 = [Co(SCN)_4^3-] = c_total * f4

Each of these satisfies the stability constants.
