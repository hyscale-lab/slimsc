Okay, so I have this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

First, I remember that the brightness of a star as seen from Earth (apparent magnitude) determines whether a telescope can observe it. Both ESPRESSO and HIRES have different limits. The question says ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, while HIRES can go down to 16 mag. Wait, actually, no, the question says "brighter than 17" for ESPRESSO and "brighter than 16" for HIRES. Oh wait, wait, no—apparent magnitude is such that lower numbers are brighter. So, if a star is brighter (lower apparent magnitude), both would see it. But the limit is the faintest they can see—like, ESPRESSO can see up to 17 mag, meaning 17 is the faintest it can handle. HIRES can go down to 16 mag, so fainter stars would be 17 or above? Wait, no, because 16 is brighter than 17. So, a star with apparent V mag of 16 is brighter than 17, so both can see it. But a star with 17 mag is only seen by ESPRESSO, and something at 18 mag would be too faint for both.

So the key is to find the apparent V magnitude of each star and see if it's less than or equal to 17 (for ESPRESSO) and less than or equal to 16 (for HIRES). Wait, wait. Wait, no: the question states that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So, m_V < 17. Similarly, with HIRES, m_V <16. So a star must have m_V less than 17 to be seen by ESPRESSO, and less than 16 to be seen by HIRES. So, for a star to be detected by both, it needs to be brighter than 16 in V mag because both can detect it only if it's that bright. Because if a star is 16.5, then ESPRESSO can see it (since 16.5<17), but HIRES can't because HIRES only goes down to 16 (brighter than 16 mag, so 16.5 is fainter than 16, so HIRES can't see it. Wait, no: the question says "stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO, so that includes stars at 16, 16.5, 17 is the limit. Wait, but wait: if a star's apparent V magnitude is brighter than 17, meaning m_V < 17. So if a star has m_V =16.5, that's <17, so ESPRESSO can see it. But for HIRES, the limit is brighter than 16, meaning m_V <16. So m_V=16.5 is not, so HIRES can't see it. So the star can be seen by ESPRESSO but not HIRES.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: the apparent magnitude scale is such that lower numbers are brighter. So a star with m=15 is brighter than one with m=17. So the "brighter than 17" would include anything from m=very low (like 1) up to m=17. So for ESPRESSO, any star with m <=17 (but wait, the wording is 'brighter than 17 mag can be observed', which is m <17. So stars with m=17 and fainter would not be observed. Wait, that's a bit confusing. So, the limit is that the apparent magnitude must be less than 17 for ESPRESSO. So m <17. Similarly
