Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm not quite sure how to approach it. Let me read through it again and try to break it down.

So, the question is about a star with certain parameters and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, right, I remember that when stars have spots, their overall brightness and temperature can change, which affects the spectral lines we observe.

The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, why does the temperature drop when spots are present? Oh, right, because dark spots are cooler regions on the star's surface, so they emit less radiation, lowering the star's overall effective temperature.

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). It says this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, which is in the near ultraviolet or maybe the far UV? I'm not exactly sure, but maybe that's a clue about the ionization state or the energy of the transition.

The question asks for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So, we're looking for (Ratio without spots) / (Ratio with spots) = factor.

I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the number of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights of the levels, E2 and E1 are their energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait. The ratio in the problem is n1/n2, right? Because the question says the ratio decreases when spots are present. So without spots (T=6000 K), the ratio is higher, and with spots (T=5500 K), it's lower. So when the temperature goes down, n1/n2 decreases. Let me see: The exponent becomes more negative when T decreases because (E2 - E1) is in the numerator. So exp(-ΔE/(kT)) would be smaller when T is smaller. So n2/n1 would be smaller when T is smaller. But the ratio n1/n2 is the inverse of n2/n1. So as T decreases, n1/n2 increases? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, let me think again. Let's say E2 > E1. So ΔE = E2 - E1 is positive.

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T) )

If T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so exp(...) increases. So n2/n1 increases as T increases. Thus, the ratio n1/n2 would decrease as T increases because it's the inverse.

Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall T is lower (5500 K). So the ratio n1/n2 (which is level 1 over level 2) would be higher when T is lower. Because if T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so n2/n1 is smaller, so n1/n2 is larger.

Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Oh wait, that can't be right. Because without spots, T is 6000 K, with spots, 5500 K. So the ratio n1/n2 would be higher when T is 5500 K, but the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So I'm getting conflicting info. Hmm, maybe I have the ratio backwards.

Wait, the question says, "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots." So the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when spots are present. So when T is 5500 K, the ratio is lower than when T is 6000 K. That suggests that as T decreases, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. But according to the Boltzmann equation, when T decreases, n2/n1 decreases because the exponential term is smaller, so n2 is smaller relative to n1. So n1/n2 would be larger when T is lower. But the problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present, which is when T is lower. So this seems contradictory. Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting which level is higher.

Wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again. Suppose level 2 is lower in energy than level 1. No, that can't be, because then the transition would require emission. Oh, wait, the transition is between two levels, but which one is higher? The wavelength is about 1448 Å, which is in the UV. Titanium has various transitions, but I'm not sure. But the energy of the photon would be E = hc/λ. But regardless, the key is the energy difference between the two levels.

Wait, but in the Boltzmann equation, it's the difference E2 - E1. So if E2 is higher than E1, then ΔE is positive. So when T is lower, the ratio n2/n1 (higher energy level over lower) is lower because the exponential is smaller. So (n2/n1) decreases as T decreases. So n1/n2 would be (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(kT)), right?

Wait, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k*T) ) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T) )^(-1) ) = (g2/g1) * exp( ΔE/(k*T) )

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me rederive it. The Boltzmann factor is for the energy difference.

n2 = n1 * (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So n2/n1 = (g2/g
