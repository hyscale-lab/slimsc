Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, right? Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. 

Wait, what's a rhombohedral crystal? Oh right, it's a type of crystal structure where all the lattice vectors are of equal length, and all the angles between them are the same. So, in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and α = β = γ. That makes sense. The interatomic distance here is given as 10 Å, which I think is the length of each lattice vector 'a', since in a rhombohedral structure, all edges are equal. 

The angles are all 30 degrees each. So α = β = γ = 30°. The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember that interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. The formula for calculating interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by something like d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + ... I think there are some terms involving the angles. Wait, maybe I should recall the exact formula.

Oh right, the general formula when the lattice is not cubic (like in a rhombohedral or hexagonal system) is a bit more complex. The formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles α, β, γ is:

1/d_{hkl}^2 = (h^2/l^2) + (k^2/m^2) + (l^2/n^2) - [ (hk cos α)/(lm a^2) + (hk cos β)/(ln b^2) + ... ] 

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Alternatively, I recall another version where for a rhombohedral system, with a = b = c = a0 and angles all equal (like here α=β=γ=30°), the formula simplifies because of the symmetry. 

Alternatively, perhaps the general formula is 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - [ (h k cos γ) / a² + (h l cos β)/(a²) + (k l cos α)/(a²) ) ] / (something). Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look up the exact formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system can be derived using the Miller indices (hkl). The formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ )

But wait, wait, that might only be for a cubic system. Because in a cubic system, α=β=γ=90°, so cos terms vanish, and the formula reduces to 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/a². But in a rhombohedral case, the angles are not 90°, so the formula must include those cos terms.

Wait, so in the general case (non-cubic), the formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² (1/h²) ) + ... ) Wait no, that's not it. Let me think again. 

Oh, perhaps the correct formula is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) ) / (a²)

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me try to get the correct formula straight.

The general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system is given by:

d_{hkl} = [ (a² b² c²) / ( (a^2 (l^2 m^2 sin^2 α) + b^2 (k^2 n^2 sin^2
