Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me try to think it through. I'm a bit rusty on some of these relativity concepts, but let's see.

The problem says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer and in the same direction as the light. That sounds a bit confusing because if the glass is moving towards the observer, then the light is moving towards the observer as well, but the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. Wait no, the beam is moving through the glass, so the glass's movement would affect the observed speed.

I remember something about how the speed of light is constant in a vacuum, but in a medium, it's c/n. But when the medium is moving, do we add the velocities? Like, is it a simple addition or does relativity come into play?

Wait, but the options given don't involve any terms like gamma (Lorentz factor), which makes me think this might be a non-relativistic problem, so maybe we can use Galilean addition of velocities.

In the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed is c/n (since it's in a medium with refractive index n). But Galilean addition would say that if the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame, then the light's speed in the lab frame would be (c/n) + v. But wait, wait, no, because the direction matters. The glass is moving in the same direction as the light, so the light's velocity in the lab frame would be the velocity of the glass plus the velocity of the light in the glass's frame.

Wait a second, but the glass's velocity is towards the observer. Hmm, but the light is propagating through the glass towards the observer as well. So, in this case, the glass is moving towards the lab observer at velocity v, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's movement. So, perhaps the light's speed in the lab frame would be (c/n) + v? But that might not be correct because the glass's movement might affect the refractive index or the light's speed in a different way.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the frame transformations. From the glass
