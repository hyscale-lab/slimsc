Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember harmonic oscillators from my mechanics classes, but relativistic? That's a bit more complex. Let's try to break this down.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The given parameters are mass m, maximum amplitude A, and it obeys Hooke's law F = -kx. The speed of light is c. The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, okay, so in the non-relativistic case, a harmonic oscillator has maximum speed given by v_max = sqrt(kA/m), right? Because the energy is conserved, potential energy at maximum displacement (1/2 kA²) converts to kinetic energy (1/2 mv_max²). So equating them gives v_max squared as kA²/m. So option C is that result. But this is the non-relativistic case. But the question is relativistic, so we can't use that directly.

Relativistic effects come into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So in special relativity, momentum and energy have different expressions. The oscillator's speed can't exceed c, but the question is about how high it can go when we include relativistic considerations.

Wait, in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the equations are different. The potential is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv². Instead, kinetic energy would be the total energy minus the rest mass energy. Or wait, maybe not. Let me think.

In special relativity, the total energy E is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc². So in the case of the oscillator, when the mass is at maximum displacement x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². The kinetic energy there is zero because the oscillator is momentarily at rest. As it moves towards equilibrium, the potential energy converts into kinetic energy. But wait, because it's relativistic, the energy expressions are different.

Wait, but wait. In a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx². The kinetic energy is (1/2)mv² in the non-relativistic case. But relativistically, kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc². So the total mechanical energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential. At maximum amplitude, all energy is potential, so E = (1/2)kA². At any other point, E = (1/2)kA² = (1/2)kx² + (gamma -1) mc².

But wait, wait, is that correct? Or is the potential energy different? No, Hooke's law is F = -kx, so the potential energy is the same as the classical case, (1/2)kx². So the total energy is (1/2)kA², which is the sum of kinetic and potential.

So when the oscillator is at the equilibrium point (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. So (1/2)kA² = (gamma -1) mc². Because potential energy is zero there. So,

(1/2)kA² = (gamma -1) mc².

We can solve for gamma here. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), and at x=0, the speed is maximum, so v_max is the speed we're trying to find.

So let's write that equation:

(1/2) k A² = (gamma -1) m c².

Let me rearrange this:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some term, perhaps, to make it easier. Let me call it β for now. So:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + β.

Wait, β is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Now, we can square both sides to get rid of the square root.

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)]².

But wait, [1 + a] squared is 1 + 2a + a². Let's compute that.

So,

1/(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + 2*(k A²)/(2 m c²) + [k A²/(2 m c²)]².

Simplify the terms:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(m c²) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this is leading me anywhere. Maybe I should instead invert the equation.

Let me take reciprocal of both sides. Let me denote the right-hand side as (1 + β)^2 where β = (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + β)^2.

Therefore,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + β)^2.

Which can be written as:

v²/c² = [ (1 + β)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + β)^2.

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2β + β² - 1 ) = 2β + β².

So,

v²/c² = (2β + β²) / (1 + β)^2.

Factor numerator: β*(2 + β).

Denominator: (1 + β)^2.

So,

v² = c² * [ β (2 + β) ] / (1 + β)^2.

But β is (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let's plug that in.

v² = c² * [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) * (2 + (k A²/(2 m c²))) ) ] / [ (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )^2 ]

Hmm, that's getting a bit complicated. Let me try to simplify this.

Let me compute the numerator inside the brackets:

Numerator = (k A²/(2 m c²)) * [ 2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) ]

Let me compute 2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)).

Let me factor out 1/(2 m c²):

= (2*(2 m c²) + k A² )/(2 m c² )

Wait, no. Let me write 2 as (4 m c²)/(2 m c²) because 2 = (4 m c²)/(2 m c²) if I'm getting a common denominator. Wait, perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = [4 m c² + k A² ]/(2 m c²).

So,

Numerator becomes:

(k A²/(2 m c²)) * [ (4 m c² + k A² )/(2 m c²) ) ]

Which is:

(k A² (4 m c² + k A² )) / [ (2 m c²)(2 m c²) ) ]

Denominator: (2 m c²)^2 = 4 m² c^4.

So numerator is k A^2 (4 m c² + k A²) / (4 m² c^4).

The entire expression for v² is c² multiplied by this numerator, divided by denominator of (1 + β)^2.

Wait, wait. Let me take it step by step.

Wait v² is c² multiplied by [ numerator ] / [ denominator ].

Wait, no, the initial expression after substitution is:

v² = c² * [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) * [2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)] ] / [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)) )^2 ]

So, let's compute the numerator inside:

(k A^2/(2 m c²)) * [2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)] = [k A^2/(2 m c²)] * [ 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ]

Let me compute 2 as (4 m c²)/(2 m c²) so:

= [k A^2/(2 m c²)] * [ (4 m c² + k A^2 )/(2 m c²) ) ]

= [k A^2 (4 m c² + k A^2 ) ] / [ (2 m c²)(2 m c²) ) ]

= [k A^2 (4 m c² + k A^2 ) ] / (4 m² c^4 )

So,

v² = c² * [ k A² (4 m c² + k A^2 ) / (4 m² c^4 ) ] / [ (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c²)) )^2 ]

Simplify denominator of the big fraction. The denominator is [ (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c²)) ) ] squared.

Let me compute (1 + β)^2 where β = kA²/(2 m c²).

So,

(1 + β)^2 = 1 + 2β + β² = 1 + 2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2))².

= 1 + (k A^2)/(m c^2) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )

Hmm, but perhaps it's better to leave it as (1 + β)^2 for now.

Putting it all together,

v² = c² * [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / [ 4 m^2 c^4 (1 + β )^2 ]

Wait, I think I may have made a mistake earlier in the algebra. Let me re-express:

The numerator inside the expression is [k A²/(2 m c²)] * [2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)].

Which is [k A^2/(2 m c^2)] * [ (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2) ) ]

So,

= [k A² (4 m c² + k A^2 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2)(2 m c^2) ) ]

Which is,

= [k A² (4 m c² + k A^2 ) ] / (4 m² c^4 )

So,

v² = c² * [ [k A² (4 m c² + k A^2 ) ] / (4 m² c^4 ) ] / [ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) )^2 ]

Let me simplify the numerator and denominator.

Let me factor out k A^2 from the numerator:

Wait, 4 m c² + k A² = k A² ( (4 m c²)/(k A²) + 1 )

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, let me write the entire equation again.

v² = [ c² * k A^2 (4 m c² + k A^2 ) ] / [ 4 m^2 c^4 (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) )^2 ]

Let me factor the denominator (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2)) ) squared.

Let me write it as [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2) ) ]^2.

So,

Denominator becomes [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2) ) ]^2 = (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 / (4 m² c^4 )

So, putting that into the equation:

v² = [ c² * k A^2 (4 m c² + k A^2 ) ] / [ 4 m^2 c^4 * ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 )/(4 m² c^4) ) ]

Wait, wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me compute the entire denominator.

The denominator of the big fraction is 4 m^2 c^4 multiplied by (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) )^2.

Which is 4 m^2 c^4 * [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2) ) ]^2.

So,

= 4 m^2 c^4 * ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ) / (4 m^2 c^4 )

= [4 m^2 c^4 * (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ] / [4 m^2 c^4 ]

The 4 m² c^4 cancels out, so denominator becomes (2 m c² + k A² )^2.

So, now v² is:

v² = [ c² * k A^2 (4 m c² + k A^2 ) ] / [ (2 m c² + k A² )^2 ]

Wait, but let me check. Because the denominator was 4 m² c^4 times [ (2 m c² +k A^2 )/(2 m c^2) ) ]^2.

Wait, no, the denominator was 4 m² c^4 multiplied by that term.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator earlier.

Wait, the big denominator is 4 m² c^4 multiplied by (1 + beta)^2.

Which is 4 m² c^4 * [ (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 ) / (4 m² c^4 ) ]

Wait, because (1 + beta ) is (2 m c² + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ), so squared would be (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 / (4 m^2 c^4 )

So,

Denominator: 4 m² c^4 * [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 / (4 m^2 c^4 ) ) ]

= [4 m^2 c^4 * (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )² ] / (4 m² c^4 )

The 4 m² c^4 cancels, leaving (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

So, v² is:

v² = [ c² * k A^2 (4 m c² + k A^2 ) ] / [ (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 ]

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Let me see if I can factor this differently.

Wait, 4 m c^2 +k A^2 = 2*(2 m c^2) +k A^2 = 2*(2 m c^2 + (k A^2)/2 )

Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps factor numerator and denominator.

Wait, numerator is c² * k A^2 (4 m c² + k A^2 )

Denominator is (2 m c² + k A² )^2.

Let me write 4 m c^2 as 2*(2 m c^2 ), so:

Numerator becomes c² k A^2 [ 2 (2 m c²) + k A^2 ]

= 2 c² k A^2 (2 m c²) + c² k A^2 (k A^2 )

Wait, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps factor (2 m c² + k A^2 ) from the numerator.

Wait, 4 m c^2 +k A^2 = 2*(2 m c²) +k A^2 = 2*(2 m c^2) +k A^2. Hmm, not directly.

Alternatively, perhaps let me think of 4 m c^2 +k A^2 = 2*(2 m c^2) +k A^2 = (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) +2 m c^2.

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe I can write numerator as (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) * something.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently.

Wait, let me go back to the equation after squaring:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ]^2.

Let me denote (k A^2)/(2 m c²) as S.

So equation becomes:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + S )².

Taking reciprocal:

(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + S )².

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + S )².

Which is,

v²/c² = [ (1 + S )^2 -1 ] / (1 + S )^2.

Compute numerator:

(1 + 2S + S²) -1 = 2S + S².

So,

v²/c² = (2S + S² ) / (1 + S )².

Factor numerator:

S (2 + S ) / (1 + S )².

So,

v² = c² * S (2 + S ) / (1 + S )².

But S is (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

So,

v² = c² * [ (k A²/(2 m c^2 )) * (2 + (k A²/(2 m c^2 )) ) ] / ( 1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2 )) )^2.

Let me compute the term (2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) = [4 m c^2 + k A^2 ]/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v² = c² * [ (k A²/(2 m c^2 )) * (4 m c^2 +k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ) ] / [ ( (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) )^2 ]

Simplify numerator:

= c² * [ k A² (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 )^2 * (2 m c^2 )^2 ) ] ?

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate.

Wait, the numerator inside the big fraction is:

( k A²/(2 m c^2 ) ) * (4 m c^2 +k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Which is:

[ k A² (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 )^2 ]

Denominator of the big fraction is [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2.

So,

Denominator big fraction: (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 / ( (2 m c^2 )^2 )

So putting it all together,

v² = c² * [ numerator ] / [ denominator ]

numerator: [ k A² (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] / (4 m² c^4 )

denominator: (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 / (4 m² c^4 )

So when you divide numerator by denominator, it's same as multiply by reciprocal.

So,

v² = c² * [ k A² (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) / (4 m² c^4 ) ] * [4 m² c^4 / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 ]

The 4 m² c^4 cancels out.

So,

v² = c² * [ k A² (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 ]

Hmm, let me factor numerator and denominator.

4 m c^2 = 2 * (2 m c^2 )

So,

4 m c^2 +k A^2 = 2 (2 m c^2 ) +k A^2 = (2 m c^2 + (2 m c^2 ) ) +k A^2

Not particularly helpful.

Wait, maybe factor 2 from 4 m c^2:

4 m c^2 = 2*(2 m c^2 )

So,

4 m c^2 +k A^2 = 2*(2 m c^2 ) +k A^2.

Wait, but the denominator is (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2.

So,

v² = c² * [ k A^2 (2*(2 m c^2 ) +k A^2 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 ]

= c² * [k A^2 ( 2*(2 m c^2 ) +k A^2 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 ]

Wait, perhaps we can write 2*(2 m c^2 ) as 2*(2 m c^2 +k A^2 -k A^2 )

But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to accept that the expression is as it is and take the square root.

Wait,

v = c * sqrt( [k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 )

But I can factor out the (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) terms.

Wait, 4 m c^2 +k A^2 = 2*(2 m c^2) +k A^2.

Hmm, not sure.
