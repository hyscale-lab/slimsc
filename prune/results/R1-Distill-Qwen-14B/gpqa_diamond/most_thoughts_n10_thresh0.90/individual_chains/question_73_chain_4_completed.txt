Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, you can't just add them normally. Newtonian addition doesn't work because of relativity effects. So I think I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, but wait, the question is asking about their relative speed. Oh right, the relative speed isn't just the difference because of relativity. So I should calculate the relative velocity of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame.

The formula for relative velocity in relativity is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me plug in the numbers. So v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So the numerator is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c². Let's compute that: (0.3c²)/c² = 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c. That's about 0.14c when rounded. So looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So that's a clue.

Now the second part is the total energy of the system. Total energy in relativity for each object is their relativistic energy, which is gamma times m c squared. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Wait, but each astronaut has their own mass and velocity, so I need to calculate each of their energies and then sum them.

So first astronaut: mass 2m, velocity 0.6c. Gamma for him is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So his energy is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, velocity 0.5c. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.25)) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So his energy is approximately 1.1547 * 3m c². Let me calculate that: 1.1547 *3 = 3.4641 m c². So adding both energies: 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c². 

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc². Option B says E=4.96, which is lower. Option D says E=5 mc², which is an approximate but lower than our calculation. So the correct energy is about 5.96, which matches option C.

Wait, but wait a second. The question says "the total energy of the system." But wait, in relativity, when considering the energy of a system, you have to consider the frame of reference. The problem doesn't specify the frame, but I think it's asking for the sum of their energies in the lab frame, not in another frame. Because if you were in one astronaut's frame, the other would have a different energy. But the problem statement doesn't specify a particular frame, but each astronaut is moving in the positive x-direction. Hmm, perhaps the lab frame is the one where the astronauts are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c. So adding their energies in that frame is correct.

So putting it all together, the relative speed is 0.14c and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². So the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy
The total energy of each astronaut is calculated using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), velocity \(0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), velocity \(0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.4641m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is the sum of the two energies:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.4641m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\)**
