Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in the qubits space. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = 1/2 (|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices represent the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. So this is a density matrix for a qubit.

I think I need to find out where this state is located in the Bloch sphere representation. Oh right, the Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Each point on the sphere corresponds to a possible state of the qubit. The state |0> is at (1,0,0) and |1> is at (-1,0,0), I think. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Or perhaps |0> is at (1,0,0) and |1> is at (-1,0,0) because |0> is the ground state and |1> is the excited state. Or maybe I got that reversed. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is ρ = [[a, b; c, d]], but maybe it's easier to express it in terms of the Bloch sphere parameters. The Bloch vector (r) has components (x, y, z), and any qubit state can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So when we have ρ, we can write it as (I + r·σ)/2, and then the Bloch vector r gives the position.

Wait, in this problem, the density matrix is given as (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute that. |0><0| is the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], and then multiply by 1/2, so ρ is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. Oh, that's interesting. That's a diagonal matrix with both diagonal entries equal to 1/2.

Wait, what does that represent? I remember that this is the maximally mixed state. It's like a classical mixture of |0> and |1>, each with 50% probability. So in the Bloch sphere, the state is at the origin because there's no preference for any direction. Because the Bloch vector r would be zero in this case. Because if ρ is (I + r·σ)/2, then when r is zero, ρ is (I)/2, which is exactly what we have here.

So looking at the options, I need to find which one has r=(0,0,0). Let me check the options. Option C is (0,0,0). So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't mix anything up. The |0> state is (1,0,0), and |1> is (-1,0,0). The maximally mixed state would be in the center, so r=(0,0,0). So yes, option C is correct.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This is a diagonal matrix with entries \(\rho_{00} = \frac{1}{2}\) and \(\rho_{11} = \frac{1}{2}\). This represents the maximally mixed state of a qubit, which corresponds to equal probabilities of the qubit being in the states \(\left|0\right\rangle\) and \(\left|1\right\rangle\). 

In the Bloch sphere representation, the state of a qubit is described by a Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\), where the density matrix can be expressed as \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right)\), with \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) being the Pauli matrices. For the maximally mixed state, \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), as there is no preference for any direction in the Bloch sphere. This corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere.

Among the given options:
- **A) \((1,1,0)\):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state with a specific Bloch vector.
- **B) \((0,0,1)\):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a different mixed state.
- **C) \((0,0,0)\):** Correct, as this is the center of the Bloch sphere, representing the maximally mixed state.
- **D) \((1,1,1)\):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state with a specific Bloch vector.

Thus, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is \((0,0,0)\). 

Answer: C
