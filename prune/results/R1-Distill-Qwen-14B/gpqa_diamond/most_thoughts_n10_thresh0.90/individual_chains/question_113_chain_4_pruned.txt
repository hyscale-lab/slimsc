Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the chemical formula of this unknown compound based on the given spectroscopy data. Let me go through each piece of information step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum. I remember that IR peaks give information about functional groups. The very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ probably indicates O-H stretching, like in an alcohol or carboxylic acid. Wait, but a very broad peak might be more characteristic of an alcohol (like in a carbonyl group for a carboxylic acid it's usually a broad peak around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹). Hmm, but wait, carboxylic acids have a very strong and broad O-H peak. But if it's an alcohol, maybe the peak is less broad? Or maybe it's an -OH in a ketone? No, wait, ketones don't have O-H. So the broad peak is probably from an -OH group, maybe an alcohol, but could also be a carboxylic acid.

Then, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 is a strong peak, which suggests a carbonyl group. The 1650 might be another carbonyl, maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, like a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ketone or maybe an ester or something else. Alternatively, the 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, maybe a ketone or an aldehyde, but aldehydes usually have lower carbonyl peaks, like around 1700, but maybe this is another type. Wait, 1650 is a bit lower, so maybe it's an aromatic ring or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl group. Because that would lower the carbonyl peak due to conjugation.

Next, the ¹H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has an alkene group, which means it's not fully saturated. So the formula must include a double bond or a ring. Let's see, the options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2.

Wait, the molecular formula for a hydrocarbon can be determined using degrees of unsaturation. Let me think: the general formula for a saturated hydrocarbon is CnH2n+2. For each degree of unsaturation (like a ring or a double bond), you lose two H's. So, the formula for the compound is C6HxOy. Let's compute the degrees of unsaturation for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. The formula for hydrogens is 12. For C6H12O2, the H count would be 12. The degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So 1 degree of unsaturation. That could be one double bond or one ring.

Option B: C6H10O. H=10. So (2*6+2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. Two degrees of unsaturation. Could be two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Option C: C6H10O2. H=10. So (14-10)/2=2. Two degrees of unsaturation.

Option D: C6H12O. H=12. (14-12)/2=1. One degree.

The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so there's at least one double bond. That means at least one degree of unsaturation. So options with two degrees (B, C) or one (A, D) are possible.

But then, looking again, the FTIR has a peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ for carbonyl. So the compound likely has a carbonyl group (C=O). That's another degree of unsaturation. So two degrees from carbonyl and the double bond. Wait, but if the compound has both a carbonyl and a double bond, that would be two degrees, but maybe some structures can have more.

Wait, if the compound has a conjugated system, like an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, that single double bond would account for two degrees (the double bond and the conjugation with another). Hmm, no, the conjugation doesn't add a degree of unsaturation; it's the double bonds and rings that count.

So, if the compound has a carbonyl group (1 degree) and an alkene (another degree), that's two. So the formula should have two degrees of unsaturation. So looking at the options, B and C have two degrees. So options B is C6H10O (which is two degrees) and C is C6H10O2 (two degrees as well).

Now, what about the Mass Spec data? The fragment peak is at m/z=45. 45 is a common fragment, often corresponding to a CH3CO+ ion (which is 45). Alternatively, it could be a (CH2)2O+ or similar, but 45 is the molecular ion of CH3COOH (which is 60, wait no, molecular weight of acetic acid is 60. So 45 is the methyl acetate ion? Or perhaps it's the acetate ion, which is 45 (CH3COO- is 45 if it's a fragment). Or maybe it's the CH3CO group. Wait, no, the molecular weight of CH3CO+ is 45? Let me calculate that. Carbon: 12, Hydrogen: 1, Oxygen: 16. So 12*2 + 1*3 +16*1=24 +3 +16=43. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, wait, the acetate ion is CH3COO⁻, which would be 12*2 + 1*3 +16*2=24+3+32=59. Hmm, but 45 is a different ion.

Wait, maybe it's the (CH2O) group. 12 + 2 +16=30. No, that's not it. Alternatively, the fragment could be from an ester. For example, in methyl acetate, the molecular ion is 73, but if it breaks off, perhaps a smaller fragment.

Alternatively, 45 could be the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's 91. Hmm. Wait, another possibility is the ketene ion, but that's more like 43. Hmm. Maybe it's the acylium ion, like CH3CO+. Let me calculate: CH3CO+ is (12*2)+(1*3)+(16*1) = 24 +3 +16=43. So that's 43, not 45. Hmm, what gives 45? Let me think of other possibilities.

Wait, perhaps it's a CH3COCH2... No, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, the fragment could be from an ester group. For example, the ester group O-CO-O, but that's more complicated. Wait, maybe it's the (CH2O) group, but that's 30. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe 45 is a fragment of a larger molecule, like the tropylium ion is 91, but probably not. Another approach: 45 can be a CH3CH2COOH fragment? No, that's 60. Wait, 45 is 45. So 45 could be the molecular ion of something like pentanoic acid? But no, pentanoic acid is 72 (12*5 +1*10 +16). Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment from an ester, like ethyl acetate. Wait, ethyl acetate has a molecular weight of 88. Its fragments might include smaller ions. For example, the ester group could break into CH3COO- which is 60. Hmm, but 60 is higher than 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is from an acyloxy group. For example, if the compound is an ester, the fragment could lose the R group and leave the ester part. Alternatively, perhaps another approach: 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. Wait, acetone is (CH3)2CO, which has a molecular weight of 58. No, that's not 45. Wait, perhaps it's something else.

Another thought: 45 could be the molecular ion of a smaller molecule. For example, if the compound is something like ethyl propionate, but that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's the loss of a fragment that results in a 45 m/z ion. For example, if the molecule loses a larger fragment, leaving a smaller one.

Wait, perhaps the compound is an ester. Esters typically have a carbonyl group, and their mass spec can produce fragments like the acyl group and the R-O- group. So maybe the 45 m/z is from the R-O- part. Or perhaps it's the acetyl group (CH3CO+) which is 43, but that's close to 45. Maybe some other isotope effect or adduct, but not sure
