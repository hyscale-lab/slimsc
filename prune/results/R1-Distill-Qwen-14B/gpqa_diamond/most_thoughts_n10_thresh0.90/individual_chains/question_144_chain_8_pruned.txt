Alright, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I remember from my studies that particles like mesons can decay, and the mean decay distance is something related to their lifetime. But wait, how exactly do I calculate that?

Okay, let's see what the question gives me. The meson X has a production energy of 8 GeV, a mass of 1.2 GeV, and a width of 320 MeV. I think the width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime via the uncertainty principle. Right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. But wait, the relation I remember is Γ ≈ ħ/τ, where Γ is the decay width and τ is the lifetime. So τ ≈ ħ/(Γ).

Wait, but calculating the mean decay distance would involve the velocity of the meson and the lifetime. Because distance is velocity multiplied by time. So, the mean decay distance (d) should be d = v * τ. 

But how do I find the velocity? Oh, right, from relativistic mechanics. Since the meson is produced with a certain energy, I can find its velocity. Or wait, do I need to consider its kinetic energy or total energy? Hmm, because the energy given is E_X =8 GeV, which includes its rest mass energy. The rest mass energy is m_X c², which is 1.2 GeV. So the kinetic energy is 8 -1.2 = 6.8 GeV. But wait, wait, maybe it's easier to use the total energy for relativistic calculations.

The total energy E is related to the momentum p and mass m via E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So, from E and m, I can find p. Once I have p, I can get the velocity from relativistic equations.

Let me write down the formula. E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². Solving for p: p = sqrt( (E^2 - (m c²)^2) ) / c². Wait, no, more accurately, p = sqrt( (E^2 - (m c²)^2) ) / c²? Wait, let me get that correct. Let me think. E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So, (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2. So
