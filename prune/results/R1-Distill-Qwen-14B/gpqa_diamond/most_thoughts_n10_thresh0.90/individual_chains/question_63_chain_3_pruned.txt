Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see. The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would switch it to the next lowest energy state. 

Wait, the fundamental state... I think that's the ground state. So, the molecule is in its lowest energy state, and when it absorbs a photon, it moves to the next state. But wait, what's the next state? Because there are different energy levels due to both rotation and vibration.

I remember that in the rigid rotor model, energy levels are quantized and depend on the rotational quantum number. But since this is a non-rigid rotor, maybe it's considering both rotation and vibration. Oh right, the non-rigid rotor (or vibration-rotation coupling) model accounts for the bond length changing during vibration, affecting the moment of inertia and thus the rotational energy.

So the molecule has two modes: rotation and vibration. When it absorbs a photon, it can change its state either by vibrating (changing vibrational quantum number) or rotating (changing rotational quantum number). The question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy." So I think that would be the next higher energy level that's the closest in energy. Maybe it's the first excited state, but I'm not sure whether it's a vibrational or rotational transition.

Wait, the fundamental state in molecular vibrations is the lowest vibrational state, which is v=0. The first excited vibrational state would be v=1. But the rotational states are quantized as well, with quantum number J. For a diatomic molecule, the energy levels are given by E_J = B * J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant.

Alternatively, the total energy of the molecule includes both rotational and vibrational contributions. In the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator model, the total energy is E = E_vib + E_rot. But in the non-rigid rotor, the bond length changes with vibration, so the moment of inertia changes, which affects the rotational energy.

But wait, for the purpose of this problem, maybe I can approximate it by considering the energy levels as a combination of rotation and vibration. So the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is v=0, J=0. The next state would be either v=1 or J=1. Which transition requires less energy?

Wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So I think they're looking for the lowest energy transition possible. So which transition has lower energy: from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, which could be either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). Which of these has lower energy?

I need to calculate the energies of these possible states and see which is smaller. Because the photon's energy must match the difference between the initial and final states. So the photon's energy (E_photon) would be E_final - E_initial.

Let me find the energies for both possibilities.

First, the initial state is E_initial = E_vib (v=0) + E_rot (J=0). But for a harmonic oscillator, the vibrational energy when v=0 is (1/2) h nu, but wait, in the rigid rotor model, E_rot for J=0 is 0. So E_initial is (1/2) h nu.

The first excited state could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. Let's compute the energy difference for both transitions.

Case 1: Transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=0)
E_final = E_vib(v=1) + E_rot(J=0)
E_vib(v=1) = (3/2) h nu (since each vibrational level is quantized as (v + 3/2) h nu, assuming harmonic oscillator)
E_rot(J=0) = 0
So E_final = (3/2) h nu.

Energy difference: E_photon = E_final - E_initial = (3/2 - 1/2) h nu = h nu.

Case 2: Transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1)
E_final = E_vib(v=0) + E_rot(J=1)
E_rot(J=1) = B * 1*(1+1) = 2B.

Energy difference: E_photon = (0 + 2B) - (1/2 h nu) = 2B - (1/2 h nu).

Wait, but in the rigid rotor model, B is given by (h^2)/(8 pi^2 I c), where I is the moment of inertia. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, B is related to the rotational constant, which is (h)/(8 pi^2 I c), but I might be mixing up some constants here.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B = (h^2)/(8 pi^2 I), with I the moment of inertia.

Wait, more accurately, the rotational energy levels are given by E_J = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2 I), where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Alternatively, some sources express it using B, where E_J = B J (J+1), and B = (h²)/(8 π² I). So yeah, B is in terms of h, I, and constants.

So for case 2, the energy difference is 2B - (1/2 h nu). But I don't know if B is larger or smaller than (1/2 h nu). Depending on that, the photon energy would be positive or negative. But photons provide energy, so the final state must have higher energy. So the E_photon should be positive.

Wait, wait. The initial state is (v=0, J=0), which has E_initial = (1/2) h nu.

In case 1, the final state energy is (3/2) h nu, so the photon energy is (3/2 - 1/2) h nu = h nu.

In case 2, the final state energy is E_rot(J=1) = 2B (since J=1, E_rot = B * 1*2 = 2B). So E_photon = 2B - (1/2 h nu).

But whether 2B is larger than 1/2 h nu determines which transition requires less energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is in a vibration-rotation state, and the next state could be a combination of both. Wait, but the problem says "the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the question is whether a vibrational transition (v=1, J=0) requires more energy than a rotational transition (v=0, J=1) or less.

So I need to calculate both possible transitions and see which has a lower energy difference.

To compute that, I need to find B and compare it to (1/2) h nu.

Let's compute B. The moment of inertia I is the reduced mass multiplied by the bond length squared. The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Given Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

So μ = (
