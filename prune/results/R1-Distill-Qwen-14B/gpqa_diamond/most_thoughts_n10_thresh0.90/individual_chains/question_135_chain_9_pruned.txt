Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the problem says the bosonic field X has a mass of 6 GeV, and the interaction Lagrangian is given. 

Wait, the Lagrangian is L = -λ f ψ̄ f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh, right, so X is interacting with fermions. The terms in the Lagrangian usually tell us what interactions are possible. So X couples to fermions, which means X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs.

Now, bosons like this usually decay into pairs of particles. So for X to decay, it needs to produce two fermions. The possible fermions would depend on their masses because the rest mass of the fermion pair must be less than the mass of X.

X's mass is 6 GeV. So I need to think about the masses of the possible fermions. Let me list the known fermion masses:

- Up quark (u): about 2.2 MeV
- Down quark (d): about 4.7 MeV
- Strange quark (s): about 95 MeV
- Charm quark (c): around 1.3 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): around 4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, like 173 GeV
- Electron (e): 0.511 MeV
- Muon (μ): around 105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): about 1.78 GeV
- Also, neutrinos are super light, but probably negligible here.

So, the fermions that X can decay into are those where each pair's combined mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let's see each option. The possible decay channels are pairs like b b̄, c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, etc., and leptons like e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-.

But since X has a mass of 6 GeV, the fermions produced must each have a mass less than 3 GeV (since two times the mass can't exceed 6 GeV). Because for each pair, 2m_fermion ≤ m_X.

Wait, wait, that's not quite right. Because the fermion pair must each have mass less than m_X, but more accurately, the sum of their rest masses should be less than m_X. But since they're a pair (like quark and antiquark), each has the same mass, so 2m_fermion ≤ m_X.

So for each fermion species, if 2m_fermion ≤ 6 GeV, then it's allowed. Let me compute 2m for each:

- b quark: m ~4.5 GeV. 2m=9 GeV, which is bigger than 6 GeV. So b b̄ is not allowed.
Wait, no, wait. Wait a second, because for fermions, the mass for each particle is m, but when they are created as a pair, the total energy required is at least 2m each. So for a pair of b quarks, 4.5 *2=9 GeV. X is only 6 GeV. So 9 >6, so it's not allowed. So X can't decay into b b̄. Wait, but looking at the options, option A includes X→b b̄, but others don't.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because sometimes, I might have to consider off-shell processes or other factors, but I think for kinematic allowance, it's purely about whether the mass is sufficient.

So let me go through each fermion:

c quark: 1.3 GeV. 2m=2.6 GeV <6 GeV → allowed.
s quark: 0.095 GeV. 2*0.095=0.19 <6 → allowed.
u quark: 0.0022 GeV. 2*0.0022≈0.0044 <6 → allowed.
d quark: 0.0047 GeV. 2*0.0047≈0.0094 <6 → allowed.
t quark: 173 GeV. 2m=346 GeV way bigger → not allowed. So t isn't an option.
b quark: 4.5 GeV. 2m=9 GeV >6 → not allowed.
So, quarks: c, s, u, d can be produced.

Leptons:
Tau: 1.78 GeV. 2m=3.56 GeV <6 → allowed.
Mu: 0.1057 GeV. 2m=0.2114 <6 → allowed.
E: 0.000511 GeV. 2m≈0.001 <6 → allowed.
But wait, in the options given, the possible lepton pairs are τ+τ−, μ+μ−, e+e−.

So putting it together, the allowed decay channels should include any of the quark pairs (c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄) and the lepton pairs (τ, μ, e).

Wait, but let me check the options.

Option A: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+τ−, e+e−.

But wait, as I just determined, b b̄ is not allowed because 2m_b >6 GeV.

So option A is not correct because it includes b decay.

Option B: c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+, μ+, e+e−. So this includes c quark, which is allowed, but wait, check the masses. So let's see, option B says X can decay into c c̄, which is 2*1.3=2.6 GeV <6. So that's allowed. Also, τ pair is allowed as 3.56 <6. Mu is allowed. e is allowed. So that includes all possible fermions except top quark, which is too heavy.

Wait, but in option B, the possible fermions are c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. All of which are allowed.

Wait, but wait, option B is written as c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+, tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−. So yes, that includes all the allowed. But let me check the options.

Looking back: the options given are:

A) X→ b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+, tau−, e+ e−

B) X→ c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+,
