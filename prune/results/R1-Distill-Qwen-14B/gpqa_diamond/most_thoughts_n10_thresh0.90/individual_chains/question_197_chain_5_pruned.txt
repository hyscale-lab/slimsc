Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying the product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, red phosphorus and HI—I remember that's used for the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes, right? So if that's the case, the starting compound must have a ketone group.

Wait, let me think. The reaction conditions are red phosphorus and HI, which is a typical Clemmensen reagent. So the starting material probably has a ketone. So the product would be an alkane where the carbonyl group was, but wait, no, wait. Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes, so a ketone R2CO would become R2CH2.

But before that, I need to figure out what Compound X is. The question provides IR and NMR data for Compound X. Let me go through the data step by step.

The IR data shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, possibly O-H stretch (like in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol). Wait, but also in the IR, there are strong peaks at 1720 and 1610 cm-1. 1720 is a strong carbonyl, maybe a ketone or aldehyde or ester. The 1610 cm-1 is around the range for aromatic C=C stretching, maybe. Then 1450 cm-1 is another aromatic ring vibration, perhaps.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR has several signals. Let me list them:

- 10.5 ppm, broad singlet (1H): That's a high chemical shift. Could be an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid proton. But wait, in the IR, we have a strong peak around 1720, which suggests a carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the -COOH proton would be around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak. But wait, the IR 1720 is a bit lower than a typical carboxylic acid carbonyl, which is usually higher, around 1700-1725. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or ketone. Wait, but if it's a ketone, the 10.5 ppm wouldn't be there because ketones don't have protons attached. Oh wait, maybe it's an aromatic aldehyde, like a benzaldehyde group, where the aldehyde proton is around 9-10 ppm, but that's usually a triplet due to coupling with adjacent protons. Wait, but in the NMR, it's a broad singlet. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the 10.5 could be a phenolic OH, but phenolic OHs are usually broader, but maybe in a more complex environment.

Wait, but looking at the other peaks. 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a pair of doublets, each integrating to 2H. This is a common pattern for
