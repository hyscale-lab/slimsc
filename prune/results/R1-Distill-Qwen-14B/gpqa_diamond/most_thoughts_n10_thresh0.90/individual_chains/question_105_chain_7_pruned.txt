Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a star with some dark spots on one hemisphere and how that affects the observed brightness. They're comparing it to a scenario where an exoplanet would cause similar variations in brightness. The goal is to find out the radius of such an exoplanet relative to the star.

Hmm, alright. Let's break down the information given. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, right? So Rstar is about 1 R_sun. The effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. Filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered, so 20% of one hemisphere is spotted. Wait, no, actually, the problem says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So the entire hemisphere is 50% of the star's surface, but 20% of that is spotted. Or maybe the filling factor is 20% of the total surface? Wait, I think the filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. Oh, but the problem says one hemisphere is covered, so maybe the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. Wait, no, the way it's phrased: "One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the total area covered is 20% of that hemisphere.

Wait, but a hemisphere is half the star's surface. So if the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, then the area of the spots is 0.2 * (π R²) * 0.5, since the hemisphere's area is half the total surface area. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me think about this.

The star's surface area is 4π R². So a hemisphere is 2π R². The filling factor is 20% of that, so the spotted area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Each spot is cooler. The spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K. So the spot temperature is Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K. Wait, or is it the other way around? The question says "temperature difference of 1000K." So I think it means the spots are 1000 K cooler. So T_spot = 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K.

Now, when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view from our perspective. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the brightness dip is due to the lower temperature spots blocking the hotter regions. But how does this compare to an exoplanet transit, which blocks some of the star's light?

The problem says that the photometric variations will resemble an exoplanet. So we need to find the exoplanet's radius such that it produces the same amplitude in the
