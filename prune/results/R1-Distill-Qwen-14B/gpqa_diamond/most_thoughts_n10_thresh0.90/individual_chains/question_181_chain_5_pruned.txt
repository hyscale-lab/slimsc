Okay, so I have this neutrino flux question about the Sun. Hmm, let's think. The question is about the ratio of flux between two energy bands after the pp-III branch stops. Oh wait, what's the pp-III branch? I remember that the proton-proton chain is the main source of the Sun's energy. There are different branches.

Right, the pp-I branch is the simplest: two protons fusing into deuterium, then another proton to form helium-3, and so on. Then there's the pp-II branch, which involves more steps, like capturing an electron neutrino. Wait, but the question is about the pp-III branch. I think pp-III is another branch where maybe more protons are involved, leading to higher energy neutrinos or something like that.

Wait, neutrinos are produced in the Sun primarily via the pp chain, particularly the pp-I and pp-II branches, but also other processes. The pp-III branch probably produces higher-energy neutrinos. So if the pp-III branch stops suddenly, what happens to the neutrino flux?

The question says that all other reactions remain as they were. So other branches like pp-I and pp-II are still operating. Now, neutrinos come from different processes. The main ones I remember are the electron neutrinos from the proton-proton chains, and the higher-energy ones from the CNO cycle, but wait, no, CNO also produces neutrinos, but maybe through different reactions.

Wait, but the Sun's main neutrino production is from the proton-proton chains. The pp-I branch produces 8 keV neutrinos, I think. The pp-II branch produces higher energy, maybe around 40 keV or so. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Or am I mixing the numbers up? Let me think again.

In the pp-I branch, the initial steps produce a positron and two neutrinos (like in the first step: p + p → 2H + e+ + ν_e). Wait, no, the first step is two protons fusing into deuterium, which is a weak reaction involving a positron and a neutrino. Then, the deuterium captures another proton to form helium-3, which emits another neutrino. So each of these steps produces neutrinos.

But the pp-II branch, I think, involves a different path. Like, when a beryllium-7 captures a proton to form boron-8, which then decays into two alpha particles, each emitting two neutrinos. So each decay produces two 15-20 keV neutrinos, maybe? Or is that from the CNO cycle? Wait, no, the CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos, like around 600 keV or something. Because in the CNO cycle, carbon fuses with protons in a series of steps, and one of them is the production of nitrogen-14, which then captures a proton to form carbon-15, which beta decays into nitrogen-14 and emits a neutrino. So that neutrino has higher energy, like about 0.6 MeV (600 keV).

Wait, but the question is about the pp-III branch. I'm not entirely sure about the details of the pp-III branch. Maybe it's a branch that produces higher-energy neutrinos than the others. So if the pp-III branch stops, we lose a certain part of the neutrino flux.

So the flux is the number of neutrinos per cm² per second. The question is about the ratio of two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So both are in the high-energy range, around 0.7-0.9 MeV.

Wait, if the pp-III branch is stopped, and it was contributing to the neutrinos in these high-energy bands, then the flux in those bands would decrease. But which band is more affected?

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is responsible for a specific range of neutrino energies. Let me think: in the Sun's core, the main neutrino production is from the pp-I and pp-II branches, which produce lower-energy neutrinos. The CNO cycle contributes higher-energy neutrinos. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing up the processes. Another possibility is that the pp-III branch is one of the steps in the main proton-proton chain that emits neutrinos in a certain energy range.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch emits neutrinos with energies around 700-800 keV, so stopping it would drop the flux in that band. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, when the pp-III branch stops, which neutrino energies are affected? Let's think about what neutrinos are produced where. The main sources are:

1. The proton-proton chain (pp-I and pp-II branches) produces lower-energy neutrinos, typically around 10s to a few hundred keV.

2. The CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos, around 0.6-10 MeV.

But the question is about the pp-III branch, which I'm less familiar with. Let me try to recall. Oh, maybe the pp-III branch is a part of the main pp chain where a different fusion path occurs that produces higher-energy neutrinos. Or perhaps it's a different type of reaction in the core.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch involves a triple-alpha reaction or something else, but that's more relevant to the later stages of stellar evolution, maybe in red giants. I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III branch is a specific step where three protons fuse in a different way, leading to higher-energy neutrinos. If that's the case, then stopping it would reduce the flux in that higher-energy band.

Suppose the pp-III branch neutrinos are in the 700-800 keV range. Then, if it stops, the flux in band1 (700-800) would drop significantly, but band2 (800-900) might be from another process, perhaps the CNO cycle, which remains unaffected. So, the flux in band1 would decrease, but band2 is still coming from other sources.

Wait, but CNO cycle neutrinos are usually higher, around 600 keV, so perhaps the 800-900 keV band is within the CNO range. So if the pp-III process produces neutrinos in 700-800 keV, then stopping it would mean that band1's flux drops a lot, but band2 (CNO) remains the same. So the ratio flux1/flux2 would drop to zero? But that's not one of the options. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the bands wrong.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the pp-III branch contributes to the 800-900 keV band, and the 700-800 is from another source. Let me think. If the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in 800-900 keV, then stopping it would reduce that band's flux. But the 700-800 band is from another process, perhaps the CNO cycle which isn't affected. So the flux in band2 (800-900) would drop, while band1 (700-800) remains the same. So the ratio would be (flux1)/(flux2) would be (same)/(reduced), which would be higher than 1. But the options include 10, 0.01, 1, 0.1.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the energy ranges. Alternatively, perhaps both bands are affected by the pp-III branch. Maybe the pp-III contributes neutrinos in both bands, but more in one than the other. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are in the 800-900 keV range. So if that's the case, then band2 would have all its flux from pp-III, which is now stopped. So band2's flux would drop, while band1's flux (from other sources) remains the same.

Wait, but what's the typical energy of neutrinos from the pp-III branch? I'm not
