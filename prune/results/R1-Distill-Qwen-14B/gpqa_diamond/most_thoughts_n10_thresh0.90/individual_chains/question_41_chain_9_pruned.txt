Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, wait. So the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is moving in the same direction as the beam. Oh, and the beam is going through the glass. So the glass is moving towards me, and the light is moving through itâ€”same direction. Interesting.

I remember that when a medium is moving relative to an observer, the speed of light in that medium as measured by the observer depends on both the refractive index and the motion of the medium. But I'm not exactly sure how they combine.

In a stationary medium, the speed of light is c/n. But if the medium is moving, how does that affect it? Oh right, this probably involves the addition of velocities, but not in the classical way because we're dealing with light, which is tricky due to relativity. Wait, but since the speeds involved are probably much less than c, maybe we can use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, the problem says to take the speed of light in a vacuum as c=1. So perhaps we need to apply the relativistic velocity addition here. Because the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame, and we have to find the speed of the light in the glass as observed in the lab.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The speed of light in the glass when the glass is moving. So the glass is moving with velocity v, and the light is moving through the glass. So what's the relation between the two?

In the frame of the glass (the rest frame), the speed of light is c/n. But in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass, we have to calculate how the light's speed appears.

Wait, but the direction matters. The glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is towards the observer. So the direction of the light is in the same direction as the motion of the glass.

But wait, in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light is moving through the glass, so
