Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH, producing a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to give product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm. Let's break this down.

First, what's happening in each step. Let's start with the first reaction: heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Dibromoadamantane... I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3. KOH is a strong base, so I think this is an elimination reaction. When vicinal dihalides (two halides on adjacent carbons) react with strong bases, they undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. But wait, wait. 1,3-dibromoadamantane: are the bromines on adjacent carbons? Adamantane is a diamondoid, so the structure is such that 1 and 3 are not adjacent. So the dihalide isn't vicinal. That's a key point.

Wait, so if the dihalide isn't vicinal, then elimination to form an alkene isn't possible. Or perhaps I'm wrong. Alternatively, maybe KOH is causing a different reaction. Oh wait, maybe it's a substitution. But KOH is a base, not a nucleophile in substitution reactions unless under specific conditions.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the reaction is more like a double dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that elimination can still occur, but not to form a double bond. Wait, maybe it's a ring-opening. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a reaction where the dibromide is cleaved, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has four six-membered rings, and the structure is quite rigid. The positions 1 and 3 are on opposite faces or something. So, if we have two bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3, which are probably not adjacent, then perhaps the KOH isn't causing elimination but something else.

Wait, another approach: looking at the product's properties. The product 1 has an IR characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm-¹. That sounds like a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, product 1 is probably an ketone. How to form a ketone from a dibromide.

Ah, in a dehydrohalogenation, but wait, with two bromides, perhaps it's a double elimination. Wait, if 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with strong base, perhaps each Br leaves, and the adjacent carbons form a double bond. But wait, in that case, would elimination be possible if the Brs are on non-adjacent carbons?

Alternatively, maybe each Br is on a bridgehead carbon, and elimination could form a bridgehead double bond. Hmm, bridgehead double bonds aren't typical because of Bredt's rule, which says that bridgehead double bonds are not generally allowed due to ring strain and poor orbital overlap. But adamantane's structure allows for some exceptions because of its rigid, diamondoid structure. Maybe in this case, the elimination leads to a bridgehead double bond.

Wait, but if that's the case, the product would be an alkene, not a ketone. So then why is there a carbonyl? Oh, maybe the reaction is different. Perhaps the dibromide under strong base conditions undergoes a different kind of elimination. Alternatively, perhaps
