Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, let me think. I remember that a pseudosphere is like a hyperbolic surface, right? But wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact definition.

The metric given is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Oh wait, that's in terms of x and y. So this must be a 2-dimensional metric, maybe representing the surface of the pseudosphere. 

I think the area element in such a metric would be the determinant of the matrix of the metric tensor. For a metric like this, which is diagonal, the determinant should be g = g_xx * g_yy - g_xy². Since g_xy is zero here, g would just be g_xx * g_yy. 

Looking at the metric, the coefficients for dx² and dy² are both 32/(4 - x² - y²). So g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant would be (32/(4 - x² - y²))². 

Wait, but the area element dA is the square root of the determinant times dx dy. But since it's diagonal and no cross terms, sqrt(g) would be (32/(4 - x² - y²)). So dA = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

Now, I need to figure out the limits of integration to find the total area. The denominator (4 - x² - y²) must be positive because otherwise the metric would be imaginary, which doesn't make sense. So 4 - x² - y² > 0. That means x² + y² < 4. So the region is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane.

Wait, but wait. The metric's denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So as x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, making the area element blow up. That suggests that the region might have a finite area up to that point, but perhaps integrating across the entire disk would give a finite or infinite area?

Let me set up the integral in polar coordinates, because the region is a circle. So x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, dx dy becomes r dr dθ. The area A is the integral over θ from 0 to 2π, and r from 0 to 2 (since x² + y² = r² < 4 implies r <2). 

So the area A is the integral from 0 to 2π of the integral from 0 to 2 of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute this. First, the integral over θ is straightforward: it's 2π. So A = 2π * ∫[0 to 2] [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me make a substitution to solve the radial integral. Let u = 4 - r², then du/dr = -2r. So - (du/2) = r dr. Hmm, wait, when r=0, u=4, and when r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫[r=0 to 2] [32 r dr/(4 - r²)] = 32 ∫[u=4 to 0] [r dr / u] 

Wait, using u =4 - r², then r dr = -(du)/2.

So substituting, r dr = - du/2. So the integral becomes 32 * ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [ ( - du/2 ) / u ]

Which is 32 * ( -1/2 ) ∫ (from 4 to 0) (1/u) du.

Wait, flipping the limits gets rid of the negative sign, so it becomes 32 * (1/2) ∫ (from 0 to4) (1/u) du.

So that's 16 ∫ (0 to4) (1/u) du.

But wait, the integral of 1/u from 0 to 4 is ln(u) from 0 to 4, which is ln(4) - ln(0). But ln(0) is negative infinity, so ln(4) - (-infty) is positive infinity. Oh wait, but that's a problem. Because that would mean the integral diverges, so the area is infinite.

But wait, wait. Let me check the substitution again. Let me do it step by step.

The integral is ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32 * (r dr) / u ] = 32 ∫ [ (-du/2) / u ] from u=4 to u=0.

So changing the limits, we can write this as 32 * (1/2) ∫ (from u=0 to u=4) (1/u) du.

Which is 16 ∫ (0 to4) (1/u) du.

But ∫ (0 to a) (1/u) du is ln(a) - ln(0). But ln(0) is negative infinity, so this integral is divergent. So the area would be infinite.

Wait, but that's not possible because the pseudosphere should have a finite area. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, another way: maybe the area is finite because the metric is singular at r=2, but the actual surface doesn't include that point. So perhaps the area up to r approaching 2 from below would be finite. Let me see.

Wait, let me compute the integral again. The integral ∫ [32 r/(4 - r^2)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me compute without substitution: let me set w =4 - r². Then dw = -2r dr → r dr = -dw/2.

But let me use substitution differently. Let me write it as ∫ [32 r dr ] / (4 - r^2) 

Let me set u = 4 - r² → du = -2 r dr → r dr = - du/2.

So the integral becomes 32 * ∫ [ (r dr) / u ] = 32 * ∫ [ (-du/2) / u ] 

The limits when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

The integral becomes 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) (1/u) du.

Which is 32 * (-1/2) [ ln(u) from 4 to 0 ] 

Which is 32 * (-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] 

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so ln(0) - ln(4) is -infty. So the integral becomes 32*(-1/2)*(-infty) = 32*(1/2)*infty = 16 * infty, which is infty.

But this suggests that the area is infinite, which is option D.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because a pseudosphere is a finite surface. Or is it? Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think about the metric again.

Wait, the metric is ds² = 32/(4 -x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So this is a 2-dimensional metric, perhaps describing the surface of a pseudosphere. But wait, the pseudosphere is a surface in 3D space, but perhaps this is a conformally flat metric in 2D. 

Alternatively, maybe the pseudosphere (which is a tractricoid) has finite area. So why is the integration giving me an infinite area?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area element. Let me re-examine. The area element in 2D is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant. Since the metric is diagonal, g= (32/(4 -x² -y²))². So sqrt(g) would be 32/(4 -x² -y²). So dA is [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ.

But the integral ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32/(4 -r²)] r dr. Let me compute this integral again. 

Wait, I can rewrite 32/(4 - r²) as 32/( (2 - r)(2 + r) ). Let me try partial fractions. Let me set 32/(4 - r²) = A/(2 - r) + B/(2 + r). 

32 = A(2 + r) + B(2 - r). 

Let me set r =2: 32 = A(4) + B(0) → A=8.

Set r =-2: 32 = A(0) + B(4) → B=8.

So 32/(4 - r²) = 8/(2 - r) +8/(2 + r).

So the integral becomes ∫ [8/(2 - r) + 8/(2 + r)] * r dr.

Hmm, but perhaps that's not the easiest way. Alternatively, let me think of u =4 - r², du = -2r dr.

Wait, let me try substitution again. Let u=4 - r² → du = -2r dr → -du/2 = r dr.

So ∫ [32/(4 - r²)] r dr = ∫ [32/(u)] (-du/2) 

= -16 ∫ (1/u) du 

= -16 ln|u| + C 

= -16 ln(4 - r²) + C.

Evaluate from r=0 to r=2.

At r=2: ln(4 -4)=ln(0) → -∞.

At r=0: ln(4) → finite.

So the definite integral is [ -16 ln(0) ] - [ -16 ln(4) ] → which is ( -16*(-infty) ) - (-16 * ln4) → that's +infty + something finite. So the integral diverges to infinity.

But that's strange because a pseudosphere is a finite object. Hmm, maybe I'm using the wrong limits. Alternatively, perhaps the metric is defined up to r=2, but does not include r=2. So the integral is from 0 to less than 2.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. So the surface extends up to r=2, but at that point, the metric becomes singular. So if the surface includes that point, the area would be infinite.

Alternatively, perhaps the pseudosphere's area is finite because the integration doesn't reach beyond a certain point. But according to the metric, it's allowed up to r=2, so the integral must include that.

Wait, but maybe I'm confusing the metric with something else. Another approach: for a pseudosphere, which is a tractricoid, I think the area is finite. The tractrix has finite area. Wait, the pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. The area of a pseudosphere of curvature K is 4π/(|K|). Hmm, but that might not directly apply here.

Alternatively, the Gaussian curvature K is related to the metric. For a metric ds² = λ(dx² + dy²), the curvature is proportional to the Laplacian of ln λ. Let me see: For a conformal metric, the Gaussian curvature is (1/λ) * [ (1/(2)) Δ(ln λ) ].

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again about the metric. The metric given is ds² = (32/(4 -x² -y²)) (dx² + dy²) → so λ = 32/(4 - r²), where r² =x² + y².

The area element is (32/(4 - r²)) r dr dθ. So the area is the integral from r=0 to 2 of [32/(4 - r²)] r dr * ∫ θ from 0 to 2π dθ.

So ∫θ gives 2π. The radial integral is ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr. As before, substitution gives us that this integral diverges, leading to an infinite area.

But that can't be right because a pseudosphere has finite area. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Alternative thought: perhaps the given metric is not of a pseudosphere but something else. Or perhaps the question is tricking me, and the area is actually infinite.

Wait, the options include D) +infty. So if the area is infinite, then the answer would be D.

Alternatively, perhaps the pseudosphere is of radius 2, but the area calculation is finite. Wait, no, according to the integration, the area is infinite because the integral from 0 to 2 of [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr is divergent.

So the area would be infinite, which is option D.


The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left( dx^2 + dy^2 \right),
\]

which describes a 2-dimensional surface. To find the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we compute the area element \( dA \), which is derived from the determinant of the metric tensor. For a diagonal metric, the determinant is \( g = g_{xx} g_{yy} \), and since \( g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \), the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \sqrt{g} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \)), the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral over \( \theta \) is straightforward:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

The radial integral is:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 32 \int_4^0 \frac{-du/2}{u} = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du \) diverges because \( \ln(u) \) approaches \( -\infty \) as \( u \to 0 \). This indicates that the area is infinite. 

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere described by the given metric is infinite.
