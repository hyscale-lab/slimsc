Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me read the question carefully.

The problem says we need to calculate the eigenvector of the operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, P_z, each given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, so the operator P is a vector operator, and we're looking for its eigenvector when it's measured along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Since n is in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero. So the direction is defined by an angle θ with the z-axis, but the direction vector has components (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that? Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of spherical coordinates. Oh right, in the x-z plane, the angle would be from the z-axis, so the direction vector would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). But wait, actually, sometimes people define the polar angle from the z-axis, so yeah, θ is the angle from z, and phi is the azimuthal, but here phi is zero since it's in x-z plane.

But wait, the operator is along n, which is in the x-z plane. So the operator P would be P · n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. Since n is in x-z, n_y is zero. So the operator becomes P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

The eigenvalue equation is (P) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Now, each component of P is given:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]

P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]

P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, since n_x = sinθ (assuming θ is the angle from z), n_z = cosθ, and n_y=0.

So the operator P is (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z), where σ_x and σ_z are the Pauli matrices.

Wait, Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So yes, each component is scaled by ħ/2.

So P = (ħ/2)( sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z )

The eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

So (sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z) |ψ> = |ψ>

Hmm, wait, because when we factor out (ħ/2), the equation becomes (ħ/2)(...) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, so the (ħ/2) cancels out, leaving (sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z) |ψ> = |ψ>.

Wait, but wait, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so the equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, which is correct.

So, yes, the matrix equation is:

[ ( sinθ * σ_x + cosθ * σ_z ) ] |ψ> = |ψ>

So, the eigenvalue is 1 because when you factor out the matrix, it's (matrix - I) |ψ> = 0.

Wait, actually, let's think of it as (matrix) |ψ> = (1) |ψ>, so the matrix must be (matrix) = I for |ψ> to be an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1. But wait, that can't be right because the matrix is sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z, which is a combination of Pauli matrices. So it's not the identity matrix unless all coefficients are zero, which is not the case here.

Wait, I think I made a mistake. The Pauli matrices are 2x2. The matrix (sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z) is a 2x2 matrix. The eigenvalue equation is:

[ (sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z) ] |ψ> = λ |ψ>

But we know that the eigenvalues of any Pauli matrix are ±1. When combining them, the eigenvalues would be ± sqrt( (sinθ)^2 + (cosθ)^2 ) ) = ±1. Because the Pauli matrices are Hermitian and their squares are identity, so any linear combination with real coefficients would have eigenvalues squared as (a^2 + b^2 + c^2), which in our case, it's 1 because sin²θ + cos²θ =1. So the eigenvalues are ±1.

Wait, but the problem states that the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Wait, no, looking back, the operator P has components scaled by ħ/2. So P is (ħ/2)( sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z ), so the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. So the factor is (ħ/2), and the eigenvalue is (ħ/2). So the equation is:

(ħ/2)( sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z ) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Divide both sides by (ħ/2), we get:

( sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z ) |ψ> = |ψ>

So the matrix equation is [ sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z ] |ψ> = I |ψ>

Which can be written as [ sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z - I ] |ψ> = 0

To find the eigenvectors, we need to find the nullspace of [ sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z - I ].

So let's write the matrix:

sinθ σ_x = sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]]

cosθ σ_z = cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

I is [[1,0],[0,1]]

So adding them:

[ [ cosθ *1 + 0 , sinθ *1 + 0 ],
  [ sinθ *1 + 0, -cosθ *1 + 0 ] ]

Wait, no, let me compute each element.

Wait, sinθ σ_x is [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]

cosθ σ_z is [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]

So adding them:

The (1,1) element is cosθ.

The (1,2) element is sinθ.

The (2,1) element is sinθ.

The (2,2) element is -cosθ.

So the matrix is:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, and then subtract I:

So subtract [[1,0],[0,1]] from this.

So the matrix becomes:

[ [ cosθ -1, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ]

So we have the equation [ [ cosθ-1, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ-1 ] ] |ψ
