Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about stars and their parallax. Hmm, let me think. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, and it's asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different exponents.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax plx is the reciprocal of distance. So plx = 1/distance. But wait, I think it's in some specific units. Oh yeah, parsecs. So the distance in parsecs is 1/plx. Got it.

Now, the problem states uniform distribution. So the number of stars doesn't depend on direction, just on distance. So stars are spread out uniformly in all directions, but how does that affect their distribution in terms of parallax?

I remember that the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a spherical shell of radius r and thickness dr would be proportional to the volume of that shell. The volume of the shell is 4πr² dr because it's the surface area (4πr²) times the thickness dr.

But how does this relate to parallax? Since distance r is 1/plx, let me make a substitution. So r = 1/plx. Let me think, dr would be the change in r with respect to plx. Hmm, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, because if plx is small, distance is large. So when plx increases, distance decreases. Let me see: if plx is p, then r = 1/p. So dr = -1/p² d(p). So dr is proportional to -1/(plx)^2 times d(plx).

Wait, but when we're considering a range of plx, say from p to p + dp, the corresponding distance r goes from 1/p to 1/(p + dp). Hmm, maybe I should express everything in terms of plx.

The number of stars in a shell at distance r is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is 4πr² dr. So substituting r = 1/plx, that becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 dr.

But dr is in terms of r, and we need to express everything in terms of plx. So dr = (dr/dp) dp, where p is plx. Let me compute dr/dp. Since p = 1/r, so r = 1/p. Therefore, dr/dp = -1/p². So, dr = -1/p² dp. Wait, but the negative sign just indicates that as p increases, r decreases. But when considering a small range dp, the absolute value is what matters, so we can take the magnitude.

Putting it all together, the number of stars per unit range dp is proportional to (4π (1/p)^2) * (1/p²) dp). Because dr is (1/p²) dp in absolute terms.

Wait, let me recheck. The volume element in terms of p is 4π (r^2) dr. But r = 1/p, dr = - (1/p²) dp.
