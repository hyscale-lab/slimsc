Okay, let's see. I need to solve this astronomy problem. So, the question is about a star with some dark spots and how it affects the observed brightness. Then, we're supposed to find the radius of an exoplanet that would cause the same brightness variation if there were no spots.

Hmm. So the star's radius is the same as the Sun, right? So R_star = R_sun. The star has dark spots covering one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%. The effective temperature of the star is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K, so 5000K. 

The problem states that these spots cause periodic brightness variations because the star rotates, modulating the spots' visibility. This situation can look like an exoplanet transit. The question is, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spots do.

Wait, so without spots, the exoplanet transit would cause a dip in brightness. But with spots, the dip is due to the spots blocking the brighter parts of the star. So I need to calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same dip.

Let me think about the brightness variation due to spots. The star's total brightness is the sum of the unspotted and spotted regions. When the spots rotate into view, the observed brightness dips because the spots are darker.

The star's total flux (without spots) is F_total = sigma * Teff^4 * surface area. The spots have a lower temperature, so each spot contributes F_spot = sigma * (Teff - delta T)^4. The filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. Oh wait, the filling factor is 20% (0.2), but only on one hemisphere.

Wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered, so the total area covered is 0.2 * (area of one hemisphere). Or wait, does the filling factor already account for the entire surface? Hmm. Let me check. The filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. Oh, wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered, but with a filling factor of 20% on that hemisphere. Hmm, no, the way it's phrased: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the entire hemisphere isn't covered; 20% of that hemisphere is spots.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the total area covered by spots as 20% of one hemisphere. So, the star's surface is a sphere, so the area is 4π R². One hemisphere is 2π R². So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². Alternatively, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, but only on one hemisphere. Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. But the problem says the star's one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%—so perhaps the area of spots is 20% of that hemisphere's area. So, the spots cover 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4 π R². So the total area covered is 0.4 π R².

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire surface. But the problem says "only one hemisphere is spotty," so perhaps the spots are 20% of one hemisphere, which is 10% of the total surface. Hmm, I think that's more likely. Because if a hemisphere is 50% of the surface, and the filling factor is 20% on that, that would be 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1, so 10% of the entire surface.

Wait, no. Let's clarify. The filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. If it's 20% on one hemisphere, then the total area covered is 0.2 * (hemisphere area). Hemisphere area is 2π R². So 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². So the spots are 0.4 π R² area. The total surface area of the star is 4 π R², so the fraction covered is (0.4 π R²)/(4 π R²) )= 0.1, which is 10% of the star's surface.

So the spots cover 10% of the star's surface.

Now, the brightness variation when the star rotates. The maximum dip occurs when the spots are on the side facing us. But wait, when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view. So the observed flux will dip as spots rotate into the visible hemisphere. But since the star is rotating, the brightness variation is due to spots moving in and out of view.

Wait, but the problem states that the situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So perhaps the variation is similar to when a planet transits the star, blocking some of the light.

So, to compute the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots, I can compute the difference in flux when the spots are on the day side versus when they're on the night side.

Wait, no. Let me think. The star's total flux is the sum of all the surface areas' emission. When a spot is on the hemisphere we can see, it contributes less flux than the surrounding. So the observed flux depends on the fraction of the star's surface that is spotted and the temperature difference.

But the star is a sphere, and as it rotates, the spots come into and out of view. So the maximum dip in brightness occurs when the spot is fully visible. But since the spots are on a hemisphere, the maximum dip would be when the entire spot area contributes to the dip.

Wait, but the star's rotation period determines the modulation. But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, we can model the maximum dip as a fraction of the star's total flux.

Alternatively, perhaps the brightness variation is the difference between the star's normal flux and the flux when parts of the star (with lower temperature) are visible.

Wait, the star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots are 5000 K. So each spot emits less flux.

The flux from a unit area at temperature T is sigma * T^4, where sigma is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So, the total flux from the unspotted star is F0 = sigma * Teff^4 * 4 pi R^2.

But when spots are present, the flux is F = F0 - (F_spot - F_unspotted_area).

Wait, no. Let me think. The star's total flux without any spots is F0 = sigma * Teff^4 * (4 pi R^2). When there are spots covering area A, with temperature T_spot, the total flux becomes F = sigma * (Teff^4 * (4 pi R^2 - A) + T_spot^4 * A).

So the change in flux (delta F) is F - F0 = sigma * [ (Teff^4 (4 pi R^2 - A) + T_spot^4 A ) - Teff^4 (4 pi R^2) ) ].

Simplifying, delta F = sigma * [ Teff^4 (4 pi R^2 - A) + T_spot^4 A - Teff^4 4 pi R^2 ]

= sigma * [ -Teff^4 A + T_spot^4 A ]

= sigma * A (T_spot^4 - Teff^4 )

Wait, but since T_spot is less than Teff, this delta F is negative, so F < F0. So the observed flux is lower.

But the amplitude of the variation would depend on how much the flux changes as the spots rotate into view.

Wait, but in reality, the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the spot hemisphere is facing us, the spots are in view, causing a dip. When the other hemisphere (non-spotty) is facing us, no spots are visible.

So the maximum change in flux occurs when the spot hemisphere is completely visible. So the change would be the maximum dip.

Wait, but the star's rotation would make the spots rotate into and out of view. So the maximum dip is when the entire spot area is visible. But perhaps the variation is periodic as the spots come into view.

So, perhaps the dip is the difference between the spot hemisphere's flux and the non-spotted hemisphere's flux.

Wait, the star's entire surface is 4 pi R^2. The spotted hemisphere has area 2 pi R^2, with 20% of that covered by spots. So the spots area is 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2, as I thought earlier.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem states that one hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the area of spots is 0
