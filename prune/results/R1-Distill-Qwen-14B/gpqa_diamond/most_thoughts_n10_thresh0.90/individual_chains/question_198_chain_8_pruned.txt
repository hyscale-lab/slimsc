Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I've got to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem states that the solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, wait, stability constants usually increase with the order of the complex, right? So β1 is for the first complex, maybe [Co(SCN)]^+ , β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}. I think that's the order.

The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ions attached, so that's [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is the second complex, with β2=40. Wait, but wait, the blue one—does that refer to a specific complex? Oh, right, usually [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} is blue. Wait, no, wait. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact colors. Let me think: I remember that [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is blue, while the others might be different colors. So if the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, that's two SCN. But wait, dithiocyanato would be two SCN-? Or wait, the dithiocyanate ion is SCN-S-CN, but no, in this case, the question is about the Co complex with two SCN- ions, so [Co(SCN)_2]^0. But I'm a bit confused because the blue complex is the tetrathiocyanato one. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the question says "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes". Hmm, but I think the blue color is associated with [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}, which is the tetrathiocyanato complex. So wait, does that mean that the question is referring to the [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} complex as the blue one? Because the prefix 'di' would suggest two, but maybe in this context, they're referring to the tetra as blue. Hmm, maybe I should double-check the problem statement.

Wait, the question says "blue dithiocyanato". Wait, dithiocyanato is two SCN- ions. Oh wait, no, dithiocyanate would be S2N2, like (SCN)2^2-? Or wait, no, in the context of Co complexes, each SCN- is a ligand. So the dithiocyanato complex would have two SCN- as ligands. Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the color. Let's see: [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} is blue, [Co(SCN)_3]^- is perhaps pink, and [Co(SCN)_2]^+ is green or something else. So if the question is about the blue complex, that's the tetra, which is β4=16. Wait, but wait, the stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Hmm, that's interesting because β3 is higher than β2, but β4 is lower than β3. So the complexes are ordered with β3 being the highest.

Wait, perhaps I got the order wrong. Stability constants usually get larger with higher order complexes, but in this case, β3 is 63, which is higher than β2=40 and β4=16. So the third complex is the most stable. So the complexes are:

Co²+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+ (β1=9)

Co²+ + 2 SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (β2=40)

Co²+ + 3 SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_3]^- (β3=63)

Co²+ + 4 SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} (β4=16)

Wait, that's a bit confusing because the β4 is lower than β3, which is higher than β2, which is higher than β1. So the third complex is the most stable.

But the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. Wait, maybe I should clarify the colors. From what I remember, [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is blue, which is the tetrathiocyanato complex. So that's the fourth complex, β4=
