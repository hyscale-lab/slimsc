Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because titrations can be a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when you dilute a weak acid, the pH changes because the concentration decreases, which affects how much it dissociates. Also, when titrating a weak acid with a strong base like NaOH, the equivalence point is when moles of base equal moles of acid. But since it's a weak acid, the equivalence point pH will be basic because the conjugate base will hydrolyze.

First, let's tackle the initial dilution. The initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the new concentration of acetic acid (CH3COOH) will be halved because the volume doubles. So 0.05 M / 2 = 0.025 M. Oh wait, no, because when you mix volumes, the concentration is (initial volume × initial concentration) / total volume. So (20 * 0.05) / 40 = 1 / 40 = 0.025 M. Yeah, that's right.

So after dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The first part is the pH at 25% titration. Wait, what does 25% titration mean? I think it refers to the percentage of the acid that has been neutralized by the base. So, 25% of the moles of acetic acid have been reacted with NaOH.

Alternatively, it could be the volume of NaOH added is 25% of the volume needed to reach the equivalence point. Hmm, I think it's the former: 25% of the acid has been titrated. Let me think. So, if I have V volume of the diluted solution, then 25% of that volume is not the way to go, but 25% of the moles being neutralized.

Wait, maybe not. Another approach: when a certain volume of NaOH is added, say V, which is 25% of the equivalence volume, then the moles of NaOH added are 25% of the moles of acetic acid.

Wait, the equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH = moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. So let's calculate the moles first.

Moles of acetic acid after dilution: M = 0.025 M, volume = 0.04 L (since 40 cm
