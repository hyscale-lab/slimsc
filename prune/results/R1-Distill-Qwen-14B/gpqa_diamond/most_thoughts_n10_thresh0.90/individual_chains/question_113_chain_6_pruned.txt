Okay, so I have this problem where I need to identify an unknown compound based on its spectral data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all involving C6H with varying O and H counts. Let me break down the information step by step.

First, the FTIR data. A very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 probably indicates O-H stretching, like in an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a broad peak too, but it's usually around 2500-3300. Hmm, but the peak is very broad. Could it be an alcohol or maybe a ketone? No, wait, ketones don't have OH groups. So, maybe it's an alcohol because the broad peak is typical for OH. 

Then, there are strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak which suggests a carbonyl group. But what kind? Could it be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carbonyl in a conjugated system? The 1650 peak is a bit lower than 1700. Wait, conjugated carbonyls might show lower wavenumbers because of conjugation. For example, an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl (like an enone) has the carbonyl peak around 1680-1700. So maybe there's a conjugated carbonyl group here. Alternatively, maybe an ester or a ketone with some conjugation.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like CH2=CH groups. So the compound must have a double bond, probably a vinyl group. So maybe an allylic system or something with a double bond adjacent to a carbonyl.

Then the Mass Spec shows a fragment at m/z 45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Let me think. The molecular ion would break into fragments. What breaks to give 45? Well, 45 is CH3COOH (which is 60, but wait, no, that's too high. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of CH3COO- (59? No, wait, 12*2 +1*4 +16*2= 24+4+32=60. Hmm. Wait, maybe another approach. 45 is also the molecular weight of CH3CHO (acetaldehyde is 44; wait, 12+2+12+16+1=44, so that's not it. Alternatively, maybe a fragment like C3H7O? Let me compute: 3 carbons would be 36 (3*12), plus 7 H is 7, O is 16. 36+7+16=59, no. Wait, 45: perhaps it's the molecular ion of a smaller compound. Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be C2H5O, which is 45 (24 +10 +16=50. No, that's 24+10 is 34, plus 16 is 50. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe 45 is a ketene ion or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's 91. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's the acylium ion, which for acetic acid would be 60, so that doesn't fit. Wait, perhaps the molecular formula can help. Let's see the options.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2: molecular weight is (12*6)+(12)+(16*2)=72+12+32=116.

B) C6H10O: (72)+(10)+(16)=98.

C) C6H10O2: 72+10+32=114.

D) C6H12O: 72+12+16=100.

So the molecular ion would be at 116, 98, 114, or 100. But the fragment is at 45. So perhaps the compound breaks into a smaller ion. Let me think about possible fragmentations.

Wait, 45 is (CH3)2CO+? No, that's 58. Wait, 45 could be (CH2)2O+, but that's 44. Hmm. Maybe it's a ketene fragment.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbonyl group with some substituents. Or maybe the 45 is a water molecule (18) plus something else. Not sure. Wait, another approach: if the compound has an ester group, then perhaps during fragmentation, it loses the ester group or something. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ester, which tends to lose the R-O group.

Wait, another thought: 45 is the molecular weight of CH3CH2COOH (but that's 60, no), or perhaps the fragment is from a cyclic structure. Wait, 45 can be C3H7O+. Let's compute: 3 carbons (36), 7 H (7), O (16) = 36+7+16=59. No. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH3COO- group, but that's 60-1=59, which doesn't fit. Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a ketene ion. I'm a bit stuck here. Let's move to the other clues.

In the IR, we had a broad peak at 3000, which I thought was an OH group. So maybe it's an alcohol. But wait, another possibility is a conjugated carbonyl, which can sometimes have a broad peak, but I think that's less likely. So, the OH suggests an alcohol or maybe a phenol, but the other peaks are at 1700 and 1650. Wait, 1700 is a carbonyl. So if there's an OH and a carbonyl, maybe it's an ester or a ketone with an alcohol group. Wait, but esters have two carbonyls? No, wait, an ester has one carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a beta-keto ester or something else.

Wait, the 1700 cm^-1 is a strong peak, which is typical for esters or ketones. The 1650 could be an conjugated carbonyl, like a ketone next to a double bond. So maybe the structure is something like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone, but also has an OH group. Hmm.

Looking at the NMR, vinyl hydrogens are present. So the molecule has a double bond. So the structure probably includes a double bond and a carbonyl group, along with an OH group.

Now, putting it together: a molecule with a double bond and a carbonyl, and an OH group. So perhaps it's a dihydroxy compound, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, but that doesn't fit the O count.

Wait, the options are C6H12O2, which is 6 carbons, perhaps an ester. Let me think about that.

An ester has the formula R-O-CO-R', which would have the carbonyl at 1700 cm^-1. So in that case, the IR would show the ester carbonyl. But where's the OH? Oh, wait, if it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone, then the OH isn't present. So maybe the broad peak is something else.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the compound is a beta-keto ester. For example, something like CH2(COOR)COOH. But that would have two carbonyl groups, which might correspond to the 1700 and 1650 peaks. But then what about the OH? Wait, maybe only one carbonyl is present. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a hemiacetal or something else, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the molecular formulas.

Looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -12 - (2*O)) / 2. Wait, formula is C6H12O2. So for the general formula CnH2mOx, the degree of unsaturation is (2n +2 - m - 2x)/2. Wait, wait, the degree of unsaturation formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*6 +2 -12 - 0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So one degree of unsaturation. That could be a ring and a double bond, or one double bond and one ring, or two double bonds.

Wait, no, wait, the formula is C6H12O2. So for each O, it's subtracted as 2 in the formula. Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute as:

Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since there's no N or X, it's (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So one DoU. That could mean either a ring or a double bond or a triple bond.

But the NMR says there are vinyl protons, so a double bond is present. So DoU is at least one. But wait, if the molecule has a double bond, then the DoU is 1, which could be the double bond. But if it's a cyclic ether, for example, that would be a ring, which is another DoU, making it two. Hmm, but the calculation says DoU=1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let's recalculate.

C=6, H=12, O=2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 - 0 +0)/2 = (14 -12)/2 = 1. So only one DoU. So either one ring or one double bond. But the NMR suggests a double bond, so that DoU is from the double bond. So the molecule has a single double bond and no rings.

So the structure must have a double bond and perhaps an ester or ketone group, along with an OH.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option C is C6H10O2. Let's compute its DoU.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2 = 2. So two degrees of unsaturation. That means a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds, or a triple bond and a ring, etc.

But the NMR shows vinyl protons, so a double bond is present. So with two DoU, there's another ring or another double bond.

So for option C: C6H10O2. So two DoU.

If that's the case, the compound could have a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

But in the IR, we have a broad peak at 3000, which suggests an OH group. So maybe the compound has a ring structure, an ester group, and an OH.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester (lactone) but that would have a carbonyl and a ring, but where's the OH?

Wait, perhaps it's a beta-keto ester, which would have a carbonyl adjacent to another carbonyl. But the IR shows two peaks around 1700 and 1650, which could fit conjugated carbonyls. But then the O count would be two. So maybe it's a diester? No, that would have more O.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is something like methyl vinyl ketone with an OH group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the mass spec fragment at 45. Let me think about what has a molecular weight of 45.

Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CHO−, which is 45 g/mol. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, 45 is also the molecular weight of CH3COO− (45? Let me calculate: 12 + (3*1) + (12 + (16*2)) → Wait, wait, methyl acetate is C2H4O2, which is 60 g/mol. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from the loss of a larger group. For example, if the molecular ion is at 100 (option
