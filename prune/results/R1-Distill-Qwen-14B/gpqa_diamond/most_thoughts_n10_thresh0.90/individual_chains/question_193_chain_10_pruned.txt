Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are various powers of r, like r cubed, r to the fifth, etc.

Hmm, right, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that distance (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by the parallax (in arcseconds). So d = 1/plx. So plx is inversely proportional to distance.

Wait, so if d = 1/plx, that means plx = 1/d. So as distance increases, parallax decreases. Got it.

The number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

But since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, we can express N in terms of d. Let's see: 1/(plx) = d. So 1/(plx)^5 would be d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So I think that's referring to the differential. Like, a small change in the number of stars with a small change in distance.

Wait, no, maybe not. Let's think about it. The number of stars in a region as a function of distance. If N ∝ d^5, then as distance increases, the number of stars increases as d^5. But wait, that seems counterintuitive. Because as you look further, the density of stars should decrease, but the volume increases. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Wait, no, the problem says that the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. Since plx is inversely proportional to d, 1/plx is d. So 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. So as you go further away (
