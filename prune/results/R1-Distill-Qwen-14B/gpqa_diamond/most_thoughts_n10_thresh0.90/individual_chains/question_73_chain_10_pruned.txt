Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about relativity, which I find a bit tricky. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m moving at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. We need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, and I have to choose the correct one.

Alright, first, let me think about relative speed. Wait, in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally, right? Because when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, you have to use the velocity addition formula from Einstein's theory.

The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is (v - u)/(1 - (vu)/(c²)), but wait, no, that's when they're moving relative to each other. Oh wait, actually, if object A is moving at v relative to the lab frame, and object B is moving at u relative to the lab frame, then the speed of A as seen from B is (v - u)/(1 - (vu)/c²). Hmm.

Wait, so let's clarify: in the lab frame, astronaut 1 has speed v1 = 0.6c, astronaut 2 has v2 = 0.5c. The question is, what is the relative speed of astronaut 2 as seen from astronaut 1's frame? Or the other way around? Because relative speed is a bit ambiguous. Oh, but since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is (v2 - v1) over 1 minus (v1 v2)/(c²), right?

So plugging in the numbers: v1 = 0.6c, v2 = 0.5c. So v2 - v1 is -0.1c. But the formula would give (v2 - v1) / (1 - v1 v2 / c²). So that would be (-0.1c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c² ). Let me compute the denominator: 0.6 * 0.5 is 0.3, so 0.3c² over c² is 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So numerator is -0.1c. So the relative speed would be (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. But speed is positive, so 0.1428c. Wait, but since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is how much faster one is than the other. Since astronaut 1 is moving faster than astronaut 2 (0.6c vs 0.5c), from astronaut 1's perspective, astronaut 2 is moving backward at 0.1c relative to him. But wait, no, because when you use the formula from A's frame to B's frame, if B is moving slower than A in the lab frame, then from A's frame, B is moving at (v2 - v1) / (1 - v1 v2/c²).

Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Let’s say in the lab frame, astronaut 1 (mass 2m) is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut 2 (mass 3m) is moving at 0.5c. The relative speed of astronaut 2 with respect to astronaut 1 would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Wait, no, because the formula is (v' - u) / (1 - (v' u)/c² ), where v' is the speed of the other object in the lab frame. Wait, I think I might have mixed up the formula. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the frame where astronaut 1
