--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read through it again and think about what each part means.

So, the setup is that there's a star similar in size to the Sun. One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the star's surface that these spots cover. The effective temperature of the star is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. Because the star is rotating, as it spins, the spots come into and out of view from our perspective, causing variations in the star's brightness over time. This is similar to how an exoplanet transiting in front of the star would block some light, causing a dip in brightness.

The question is asking, if instead of these spots, there was an exoplanet causing the same brightness variation, what would be the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius?

Hmm. So I think the key here is to calculate the change in brightness (the signal amplitude) caused by the spots and then determine what planet size would cause the same change.

Wait, but wait. The problem mentions that the star has spots on one hemisphere, and the photometric observations show periodic variations because of rotation. The same situation could resemble an exoplanet causing a transit. But to produce the same amplitude in the light curve (without the spots), what planet radius is needed?

So, first, I need to model the brightness variation caused by the spots and compare it to that caused by a planet transit.

Let me break this down.

When a star has spots, the observed brightness depends on which part of the star is facing us as it rotates. If the spots are cooler, they'll dim the total brightness when they're in view. The spots have a lower temperature, so when they're facing us, the star's overall brightness decreases. Similarly, when a planet transits, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness.

I think the approach is to calculate the fractional change in brightness (ΔF) in both cases and set them equal, then solve for Rplanet/Rstar.

So, for the spot case: The star has a filling factor f (20% or 0.2) of spots. Each spot is cooler by 1000 K. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, so the spots are at 5000 K.

The flux from the star without spots is F_star = σTeff^4. But with spots, the total flux is F = F_star - f * (F_spot - F_ambient), where F_spot is the flux per unit area of the spot, and F_ambient is the flux without the spot.

Wait, because the spots are cooler, their flux per unit area is less. So each spot contributes less flux than the surrounding. So the change in flux when the spot is visible would be a decrease.

Alternatively, the total flux from the star's surface is F = F0 * (1 - f) + F0 * (T_spot / T_eff)^4 * f, where F0 is the flux per unit area without spots.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the non-spotted area contributes F0, and the spotted area contributes F0 * (T_spot / T_eff)^4.

So the total flux is F = F0 [ (1 - f) + f (T_spot / T_eff)^4 ]

The change in flux due to the spot coverage is ΔF = F0 [ (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ) ] - F0 [ (1 - 0) + 0 ] ?

Wait no, wait. Without any spots, the flux would be F0. With spots, it's F = F0 [ (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ]

Thus, the fractional change in flux is (F - F0) / F0 = [ (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) - 1 ] = [ -f + f (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ) ] = f [ (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 ) - 1 )

So ΔF/F = f [ (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 ) - 1 ]

Since T_spot is 5000 K, and T_eff is 6000 K, let me compute that.

T_spot / T_eff = 5000 / 6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(T_spot / T_eff)^4 = (5/6)^4. Let me calculate that. 5^4 is 625, 6^4 is 1296. So 625/1296 ≈ 0.48225.

So (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 ) = ~0.48225.

So,

ΔF/F = f * (0.48225 - 1) = 0.2 * (-0.51775) ≈ -0.10355.

So the fractional change is about -10.355%. So the star's brightness decreases by about 10.355% when the spots are facing us.

Wait, but this is the average change? Or does it depend on the rotation?

Hmm. Alternatively, when the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing the flux to dip. The maximum depth would be when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible. Wait, no, because the star is a sphere, so when it's viewed from the side, only part of the spots are visible. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the problem says that the star has one hemisphere covered in spots. So when the star is viewed from Earth, the hemisphere with spots could be facing us or not. But if it's a hemisphere, then the maximum spot coverage would be when we see that hemisphere. So the maximum dip would be when the entire spotted hemisphere is in view.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should model the maximum dip.

Alternatively, the star's brightness variation depends on how much of the spotted area is visible. Since the spots are on a single hemisphere, their visibility depends on the star's rotation. Hmm, but perhaps the maximum dip is when the entire spotted area is visible, which would be when the entire hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, but the star is a sphere. The hemisphere with spots would occupy 50% of the star's surface. But in this case, the filling factor is 20%—so it's 20% of the hemisphere, which is 10% of the entire star's surface. Wait, no. Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. Oh, no, wait: the question says "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So that filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the total area covered is 0.2 * (π R^2), since a hemisphere has area 2π R² / 2 = π R²? Wait, no, wait. Hemisphere surface area is 2π R² (for a sphere, surface area is 4π R², so hemisphere is 2π R²). So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

Wait, wait, no. Maybe it's that the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * (hemisphere area), which is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R². So the total area of spots is 0.4π R².

So when we view the star, as it rotates, the spot coverage visible can vary. But the maximum dip occurs when the entire spotted area is visible. But wait, the star is a sphere; when you look at it, you see half the star (the hemisphere facing us). So if the spots are on one hemisphere, when that hemisphere is facing us, the maximum amount of spots is visible. So the maximum dip would be when the entire 0.4π R² spots are visible.

Hmm, maybe I should model the maximum dip. The dip in brightness is the fractional change in flux when the maximum number of spots is visible.

So the maximum dip, ΔF_max, would be the total flux without spots minus the flux with maximum spots visible.

Wait, the star's total flux without spots is F_total = σ Teff^4 * 4π R². Wait, no, the flux from a star is given by F = σ Teff^4 multiplied by the surface area. But when we observe it, the flux we receive is from the surface area that's visible. Wait, no, the star's total flux is F = σ Teff^4 * (4π R²) (if the star is a perfect blackbody), but when viewed from Earth, we see the flux as F = σ Teff^4 * (π R²) ) / (4π D² ), where D is distance. But for relative changes, D cancels out.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the fractional change in flux when spots are present.

So, the star's normal flux is F0 = σ Teff^4 * (π R²) ), because the cross-sectional area is π R².

When a spot is present, the flux is F = (π R² - A_spot) * σ Teff^4 + A_spot * σ T_spot^4.

But wait, A_spot is the area covered by spots. So F = F0 - A_spot (σ Teff^4 - σ T_spot^4 )

Thus, the fractional change is (F - F0) / F0 = - A_spot (σ Teff^4 - σ T_spot^4 ) / F0.

Wait, because F0 = π R² σ Teff^4, so F0 = (π R² σ) Teff^4.

Thus,

(F - F0)/F0 = [ - A_spot (σ Teff^4 - σ T_spot^4 ) ] / [ π R² σ Teff^4 ]

The σ terms cancel:

= [ - A_spot (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / [ π R² Teff^4 ]

= [ - A_spot ( (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) / Teff^4 ) ] / ( π R² ) 

Wait, but π R² is the area of the star's disk as seen from Earth. So,

= [ - A_spot (1 - (T_spot / Teff)^4 ) ] / ( π R² )

= [ - (A_spot / π R² ) ( 1 - (T_spot / Teff)^4 ) ]

The term (A_spot / π R² ) is the fraction of the star's disk covered by spots. Let me call that f_visible.

Wait, but wait. The total spots are on one hemisphere, so when the hemisphere is facing us, the entire spot area is visible. So the maximum f_visible is (A_spot) / (π R² ) = (0.2 * 2 π R² ) / (π R² ) )= 0.4.

Wait, let me clarify. The area of the hemisphere is 2 π R². The spots cover 20% of that, which is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R². So when the hemisphere is facing us, the entire 0.4 π R² is visible. So f_visible = 0.4 π R² / (π R² ) )= 0.4, which is 40% coverage.

So maximum dip, ΔF_max, would be:

ΔF_max/F0 = - f_visible * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff )^4 )

Which is:

ΔF_max/F0 = - 0.4 * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

We already calculated (5000/6000)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

Multiply by 0.4:

0.4 * 0.51775 = 0.2071.

So ΔF_max/F0 ≈ -0.2071, which is a 20.71% dip in brightness.

Wait, but wait. That can't be right because earlier, when I thought about the average, I got about 10% dip. But this is the maximum dip when all spots are visible.

Wait, but the problem says that the star's brightness varies with rotation because the spots come into view. So the maximum dip is when the hemisphere with spots is completely visible. So the light curve would have a periodic dip of about 20.7% when the spots are fully visible.

But how does this compare to the exoplanet case?

In the exoplanet case, when the planet transits in front of the star, it blocks some light. The dip in flux is given by the area blocked divided by the area of the star.

The dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the area blocked is π R_p², and the star's area is π R_Star², so the ratio is (R_p^2)/(R_Star^2) = (R_p/R_Star)^2.

So the dip would be (R_p/R_Star)^2.

Wait, but that's only if the planet covers the same fraction of the star as the spots do. So we need to set the maximum dip from the spots equal to the dip from the planet.

Wait, wait, in the problem statement, the spot situation is causing a dip, and the exoplanet would cause a dip. The question is, what planet radius would cause the same amplitude (i.e., same dip) as the spot situation.

So, the maximum dip from spots is 20.71% (0.2071). The dip from the planet is (R_p/R_Star)^2.

So, setting (R_p/R_Star)^2 = 0.2071.

Wait, but wait. No, because when the planet transits, it's covering part of the star, so the dip is the fraction of the star's area blocked by the planet. So dip = (R_p / R_Star)^2.

But wait, the dip from the spots is a decrease in flux of about 20.7%, so the planet's dip would be (R_p/R_Star)^2 = 0.2071.

Wait, but wait. That would give R_p = R_Star * sqrt(0.2071) ≈ R_Star * 0.455. But that's over 40% of the star's radius, which is larger than the options given. The options are all less than 0.4, with the highest being option D at 0.32.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me double-check.

Wait, no, perhaps the dip from the spot is not 20.7% but something else. Because in the spot case, the dip is when the entire hemisphere is visible, but perhaps the maximum dip isn't 20.7% but something else.

Wait, wait. Let me reevaluate.

The star has a radius R, so the area is 4 π R², but when viewed from Earth, we see π R². The spots are on a hemisphere, which is 2 π R² in area, and 20% of that is 0.4 π R² covered by spots.

So when the hemisphere with the spots is facing us, the maximum area of spots visible is 0.4 π R². So the fraction of the star's disk covered by spots is (0.4 π R²) / (π R²) )= 0.4, or 40%. So in that scenario, the dip in flux would be 40% of the star's flux being cooler, but the amount of flux decrease depends on the temperature difference.

Wait, but the way flux works is that each spot contributes less flux. So the total flux from the star would be:

F = F0 * (1 - f) + F0 * (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) * f,

where f is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. Wait, but in this case, when the hemisphere is facing us, the fraction of the star's surface (as viewed from Earth) covered by spots is 40%. So f=0.4.

So the flux is F = F0 * [ (1 - 0.4) * 1 + 0.4 * (5000/6000)^4 ]

Which is F0 * [ 0.6 * 1 + 0.4 * 0.48225 ].

Compute that:

0.6 + 0.4 * 0.48225 = 0.6 + 0.1929 = 0.7929.

So F = F0 * 0.7929.

The dip compared to F0 is (F0 - F) / F0 = (1 - 0.7929) = 0.2071, which is 20.71% dip.

So the maximum dip is about 20.71% of F0.

In the planet case, the dip is (R_p / R_Star)^2. So to get the same dip,

(R_p / R_Star)^2 = 0.2071 → R_p / R_Star = sqrt(0.2071) ≈ 0.455.

But looking at the options, the closest given is option A) ~0.39, D) ~0.32.

Hmm, none of the options are around 0.45. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the way the spot coverage is being considered. Because the star's total flux isn't just the sum of the normal and spot fluxes, but perhaps the situation is different because we're only seeing one hemisphere.

Wait, another approach: for the star, the maximum dip is when the entire spot area is visible. The spot area is 0.4 π R². The star's area as seen is π R². So the fraction of the star's area covered by spots is 0.4 π R² / π R² = 0.4. So the dip is 0.4 * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 ) = 0.4 * (1 - 0.48225) = 0.4 * 0.51775 = 0.2071, which is a 20.71% dip.

Wait, but the problem says that the brightness variation due to the spots is periodic and resembles an exoplanet. So the amplitude (the dip) would be the same as that of a planet transit.

But when a planet transits, the dip is (R_p / R_Star)^2. So setting (R_p / R_Star)^2 = 0.2071 gives R_p/R_Star ≈ sqrt(0.2071) ≈ 0.455, which is about 0.46, but this isn't among the options. So where am I going wrong?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the way the spot coverage affects the overall brightness. Because the star has a temperature of 6000 K and the spots are 5000 K, the spots contribute less flux. So the star's overall brightness when spots are present depends on the fraction of the surface covered by spots.

Wait, but perhaps when the spots are on one hemisphere, but not all of the star's surface is covered, the dip when the entire hemisphere is visible is 20.71%, but perhaps the average dip over time (due to rotation) is less.

Wait, no. The question is about the amplitude of the variation, which would correspond to the maximum dip, not the average. So when the entire hemisphere is visible, the dip is about 20.7%.

So, if the planet needs to cause the same dip, we'd have to have (R_p / R_Star)^2 = 0.2071 → R_p = 0.455 R_Star. But that's not one of the options.

Looking at the options:

A) ~0.39 → 0.39² = ~0.152 → 15.2% dip.

B) ~0.07 → 0.0049 → 0.49% dip.

C) ~0.11 → 0.0121 → 1.21% dip.

D) ~0.32 → 0.1024 → 10.24% dip.

Hmm. So none of these options give a 20% dip. Which means I'm probably miscalculating something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the spot flux calculation. Let me reevaluate.

Alternative approach: The star's brightness when a spot is present is a function of the spot's coverage and temperature. The flux from the star without spots is F0 = σ T_eff^4 * (π R^2) (the area as seen from Earth).

When a spot is present, the flux is F = F0 - (area of spots) * (F0 per unit area - F_spot per unit area).

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as:

The star's total flux is F = (1 - f) * F0 + f * F_spot,

where f is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots as seen from Earth.

Wait, but in this case, the spots are on a hemisphere, so the maximum f is 0.4 (40% of the star's disk). So when the entire hemisphere is visible, f = 0.4.

So, F = (1 - 0.4) * F0 + 0.4 * ( (T_spot / T_eff )^4 ) * F0.

So,

F = F0 [ 0.6 + 0.4 * (5000/6000)^4 ]

As before, which is 0.6 + 0.4*(0.48225) = 0.6 + 0.1929 = 0.7929.

So F = 0.7929 F0 → dip is 0.2071 F0, which is a 20.71% dip.

Wait, but perhaps the problem isn't considering the maximum dip, but the average dip. Because the star is rotating, the spots come into view and out of view, causing a periodic variation. So the average brightness variation would be lower.

Wait, but the problem states that the brightness variation is periodic, so the amplitude (maximum dip) is what's being compared to the planet's transit.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the variation's amplitude, which would be the peak-to-peak change. Wait, but that's the same as the dip; the amplitude is the depth of the dip.

So why is there a discrepancy between my calculation and the options?

Wait, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface, not just the hemisphere. Let me re-read the question.

The question says, "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

So when the hemisphere is facing us, the spots cover 0.4 π R², which is 40% of the star's disk (since the disk area is π R²). So the dip is 20.71%.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer isn't in the options, but that's unlikely because the options are given. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the spots are on a single hemisphere, so when the star rotates, only part of the spots are visible. Wait, no, if the hemisphere is entirely covered, then when that hemisphere is facing us, the entire 40% area is visible. So the maximum dip is 20.71%.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the dip calculation.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is about the relative brightness variation, not the absolute dip. Because when the planet transits, the dip is (R_p / R_Star)^2. But when the spots are present, the dip is f * (1 - (T_spot / T_Eff)^4 ).

Wait, in the problem statement, perhaps the star is not covered by spots, but the brightness variation is the same as the planet. So the planet's dip is (R_p/R_Star)^2, and the spot's dip is the same.

So if (R_p/R_Star)^2 = 0.2071, then R_p/R_Star is about 0.455, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct approach is different.

Wait, maybe I should consider the change in brightness when the spots are on the hemisphere, but the star is rotating, so the spots are only visible for part of the time, leading to a lower amplitude variation. No, the amplitude is the maximum dip when the spots are fully visible.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the brightness variation caused by the spots as they rotate. For example, the star's brightness will dip when the spots come into view, but the dip is the same as the planet's maximum dip.

Wait, but maybe the problem considers the total variation over a rotation period. No, the amplitude is the depth of the dip, not the total change over time.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think of another approach.

Another approach: The flux from the star without any spots is F0. When spots are present, the flux is F = F0 * (1 - f + f*(T_spot^4 / T_Eff^4)).

The change in flux is ΔF = F - F0 = F0 [ (1 - f + f*(T_spot^4 / T_Eff^4)) - 1 ] = F0 [ -f + f*(T_spot^4 / T_Eff^4) ) ] = F0 * f ( (T_spot^4 / T_Eff^4 ) - 1 )

So the fractional change is ΔF/F0 = f ( (T_spot^4 / T_Eff^4 ) - 1 )

Which, with numbers, is 0.2*( (5000/6000)^4 -1 ) = 0.2*(0.48225 - 1) = 0.2*(-0.51775) = -0.10355 → -10.355% change.

Wait, but this is the average change, not the maximum dip. Because when the spots are on the far side, there's no dip. So the average might be lower. Hmm, but the problem says that the situation can resemble an exoplanet, which would cause a periodic variation. So the amplitude (the maximum dip) would be the same as the planet's dip.

Hmm, I'm getting conflicting results. Perhaps I should think that when the spots are positioned such that half of them are visible, the dip is 10.355%, which is about 10% dip.

Wait, but earlier when the entire hemisphere is visible, the dip is 20.71%.

So which is it? The problem says that the star has one hemisphere covered with spots. So when that hemisphere is facing us, the dip is maximum. So the amplitude of the variation is 20.71% dip.

So to match that, the planet's dip would have to be 0.2071, which requires R_p/R_Star ≈ 0.455, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the spot filling factor.

Wait, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface, not the hemisphere. Let me re-read the question.

The question says: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered by spots. So 20% of the hemisphere is covered, which is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R². So when the hemisphere is facing us, the spots cover 0.4 π R², which is 40% of the star's disk area (π R²).

So dip is 20.71%.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the temperature difference, but only the area. But that wouldn't make sense because the spots are cooler.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the exoplanet case. The exoplanet would cause a dip of (R_p/R_Star)^2. So if that dip is 0.2071, then R_p is about 0.455 R_Star, but none of the options are near that.

Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the dip. Let me recompute the (5000/6000)^4 term.

5000/6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333333.

0.8333333^4 = ?

Let me compute it step by step:

0.8333333^2 = 0.69444444.

0.69444444^2 ≈ 0.482253.

Yes, so (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So when the hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F = F0 * (1 - 0.4) + 0.4 * 0.48225 F0 = 0.6 F0 + 0.1929 F0 = 0.7929 F0.

Dip is 1 - 0.7929 = 0.2071.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation as the change over time, not the maximum dip. So when the star is rotating, the apparent brightness changes as the spots come into and out of view. So the amplitude of the brightness variation would be the difference between when the spots are fully visible and when they're not.

Wait, but in that case, when the spots are not visible, the brightness is F0. When they are fully visible, it's 0.7929 F0. So the amplitude (the change) is 0.2071 F0. But when the spots are on the other side, the brightness is F0. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is 0.2071 F0, which is a 20.7% change. But the exoplanet would cause a dip of (R_p/R_Star)^2, which would have to match 0.2071.

But again, that gives R_p/R_Star ≈ 0.455, which isn't an option.

Hmm. The options are all much lower. So perhaps I'm missing a key factor. Let me think.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the star is being observed in a way that the spots don't all come into view at once. Or perhaps the approach is to model the spot-induced brightness variation as a periodic signal, integrating over the rotation period.

Wait, no. The problem states that the situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So the amplitude of the brightness variation (the dip) caused by the spots should match that of the planet.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the average brightness variation, not the maximum dip. Let me recalculate the average.

If the spots cover 40% of the star's disk when the hemisphere is facing us, but the star rotates such that the spots are only partially visible on average.

Wait, but the problem says that the star's brightness varies periodically due to rotation, which suggests that the maximum dip is when the entire hemisphere is visible.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach.

Alternative approach: The effective area of the spots as seen from Earth is f * π R^2, with f=0.4. The change in brightness is (ΔF) = (F_spot - F_star) * f.

But F_spot = (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) * F_star.

So ΔF = F_star [ (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) - 1 ] * f.

So the fractional change is [ (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) - 1 ] * f.

Which is [ (5000^4/6000^4) -1 ] * 0.4.

As computed before, that's (0.48225 - 1) * 0.4 = (-0.51775) * 0.4 = -0.2071.

So dip is 20.71%.

So again, the same result.

Hmm. So the problem is that none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the exoplanet's transit causes a dip of (R_p / R_Star)^2, but the spot's dip is larger because of the temperature difference. So perhaps the planet would need to be smaller to cause the same dip.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is not considering the dip but the peak-to-peak variation in the brightness. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the star's brightness variation due to spots isn't the same as the dip from a planet, because the spots are cooler, but when they're not visible, the star is at full brightness. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is the dip. So the planet's dip should match that.

Wait, but the exoplanet would cause a dip of (R_p/R_Star)^2. So to match a 20.71% dip, R_p/R_Star is about 0.455, which isn't an option. So perhaps the problem is considering the average dip over the rotation period.

Wait, perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface, not just the hemisphere. Let me think: if the entire star has 20% spots, then when any part of the star is facing us, the maximum fraction of spots visible is 20%. So the dip would be 0.2 * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 ) = 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355, or 10.355% dip.

Ah! So perhaps I misinterpreted the filling factor. The problem says "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface, not the hemisphere. So the spots cover 20% of the star's total surface area.

Wait, no. If the entire star's surface is 4 π R², and one hemisphere (2 π R²) is covered with spots with a filling factor of 20%, then the area of spots is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R², which is 10% of the entire star's surface area. So when the hemisphere is facing us, the spots cover 40% of the star's disk. But if the entire star has 20% coverage, then when any part is visible, the maximum visible is 20%.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

Scenario 1: The entire star's surface has 20% spots. So any hemisphere facing us would have 10% of the star's surface covered by spots. So when the hemisphere is facing us, the spots would cover 10% of the star's disk.

Scenario 2: One hemisphere has 20% of its area covered by spots. So the hemisphere's area is 2 π R². 20% of that is 0.4 π R². So when that hemisphere faces us, the spots cover 0.4 π R², which is 40% of the star's disk area.

The problem states that the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are on one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%. So the spots are 20% of the hemisphere's area.

So in Scenario 2, the maximum dip is 20.71%. But none of the options match that.

So perhaps the problem is referring to the average dip over the rotation period, considering that only part of the spots are visible at any time.

Wait, but if the star is rotating with a period such that the spots are only visible for part of the time, the average brightness would dip by a certain amount, but the amplitude would still be the maximum dip.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the dip as 20.71% and see which option's squared gives that. But none of them do. So perhaps I made a mistake in the spot calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation due to the spots isn't the same as the planet's dip. Because the spots are cooler, but when they're not visible, the star appears brighter. So the maximum brightness is when no spots are visible, and the minimum when the spots are fully visible.

But the exoplanet's situation is the opposite: the planet causes a dip when it's in front, but the rest of the time, the star's brightness is normal. So the amplitude is the dip.

So to have the same amplitude, the planet's dip (Rp²/Rs²) must equal the spot's dip.

But again, that leads to Rp ~ 0.455 Rs, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the spot's effect not on the flux, but on the brightness as seen from Earth, which depends on the area and the rotation period.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying the scenario and only considering the area, not the temperature difference. But that wouldn't make sense because the spots are cooler.

Wait, perhaps the problem is mistaken, or perhaps I'm missing a key factor.

Wait, another thought: maybe the problem is asking for the planet's radius such that the photometric signal (the depth) is the same as the spot-induced variation. But perhaps the spot-induced variation is when part of the star's surface is blocked by the spots, which are cooler.

Wait, but in reality, the spots cause a dip in brightness when they are in view. So the dip is due to the reduced flux from the spots. The planet would cause a dip of (Rp/Rs)^2.

So perhaps the problem is that the dip from the spots is (f) (1 - (T_spot / T_Eff)^4 ), and the planet's dip is (Rp/Rs)^2.

So setting f (1 - (T_spot / T_Eff)^4 ) = (Rp/Rs)^2.

Thus, Rp/Rs = sqrt( f (1 - (T_spot / T_Eff)^4 ) )

With f = 0.4 (since when the hemisphere is fully visible, 40% of the star's disk is covered by spots).

So,

Rp/Rs = sqrt(0.4 * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )) = sqrt(0.4 * (1 - 0.48225)) = sqrt(0.4 * 0.51775) = sqrt(0.2071) ≈ 0.455.

Again, same result.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options. But since the options don't include that, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to a much smaller dip. Let me think: what if the spots are only on a small part of the star, leading to a smaller dip.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface, not the hemisphere. So if the entire star is 4 π R², the spots cover 0.2 * 4 π R² = 0.8 π R².

When the star rotates, the maximum visible spots would be 0.8 π R², which is 80% of the star's disk area. Wait, but that would make the dip even larger, leading to Rp/Rs even larger than 0.455. Which is not possible.

Wait, that can't be right. If the spots are on one hemisphere, the maximum visible is 40% of the star's disk area. So perhaps the problem is that the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface, not the hemisphere.

In that case, the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 4 π R² = 0.8 π R². So when the hemisphere is facing us, the maximum visible is 0.8 π R², which is 80% of the star's disk area.

So the dip would be f = 0.8.

So,

ΔF/F0 = 0.8 * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 ) = 0.8 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.4142.

So dip is 41.42%.

So (Rp/Rs)^2 = 0.4142 → Rp/Rs ≈ 0.643, which is even larger and not an option.

Hmm. I think I'm going around in circles. Given the options, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the dip as if the spots are on 20% of the star's surface, not the hemisphere.

So, if the spots cover 20% of the star's surface, then when the star rotates, the maximum visible is 20%.

In that case,

ΔF/F0 = 0.2 * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 ) = 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355 → 10.355% dip.

So,

(Rp/Rs)^2 = 0.10355 → Rp/Rs ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

Which is approximately 0.32, which is option D.

So perhaps the correct answer is D) ~0.32.

But wait, the problem says that the hemisphere is covered with spots, so the maximum visible is 40% of the star's disk area. But perhaps the problem considers the filling factor as 20% of the entire star's surface. So the spots are 20% of the star's surface, which when a hemisphere is covered, it's 20% of the star's surface, so when the hemisphere is facing us, the spots cover 20% of the star's disk. Wait, no. If the spots are on a hemisphere, and the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, then when the hemisphere is facing us, the spots cover 40% of the star's disk.

But perhaps the problem considers the filling factor as 20% of the star's entire surface. So the spots are 20% of the star's surface.

In that case, when the star rotates, the maximum fraction of spots visible is 20%.

So dip is 20% of the star's disk covered, leading to a dip of 0.2 * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 ) ≈ 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355 or 10.355% dip.

So (Rp/Rs)^2 = 0.10355 → Rp/Rs ≈ 0.3218 → ~0.32, which is option D.

So perhaps that's the intended solution.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation (amplitude) as the star with spots, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Same as the Sun.
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a **filling factor of 20%** (i.e., 20% of the hemisphere's surface is covered by spots).
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The star's brightness decreases when the spots are visible due to their lower temperature.
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation is determined by the fractional change in flux caused by the spots.

3. **Exoplanet Comparison**:
   - A planet transiting in front of the star blocks a fraction of the star's light proportional to \( \left( \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 \), where \( R_p \) is the planet's radius and \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the star's radius.
   - We need to calculate the radius of the planet such that the amplitude of the brightness variation matches that caused by the spots.

---

### Step 1: Brightness Variation Due to Spots
The flux from a blackbody is proportional to \( T^4 \). The total flux from the star with spots is given by:

\[
F = F_0 \left[ (1 - f) + f \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right]
\]

where:
- \( f \) is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots as seen from Earth.
- \( F_0 \) is the flux from the star without spots.

#### Maximum Dip:
When the hemisphere with spots is fully visible, the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is \( f = 0.4 \) (since 20% of the hemisphere's area is covered by spots, and the hemisphere occupies 50% of the star's surface as seen from Earth).

The fractional change in flux is:

\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = f \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right]
\]

Substituting the values:
- \( f = 0.4 \),
- \( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} = \frac{5000}{6000} = \frac{5}{6} \),
- \( \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.48225 \),

we calculate:

\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = 0.4 \left[ 1 - 0.48225 \right] = 0.4 \times 0.51775 \approx 0.2071
\]

Thus, the maximum brightness dip caused by the spots is approximately \( 20.71\% \).

---

### Step 2: Brightness Variation Due to a Planet
The brightness dip caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to:

\[
\left( \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
\]

To match the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots, we set:

\[
\left( \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.2071
\]

Solving for \( \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} \):

\[
\frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.2071} \approx 0.455
\]

---

### Step 3: Reconciling with the Options
The calculated value of \( \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx 0.455 \) does not match any of the provided options. However, upon reevaluating the problem, it is possible that the filling factor refers to 20% of the star's **entire surface** rather than just the hemisphere. In this case:

- The fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is \( f = 0.2 \).
- The maximum brightness dip is:

\[
\frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = 0.2 \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right] = 0.2 \times 0.51775 \approx 0.10355
\]

Thus, the dip is approximately \( 10.355\% \), and:

\[
\left( \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.10355 \implies \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218
\]

This matches **Option D (~0.32)**.

---

### Final Answer:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately **0.32**.

**Answer: D**
