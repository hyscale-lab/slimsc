Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about the distribution of stars and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (p) is inversely proportional to distance (d), like p = 1/d in parsecs. So if a star is closer, it has a larger parallax, and farther stars have smaller parallaxes.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, uniform distribution usually means the same number per unit volume. So, if the density is uniform, the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the volume itself.

Parallax is in inverse, so higher parallax means closer. Let's think about how the volume relates to parallax. For a given parallax range, like from p to p + dp, what's the distance range? Since p = 1/d, dp = - (1/d²) dd. So, dd = -d² dp. Hmm, but since we're dealing with ranges, maybe I should think in terms of distance shells.

If I consider a thin shell between distance d and d + dd, the volume of this shell is approximately 4πd² dd. That's the surface area of a sphere (4πd²) multiplied by the thickness dd. So the number of stars in that shell would be the volume times the number density, which is uniform.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax, which is dp. So I need to relate this shell in terms of parallax. Let's see, d = 1/p, so dd = - (1/p²) dp. But since I'm considering a small dp (a unit range), I can think of how the volume changes with parallax.

The number of stars in a parallax range from p to p + dp would be the number density multiplied by the volume. The volume for a given p is the same as the volume for that shell in distance. So substituting, the volume is 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp? Wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, the shell in terms of distance is 4πd² dd. But since d = 1/p, that becomes 4π (1/p)^2 dd. And dd is the change in distance, which we can express in terms of dp. Since dp = - (1/d²) dd, then dd = -d² dp. Substituting d = 1/p, dd = - (1/p²) dp. So the volume becomes 4π (1/p²) * (-1/p²) dp.

Wait, but the negative sign just indicates direction, so for the purposes of counting stars, I'll take the absolute value. So the volume is 4π (1/p^4) dp. Oh wait, that's 4π * (1/p^2) * (1/p²) dp, which is 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars is proportional to the volume, which is proportional to (1/p^4) dp. But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax, which is dp. So the number per unit dp would be 4π (1/p^4) ? No, wait, because the number of stars in a dp range is proportional to (1/p^4) * dp. So the density per unit dp would be (1/p^4).

Wait, but the options are about how the number changes with plx, so the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/(p^4). So looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4.

But wait, I thought the volume element in terms of parallax would be different. Let me recap. Number of stars N in a volume dV is N = n * dV, where n is number density (stars per volume). For a uniform distribution, n is constant.

dV is the volume between d and d+dd, which is 4πd² dd. Since p = 1/d, then d = 1/p, so d² = 1/p². Also, dd = - (1/p²) dp. So inserting into dV, dV = 4π (1/p²) * ( -1/p² ) dp. The negative is just direction, so dV = 4π (1 / p^4 ) dp. So N = n * dV = n * (4π / p^4 ) dp.

But the question is about the number per unit parallax, so integrating over a small dp. So the number per unit parallax (dp) is (4π n ) / p^4. So the number N per unit plx (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4. So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but wait a second. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the relation between dV and parallax.

Another approach: The number of stars per unit volume is uniform, so n is constant. The number of stars in a certain range of parallax is N = n * V, where V is the volume accessible to stars with parallax between p and p+dp.

Since p = 1/d, we have d = 1/p. So the volume between p and p+dp corresponds to the distance from d to d+dd, where dd = -d² dp. So the volume is the same as before, 4πd² dd = 4π (1/p)^2 * (-1/p²) dp, which is 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So N = n * 4π / p^4 * dp. So per unit dp, N is proportional to 1/p^4. So the correct answer is option A.

But wait, some sources say that the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to 1/p². Did I do something wrong here?

Wait, perhaps I got confused with the differentials. Let me think again. The volume element in terms of parallax.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the number of stars in a given parallax interval (dp) at a certain distance p. So the volume is the shell volume, which is 4πd² dd. But since d = 1/p, dd = - (1/p²) dp. So the shell volume is 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp? That's 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars is n * 4π (1/p^4) dp. So when you divide by dp (to get per unit dp), it's (4π n) (1/p^4). So the number per unit parallax is 1/p^4, which is option A. So the correct answer should be A.

But wait, I'm a bit uncertain because I've heard that in the context of distance modulus and the number of stars, the distribution is such that the number per magnitude (which is a logarithmic distance measure) depends on 1/d^2. But in this case, the parallax is a linear measure of inverse distance. So perhaps the earlier approach is correct.

Another way: The number of stars in a certain distance interval (dd) is proportional to 4π d². Because for a thin shell at distance d, the volume is 4π d² dd. So as d increases, the number of stars per shell increases with d², assuming uniform density.

But since the question is about parallax, p = 1/d, so d = 1/p. So substituting, number of stars per dd is 4π (1/p)^2. But dd is related to dp as dd = - (1/p²) dp. So the number per dp would be (4π / p²) * (-1/p²) ) = -4π / p^4. Taking the magnitude, it's 4π / p^4. So per unit dp, the number is 1/p^4, so option A is correct.

So yeah, I think the answer should be option A: ~1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), such that \( p = \frac{1}{d} \). The problem assumes a uniform distribution of stars, meaning the number density of stars (\( n \)) is constant.

The number of stars in a thin shell at distance \( d \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \), where \( dd \) is the thickness of the shell in distance. Since \( d = \frac{1}{p} \), we can express \( dd \) in terms of \( p \) as \( dd = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{p} \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \) into the volume expression, the volume of the shell becomes:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p^2}\right) \left(-\frac{1}{p^2}\right) dp = -\frac{4\pi}{p^4} dp.
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, so we take the absolute value for counting stars. Thus, the volume of the shell is proportional to \( \frac{1}{p^4} dp \). The number of stars in this shell is then proportional to \( n \cdot dV \), which simplifies to:

\[
N \propto n \cdot \frac{1}{p^4} dp.
\]

To find the number of stars per unit range of \( p \), we divide by \( dp \), giving:

\[
\text{Number per unit } p \propto \frac{1}{p^4}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{p^4} \). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ 1/plx^4.**
