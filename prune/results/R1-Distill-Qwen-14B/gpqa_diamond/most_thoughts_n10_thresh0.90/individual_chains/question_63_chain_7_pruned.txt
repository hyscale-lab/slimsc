Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule and photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon. I need to find the momentum of that photon so the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state. The options are given, so I'll need to figure out which one it is.

Wait, the model is the quantum rotation-vibration model, or non-rigid rotor model. Right, so I remember that in such models, the energy levels involve both rotational and vibrational states.

In the fundamental state, the molecule is in its lowest energy state. So, the next state with the lowest possible energy must be the next higher state. But wait, what's the order here? Oh, right—vibrational energy levels are quantized, and so are rotational. But in the non-rigid rotor model, the moment of inertia isn't constant because the bond length changes with vibration. So the rotational energy depends on the vibrational state.

But wait, the question is about the transition after absorption. So, the photon must supply the energy difference between the current state and the next higher state.

Wait, but what's the initial state? Fundamental state probably means the lowest vibrational state (v = 0) and the lowest rotational state (J = 0). So the next state could be either a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). Which transition requires less energy? Because the photon's energy needs to match the difference.

Vibrational energy levels have higher energy gaps. The energy for vibration is (n + ½) h w, where n is the vibrational quantum number. For rotation, the energy is something like (J (J+1) ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. So, the rotational energy levels are closer together, especially for low J.

Wait, but the molecule is in its fundamental state, so v=0 and J=0. The next possible state could be either v=1 (first excited vibrational state) or J=1 (first excited rotational state). Which requires less energy? Let me calculate both.

The energy difference for vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1 is ΔE_vib = (1 + ½ - 0 - ½) h w = h w. For the rotational transition from J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is [ (1)(2) - 0 ] * (ħ²/(2I)) = (2) * (ħ²/(2I)) ) = ħ²/(I).

Hmm, which of these is smaller? Because the photon can provide either, but the question says it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the photon must be the one that causes the smallest energy jump?

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the next state being the first possible higher state, regardless of whether it's rotational or vibrational. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, I think in the non-rigid rotor model, the vibrational and rotational energies are treated together, considering the bond length changes. So the energy levels are actually a combination of both. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering only the vibrational transition, but that's not clear.

Wait, the question says the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model. So the energy levels are a combination of both rotational and vibrational states. So, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the next higher state, which could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. Which of these has a lower energy difference?

Let me calculate both ΔE.

First, the vibrational energy difference: E_vib = h w. H is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

E_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Now, the rotational energy difference. The moment of inertia I is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length.

μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20 amu * 2 amu)/(22 amu) = (40)/(22) amu = about 1.818 amu.

Wait, but to compute I, I need to convert amu into kg. 1 amu is about 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.017e-27 kg.

r is given as 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

So I = μ * r² = 3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.017e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg·m².

The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = [J (J+1) * ħ² ] / (2I).

The energy difference from J=0 to J=1 is ΔE_rot = E(1) - E(0) = (2 * ħ²)/(2I) - 0 = (ħ²)/(I).

Wait, actually, E(J) = [ J (J+1) ] * (ħ²/(2I) ). So for J=0, E is 0. For J=1, E is (2) * (ħ²/(2I)) )= ħ²/(I).

So ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I).

Compute that.

ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

Then, ΔE_rot = (1.112e-68) / (1.207e-46) ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

Wait, but that's way smaller than the vibrational energy difference of 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon must have energy corresponding to the rotational transition.

Wait, but the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state. So, the next possible state would be the one with the smallest possible energy increase. So, the molecule can either go to v=1 or J=1. Since J=1 requires less energy, that's the next state.

Wait, but does that make sense? Because the energy levels are quantized, the molecule can transition either way. But the question asks for the lowest possible energy state, so the photon must supply the energy needed for the smallest possible jump.

So the photon's energy should match the rotational energy difference, which is lower.

So the photon's energy E_photon = ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I) ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

But wait, the question is about momentum, not energy. So photon momentum p is related to its energy by E = pc, because for photons, E = pc (since their mass is zero). So p = E / c.

c is the speed of light, ~3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.22e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, that's way smaller than any of the options given. The options are on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 N·s.

Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a miscalculation? Let me double-check my steps.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the energy levels. Maybe the next state is a combination: in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of both, so transitions can involve changes in both vibrational and rotational states.

Wait, but in the model, the fundamental state is v=0 and J=0. The next state could be v=1, J=0, or v=0, J=1, or even v=1, J=1. But which has the lowest energy? Or perhaps the next available state is the one with the least energy, which would be the rotational transition.

Wait, but the energy for rotation is much lower than vibration. So v=0, J=1 is a lower energy state than v=1, J=0.

Wait, but wait: the energy of the fundamental (v=0, J=0) is E0 = 0 (vibrational) + 0 (rotational). The next possible state would be either v=1, J=0 (E = E_vib) or J=1, v=0 (E = E_rot).

Since E_rot is much smaller than E_vib, the next state with the lowest possible energy is J=1, v=0. So the photon must supply the energy difference corresponding to the rotational transition.

But earlier calculation of p gave 3e-31 kg·m/s, which is 3e-31 N·s, which is way smaller than the options provided (the smallest option is 1.4e-28 N·s).

Wait, so I must have made an error somewhere.

Let me go back. Maybe I miscalculated I or the energy.

Wait, let's recompute I.

Given Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 = 20/11≈1.818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.017e-27 kg.

r is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = μ r² = 3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.017e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m².

Correct.

Now E_rot (J=1) = [1*(1+1)] * ħ²/(2I) = 2 * ( (1.05457e-34)^2 ) / (2 * 1.207e-46 )

Wait, let me compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 2 * (1.05457e-34)^2 = 2 * (1.112e-68) = 2.224e-68.

Denominator: 2 * 1.207e-46 = 2.414e-46.

So E_rot = (2.224e-68) / (2.414e-46) )= approx 9.21e-23 J.

But wait, that's the same as before. So E_photon = 9.21e-23 J.

p = E/c = 9.21e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s = 3.07e-31 N·s.

Hmm, the options are on the order of 1e-27 N·s. So perhaps I'm doing something wrong here.

Wait, maybe I forgot to account for the vibrational energy in the rotational energy calculation. Because in the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length isn't fixed. Oh, wait, but for calculating the moment of inertia, I used the bond length, which is given as 2 angstroms. So I think that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the model considers that the molecule can't be treated as a rigid rotor, so the rotational energy depends on the vibrational state. But if the molecule is in the fundamental vibrational state, v=0, then the bond length is fixed at r=2 angstroms. So the moment of inertia is fixed. Hmm, but I'm not sure how that affects the rotational energy.

Wait, maybe I should be considering the total energy difference when transitioning from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1), but that's the same as the calculation above.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a transition that includes both vibrational and rotational changes, but that would require more energy than just the rotational change, which wouldn't be the next lowest.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the Raman effect where a photon induces a rotational change without changing the vibrational state, or other transitions. Alternatively, maybe the question is simplifying and only considering vibrational transitions.

Wait, but the energy difference for the vibration is h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J. The photon's momentum would be E/c = 2.65e-19 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 8.84e-28 kg·m/s = 8.84e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, option A is 1.9e-28. So 8.8e-28 isn't exactly matching any, but perhaps I made a mistake in units.

Wait, wait. Let me re-calculate the vibrational energy.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

w = 4e14 rad/s.

E_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626 *4) * 1e-20 = 26.504e-20 J = 2.6504e-19 J.

Then, p = E/c = 2.6504e-19 J / (3e8 m/s) = (2.6504 /3) *1e-27 kg·m/s ≈ 0.8835e-27 = 8.835e-28 kg·m/s = 8.835e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28. So 8.8e-28 isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the energy required is the combination of the rotation and vibration. But if the molecule is absorbing a photon that causes a transition to the next higher state, which could be a vibrational change, a rotational change, or a combination. But in the non-rigid rotor model, perhaps the energy levels are more complex.

Wait, perhaps the next state isn't just a pure rotational or vibrational change, but involves both.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy difference between the (v=0, J=0) state and the (v=1, J=0) state, which would be a vibrational transition. But earlier I saw that the rotational transition requires less energy, but maybe in reality the vibrational transition is higher, so the photon must supply that.

Wait, but according to the question, the molecule is in the fundamental state. So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the first excited state, which is the next available state, regardless of whether it's vibrational or rotational.

Wait, but in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are a mix of rotation and vibration. So the energy difference between the states is given by the sum of the rotational and vibrational contributions.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the question is considering only the vibrational transition because the molecule is modeled with rotation-vibration coupling, but the photon's energy needed is the vibrational energy.

Wait, but the options don't match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the molecule's transition from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state, which requires the photon to have energy E = h w.
