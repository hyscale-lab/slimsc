Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has three parts, each part being a different Michael addition reaction. I need to figure out the reactants and the major products for each, and then match them with the options provided.

First, let's recall what the Michael addition is. From what I remember, the Michael addition is a 1,4-conjugate addition where a nucleophile (the Michael donor) attacks a conjugated enone system (the Michael acceptor) at the beta position. This reaction forms a new carbon-carbon bond and typically results in the formation of a new stereocenter.

So looking at the first reaction:

Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). 

Dimethyl malonate is a known Michael donor. Its structure is CH2(CO2Me)2. The other component is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of this would be CH2=CH-CO2Me, but wait, no. Let me think again. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCO2Me? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the substituent is on the third position. Let me count. For acrylate, it's CH2=CH-COOR. So the positions are 1 (CH2), 2 (CH), 3 (COOR). So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the CH2 part? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH2CO2Me? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)CO2Me. No, that's not right. Wait, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylic acid methyl ester. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the p-tolyl group is on C3. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCO2Me? No, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CO-p-tolyl? No, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So the substituent in 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be on the third carbon. So the structure would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)CO2Me. Oh wait, so the double bond is
