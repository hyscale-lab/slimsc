Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem starts by describing a state |alpha> of an electron. The state is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, they form an orthonormal basis for the spin-1/2 system.

Wait, the state is proportional to that expression. That means it's not normalized yet. So, the first thing I should probably do is normalize the state. Because when we talk about probabilities, the state vector needs to have a length of 1.

So, let me write down the state. Let me denote |alpha> = a |up> + b |down>, where a = (1+i) and b = (2 - i). But it's proportional, so I need to find the normalization constant.

The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1. So, I need to compute |a|^2 + |b|^2. Because for an orthonormal basis, the inner product is just the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

Calculating |a|^2: (1+i)(1-i)/ (since for a complex number z, |z|² = z * z*, the conjugate). So, (1+i)(1-i) = 1*1 + 1*(-i) + i*1 + i*(-i) = 1 -i +i -i². Oh wait, i² is -1, so that becomes 1 -i +i +1 = 2. So |a|² = 2.

Similarly, |b|^2: (2 -i)(2 + i) = 4 + 2i -2i -i². The i terms cancel, and since i² is -1, it's 4 + 1 =5. So |b|² is 5.

So the total squared magnitude is 2 + 5 =7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next part of the problem: calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator with matrix A. The matrix A has elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, that's interesting. So, for a 2x2 matrix, it'll be:

[0, ħ/2]
[ħ/2, 0]

Wait, this looks familiar. I think this is the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So A = (ħ/2) σ_x.

In quantum mechanics, if an operator has eigenstates |+x> and |−x>, which are the eigenstates of σ_x, then the operator A would have eigenvalues ±ħ/2. So, the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |−x>, with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2 respectively.

But wait, the question says "each of the eigenstates of the operator". So, we're to find the probability of measuring the state |alpha> in each of these eigenstates. So, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |−x>.

Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, perhaps I can express |alpha> in the σ_x basis.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach would be better. The eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of σ_x. So, the eigenstates |+x> and |−x> can be written in terms of |up> and |down>.

I remember that the eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? Because σ_x flips the spin.

So, |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, let me write |alpha> in terms of these states.

First, let me express |alpha> as:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>

I can write this as a vector in the |up>, |down> basis. Let me denote the coefficients as c_up and c_down.

c_up = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
c_down = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

Now, I want to express |alpha> in the |+x> and |−x> basis. Let's denote the coefficients as d_+ and d_-.

So, |alpha> = d_+ |+x> + d_- |−x>

Expressing |+x> and |−x> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|+x> = (1/sqrt(2)) (|up> + |down>)
|−x> = (1/sqrt(2)) (|up> − |down>)

So substituting, |alpha> = d_+ [ (|up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2) ) ] + d_- [ (|up> − |down> ) / sqrt(2) ) ]

Grouping the terms:

= [ d_+ + d_- ) / sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (d_+ - d_- ) / sqrt(2) ] |down>

But this must equal the original expression for |alpha>:

c_up |up> + c_down |down>

Therefore, equate the coefficients:

c_up = [ (d_+ + d_- ) / sqrt(2) ]
c_down = [ (d_+ - d_- ) / sqrt(2) ]

Hmm, so I can solve for d_+ and d_- in terms of c_up and c_down.

Let me set up the equations:

Equation 1: (d_+ + d_-) / sqrt(2) = c_up
Equation 2: (d_+ − d_-) / sqrt(2) = c_down

Let me write them as:

d_+ + d_- = c_up * sqrt(2)
d_+ − d_- = c_down * sqrt(2)

Now, adding equations 1 and 2:

2 d_+ = (c_up + c_down) * sqrt(2)
d_+ = (c_up + c_down) * sqrt(2) / 2

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

2 d_- = (c_up − c_down) * sqrt(2)
d_- = (c_up − c_down) * sqrt(2) / 2

So,

d_+ = [ (c_up + c_down) * sqrt(2) ] / 2
d_- = [ (c_up − c_down) * sqrt(2) ] / 2

Let me compute c_up + c_down and c_up - c_down.

c_up = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
c_down = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

c_up + c_down = [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] / sqrt(7 ) = (3) / sqrt(7 )
c_up - c_down = [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] / sqrt(7 ) = [ (1-2) + (i + i) ] / sqrt(7 ) = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(7 )

So,

d_+ = [ 3 / sqrt(7 ) * sqrt(2) ] / 2 = [3 sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7)) )

Similarly,

d_- = [ (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(7 ) * sqrt(2) ] / 2 = [ (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7) )

Wait, but I'm more interested in the probabilities. The probability of measuring +ħ/2 is |d_+|^2, and the probability of measuring -ħ/2 is |d_-|^2.

So, let's compute |d_+|² and |d_-|².

First, |d_+|²:

d_+ = [3 sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7)) )

So |d_+|² = (9 * 2 ) / (4 * 7 ) = (18)/(28) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857...

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because if I compute 3² (9) times [ sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) ]². Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, d_+ is [3 sqrt(2) ]/(2 sqrt(7)).

So, square it: (9 * 2)/(4 *7) ) = (18)/(28) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Hmm, 9/14 is approximately 0.64.

Then |d_-|² = |d_-|^2.

Let me compute d_-:

d_- = [ (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7) )

The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] * (2)/(4*7) )

Because |a + ib|² = a² + b². So, |(-1 + 2i)|² is 1 +4=5.

So |d_-|² = 5 * (2) / (4*7) ) = 10/(28) = 5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Wait, but 9/14 +5/14=14/14=1, so that's correct.

Wait, but wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857 and 5/14 is about 0.35714. But looking at the options, let's see.

Option A is 0.64 and 0.36, which is close to this. But let me check if my calculation is correct.

Wait, wait. I think I made a mistake here. Because when I computed d_+ and d_-, perhaps I should have considered the cross terms, or perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, let me go back. Because I'm getting |d_+|² as 9/14 which is approximately 0.64, and |d_-|² as 5/14 ~ 0.357. But none of the options have 5/14 as a second probability. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7

But 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is close to 0.36, but not exactly. But perhaps I made an error in calculations.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I can write the state |alpha> as a vector and then compute the inner product with the eigenstates of A.

Let me think. The eigenstates of A are |+x> and |−x>, which are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2)
|−x> = (|up> − |down> ) / sqrt(2)

So, the probability of measuring +x is |<+x | alpha>|², and similarly for -x.

So, let's compute <+x| alpha>.

First, <+x | is (⟨up| + ⟨down| ) / sqrt(2)

|alpha> is ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>

So, <+x | alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

= [ (1+i + 2 -i ) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) ]

Simplify numerator: 1+2 +i -i = 3. So,

= 3 / (sqrt(14)) 

So the magnitude squared is (3)^2 / (14) ) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, compute <+x | alpha> is 3/sqrt(14), so probability is 9/14.

Similarly, compute ⟨−x | alpha>:

⟨−x | alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

= [ (1+i -2 +i ) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) ]

Simplify numerator: (1-2) + (i +i) = (-1) + 2i.

So, the inner product is ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14 )

The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1+4)/14=5/14 ≈0.3571.

So, the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.643 and 5/14≈0.357.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36. So that's close. The first two probabilities fit that.

Now, the average value of the operator A.

The average value is given by <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is a Hermitian operator, the average value is the expectation value.

But A is (ħ/2) σ_x, so <A> = (ħ/2) <sigma_x>.

The expectation value of sigma_x is given by <+x| sigma_x |alpha> etc., but perhaps a better approach is to compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

So, let me compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A = (ħ/2) σ_x, <A> = (ħ/2) <sigma_x>.

The expectation value of sigma_x in state |alpha> is given by <+x| alpha>² - ⟨−x| alpha>².

Wait, no, another approach: The expectation value of σ_x is 2*(probability of +x) - 1, but wait, that's when the eigenstates are |+> and |-> with eigenvalues +1 and -1. But in our case, the eigenvalues are +1 and -1 for σ_x, so expectation value is <+x| sigma_x |alpha> - <−x| sigma_x |alpha> ?

Wait, perhaps I should compute directly.

Another approach: express the state |alpha> and compute <alpha| σ_x |alpha
