Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms and spectroscopy. But let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break it down.

First, heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1. The product is a light yellow solid. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I remember is around where esters or possibly ketones absorb. Wait, but 1720 is more ester than ketone. Wait, no, ketones are around 1700-1750, but esters are similar, maybe a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe an epoxide? No, epoxide's IR is around 1250. Hmm, so 1720 could be an ester or maybe a ketone. But let me think about the reaction.

Heating dibromide with KOH usually leads to elimination. Wait, no, wait. KOH in such a reaction can cause an elimination, but since it's a strong base, it might deprotonate and form an epoxide? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a molecule with two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. When treated with a strong base like KOH, perhaps an elimination occurs, but since it's heated, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation. But wait, elimination would form a double bond. But then, the product has an IR at 1720, which suggests maybe an ester or a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: when two vicinal (adjacent) bromides are treated with a strong base, especially in an elimination reaction, but if it's a cyclic structure like adamantane, perhaps the elimination leads to a ring-opening? Or maybe instead of elimination, a substitution occurs. Wait, no, KOH is a base and a nucleophile. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is symmetric, so maybe it's undergoing a double elimination to form an epoxide. Oh wait, wait, no, epoxides are formed from vicinal dihalides under certain conditions. Oh, wait, yes! When a vicinal dihalide (two adjacent Br atoms) is treated with a strong base like KOH, especially in an elimination reaction, it forms an epoxide. So product 1 would be adamantane-1,3-diol epoxide, or more accurately, the epoxide form. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, when two adjacent bromides are present, such as in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and you treat with KOH, the base can abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the elimination of Br⁻ and the formation of an epoxide. Because the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, the elimination leads to the formation of an oxygen bridge between those two carbons. So product 1 is the epoxide, which is called 1,3-dioxo-adamantane or something like that. But wait, the NMR data given is 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). So the product is a diol? Wait, no. Because if it's an epoxide, the next reaction would be opening it. Wait, perhaps the first step gives an epoxide, and then the next steps involve opening it. Let me think.

Wait, after the first reaction, product 1 is the epoxide. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Hmm, what does that do? Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts reactions, but I'm not sure how that applies here. Alternatively, maybe it's used in some kind of ring-opening or other reaction. Wait, perhaps the epoxide is being opened in a ring-opening reaction to form a diol. Wait, but what's the role of aluminum isopropoxide here? Alternatively, maybe the epoxide is being converted into a ketone or something else.

Alternatively, considering that epoxides can undergo acid-catalyzed ring-opening. Since aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, perhaps it's acting as a catalyst for that. So product 2 would be a diol if the epoxide is opened. But wait, if product 1 is the epoxide, and when heated with Al isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid, perhaps the epoxide is opened via acid catalysis to form a diol. But wait, the diol would have two -OH groups. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the epoxide is being converted into a ketone via some kind of rearrangement, but I don't recall a direct pathway for that.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the first reaction isn't an epoxide. Let me re-examine the first reaction. 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Wait, KOH can cause elimination, but in the presence of a dihalide, perhaps it's a substitution. Wait, no, because substitution would require a nucleophile, like an -OH, but KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a vicinal dihalide. So when treated with KOH, perhaps each Br is replaced by OH, but that would form a diol. But wait, the NMR of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), which could be two OH groups, but wait, the IR shows 1720 cm⁻¹, which doesn't fit an -OH stretch. Oh wait, wait, no. If product 1 is a diol (vicinal diol), then the IR would show broad peaks around 3300 cm⁻¹ for the -OH groups. But the IR given is 1720, which is more likely a carbonyl, like an ester or ketone.

Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong about the first reaction. Let me think again. So what else could product 1 be? Maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, forming a double bond. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is on adjacent carbons, so elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C3? Wait, but in the adamantane structure, maybe the double bond isn't possible because of the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, causing the formation of a carbene or some other structure? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the KOH is acting as a base, causing the two bromides to eliminate and form a carbonyl group. Wait, but how? Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, with four cyclohexane rings fused together. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two adjacent carbons. Upon treatment with KOH, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH, but that would form a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing elimination to form an epoxide. So the first product is the epoxide. Then, the IR at 1720 would make sense if it's an ester, but if it's an epoxide, why isn't the IR showing
