Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to remember.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a boson X and some fermions. The term is written as L(y) = -λf f-bar ψf (y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψf(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully. Oh, right, the interaction term is probably something like coupling the boson X to fermions. The exact form might not matter for determining the decay modes, though.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So, I need to find which fermions it can decay into, considering their masses. Because for a decay to be kinematically allowed, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion, right? Because the fermion would need to have enough energy to create a pair.

Wait, but wait. The Lagrangian shows that X interacts with certain fermions. So it's about which fermions are present in the interaction term. The given Lagrangian has ψf(y), which I think represents fermion fields. So, the fermions that X can decay into are those that are coupled in this term.

But looking at the Lagrangian, it's written as -λf f-bar ψf (y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψf(y). Hmm, maybe I should clarify the structure. Oh, perhaps the interaction is X ψ ψ, implying that X couples to a pair of fermions. So, X can decay into two fermions (like a fermion and its anti-particle). So, the possible decay products depend on which fermions are involved in the interaction.

Wait, but the problem says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by..." So that Lagrangian term would dictate which fermions X can interact with. So any fermion ψf that is present in that term can be a decay product.

But in the Lagrangian, we have ψf(y), which is a fermion field. The interaction is X ψf ψf. So X can couple to a pair of ψf fermions. So, X can decay into a ψf and anti-ψf. So the possible decay products are any of the fermions ψf that are present in the interaction.

Wait, but the options given are about various fermions, like b, s, u, d, tau, etc. So I need to figure out which fermions are allowed by the interaction.

Wait, but the Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f f-bar ψf (y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψf(y). Hmm, perhaps the term is more like λ f (X) ψf ψf. So the interaction is between X and ψf particles. So ψf would be a fermion of some type.

Wait, but in the Lagrangian, perhaps the term is more like X ψψ. So the X field is interacting with ψ fermions. So ψ could be any fermion that has this coupling.

Wait, but the fermion ψf could be any of the quarks or leptons, depending on what's allowed by the interaction. But the problem statement doesn't specify which fermions are involved. Wait, no. The problem gives the Lagrangian, but it's written in a general way, so perhaps ψf represents all possible fermions. But that can't be right, because in reality, different bosons couple to different fermions.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that the boson X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that it can couple to, and for which the mass is less than half of X's mass (since X is 6 GeV, so each fermion must be less than 3 GeV). 

So first, let me list all the known fermions and their masses:

- Up quark (u): ~2 MeV/c²
- Down quark (d): ~5 MeV/c²
- Strange quark (s): ~100 MeV/c²
- Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV/c²
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.7 GeV/c²
- Top quark (t): ~173 GeV/c²
- Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV/c²
- Muon (mu): ~105.7 MeV/c²
- Tau (tau): ~1.78 GeV/c²
- Neutrinos (ν): very light, around 0.1 eV or so, but perhaps negligible.

So the mass of X is 6 GeV. So each fermion in the decay must have a mass less than 3 GeV, because two of them need to be created (so m_fermion * 2 < 6 GeV).

Looking at the fermion masses:

- u: 2 MeV → yes
- d: 5 MeV → yes
- s: 100 MeV → yes
- c: 1.5 GeV → yes (since 1.5 *2 = 3 GeV <6 GeV)
- b: ~4.7 GeV → 4.7 *2 =9.4 GeV>6 GeV → no
- t: way too heavy, 173 GeV → no
- e: 0.5 MeV → yes
- mu: ~0.1 GeV → yes (0.1 *2=0.2 <6)
- tau: ~1.78 GeV → 1.78*2=3.56 GeV>6 GeV? Wait wait, 1.78 *2 is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. Oh wait, 3.56 <6, so tau is allowed.

Wait, wait. For a decay into a tau pair, X must have mass >= 2 * m_tau. m_tau is about 1.78 GeV, so 2*m_tau is ~3.56 GeV. X is 6 GeV, which is larger than 3.56 GeV, so yes, the decay is allowed.

Wait, but wait. What about the bottom quark? m_b is about 4.7 GeV, so 2*m_b is ~9.4 GeV, which is larger than X's mass of 6 GeV. So X can't decay into a pair of b quarks.

So the allowed decay products would be any fermion-antifermion pair where m_fermion *2 <=6 GeV.

So looking at each fermion:

u: allowed (2 MeV)
d: allowed (5 MeV)
s: allowed (100 MeV)
c: allowed (3 GeV)
e: allowed (0.5 MeV)
mu: allowed (0.1 GeV)
tau: allowed (1.78 GeV, 2*1.78=3.56 GeV <6 GeV)

So fermions that are allowed as decay products are u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

Wait, but what about the top quark? No, m_t is way too high. Quarks: u, d, s, c, but not b or t.

So the decay products would include each of these fermion pairs.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X → b, s, u, d, tau, e. Wait, but b is not allowed because 2*m_b=9.4 GeV>6 GeV. So option A includes b, which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Wait, but option B includes c. Wait, 2*m_c is 3 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV, so c is allowed. So option B is X→c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau tau-bar, mu mu-bar, e e-bar.

Yes, that seems correct. Because all these fermions have 2*m_fermion <6 GeV.

Wait, but what about the up quark? 2*m_u is 4 MeV, which is okay. So yes, u is allowed.

Option B includes c, which is allowed, but option D includes c as well. Wait, let me check the options again.

Looking at option D: X → b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So includes b, which is not allowed.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t, but t is too heavy. So C is wrong.

So the correct options are the ones that include all the allowed fermions and exclude the ones that are too heavy.

So the allowed fermions are u, d, s, c, tau, mu, e.

Looking at the options:

Option B: X → c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. That's correct. 

Option D includes b which isn't allowed, so D is wrong.

Wait, but let me double-check. The problem is about the Lagrangian, so perhaps only certain fermions are coupled to X. Because the Lagrangian is written as -λ f f-bar ψf (y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψf(y). So ψf is a fermion field. Could ψf represent only certain types of fermions?

Wait, the interaction term appears to be X ψf ψf, so X can decay into ψf and ψf-bar. But what is ψf in this case? Are they all possible fermions, or only specific ones?

Hmm, perhaps the notation is that ψf is a generic fermion field, but in reality, the interaction could be with specific fermions. But the problem statement doesn't specify which ones, so perhaps we're to assume all fermions. But that can't be right because, for example, the top quark can't be produced since X is only 6 GeV.

Wait, but the problem says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by..." So, X can interact with any fermion f. So, the possible decay products would be any fermion f where 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

So, the correct decay modes are into any of the fermion pairs where this condition holds. So, yes, the answer is option B, because it includes all the allowed fermions except those too heavy.

Wait, option B lists: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Yes, all allowed. Option B is present as an option. So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but another thought: the interaction term must have the fermions ψf in it. So, the X can couple only to the fermions that are present in the interaction. If, for example, the interaction term is only with leptons, then X can only decay into leptons. But the way the problem is written, the interaction is with fermions in general, perhaps all. Alternatively, perhaps the interaction term is written with ψf, but in reality, ψf could be any of the known fermions.

Wait, but in the Lagrangian given, the interaction is X ψf ψf. So for any fermion f, X can couple to a pair of ψf fermions. So if the interaction is written as L = λ X ψf ψf, then X can decay into any of the fermions f that satisfy m_f ≤3 GeV.

So, the possible decay products are all fermion-antifermion pairs where 2m_f ≤6 GeV. So the allowed fermions are u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

So the correct option is option B: X→c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau tau-bar, mu mu-bar, e e-bar.

Looking at the options given:

Option B is "X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau tau-bar, mu mu-bar, e e-bar"

Yes, that's correct.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the given interaction Lagrangian and the fermion masses. For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the mass of the boson must satisfy \( m_X \geq 2m_f \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion \( f \). The interaction Lagrangian indicates that \( X \) couples to fermion-antifermion pairs, and the allowed decay products depend on the fermion masses.

### Fermion Masses and Allowed Decays:
1. **Up quark (\( u \))**: \( m_u \approx 2 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_u = 4 \, \text{MeV} \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → Allowed.

5. **Bottom quark (\( b \))**: \( m_b \approx 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b = 9.4 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → Not Allowed.
6. **Top quark (\( t \))**: \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → Not Allowed.
7. **Electron (\( e \))**: \( m_e \approx 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_e = 1.022 \, \text{MeV} \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → Allowed.
8. **Muon (\( \mu \))**: \( m_\mu \approx 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_\mu = 211.4 \, \text{MeV} \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → Allowed.
9. **Tau (\( \tau \))**: \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau = 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \) → Allowed.

Thus, the allowed decay products are \( u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, s\bar{s}, c\bar{c}, e^+e^-, \mu^+\mu^-, \tau^+\tau^- \).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). → Incorrect.

- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). → Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. → Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it includes all kinematically allowed decay modes of the boson \( X \).

Answer: B
