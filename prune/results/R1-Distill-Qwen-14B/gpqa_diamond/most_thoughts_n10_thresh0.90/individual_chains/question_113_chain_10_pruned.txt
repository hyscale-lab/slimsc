Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. I need to pick the right one based on the given data.

Let's start by looking at each piece of data and see what they can tell me about the compound.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in IR around that region usually indicate O-H stretching. So maybe this compound has an alcohol group or maybe a carbonyl with hydrogen, but I'm not sure. Wait, noâ€”wait. Another possibility is that it's an alcohol (like an -OH group) or maybe an amide, but since there's no mention of NMR peaks for amines, I'll focus on O-H. Alternatively, maybe it's from an ether, but ethers don't usually have strong O-H stretches. So probably, this is an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, carboxylic acids have very broad O-H stretches, but they also have strong absorption around 1700 cm^-1 for the carbonyl.

The other IR peaks are at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 peak is a strong one, which I think is a carbonyl group (C=O). But wait, 1650 is a bit lower. Could that be another carbonyl, maybe an ester or amide? Or perhaps an aromatic ring with conjugated carbonyl? Alternatively, maybe it's an absorption from something else, like an aromatic ring vibration or an amide. But let's think about the common groups. A carbonyl in a ketone is typically around 1700. An ester's carbonyl is similar, maybe a bit lower. An acid's carbonyl is usually around 1700, but maybe the 1650 is from something else. Wait, maybe there's another functional group. Another possibility: the 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like in an aromatic ketone or maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Or perhaps it's a carbonyl with another group, like an ester or amide. Alternatively, the 1650 might not be a carbonyl. Wait, I should think about other possibilities. For example, maybe it's a C=C stretch? Because C=C double bonds have peaks around 1650 cm^-1. Oh, wait, that's a possibility. So maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl, and the 1650 is a C=C. That would make sense, especially if the compound has both a carbonyl and some sort of unsaturated group, like a vinyl group.

Looking at the NMR data: there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydro
