Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule transitioning between energy states. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The question is about finding the momentum of a photon that causes the molecule to switch from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state. 

Wait, let me think. The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state for both rotation and vibration. But wait, in the quantum model, each mode has its own quantum numbers. For rotation, the ground state is when the rotational quantum number J is 0, and for vibration, the vibrational quantum number ν is 0. But if it's the next lowest state, does that mean it's the first excited state overall? So maybe the molecule is transitioning to a state where either J increases or ν increases.

But wait, the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state would be the one with the least increase in energy. In quantum systems, sometimes the first excited state is a higher state in one of the modes. I'm a bit fuzzy on whether the next state is the first vibrational excited state or the first rotational one. 

Wait, the model used here is the rotation-vibration model, which combines both rotation and vibration. But I think each has its own energy levels. The fundamental state would be the lowest for both. The next state could be increasing J by 1 (so J=1) or increasing ν by 1 (ν=1). Which transition requires less energy? Because the question is about the photon that causes the transition, the energy of the photon must match the energy difference between the states.

I think that for a diatomic molecule, the vibrational energy levels are quantized with much higher spacing than the rotational ones. Because the vibrational energy levels are given by (ν + ½) ħω, where ω is the angular frequency. The rotational energy levels are given by something like (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

So to find the energy difference between the fundamental state and the next state, I need to calculate the energy of the first possible transition. The photon's energy must match the energy difference. Since the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, I should find the transition that requires the least energy.

Wait, but the options are about momentum, not energy. Momentum p is related to energy if we're considering the photon. Because photons carry energy E = pc, where c is the speed of light. So once I find the required energy, I can find p by dividing E by c.

But first, I need to calculate the energy of the transition. Let's break it down. The fundamental state is J=0, ν=0. The next possible states are J=1, ν=0 (rotational transition) or J=0, ν=1 (vibrational transition). Which of these requires less energy?

Let me compute the energies for both.

First, the rotational energy for J=1 and J=0.

The rotational energy is given by E_rot = (J(J+1) * ħ²) / (2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

I is the moment of inertia, which is μr², where μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length.

Wait, bond length is given as 2 angstroms. So r = 2e-10 meters (since 1 angstrom is 1e-10 m).

Masses are Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. So the reduced mass μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) in amu. Let me compute that.

μ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40 / 22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Since 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg, then μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ let's calculate that.

1.818 * 1.66 = approx 3.010.

So μ ≈ 3.01e-27 kg.

I = μr² = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.204e-46 kg·m².

Now, the rotational energy for J=0 is E_rot(0) = 0. For J=1, E_rot(1) = (1*2 * ħ²) / (2I) = (2 ħ²) / (2I) = ħ²/(I).

I need ħ, which is h/(2π). Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ is approximately 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So E_rot(1) = ( (1.05457e-34)^2 ) / (1.204e-46 )

Calculating numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68.

Then E_rot(1) = 1.112e-68 / 1.204e-46 ≈ approx 9.23e-23 J.

Wait, that seems really tiny. Hmm, maybe I should check my calculations.

Wait, let me compute that again.

I = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10)^2 = 3.01e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg m².

E_rot(1) = (ħ²)/(2I) * J(J+1). For J=1, it's 2 ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/(I).

Wait, wait, the formula is E_rot = [J(J+1) ħ² ] / (2I)

So for J=1: E_rot(1) = (1*2) * ħ² / (2I) = (2 ħ²)/(2I) = ħ²/I.

Ah, same as before. So ħ² is (1.05e-34)^2 ≈ 1.1e-68 J²·s².

Divided by I=1.2e-46 kg m².

So E_rot = 1.1e-68 / 1.2e-46 ≈ 9.17e-23 J.

Wait, but what's that in terms of photon energy? Let me think about the vibrational energy.

Vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (ν + ½) ħ ω.

The given ω is 4e14 rad/s. For ν=0 (ground state) and ν=1 (first excited state), the energy difference for a vibrational transition is E_vib = ħ ω (since (1 + ½) - (0 + ½) ) = 1 * ħω.

So E_vib = ħ * ω = 1.05e-34 * 4e14 = approx 4.2e-20 J.

Wait, that's way higher than the rotational energy. Because 4.2e-20 J is much bigger than 9e-23 J (since 1e-20 is 1e3 times 1e-23). So the vibrational transition is higher in energy. So the smallest energy transition would be the rotational one from J=0 to J=1.

Wait, no, wait. Because the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state. Which for rotation is J=0, and for vibration ν=0. So the next state would be the one with the lowest possible energy. So the next possible state is either J=1 and ν=0, or J=0 and ν=1. Which has a lower energy difference?

From the calculations, E_rot is about 9e-23 J and E_vib is 4.2e-20 J. So E_rot is much smaller. So the photon would need to have energy equal to E_rot, which is 9e-23 J.

Wait, but wait a second. I'm a bit confused because I thought that normally, in diatomic molecules, the rotational and vibrational energies are treated as separate modes. So when transitioning, the photon could cause a change in either rotational or vibrational state. But for the next state with the lowest possible energy, the molecule would prefer the transition that requires the least energy, which is the rotational one.

So the photon's energy should be E_rot = 9e-23 J. But wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating E_rot. Let me recalculate.

E_rot(1) = [ (1)(1+1) * ħ² ] / (2I) = (2 ħ²)/(2I) ) = ħ²/(I)

So ħ is 1.05457e-34 J·s. So ħ² is about (1.05e-34)^2 = approx 1.1e-68 J²·s².

I is 1.2e-46 kg m².

So ħ² / I = 1.1e-68 / 1.2e-46 = (1.1/1.2) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.917e-22 J = 9.17e-23 J.

Yes, that's correct. 

So the photon needs to have energy equal to 9.17e-23 J.

But wait, the question is about the photon's momentum. Since E = pc for a photon, then p = E/c.

C is the speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.17e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = approx 3.06e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Options are:

A) 1.9e-28 N·s

B) 2.3e-27 N·s

C) 1.1e-27 N·s

D) 1.4e-28 N·s

Wait, but wait, 1 N·s is 1 kg·m/s. So the options are expressed in kg·m/s, which is the same as N·s.

Wait, so 3.06e-31 kg·m/s is 3.06e-31 N·s. But none of the options are around that. The options are all 1e-27 or 1e-28. So there's a problem here.

Wait, wait a minute. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the reduced mass or something else. Let's recheck.

Reduced mass μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (22) = 40/22 = 1.818 amu.

Wait, 1 amu is 1.66e-27 kg, so 1.818 * 1.66e-27 = approx 3.01e-27 kg. That's correct.

Bond length r = 2 A = 2e-10 m. So I = μ r² = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 is 4e-20 m². So I = 3.01e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg m². Correct.

E_rot(1) = (2 * ħ²) / (2I) = ħ² / I.

So, ħ is 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So ħ² is (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 J²s².

I = 1.204e-46 kg m².

So E_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.204e-46 = 9.23e-23 J.

Hmm, that's correct.

So p = E/c = 9.23e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.077e-31 kg·m/s = 3.077e-31 N·s.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe the transition is not rotational but vibrational? But earlier calculation showed that to be much higher. Unless... wait, perhaps the question is about the fundamental state, which for the vibration might be in the rotational state. Wait, no, the fundamental state is the lowest energy for both.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the molecule transitions from the (J=0, ν=0) state to the (J=1, ν=0) state. That would require energy for rotation.

But maybe the given options are using the vibrational transition. Let me check what the vibrational photon's momentum would be.

E_vib = ħ ω = 1.05457e-34 J·s * 4e14 rad/s = 4.218e-20 J.

p = E/c = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 = 1.406e-28 N·s.

Wait, that would correspond to option D: 1.4e-28 N·s.

But earlier, the vibrational transition's energy is much higher than the rotational. So why would the question have the photon's momentum as per the vibrational transition? Because perhaps the question is asking for the next state, which could be the first vibrational state, not the rotational. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is in the fundamental state of the rotation-vibration model. That is, J=0 and ν=0. The next state with the lowest energy could be J=1, ν=0, but if that's not allowed, perhaps it's J=0, ν=1. But in terms of energy, the rotational state is lower, so that would be the next state.

But why are none of the options matching the rotational transition?

Wait another thought: perhaps the question is looking for the transition to the next state, which is the first state above the fundamental, regardless of whether it's rotation or vibration. But which transition requires less energy? We have E_rot ≈9e-23 J and E_vib≈4e-20 J. So the rotational transition is lower, so the photon would have to supply that.

But the options are much larger in magnitude than 3e-31. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the molecule as a rigid rotor, but perhaps not. Wait, no, the question states it's modeled using the non-rigid rotor model, which is the same as the rotation-vibration model, I think.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula for the rotational energy. Let me double-check. The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = [J(J+1) ħ² ] / (2I). So for J=1, E_rot = 2 ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/(I). So that's correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the angular frequency given is ω, but the vibrational energy is quantized in terms of hν, not ħω. Because sometimes, the vibrational energy is written as (ν + ½) h ν_vib, where ν_vib is the vibrational frequency in wavenumbers.

Wait, I think I might have gotten this wrong. Let me clarify: the vibrational energy levels are (ν + 1/2) h ν, where ν is the vibrational quantum number, and ν is the vibrational frequency in terms of s^-1.

Wait, but the question gives the angular frequency ω as 4e14 rad/s. So the regular frequency ν (without the hat, which is confusing) would be ω/(2π). So perhaps the energy is (ν + 1/2) ħ ω.

Wait, yes, because E_vib = (ν + 1/2) ħ ω.

So the energy difference between ν=0 and ν=1 is E = ħ ω.

So E = 1.05e-34 J·s * 4e14 rad/s = 4.2e-20 J. So p = E/c = 4.2e-20 / 3e8 = 1.4e-28 kg·m/s or N·s.

Which is option D: 1.4e-28 N·s.

But earlier, the E_rot is 9.2e-23 J, which would lead to p=3e-31 N·s, which is much smaller than any of the options. So why is this?

Wait, perhaps the molecule is transitioning not just to the next state in rotation or vibration, but considering the combination of both. Or perhaps the question is looking for the vibrational transition, assuming that the rotational transition is not possible because the molecule is in the fundamental state, but that doesn't make sense because the fundamental state is the lowest, so J=0 is allowed.

Wait, maybe I should compute the possible photon energy for both transitions and see which option fits.

E_rot is 9.2e-23 J, so p_rot = 3e-31 N·s.

E_vib is 4.2e-20 J, p_vib = 1.4e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 N·s, which matches the vibrational transition.

So if the question is asking for the photon momentum needed to move the molecule to the next possible state, which requires the least energy, then why would the vibrational transition be considered?

Because perhaps the rotational transition is not allowed? Or perhaps the model allows for different selection rules.

Wait, in the rigid rotor model, the selection rule for rotation is ΔJ = ±1. But in the real model, with vibration and rotation coupling, maybe there are other selection rules. Or perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition as the next state, not the rotational.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the problem again. The question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the lowest possible energy difference would be the rotational one. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the bond length is given as 2 angstroms, but I used 2e-10 m correctly. Let's recheck.

Yes, 2 A is 2e-10 m.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the reduced mass is calculated incorrectly. Wait, the reduced mass μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (22 amu) = (40) / 22 = about 1.818 amu. That calculation is correct.

Wait, what's the moment of inertia again? I think I did that correctly.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units. Let's recast all units correctly.

Wait, the moment of inertia I is μ r². r in meters, so 2e-10 m. So r² is 4e-20 m². μ is 1.818 amu, which is 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 3.01e-27 kg. So I = 3.01e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.204e-46 kg·m². Correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating E_rot. Let me recompute ħ².

ħ is approximately 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So ħ² is (1.05457e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68 J²·s².

Then, E_rot = ħ² / I = (1.112e-68) / (1.204e-46) = 9.23e-23 J. Correct.

So p_rot = 9.23e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 N·s. Not matching any options.

So perhaps the correct approach is to consider the vibrational transition, which gives an option that's present.

But why is the rotational transition not matching any options? Maybe the problem expects the higher transition. Alternatively, perhaps I mixed up the energy for the rotational transition.

Wait, maybe the rotational transition is not possible because J can't go to zero. Wait, no, J can be zero, and the transition is allowed from J=0 to J=1 with a photon of appropriate energy.

But the options don't have the 3e-31 value. So perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the vibrational transition, not the rotational. So the next state would be the first vibrational excited state. So the photon's energy would be E_vib = ħ ω = 4.2e-20 J, which gives p=1.4e-28 N·s, which is option D.

But the question says, "the next state with the lowest possible energy," which would suggest the transition requiring the least energy. So why would it consider the higher energy transition?

Alternatively, perhaps the rotational transition is forbidden for some reason, such as selection rules. But in reality, the selection rule for rotation is ΔJ = ±1, so J=0 → J=1 is allowed.

Wait, but perhaps in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of both, but the transitions are dipole allowed only when certain conditions are met. Hmm, I'm not sure about the exact selection rules for such a model, but I think for simplicity, the problem expects us to consider the vibrational transition, even though the rotational one requires less energy.

But the options don't have the rotational transition's momentum. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Another approach: perhaps the given w is the vibrational frequency in terms of wavenumbers, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the photon's energy as the sum of both rotational and vibrational transitions, but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, maybe the problem is about the fundamental vibrational state, but the next state is the first rotational state. But in any case, the calculation for the rotational energy seems correct, but that gives a momentum not in the options.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor in the rotational energy. Let me double-check the formula.

The rotational energy is E_rot = (J(J+1) ħ² ) / (2I). For J=1, E_rot = (2 * ħ² ) / (2I) = ħ² / I. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the molecule is moving from the state where J=0, ν=0 to J=1, ν=0, which requires just the rotational energy. So the photon's energy is E_rot, but the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the given options are orders of magnitude off. Let's see:

If the correct p is 3e-31, which is 3e-31 N·s. But the options are 1e-28 or 1e-27, which are larger by factors of 1e4 to 1e5. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the formula for the moment of inertia. Let me recheck:

I = μ r². Correct.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong value for r. The problem says bond length is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m, correct.

Hmm. Another thought: maybe the question is not about the ground state, but the fundamental state refers to the rotation being in the first state. But no, in the quantum model, the ground state is J=0.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule's transition to a state where both J and ν increase. But that would require much higher energy.

Wait, maybe the question is considering the transition from (J=0, ν=0) to (J=0, ν=1), which is a vibrational transition. So the photon's energy matches the vibrational energy difference, which is E_vib = ħ ω = 4.2e-20 J → p= 1.4e-28 N·s. Which is option D.

So perhaps the answer is D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences for rotational and vibrational transitions.

### Key Information:
1. **Molecular Parameters**:
   - Mass of X: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \)
   - Mass of Y: \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
   - Bond length: \( r = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
   - Angular frequency: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)

2. **Reduced Mass**:
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
   \]
   Converting to kilograms:
   \[
   \mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.01 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
   \]

3. **Moment of Inertia**:
   \[
   I = \mu r^2 = (3.01 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.204 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
   \]

4. **Rotational Energy**:
   The rotational energy levels are given by:
   \[
   E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{J(J+1) \hbar^2}{2I}
   \]
   For \( J = 0 \) (ground state), \( E_{\text{rot}} = 0 \). For \( J = 1 \):
   \[
   E_{\text{rot}}(J=1) = \frac{2 \hbar^2}{2I} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}
   \]
   Substituting \( \hbar \approx 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( I = 1.204 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2 \):
   \[
   E_{\text{rot}}(J=1) = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.204 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.23 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]

5. **Vibrational Energy**:
   The vibrational energy levels are given by:
   \[
   E_{\text{vib}} = (\nu + \frac{1}{2}) \hbar \omega
   \]
   The energy difference between \( \nu = 0 \) (ground state) and \( \nu = 1 \) (first excited state) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
   \]

6. **Photon Momentum**:
   The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). For the rotational transition:
   \[
   p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{9.23 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.08 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}
   \]
   For the vibrational transition:
   \[
   p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{4.22 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.41 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- The rotational transition requires \( p_{\text{rot}} \approx 3.08 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s} \), which does not match any of the given options.
- The vibrational transition requires \( p_{\text{vib}} \approx 1.41 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \), which matches **Option D**.

Since the question asks for the next state with the lowest possible energy, the vibrational transition is selected because it corresponds to the smallest energy difference among the options provided.

**Answer: D**
