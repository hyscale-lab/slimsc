--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these synthesis problems. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about synthesizing a specific compound: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. And I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents from the given options.

First, I should probably draw both the starting material and the target molecule to visualize what's happening. So, ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group attached. The target molecule has two cyclohexane rings: one is the main ring, and the other is attached via a CH2 group that has a hydroxyl group. Also, there's a carbonyl group (aldehyde) at the 1-position.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main chain is a cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde group at position 1. Attached to that same position is a cyclohexyl group, but wait, the structure is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl). So, it's a CH2 group attached to the cyclohexane ring. That CH2 has a hydroxyl group (OH) and a cyclohexyl group attached. So it's like:

Main ring: cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (position 1 is where the aldehyde is, so the aldehyde is on a CH2 maybe? No, wait, the main ring is cyclohexane with a substituent at position 1. That substituent is a CH2 group, which is connected to both a hydroxyl (OH) and a cyclohexyl group. So, the substituent is -(CH2-OH-Cyclohexyl? Wait, no, the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl. So it's -CH2-OH and a cyclohexyl group on the same carbon. So that carbon is attached to two cyclohexyls? No, wait, wait. The substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl, meaning that the substituent is a CH2 group where one H is replaced by an OH and another H is replaced by a cyclohexyl group. So that carbon has both an OH and a cyclohexyl group attached, plus being connected to the main ring.

Wait, maybe I should better visualize this. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring (let's call it ring A), and at position 1 of this ring, there's a substituent. That substituent is a CH2 group. On this CH2, one hydrogen is replaced by a hydroxyl group (OH), and another hydrogen is replaced by a cyclohexyl group (ring B). Also, on ring A, at position 1, there's an aldehyde group. Wait, no: the name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde group (-CHO) at position 1. And the substituent at position 1 is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group. Wait, that can't be right because the substituent is on the same carbon as the aldehyde. Oh, wait, no. The substituent is attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde. Wait, no. Wait, the formula would be something like:

The main ring is cyclohexane, with a substituent at position 1. That substituent is a CH2 group. On that CH2, there's a hydroxyl group (OH) and a cyclohexyl group. Also, the same carbon (position 1) has the aldehyde group. So the structure is cyclohexane with an aldehyde at C1, and that same carbon has a CH2 group attached which has OH and cyclohexyl. Hmm, that seems a bit strained, but perhaps that's the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group attached to the main ring. That CH2 has both a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group. So the main ring is cyclohexane, and the substituent is a -(CH2-OH)(cyclohexyl) group. So the structure is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a substituent at C1 that is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the substituent as being on the aldehyde carbon. Because the name is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group. Then, the substituent at the aldehyde carbon is a cyclohexyl and hydroxy group. So the aldehyde is attached to a CH2OH and a cyclohexyl.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

The main chain is cyclohexane, with an aldehyde group (-CHO) at position 1. The aldehyde group is on a CH2 group that also has a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So the structure is:

Main ring: cyclohexane.

At position 1, the substituent is a CH2 group. This CH2 is attached to the main ring and has the aldehyde group, a hydroxyl group, and a cyclohexyl group. So the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl attached to the main ring's position 1, and the aldehyde is part of that substituent? Or is the aldehyde on the main ring?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me parse the name again.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

The parent chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the aldehyde is at position 1 of the cyclohexane ring. Then, the substituent at position 1 is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group. Wait, that would imply that the carbon at position 1 has both the aldehyde group and the substituent. That's not possible because a carbon can't have four bonds if it's connected to an aldehyde (which is a CHO group, a triple bond). So perhaps I've misunderstood the structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is on the aldehyde carbon. So the aldehyde is RCHO, and R is the cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the main cyclohexane ring. So the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl attached to the aldehyde's carbon. So the aldehyde is part of a substituent.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

The main ring is cyclohexane. Attached to it is a CH2 group. This CH2 is attached to:

- The main ring.

- An aldehyde group (CHO).

- A hydroxyl group (OH).

- A cyclohexyl group.

Wait, that can't be right because a CH2 has only two H's. Oh wait, perhaps the substituent is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)-CHO. No, that's not right either. I'm getting stuck on the structure. Maybe I should think about the reaction steps and see what each reagent does.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (C≡C-) attached. So the molecule is cyclohexane with an alkyne group.

Reagents in the options involve NaNH2, methyl chloride, H2/Pd, Ba(OH)2, H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, Li in liquid NH3, O3, (CH3)2S, NH4OH, etc.

Let me think about what each reagent does.

NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. With alkynes, NaNH2 can induce elimination or perhaps as a base in other reactions. Methyl chloride is CH3Cl, which is a methylating agent. H2/Pd is hydrogenation catalyst, so it would add H2 across a triple bond, turning an alkyne into an alkane. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, possibly used for elimination, like in the formation of epoxides or for dehydrohalogenation. H2SO4 and HgSO4 in H2O are conditions for oxymercuration, which adds an OH group to an alkene in a Markovnikov fashion. O3 is ozone, used for ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl groups.

Li in liquid NH3 is a strong base, used for elimination reactions, like in the Birch reduction or for deprotonating compounds to form carbanions. O3 followed by (CH3)2S would be reductive workup, whereas NH4OH would be oxidative (giving ketones or other groups).

The target molecule has an aldehyde group and a hydroxyl group, so I'm thinking that maybe the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde, perhaps via hydrogenation and oxidation.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is the starting point. So, perhaps the triple bond is in the starting material.

Let me think about possible reaction steps.

First, perhaps we need to functionalize the triple bond. One approach is to hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkene. But wait, if we hydrogenate ethynylcyclohexane, we get cyclohexane with an ethyl group attached (allyl?), but wait no, hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and Pd would give an alkane. So ethynylcyclohexane (which is cyclohexane with C≡CH) would become cyclohexane with CH2CH3 group.

But wait, that can't be right. Let me think: ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, no. Ethynyl is C≡C-, so ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a C≡C- group attached. So it's cyclohexane with a substituent that is a terminal alkyne: -(C≡CH).

So, hydrogenation with H2 and Pd would add two hydrogens across the triple bond, turning it into a single bond. So the product would be cyclohexane with a CH2CH2 group? Wait, no, hydrogenation of a terminal alkyne (C≡CH) with H2 and Pd would give CH2CH2? No, wait, the hydrogenation of a triple bond to a single bond would give CH2CH2? No, wait, no—hydrogenation of a triple bond (alkyne) to an alkane (single bond). So, adding two H2s: C≡CH + 2 H2 → CH2CH3. But ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a C≡C-H group. So after hydrogenation, it becomes cyclohexane with a CH2CH3 group. So, cyclohexane with an ethyl group attached.

But the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group, which is attached to another cyclohexane ring. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a Grignard reaction or some kind of alkylation.

Wait, the target has two cyclohexane rings: one as the main ring, and another as a substituent. The substituent is attached to the main ring via a CH2 group which also has an OH and an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the reaction involves adding a substituent to the main ring.

Let me think about the reagents.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd; then Ba(OH)2; then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

So first step: NaNH2 (a strong base) with methyl chloride. Methyl chloride is a methylating agent. So NaNH2 is a strong base, often used to deprotonate compounds to form carbanions. For example, in alkyne chemistry, NaNH2 can deprotonate terminal alkynes to form acetylides. Then, methyl chloride would methylate something. So perhaps the first step is to form a methyl ether or a methyl ester, but with a methyl chloride and a strong base.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH2. NaNH2 would deprotonate the terminal alkyne (ethynylcyclohexane has acidic protons on the sp-hybridized carbon). Deprotonation would give the cyclohexylacetylide: cyclohexyl-C≡C^-.

Then, methyl chloride would methylate the acetylide. So the acetylide would attack CH3Cl, leading to cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. So that's 1-methylcyclohexylacetylene? So, the product after step 1 would be a substituted acetylene.

Then step 2 is H2/Pd. That would hydrogenate the triple bond into a single bond. So the product would be cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Let me think. If the starting material is cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3, hydrogenation would add two H2s, turning the triple bond into a single bond. So it becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait: cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3 → cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, because adding H2 to triple bond (C≡C) would give CH2-CH2. Wait, no: hydrogenation of triple bond (alkyne) with H2 and Pd gives an alkane. So C≡C becomes CH2CH2? No, no, each triple bond has two π bonds. Adding H2 would make each π bond into a single bond. So the triple bond (C≡C) becomes a single bond (C-C) with two Hs added. So, the structure would be CH2-CH2? No, that's not right. Wait, the molecule is cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. After hydrogenation with H2 and Pd, it becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the triple bond is converted to a single bond, so the two carbons (C≡C) become CH2-CH2.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think. The molecule is:

cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

When hydrogenated with H2 and Pd, the triple bond becomes a single bond with two additional Hs on each carbon. So the structure becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, that's impossible because the triple bond is between two carbons. So, after hydrogenation, the structure would be cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, wait, perhaps it's cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? That doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps after hydrogenation, the triple bond becomes a single bond, so the two central carbons become single-bonded with each having two H's. So the structure would be cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. Hmm, but that would be a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the product after step 2. It would be a cyclohexane ring attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to another CH2 group, which is attached to a CH3. So it's cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But wait, that's just a straight chain. Alternatively, maybe the ring is such that the substituent is a two-carbon chain.

Hmm, perhaps the product after step 2 is a cyclohexane ring with a two-carbon chain extending from it. So cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But the target molecule is more complex. It has a substituent that is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group, which is attached to a main ring that also has an aldehyde group.

So perhaps after the first two steps (methylating and hydrogenating), we get a structure that isn't the target yet. Then, step 3 is Ba(OH)2. What does Ba(OH)2 do? It's a strong base, often used for elimination reactions, like in the formation of epoxides or for dehydrohalogenation. Or maybe it's used in the oxidation of alcohols.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is also used as a base in some eliminations. Alternatively, perhaps in step 3, the compound is treated with Ba(OH)2, which could induce an elimination reaction, forming a double bond. But wait, in the target molecule, there isn't a double bond. Or perhaps it forms an epoxide?

Alternatively, maybe Ba(OH)2 is used for epoxidation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I might be mixing up reagents. For example, HgSO4 and H2SO4 in H2O are used in oxymercuration, which adds an OH group to an alkene in a Markovnikov fashion. So perhaps after an elimination to form a double bond, we could add an OH group.

Wait, but in step 4 of some options, O3 is used, which suggests ozonolysis.

Let me think about each option.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → forms cyclohexylacetylide and then methylated to form cyclohexylpropyne (maybe? Or 1-methylcyclohexylacetylene?)

Wait, original structure is ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡CH). After deprotonation with NaNH2, it's cyclohexylacetylide (cyclohexyl-C≡C^-). Then methyl chloride would methylate the acetylide, giving cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. Then step 2 is H2/Pd, which would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's a straight chain. So cyclohexyl-CH2CH2CH3? So the product after step 2 would be a cyclohexane ring with a propyl group attached.

Then step 3 is Ba(OH)2. Hmm. Maybe it's an oxidation or elimination. If Ba(OH)2 is used as a base, perhaps it deprotonates something, but in this case, the compound is a straight alkane. So maybe Ba(OH)2 is for epoxidation, but that's not applicable here because there's no double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for some kind of elimination. Wait, but the compound after step 2 is a straight alkane. So I'm not sure. Then step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. Those are oxymercuration conditions, which add an OH group to an alkene. But if there's no double bond, that wouldn't work. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are meant to form a carbonyl group. Wait, but the starting material is an alkyne, and after hydrogenation, it's a single bond. Then, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is doing something else, like oxidation.

Wait, maybe I should think about the other options.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li/liq. NH3; then O3/H2O; then NH4OH.

So first step: NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. Again, NaNH2 deprotonates the terminal alkyne to form the acetylide. Then ethyl chloride would methylate the acetylide, giving cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Then step 2 is Li in liquid NH3. Li is a strong base, perhaps for elimination. So maybe the Li would deprotonate the compound and cause elimination, forming a double bond. So cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3 → after elimination, maybe forms a cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 group? No, wait, elimination would remove two substituents and form a double bond. So perhaps the ethyl group is removed, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the Li in liquid NH3 is for a Birch reduction, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's for dehydrohalogenation, but the compound isn't a halide. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe after the first step, the acetylide is treated with ethyl chloride to form a longer chain. Then, step 2 with Li in NH3 could be a deprotonation leading to a ring expansion or forming a diradical, but I’m not clear.

Then step 3 is O3/H2O, which would cleave any double bonds formed. So perhaps the Li step forms a double bond, which is then cleaved by O3.

But the target molecule has an aldehyde group, which suggests that ozonolysis could form carbonyl groups. So perhaps a double bond is cleaved into aldehyde groups.

But I'm not sure how this would lead to the target. Let me think again.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; O3/(CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2.

Wait, step 1 is same as option A: acetylide formation and methylation. Step 2: H2 with Pd-CaCO3, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So the triple bond becomes a single bond. Then step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup (as opposed to oxidative). O3 would cleave double bonds, but if step 2 hydrogenated the triple bond into a single bond, there’s no double bond. So that doesn’t make sense.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the compound has a double bond? No, because Pd with H2 would hydrogenate any triple or double bonds into single bonds.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the steps wrong. Let me see.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; Li/liq. NH3; O3/(CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. NaNH2 is a strong base, and methanol is a methylating agent. So perhaps the acetylide is formed and then quenched with methanol. Wait, but that might form an ether. Alternatively, maybe this is a Gilmann reagent preparation, where the acetylide is treated with a methyl halide. Wait, but the option says methanol, not methyl chloride. Hmm, perhaps it's a quenching step.

Wait, maybe the first step is to deprotonate the ethynyl group to form the acetylide, then treat with methanol. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, NaNH2 in methanol might be a way to form a methyl ether or something else. I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to make the acetylide, then treat it with something else.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by thinking about what functional groups are needed in the target and how to form them.

The target has an aldehyde group and a hydroxyl group. So, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde via some oxidation.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne. To form an aldehyde, we can perform a hydration reaction. For example, the alkyne can be converted into an enol, then oxidized to a ketone, but that's more for internal alkynes.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted to a carbonyl group via some method. Ozonolysis of an alkyne would give two carbonyl groups, but that requires breaking the triple bond, which might not be the case here.

Wait, another approach: considering the steps in the options, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a diketone, then reducing it, or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to form a Grignard reagent. Wait, but Grignard reagents are usually formed from alkyl halides, not alkynes.

Wait, another thought: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2 group which also has an OH and an aldehyde. So perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to the main ring. Additionally, that CH2 has an OH and an aldehyde. Wait, that doesn't seem possible because a carbon can't have four bonds. Oh wait, perhaps the substituent is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)-CHO.

Wait, wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group which has both an OH and a cyclohexyl group attached to it. Then, that CH2 is attached to the main ring, which has an aldehyde group at the same position. So the substituent is -(CH2OH)(cyclohexyl)-CHO. Hmm, but that would require the substituent to have three groups attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde. That might be a problem because the aldehyde is a carbonyl group, which is a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group attached to the main ring. That CH2 has an OH group and a cyclohexyl group. So the substituent is -(CH2OH)(cyclohexyl)-, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2 group, which also has an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group. But that carbon would have four substituents: two cyclohexyls (if any), the main ring, the aldehyde, and the OH. That's impossible.

So perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Maybe the aldehyde is on a side chain attached to the main ring. Let me try to think differently.

Another approach: the target molecule has a substituent at position 1 of the cyclohexane ring. That substituent is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group, and the substituent is attached to a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group, which has both a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group. And the main ring has an aldehyde group at position 1. So the substituent and the aldehyde are on the same carbon of the main ring. Wait, that would make the substituent and the aldehyde both on the same carbon. So the structure would be:

The main ring is cyclohexane, with a substituent at position 1. The substituent is a CH2 group attached to the main ring. That CH2 has an aldehyde group (CHO), a hydroxyl group (OH), and a cyclohexyl group. Wait, that would require the CH2 to have four bonds, which is impossible. So perhaps the substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group, but that would require a chiral center with three substituents plus the main ring.

I'm getting stuck on the structure, so perhaps I should think about the reaction steps and see which option leads to the formation of the necessary functional groups.

The target has an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group. So, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group. One way to do that is through ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds into carbonyls. But the starting material is an alkyne, not an alkene. So perhaps the alkyne is first converted into an alkene, which is then ozonolyzed.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a trans-alkene, then ozonolyzed to form carbonyl groups.

Wait, let's think about that. Starting with ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡CH), step 1 could be hydrogenation to cyclohexane-CH2CH2. Wait, no, hydrogenation of the alkyne would give cyclohexane with a CH2CH3 group. So the product would be cyclohexyl-ethane.

But the target requires a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2 group, which has an OH and an aldehyde. So maybe the ethyl group is oxidized to a carbonyl.

Wait, but cyclohexyl-ethane would have a CH2CH3 group. Oxidation could turn the CH2CH3 into aCHO group, but that's not straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the ethyl group is converted into a double bond, then ozonized.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to an alkene, then ozonized. Let me think.

If step 1 is hydrogenation of the alkyne to an alkene, but wait, that's not possible because hydrogenation of a triple bond with H2 and a catalyst (like Lindlar's catalyst) would typically give cis alkene, but in the presence of a poison like quinoline, it gives trans. But hydrogenation with H2 and Pd would give the alkane. Wait, no, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol ether, then cleaved.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at option D: steps are NaNH2, methanol; Li/liq. NH3; O3/(CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. NaNH2 is a strong base, so it would deprotonate the alkyne to form the acetylide. Then, methanol would perhaps quench the acetylide, leading to an ethereal oxygen? Or maybe the acetylide reacts with methanol in a substitution reaction. Wait, the acetylide is a strong base, so maybe it deprotonates methanol, forming MeO^- and the cyclohexylacetylene. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the methanol is used to form a methyl ether. But I'm not certain.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. Li is a strong reducing agent, often used in Birch reductions, but in this context, maybe it's used for elimination. For example, if the compound has a good leaving group, Li could facilitate an elimination, forming a double bond.

Then step 3: O3/(CH3)2S. Ozone would cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if a double bond were formed in step 2, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls.

Then step 4: NH4OH. That's aqueous ammonium hydroxide, perhaps for workup or acid-catalyzed reactions, like in the formation of alcohols from ozonides.

Hmm, putting it all together:

Starting material: ethynylcyclohexane → step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe form the acetylide and then quench it with methanol. Then step 2: Li in NH3, perhaps eliminating to form a double bond. Then ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups, and then step 4 would work up to form alcohols or other groups.

But I'm not sure how this leads to the target molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence involves forming an epoxide, then opening it to form an alcohol and a carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2 group which has an OH and an aldehyde. So perhaps the structure is a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group at position 1 and a substituent which is a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexyl group and an OH.

So, the substituent is -(CH2-OH-cyclohexyl). Hmm, but that's a bit unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2 group which also has an OH group. And the main ring has an aldehyde group at the same position.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2-OH group to the main ring, and the main ring also has an aldehyde group at that position. So the structure would be main ring (cyclohexane) with a substituent at position 1: -(CH2-OH-cyclohexyl), and that carbon is also the aldehyde group. But again, that seems impossible because that carbon would have four bonds.

I think I'm stuck on visualizing the target structure, so perhaps I should focus more on the reagents and what they do.

The target has an aldehyde group and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon, which suggests that maybe an oxidation step is involved. For example, an alcohol is oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a diol, then oxidizing one of the OH groups to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone or aldehyde via some oxidation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the starting alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group by adding water across the triple bond. For example, hydration of an alkyne can give a ketone (for internal alkynes) or an aldehyde (for terminal alkynes). So, if ethynylcyclohexane (a terminal alkyne) is treated with a suitable reagent, it could form cyclohexylacetaldehyde (an aldehyde group).

Wait, but how? The hydration of a terminal alkyne typically requires specific conditions. For example, using HgSO4 and H2SO4 (hydration) would convert a terminal alkyne into a ketone, not an aldehyde. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, the oxymercuration of an alkyne would add an OH group in a Markovnikov fashion. But for alkynes, the hydration could lead to a ketone or an aldehyde, depending on the conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps using O3 and then a reductive workup would cleave the alkyne into two carbonyl groups. But that requires the alkyne to be in a position that allows for cleavage.

Wait, if the alkyne is ethynylcyclohexane, ozonolysis would break the triple bond into two carbonyl groups, but since it's a terminal alkyne, ozonolysis would give a single carbonyl group and a hydrogen. So, ozonolysis of ethynylcyclohexane would give cyclohexane with a formyl group (CHO) attached. So, the product would be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

But wait, the target molecule is more complex, so perhaps this is part of the process.

So, let's think: step 1, ozonolysis of the alkyne gives cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Then, perhaps the next steps involve adding a substituent.

But looking at the options, the first reagent in option C is NaNH2 and methyl chloride, then hydrogenation, then ozonolysis. So perhaps the steps involve forming a longer chain, then cleaving it.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Convert the alkyne into an aldehyde.

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is C. Let me think about it.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → forms the acetylide and methylates it, giving cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenates the triple bond to CH2CH2, so the product is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no. Wait, hydrogenation of C≡C-CH3 with H2 and Pd would give CH2-CH2-CH3. So cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Then, step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis. But wait, the compound after step 2 is a straight chain without any double bonds. So ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So this doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is B.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → forms cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li in liq. NH3 → perhaps eliminates to form a double bond. So cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3 → cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, elimination would require removing a substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the Li in NH3 is for deprotonation and elimination, forming a triple bond again. Not sure.

3. O3/H2O → then cleaves any double bonds to carbonyls.

4. NH4OH → perhaps for workup, forming alcohols.

Wait, but the target has both an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group. So maybe after ozonolysis and workup, you get two aldehyde groups, and one is further modified.

But I'm not making progress. Let me try to think about what each reagent does in the options.

Looking for a sequence that forms the aldehyde and the hydroxyl group. So, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group, and another group is added with a hydroxyl.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via hydration, then the carbonyl is reduced to an alcohol, and then oxidized back to an aldehyde. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkene, then the alkene is epoxidized, then the epoxide is opened to form an alcohol and another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkane, then oxidized to form an alcohol, which is further oxidized to a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, let me think about each option again.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → forms cyclohexylpropyne (C≡C-CH3).

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenates to cyclohexylpropane.

3. Ba(OH)2 → maybe elimination to form a double bond.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → oxymercuration.

But after step 4, we would have an OH group added, but I'm not sure how that leads to the target.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → cyclohexylbutyne.

2. Li in NH3 → perhaps elimination to form a double bond.

3. O3, H2O → cleave the double bond into carbonyls.

4. NH4OH → workup.

So, if step 2 forms a double bond, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. So, perhaps the starting alkyne is converted into a longer chain, then a double bond is introduced, which is then cleaved into carbonyls.

But the target has both a hydroxyl and an aldehyde group, so perhaps one of the carbonyls is a ketone and the other is an aldehyde. But I'm not sure.

Option C:

After step 2, you have a propane chain attached to the main ring. Then ozonolysis would break that into two carbonyls. But the compound after step 2 is a single bond, so no double bond for ozonolysis.

Wait, that can't be right. So perhaps option C is not correct.

Option D:

Steps: NaNH2, methanol; Li in NH3; O3/(CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe the acetylide is formed and then quenched with methanol. That would give cyclohexylmethanol? Not sure.

Step 2: Li in NH3. Maybe elimination to form a double bond.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into carbonyls.

Step 4: NH4OH. Workup, perhaps hydrolyzing ozonides into carbonyls.

But I'm not sure.

Another approach: perhaps the correct sequence is to first form a Grignard reagent, then perform a coupling, but that's not in the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Convert the alkyne to an aldehyde via hydration.

But how? Using HgSO4 and H2SO4 in H2O (option A's step 4) could hydrate the alkyne to a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, a terminal alkyne. Hydration of a terminal alkyne typically yields a ketone, but maybe under certain conditions it can yield an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps using O3 followed by reductive workup would give two aldehyde groups.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne, so ozonolysis would produce a single aldehyde group and a hydrogen. So, ozonolysis would convert the triple bond into a carbonyl group. So, after ozonolysis and reductive workup, we would get cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

But the target has more substituents, so maybe after that, we need to add a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Acetylide formation and alkylation.

2. Hydrogenation to a single bond.

3. Oxidation to form a carbonyl group.

4. Addition of a hydroxyl group.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at option C, step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S. That suggests reductive ozonolysis, which would break the double bond into aldehydes without further oxidation.

So, if after step 2 (hydrogenation), the compound has a double bond, that would make sense.

Wait, no, because step 2 is hydrogenation, which would saturate any double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation of a different functional group.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the correct reagents for each functional group.

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2 group, which has an OH and an aldehyde.

So, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group with both an OH and a cyclohexyl group attached, and the main ring has an aldehyde.

So, the substituent is -(CH2OH)(cyclohexyl)-CHO. Hmm, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2 group, which also has an OH group. And the main ring has an aldehyde group at the same position.

So, how can we form such a structure?

Perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, which is then subjected to some kind of alkylation or hydroxylation.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Maybe I should consider each option's steps and see which leads to the target.

Option C:

Steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: acetylide → methylated to cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenates triple bond to single bond → cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S: reductive ozonolysis. But the compound after step 2 has no double bond, so ozonolysis won't do anything. So this is incorrect.

Option D:

Steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol: acetylide forms, then quenched with methanol → maybe forms cyclohexylmethanol.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step forms the acetylide, which is then treated with methanol to form an ether. But I'm not certain.

Step 2: Li in NH3 → maybe eliminates a molecule, forming a double bond.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S → cleaves the double bond into carbonyls.

Step 4: NH4OH → hydrolyzes any ozonides.

But I'm not sure how this leads to the target.

Option B:

Steps:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li in NH3 → perhaps elimination to form a double bond: cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, perhaps forms cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond somewhere. Not sure.

3. O3, H2O → cleaves the double bond into carbonyls.

4. NH4OH → workup.

But the target has an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group. Maybe the workup from ozonolysis gives aldehydes and the NH4OH adds hydroxyl groups.

Wait, another thought: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2 group that also has an OH. So perhaps the cyclohexyl group is introduced via alkylation.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Use NaNH2 and methyl chloride to form a methyl-substituted acetylide.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making a longer chain.

3. Use Ba(OH)2 to eliminate and form a double bond.

4. Oxymercuration to add an OH group in a Markovnikov fashion.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: think about the formation of a diol from an epoxide. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C.

Wait, in option C, after step 2, the compound is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then, step 3 is ozonolysis, but that's on a single bond. So that can't be right.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing the point. The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2 group, which also has an OH and an aldehyde. So, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2 group, which also has an OH and an aldehyde.

Wait, maybe that's impossible, so perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to the main ring. Additionally, that CH2 has an OH group, and the main ring has an aldehyde group.

So, the substituent is -(CH2-OH-cyclohexyl), and the main ring has an aldehyde. Thus, the main ring's substituent is a CH2 group with an OH and a cyclohexyl group.

So, the substituent is -(CH2-OH)(cyclohexyl)-.

So, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a CH2 group attached to both the main ring and a cyclohexyl group, and also introducing an OH and an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis involves:

1. Forming a new carbon-carbon bond between the main ring and another cyclohexyl group via alkylation.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, which is then subjected to a Corey-Fuchs reaction or some other method to add a substituent.

But I'm stuck.

Given the time I've spent and the uncertainty, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the reagents.

The target requires an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group. Ozone and reductive workup can form carbonyl groups. Hydrogenation can saturate triple bonds.

Looking at option D:

Steps: NaNH2, methanol; Li/liq. NH3; O3/(CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Perhaps the first step forms the acetylide and then does something else. The second step might form a double bond via elimination. Then ozonolysis cleaves the double bond into carbonyls, and the final step hydrolyzes to form aldehydes and alcohols.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct. Let me look at option C again.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → but no double bond, so nothing happens here.

Thus, option C can't be correct.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → cyclohexylpropyne.

2. H2/Pd → cyclohexylpropane.

3. Ba(OH)2 → perhaps elimination to form a double bond.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → oxymercuration.

If step 3 forms a double bond, then step 4 adds an OH group.

So, after step 4, perhaps the product has an OH group and an aldehyde.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, if after step 3, a double bond is formed, then step 4 (oxymercuration) would add an OH group to the more substituted carbon (Markovnikov addition). Then, perhaps one of the carbons becomes an aldehyde.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe after step 3, the compound is cyclohexylpropane with a double bond. Then, oxymercuration adds an OH group. But I'm not sure how that leads to the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, I'm really stuck. Based on the reagents, the correct sequence likely involves forming an aldehyde via ozonolysis and then adding a hydroxyl group.

Hmm.

Another approach: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2 group which also has an OH. So perhaps the substituent is formed via a nucleophilic substitution or alkylation.

Wait, if the compound after some steps has a good leaving group, like a bromide, then perhaps an SN2 reaction with a cyclohexyl group could add the substituent.

But I don't see any reagents in the options that would introduce a leaving group like Br.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination, forming a double bond, which is then epoxidized and then opened to form a diol.

But I'm not making progress.

Given the time I've spent, I'll make a guess. The correct answer is option C.


The problem involves synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group at position 1 and a substituent at the same position. This substituent is a CH2 group attached to both a hydroxyl group (OH) and a cyclohexyl group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: The terminal alkyne in ethynylcyclohexane is deprotonated to form an acetylide, which is then methylated to yield cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.
2. **H2/Pd**: Hydrogenation of the triple bond converts the alkyne into a single bond, resulting in cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.
3. **Ba(OH)2**: This strong base could induce elimination, potentially forming a double bond. However, the product after step 2 is a saturated compound, so elimination is unlikely.
4. **H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**: These reagents are used for oxymercuration, which adds an OH group to a double bond in a Markovnikov fashion. Since there is no double bond after step 3, this step does not contribute to the synthesis.

This sequence does not lead to the target molecule.

---

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH2, ethyl chloride**: The terminal alkyne is deprotonated and ethylated to form cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: Lithium in liquid ammonia is a strong base, often used for elimination. This step could remove a substituent and form a double bond, resulting in cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond.
3. **O3/H2O**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. This step would break the double bond formed in step 2, producing carbonyl compounds.
4. **NH4OH**: This step likely hydrolyzes ozonides to form aldehydes or ketones.

While this sequence involves functionalizing the alkyne and forming carbonyl groups, it does not clearly lead to the target molecule with the specific substituent structure.

---

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: The terminal alkyne is deprotonated and methylated to form cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.
2. **H2/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenation of the triple bond converts the alkyne into a single bond, yielding cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.
3. **O3/(CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis with a reductive workup cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. However, the compound after step 2 is saturated, so this step does not contribute to the synthesis.
4. **Ba(OH)2**: This strong base could induce elimination or oxidation, but its role in this sequence is unclear.

This sequence does not lead to the target molecule.

---

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH2, methanol**: The terminal alkyne is deprotonated to form an acetylide, which is then quenched with methanol. This step might form a methyl ether or a different intermediate.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: Lithium in liquid ammonia is a strong base, potentially inducing elimination to form a double bond.
3. **O3/(CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis with a reductive workup cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. If a double bond is formed in step 2, this step would produce carbonyl compounds.
4. **NH4OH**: This step likely hydrolyzes ozonides to form aldehydes or alcohols.

While this sequence involves functionalizing the alkyne and forming carbonyl groups, it does not clearly lead to the target molecule with the specific substituent structure.

---

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences clearly leads to the target molecule. However, based on the reagents and the reasoning provided, **Option C** appears to be the most plausible, as it involves steps that could potentially form the necessary functional groups, even though the reasoning is incomplete.
