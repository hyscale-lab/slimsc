Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Hmm, I remember that these are high-resolution spectrographs on big telescopes. ESPRESSO is on the Paranal Observatory, which has the VLT in Chile, and HIRES is at Keck Observatory in Hawaii. 

The question gives me five stars, Star1 to Star5, each with different properties. I need to figure out which ones are observable by both instruments. The key points given are their apparent V magnitudes and absolute V magnitudes, distances, and some have extinction (E(B-V)) which affects their observed brightness.

Wait, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. So that's more than 17? Or brighter than 17? Wait, magnitude scale is a bit tricky. Brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So if a star's apparent magnitude is less than 17, it's brighter than 17, meaning it can be observed. Because if a star is 17th magnitude, it's at the limit. So for ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 (so V mag <17) can be observed. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so V mag <16.

So the task is to compute each star's apparent V magnitude, considering any extinction (dust reddening) if present, and see if it's below 17 for ESPRESSO and below 16 for HIRES. Only the stars that are observable by both will be the correct answer.

Let me process each star one by one.

Star1: Absolute V mag is 15.5, distance is 10 pc. So apparent V = absolute mag + distance modulus. Distance modulus is 5 log10(d) - 5. d=10, so 5*1 -5=0. So apparent V is 15.5 + 0 =15.5 mag. No extinction mentioned, so E(B-V)=0. So apparent V is 15.5. Check both instruments: 15.5 <17 (ESPRESSO can see it), 15.5 <16 (HIRES can see it). So Star1 is detectable by both.

Wait, but wait! Wait the question says that Star1's absolute magnitude is 15.5 and it's located at 10 pc. So apparent V is 15.5 (since 10 pc is the zero point for distance modulus). So yes, that's correct.

Star2: Apparent V mag is 16.5. So for HIRES, which can observe V mag up to 16, 16.5 is above that. So HIRES can't observe it. But for ESPRESSO, 16.5 is brighter than 17? No, wait, 16.5 is less than17. Wait, ESPRESSO can observe up to V=17. So 16.5 is within the limit. So Star2 can be observed by ESPRESSO but not by HIRES. Therefore, Star2 isn't a candidate for both.

Star3: Apparent V mag is 15.5, but wait, it has an E(B-V)=0.6. So there's extinction. The formula given is the total absorption in V is E(B-V) multiplied by 3.1. So extinction in V band is 0.6 *3.1 = 1.86 mag. So the observed apparent V magnitude would be the intrinsic (without extinction) V plus extinction. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the star's apparent magnitude is measured through the interstellar medium, so the observed apparent V is the actual V plus extinction. But wait, the apparent V given, 15.5, is that the observed (corrected) magnitude or the intrinsic? Wait, the way the problem is stated: Star3's apparent V mag is 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So the actual extinction would make the star appear fainter. Wait, the problem says that the apparent V is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6. Wait, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The apparent magnitude is the observed value, including extinction. But sometimes when stars are reported, their magnitudes are given as corrected. But in this case, the question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag". Wait, no, the question says for Star3: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag". Hmm, that's a bit conflicting. Because if E(B-V) is given, that suggests that the observed V magnitude is affected by extinction.

Wait, perhaps the apparent V given is the observed magnitude, so the intrinsic magnitude (without extinction) would be brighter. But the way it's written, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the extinction-corrected value. Hmm, that's a confusion point.

Wait, the problem says: "For the sake of simplicity, let's disregard the pointing limits of the telescopes (such as maximum and minimum elevations) as well as the altitudes of the telescopes."

So, for Star3, it's given as apparent V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, and located at 15 pc. Now, the total absorption in V is E(B-V)*3.1. So 0.6 *3.1 is 1.86 mag. So the star's light is dimmed by 1.86 mag due to extinction.

Wait, but if the apparent V is 15.5, that's the observed (extincted) magnitude. So the intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction) would have been brighter. So the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is the actual value. So with that, for the purpose of detection, the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5.

Wait, no, wait. Because when we have extinction, the observed apparent magnitude is larger (dimmer) than the true value. So the actual apparent magnitude without extinction would be 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64. But wait, the 'apparent V' given is the observed magnitude, so it's 15.5. So when calculating whether the star is detectable, we have to use the observed apparent magnitude.

Wait, but wait, the star's observed apparent magnitude is 15.5. So, for ESPRESSO, which can go up to 17, 15.5 is okay (brighter than 17). For HIRES, which can go up to 16, 15.5 is also okay. So Star3 is detectable by both.

Wait, but wait. Let's re-express this. The apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is what's observed. So the star is not affected by extinction beyond that.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The star has an intrinsic absolute magnitude, but the observed apparent magnitude is affected by distance and extinction.

Alternatively, perhaps the apparent magnitude given is the uncorrected value, and we have to calculate the extinction to find the observed magnitude.

Wait, the problem states for Star3: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag". So E(B-V) is the color excess, which is the difference between the observed (B-V) and the intrinsic (B-V). The total extinction in V band is A_V = E(B-V) * 3.1 = 0.6 *3.1 = 1.86 mag. Therefore, the observed apparent magnitude in V is m = M + distance modulus + A_V. Wait, but wait, the distance modulus is 5 log (d/10) where d is distance in parsecs.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula for apparent magnitude is: m = M + 5 log10 (d)  - 5 + A_V.

So for Star3, M is absolute magnitude, which is the apparent mag at 10 pc (without extinction). Wait, no, M is the absolute magnitude, which is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc, without any extinction.

Wait, for Star3, it's located at 15 pc, E(B-V)=0.6.

So m = M + 5 log10(15) -5 + A_V.

Wait, but what's M? The problem says Star3's absolute V magnitude is 15.5. So M =15.5.

So m = 15.5 + (5 log10(15) -5) ) + A_V.

Compute each part:

log10(15) ≈ 1.176.

So 5 * 1.176 ≈ 5.88.

5 log10(15) -5 =5.88 -5=0.88.

A_V = 0.6 *3.1=1.86.

So m =15.5 + 0.88 +1.86 =15.5 +2.74 =18.24.

Wait, so the apparent magnitude is m=18.24. But the problem says Star3's apparent V mag is 15.5. Hmm, that's a conflict.

Wait, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the one before correcting for extinction. So the observed (apparent) magnitude is m_obs = m_intrinsic + A_V.

But in the problem statement, for each star, the given is apparent V mag, which includes extinction. So, when the problem says Star3 has apparent V mag 15.5, that's the observed value, which is m_obs = 15.5. So the actual intrinsic apparent magnitude is m_intrinsic = m_obs - A_V = 15.5 -1.86=13.64.

But wait, for detection purposes, what matters is the observed apparent magnitude. Because the spectrograph's limit is based on observed V magnitude.

So, for Star3, the observed apparent V is 15.5. So for ESPRESSO, which can go up to 17, that's fine. For HIRES, up to 16, so 15.5 is okay. So Star3 is observable by both.

Wait, but according to the calculation I did earlier, without considering the given apparent magnitude, I get m=18.24. So I'm confused here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me re-express this.

The problem states each star's properties. For Star3, it says: apparent V mag of 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, located at 15 pc.

Wait, the apparent V magnitude is the observed value, already including the effects of extinction and distance. So the observed m is 15.5, so that's what to use for the instrument limits.

Because when a star is observed, the apparent magnitude is the observed brightness, which includes all effects like distance and extinction. So for this problem, the given apparent V magnitudes are the observed values, so we don't need to compute them again. Therefore, for Star3, the observed V mag is 15.5, which is within both ESPRESSO and HIRES limits.

Wait, but wait, no. Because
