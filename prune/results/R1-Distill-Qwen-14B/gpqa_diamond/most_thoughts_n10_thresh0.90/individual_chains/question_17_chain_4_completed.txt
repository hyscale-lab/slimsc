Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Let me try to figure it out. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through step by step.

The question says: What's the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex? The pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant K_Ca-EDTA is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The Ca-EDTA complex would dissociate in solution, right? So the complex is CaY²- maybe? Or something like that. The formation constant, K, is a measure of how strong the complex is. A high K means the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much.

So the problem is about finding the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in solution. Because the complex dissociates a little, but since K is so large, maybe it's almost completely dissociated? Or wait, no, wait. Wait, when the formation constant is large, that means the complex is stable, so it doesn't dissociate much. So the concentration of free Ca²+ would be really low.

Wait, wait, I should probably write down the equation for the dissociation. The complex is CaY²- which dissociates into Ca²+ and Y⁴- (EDTA^4-). So the reaction is:

CaY²- ⇌ Ca²+ + Y⁴-

The formation constant K for this reaction would be [Ca²+][Y⁴-]/[CaY²-]. Wait, no, wait. Formation constants can be a bit confusing. Because the formation of the complex is the reverse of this. So the formation reaction is Ca²+ + Y⁴- ⇌ CaY²-, and the formation constant K would be [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y⁴-]).

Given that K is 5x10^10, which is a very large number. So the complex is highly favored, meaning that most of the Ca is in the complex form, and little is free. So the concentration of free Ca²+ should be very low, much lower than 0.02 M.

But wait, the solution given is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of CaY²- is 0.02 M. Then, when it dissociates a little, some Ca²+ and Y⁴- are formed. Let me let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. So, at equilibrium:

[CaY²-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small)
[Ca²+] = x
[Y⁴-] = x

So the expression for K is (x)(x)/(0.02) = K =5e10.

Wait, wait, no. Because K is [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y⁴-]) = 5e10. So:

5e10 = (0.02 - x) / (x^2)

Since x is very small compared to 0.02, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So approximate equation:

5e10 ≈ 0.02 / x^2 → x^2 ≈ 0.02 / (5e10) → x^2 = 2e-13 → x ≈ sqrt(2e-13) → approx.

Wait, sqrt(2) is about 1.414, so sqrt(2e-13) is approximately 1.414e-6.5? Wait, because 1e-13's square root is 1e-6.5, which is about 3.16e-7. So 1.414 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 4.47e-7. Hmm, but wait, let's compute it more accurately.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5e12) = 4e-13. So x^2 = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 → 2e-6.5 is 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, that's about 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7. So that's the concentration of Ca²+.

Let me double-check. Oh wait, wait! Wait a minute. Wait, I think I might have mixed up the formation constant. Because some sources define the formation constant as Kf = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y⁴-]). So yes, I did it right.

So the calculation seems correct. So the free Ca²+ is about 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we start by considering the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant is given as \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \), and the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let \( x \) represent the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions at equilibrium. The equilibrium concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CaY}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{Y}^{4-}] = x
\]

The formation constant expression is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}
\]

Substituting the equilibrium concentrations:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
