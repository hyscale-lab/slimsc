Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking. So, two stars, star_1 and star_2. The iron atoms in their photospheres are being studied. It says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to those in star_2. Oh, and the energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. The question is about finding the correct equation relating their effective temperatures T1 and T2, assuming LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium).

Wait, LTE means that each small region of the star's photosphere is in thermal equilibrium, right? So we can use the Boltzmann distribution here for the energy levels.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the populations (n) of two energy levels is given by (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, and g are the statistical weights.

In this problem, the energy difference ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. But wait, the energy levels for iron atoms, I'm not sure about their statistical weights. However, the question states that the excitation is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So, n1/n2 = 2.

Wait, but actually, the problem states that the number of excited atoms is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. So, the ratio (n_upper/n_lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Or wait, no—wait, does it mean that the fraction of excited atoms is twice as high in star_1? Or is the number of excited atoms per atom higher?

Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Hmm. So, I think it means that the population of the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So (n1_upper) = 2 * (n2_upper), given the same lower state. Or maybe it's the ratio n_upper/n_lower for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Or maybe it's the ratio of the number of excited atoms in star_1 to that in star_2 is 2, but I'm not entirely certain. Let me re-read the question.

The exact wording is: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2."

Hmm, "twice as excited"—I think that refers to the population of the excited state. So, the number of atoms in the excited state (n_upper) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. But wait, without knowing the statistical weights, perhaps the problem assumes that the ground state is much more populated, but maybe it's using the ratio of the excited state to the ground state.

Wait, but maybe the problem is considering the ratio (n_upper/n_lower) for each star. So for star_1, (n_upper/n_lower) = 2 * (n_upper' /
