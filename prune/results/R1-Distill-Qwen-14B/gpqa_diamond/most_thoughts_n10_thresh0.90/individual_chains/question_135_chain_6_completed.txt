Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay. Let me see if I can figure it out. The question is about the bosonic field X and its possible decay products. The Lagrangian interaction is given, and some options are provided. Hmm.

First, the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I remember that when a particle decays, the mass of the parent must be at least twice the mass of the child particles because energy and momentum have to be conserved. Oh right, the rest mass energy must be sufficient for the production of the decay products.

So, looking at the decay possibilities, X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. Let's consider each option and see which decay products are kinematically allowed.

Looking at the given Lagrangian: L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit confused about that. Oh, right, the interaction term involves X coupling to fermions. The structure looks like a Yukawa coupling, where the boson X is interacting with fermions f. So the decay X → f f̄ would happen via this interaction term.

But wait, the problem is about kinematical allowability, not about whether the decay is actually possible due to the interaction. So the interaction tells us which fermions X can decay into, but the mass of X determines which of those are kinematically allowed.

So the boson X can decay into any fermion pair as long as the sum of their masses is less than or equal to X's mass. So the fermions must have a mass less than or equal to 6 GeV / 2 = 3 GeV each. Because each fermion would get some energy, but the minimum mass is the rest mass. So each fermion's mass must be less than 3 GeV. 

Wait, but the fermion masses vary. Let me think: the known fermion masses, in GeV. Let's list them.

Leptons: electrons are about 0.0005 GeV, muon ~0.105, tau ~1.777. So all of them are below 3 GeV.

Quarks: up and down are light, around a few MeV each, so way below 3. Then strange is about 100 MeV (0.1 GeV), which is still below. Charm is about 1.5 GeV, which is under 3. Bottom is about 4.5 GeV—wait, no, I think bottom is around 4.7 GeV. Wait, so bottom quarks are heavier than 3 GeV. Because 4.7 is greater than 3, right? So if the X is 6 GeV, can it decay into a b b̄ pair? Each b is 4.7 GeV. Wait, 4.7 * 2 is 9.4, which is way higher than X's mass of 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄ because that would require X mass to be at least 9.4 GeV.

Same for top quarks—X is 6 GeV, top is 173 GeV. So that's way too heavy. So any fermion with mass over 3 GeV can't be a decay product.

So let's see, which fermions are allowed.

Leptons: e, mu, tau. Their masses are all way under 3 GeV. So X can decay into e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-.

Quarks: u, d, s, c. Let's see their masses. u and d are about a few MeV—so their rest masses are negligible. So X can decay into u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄.

But wait, can X decay into c c̄? Charm quark is about 1.27 GeV, so 2 * 1.27 is 2.54 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV, so yes. But what about bottom? As I mentioned, 4.7 GeV each, so 9.4 needed—so no.

So the allowed fermions are: e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

So possible decay channels are X → e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄. 

Wait, but looking at the options.

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau−, e+ e−. So includes b b̄ which is impossible. So A is wrong.

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−. So all allowed, except no b. That looks correct. But wait, let's check the options.

Option C includes c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, t t̄, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−. But t is too heavy (173 GeV), so C is incorrect.

Option D: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−. Again, includes b which is impossible.

So the correct decay channels are all the light fermions (including c quark) and the leptons. So looking at the options, only option B includes these possibilities: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So B is correct.

Wait, let me double-check the fermion masses. Bottom is about 4.7 GeV—so 2 * 4.7 is 9.4. X is only 6 GeV, so no. So B is the right answer because it includes all allowed fermions except the b and t, which are too heavy. So option B's list includes c, s, u, d (quarks), and tau, mu, e (leptons). So yes, correct.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. For a particle to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair \( f\bar{f} \), the rest mass of the fermion \( f \) must be less than or equal to half the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This ensures energy and momentum conservation.

The known masses of fermions are as follows:
- **Leptons**: \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV}, \, m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV}, \, m_\tau \approx 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \) (all below 3 GeV).
- **Quarks**: \( m_u, m_d \approx \text{a few MeV} \) (negligible), \( m_s \approx 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \), \( m_c \approx 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \), \( m_b \approx 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \), \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \).

From this, the fermions with masses below 3 GeV are:
- **Leptons**: \( e, \mu, \tau \).
- **Quarks**: \( u, d, s, c \).

Thus, the boson \( X \) can decay into the following fermion-antifermion pairs: \( e^+e^-, \mu^+\mu^-, \tau^+\tau^-, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, s\bar{s}, c\bar{c} \). Decays into \( b\bar{b} \) or \( t\bar{t} \) are kinematically forbidden because their masses exceed 3 GeV.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is forbidden. Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is forbidden. Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is forbidden. Incorrect.

The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decay channels for \( X \).

Answer: B
