Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure out which stars are observable by both.

First, let me understand the instruments. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17. HIRES can observe brighter than 16 mag. So, the stars have to be bright enough for both. But wait, actually, noâ€”because each has their own brightness limits. So a star that's brighter than 17 would definitely be brighter than 16, so it would be observable by both. But wait, no, because HIRES can go down to 16, which is brighter than 17. So for ESPRESSO, only stars with V mag <=17 can be observed, and HIRES can do up to 16. So the stars must be brighter than 16 in V mag for HIRES, but since ESPRESSO can go up to 17, that means the star needs to be brighter than 16 V mag. Because HIRES can't go beyond 16. So the stars that are brighter than 16 V mag can be seen by both.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17. So that's V magnitude less than 17, right? Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17, it's magnitude is less than 17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so magnitude less than 16.

Wait, no, wait. The question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" by ESPRESSO. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Because in astronomy, a magnitude of 17 is fainter than 16. So if the star is brighter than 17, that would mean V mag <=17. Because brighter stars have lower magnitudes.

Wait, no. Wait, the terminology is tricky. The higher the magnitude, the fainter the star. So when the question says, "brighter than 17 mag", that means the apparent magnitude is less than 17, because lower numbers mean brighter. So for ESPRESSO
