Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The problem mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Then, the radial velocities are given as 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The astronomers assume the stars radiate as black bodies and computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a certain factor. The options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

Hmm, wait. So the first thing I should consider is what determines the luminosity of a star. I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R² multiplied by the fourth power of the temperature.

The problem says the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. Oh, right, the wavelength where a black body radiates most intensely is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. Since the λ_max is the same for both stars, that must mean their temperatures are the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature, if λ_max is same, T is same. So, T_1 = T_2.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. Radial velocity is the velocity along our line of sight. The radial velocity would affect the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Oh, right, that's important. So the observed wavelength (the one we measure) would be different from the emitted wavelength.

Wait, but the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. Does that mean the observed λ_max is the same for both? Or does it mean the emitted wavelengths are the same? Let me think. Since the question says the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, I think that refers to the observed wavelengths. So the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. But the emitted λ_max depends on the star's temperature. But the observed λ_max would be shifted due to their velocities.

So because Star_1 has radial velocity v1 =0, its observed λ_max is the same as the emitted λ_max. But Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Wait, but is it moving towards or away from us? Because radial velocity can be positive (moving away) or negative (moving towards). Since the problem says Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s, but the sign isn't specified. But in any case, the Doppler shift will change the observed wavelength.

Wait, but the problem states that the λ_max for both is the same. So the observed λ_max is the same. But their intrinsic λ_max (emitted) would be different because of their velocities. So I need to calculate the intrinsic temperatures considering the Doppler shift.

Wait, let's think again. The observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So the Doppler effect must have shifted their respective emitted λ_max to the same observed value. Therefore, we can relate their emitted temperatures using the Doppler formula.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is: λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), but wait, that's an approximation. Alternatively, for non-relativistic speeds, the Doppler shift is approximately λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r / c ), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, that's a linear approximation. If the velocity is a significant fraction of c, we need to use the relativistic Doppler formula.

Wait, 700 km/s is about 0.23% the speed of light (since c is ~3e5 km/s). So 0.7e3 / 3e5 = 0.00233. So the velocity is not too high, but to be precise, perhaps the relativistic formula is needed.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula is: λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), assuming v is moving away (positive velocity). Alternatively, if moving towards, it would be negative. But in this problem, Star_1 has v=0, so its λ_obs is same as λ_emit. Star_2 has v=700 km/s; but if the velocity is moving away, then λ_obs is longer than λ_emit. If it's moving towards, it's shorter. But since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps we can assume that Star_2 is moving away (v=+700 km/s), or is it towards? Hmm, but I think the problem states the radial velocities as 0 and 700, with no direction, so perhaps it's just the magnitude. Alternatively, perhaps the direction doesn't matter because we'll be taking a square, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the problem says the observed λ_max is the same for both. So if Star_1's λ_emit is λ_1, and Star_2's λ_emit is λ_2, but their observed λ_max is the same, say λ_obs.

So for Star_1: λ_obs = λ_1 (since v1 is 0).

For Star_2: λ_obs = λ_2 * Doppler_shift_factor(v2), where v2 is 700 km/s.

But wait, if the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer than emitted. So λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v_r /c ), approximately, when v_r << c. But exact formula is (sqrt( (1 + v_r/c)/(1 - v_r/c) )) ) for the case when the motion is along the line of sight.

Wait, the exact formula is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) ), for a source moving away with velocity v_r. So if v_r is positive (moving away), then λ_obs is longer. If moving towards, v_r is negative, which makes λ_obs shorter.

But in this problem, the observed λ_max
