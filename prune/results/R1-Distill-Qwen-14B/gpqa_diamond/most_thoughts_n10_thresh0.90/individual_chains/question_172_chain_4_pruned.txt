Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

So the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, that has to do with their excitation states, probably Boltzmann distribution or something like that. Since the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), I can apply the Boltzmann equation here.

From what I remember, the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature and the energy difference between those levels. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where g are the statistical weights, and k is the Boltzmann constant. Oh wait, but in this case, maybe the statistical weights are the same, or we're told to ignore them? The question mentions the energy difference, so perhaps the ratio is just about the exponential term.

Wait, the problem states that the energy difference (ΔE) between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. But actually, the exact value might not matter because the options involve the temperatures T1 and T2, and the ratio of their n (excitation levels).

In star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So for a specific energy level, let's say n1 is the number in that level in star_1, and n2 in star_2. So n1/n2 = 2. Assuming that the g factors (statistical weights) are the same for both stars, because they are the same element in the same energy levels, so g1/g2 = 1. So the equation simplifies to (n1/n2) = exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)) / exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)).

Wait, no. Let me recheck. The ratio of their populations would depend on the Boltzmann factors for each star. So for each star, the ratio of the upper to lower level is exp(-ΔE/(kT)). So in star 1, the ratio n_upper/n_lower is exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and in star 2, it's exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But the problem states that the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So perhaps the ratio n1 (upper) over n_lower in star_1 is twice that of star_2's ratio. Oh wait, the way it's phrased: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." Hmm, maybe that means the number of atoms in the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Or perhaps the excitation is higher, so the ratio is higher. Wait, actually, if the excitation is higher, that usually means more atoms are in the upper energy level, which would imply a higher temperature because higher T makes the Boltzmann factor larger (so more atoms in higher energy states).

Wait, I might have gotten the ratio reversed. Let me think again.

So for each star, the ratio of excited (upper level) to
