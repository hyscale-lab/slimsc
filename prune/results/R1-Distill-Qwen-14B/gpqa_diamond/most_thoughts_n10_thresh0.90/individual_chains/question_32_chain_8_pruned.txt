Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96 times the speed of light. Hmm, right, I remember that in relativity, when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, their energy increases due to relativistic effects.

First, I need to figure out what the nucleus is. The question says it's Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. Let me think, lithium has an atomic number of 3. The isotope would be Li-6 because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion. But wait, in colliders, they usually deal with ions, so it's probably a charged particle, like a singly charged ion. So the charge would be +1, but I'm not sure if that affects the energy calculation here. Maybe it doesn't because the mass is what's important for the energy.

The energy of a relativistic particle is given by the total energy formula: E = gamma * m0 * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor. Oh right, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since the speed v is 0.96c, I can plug that in.

Let's compute gamma first. So v = 0.96c. Therefore, v squared over c squared is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which I think is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that. 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784, yes. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a single nucleon is about 1.67e-27 kg. But wait, I think I remember that the mass of a proton is approximately 1.67e-27 kg, and the neutron is slightly heavier, about 1.68e-27 kg. So for a Li-6 nucleus, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total mass would be 6 * average mass. But wait, the exact mass might be better found from the periodic table. Alternatively, maybe I can use the atomic mass.

Wait, the mass of a Li-6 atom is about 6.941 atomic mass units (u). But wait, since a Li-6 ion has a charge, it's missing electrons. Hmm, but wait, in the case of a nucleus, the mass is approximately the same as the atom minus the electrons, but since the electrons' mass is negligible compared to nucleons, maybe I can ignore that. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the mass of the nucleus, which for Li-6 is about 6.941 u minus the electrons. Wait, no. Wait, the atomic mass includes the electrons, but when the nucleus is considered, it's the mass of the protons and neutrons. But wait, the exact calculation might be tricky. Let me think: the mass of a Li-6 nucleus (without electrons) is approximately 6.941 u minus the mass of 3 electrons (since Li has 3 electrons) because Li-6 is a neutral atom in the question? Or not? Wait, the ion is Li with 3 neutrons, but the charge isn't specified. Oh, the problem says nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons, so perhaps it's just Li-6 as a nucleus, so the mass is the sum of 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

But maybe it's easier to
