Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because titration problems can get a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

Alright, let's read the question again. We're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each providing two pH values.

Hmm, first, I think I should figure out the initial concentration after dilution. Wait, wait. Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water. So that's a total volume of 40 cm³. Oh, right, because 20 + 20 is 40.

So the initial concentration after dilution would be... using the dilution formula C1V1 = C2V2. Here, C1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. The new volume V2 is 40 cm³. So C2 is (0.05 * 20) / 40. Let me calculate that: (1) /40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but acetic acid is a weak acid, so when we dilute it, it dissociates more, but the initial concentration is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

So the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH to form acetate ions (CH3COO^-). At equivalence, the solution will be of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base. So the solution should be basic. The pH at equivalence will be determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.

But before that, the question asks about the pH at 25% titration. That means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So, I need to find the pH at that point.

Let me think about the steps.

First, I'll calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach 25% titration and the equivalence point.

But wait, maybe it's easier to calculate the moles first.

The initial moles of acetic acid: Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M × 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) = 0.001 moles.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the initial 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, but after dilution with 20 cm³ water, the total volume is 0.04 L. So the moles are the same, but the concentration is 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Right.

Wait, wait another thing. When you dilute a solution, the moles stay the same. So the initial 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid has 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles of acetic acid. Diluting it to 40 cm³ doesn't change the moles; it just lowers the concentration to 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M, as I found earlier.

So the moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol.

At equivalence point, all of this would react with Na
