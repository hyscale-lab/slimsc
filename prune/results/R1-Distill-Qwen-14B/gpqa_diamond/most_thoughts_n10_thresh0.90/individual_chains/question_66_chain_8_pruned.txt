Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I need to figure out which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, I remember that the SMEFT is based on the Standard Model but with higher-dimensional operators added. The idea is that these operators are organized by their dimension. So, SMEFT respects the symmetries of the Standard Model, right? But which ones exactly?

Let's go through each symmetry. Lorentz symmetry is about how fields transform under Lorentz transformations, like rotations and boosts. The Standard Model definitely respects Lorentz symmetry, so SMEFT should too. That would mean all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. So option 1 is a must.

Next is Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Wait, but the Standard Model already respects Poincare symmetry. So do the operators in SMEFT? I think so because they're part of the effective theory which maintains the same symmetries as the Standard Model. So option 2, Poincare symmetry, should also be respected. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

CP symmetry is a bit trickier. CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. The Standard Model doesn't respect CP symmetry in some cases, like in the CKM matrix leading to CP violation. So if the Standard Model doesn't have CP symmetry, then SMEFT shouldn't enforce it either. Therefore, operators in SMEFT might not necessarily respect CP symmetry. So option 3, CP symmetry, is not a must.

What about CPT symmetry? CPT is Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. I think CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, especially in theories that are Lorentz invariant. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it should also respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 must be correct.

Putting it all together, the symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but wait a second. Poincare symmetry includes translations. The SMEFT operators are local, so they respect local Lorentz and translation symmetries. So yes, Poincare is included. But wait, is Poincare symmetry even a separate symmetry in this context? Because Poincare includes the Lorentz group and translations. Oh, but the question lists them separately, so perhaps both 1 and 2 are correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The Poincare group is the combination of Lorentz and translations. So if an operator respects Poincare symmetry, it automatically respects Lorentz. But the question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if an operator is written in SMEFT, it must respect Poincare and Lorentz?

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering Lorentz and Poincare as separate. But in reality, Poincare is a larger symmetry that includes Lorentz. So if an operator respects Poincare, it's also respecting Lorentz. But the question lists them as separate options. Oh, because the first option is Lorentz, and the second is Poincare. So maybe the correct thing is that all operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare, as well as CPT.

Wait, but I think the SMEFT operators are constructed in a way that they respect the symmetries of the Standard Model. So if the Standard Model respects Poincare, then SMEFT does too. Thus, all operators must respect Poincare, which implies Lorentz, but the question is including Lorentz as a separate option.

Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The question is which symmetries must all operators respect. So if an operator in SMEFT must be Lorentz invariant, then it must also transform correctly under Poincare (since it's a larger symmetry). But the options are given as individual choices.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "must be respected by all operators", so the options are which of the four symmetries are necessarily respected.

So, whether it's Lorentz or Poincare. Well, Poincare is a symmetry of the theory as a whole, but do individual operators have to respect it? Or is it the theory's symmetry regardless of individual operators? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, operators in the SMEFT are local, Lorentz-invariant operators. So each operator is Lorentz-invariant. As for Poincare, that includes translations. Well, SMEFT operators are written in terms of fields that are translation-invariant, so they should respect that as well. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are respected.

But wait, I'm getting myself into a knot. Let me think: the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So all operators in it must be Lorentz-invariant. Poincare symmetry includes translations, so if the theory is Poincare-invariant, then each operator must respect it. But maybe individual operators don't need to, but the entire theory must. Or perhaps since the operators are local, they are automatically Poincare-invariant.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that Poincare symmetry is automatically respected if Lorentz is, because translation invariance comes for free in the theory. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, another approach: in the Standard Model, the Poincare symmetry is respected, so the SMEFT, being an effective theory thereof, must also respect it. But do individual operators need to respect it? Hmm, maybe the operators are written in a way that they are invariant under Poincare, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by "all operators". So
