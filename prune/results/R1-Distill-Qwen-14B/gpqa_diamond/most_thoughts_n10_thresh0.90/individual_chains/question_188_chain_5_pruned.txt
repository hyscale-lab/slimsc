Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal but the angles aren't necessarily 90 degrees. Oh right, in a rhombohedral system, the three lattice parameters a, b, c are equal, and the angles α, β, γ are all the same, which in this case is 30 degrees each.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. I think the formula for interplanar distance d is given by something like d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + ... some terms involving angles). Wait, no, wait. Oh right, for a general crystal system, the interplanar distance formula is d_{hkl} = a/(sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + (h² + k²) * (1 - cos α)/(cos α) ) ), but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Oh wait, no, maybe I should recall that for a rhombohedral system, the formula is simplified.

Another approach: I remember that for a cubic system, the interplanar distance is a/(sqrt(h² +k² +l²)). But rhombohedral isn't cubic because of the angles. So what's the formula here?

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system is d_{hkl} = [ (a² (h² + k² + l²) + ... ) ]^{-1/2} but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the formula for rhombohedral is d = a/(sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) * (cos α) ) ), but wait, no, that can't be right because I think the formula involves the cosines of the angles. Or perhaps I'm mixing it up with something else.

Wait, maybe I should refer to the general formula for interplanar distance. The formula is d = (1/√(h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos γ1 + hl cos γ2 + kl cos γ3))) ) * (a), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the formula for a rhombohedral system is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(h
