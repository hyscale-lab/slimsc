Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to tackle, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

So, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, right. I remember that stars' properties can influence the ionization states of elements in their atmospheres, which affects their spectral lines.

The star's parameters are given: a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. When the spots are present, the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Wait, the ratio of level 1 to level 2 decreases when spots are present. So without spots, the ratio is higher. The question is asking for the factor by which it changes, so (ratio without spots) divided by (ratio with spots).

I think this has to do with the Saha equation, which relates the ionization state of atoms to temperature and electron density. But wait, the Saha equation is more about ionization, but here we're talking about excitation between two energy levels of neutral Ti. Oh right, for excitation, it's the Boltzmann equation we need to use.

The Boltzmann equation describes the distribution of particles in different energy levels under thermal equilibrium (LTE here). The equation is (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

In this case, the ratio is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

But wait, the problem gives that when spots are present, the ratio decreases. So when the effective temperature drops, the ratio goes down. So the ratio is proportional to exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T) ). Since E1 and E2 are the energies of levels 1 and 2, if level 1 is higher than level 2, then (E1 - E2) is positive. So as T decreases, the exponent becomes a larger negative number, making the ratio smaller. That makes sense why the ratio decreases when T drops. So the ratio is inversely proportional to temperature.

Wait, but the transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. That's in the near-ultraviolet range, I think. The energy difference between the two levels can be found using the wavelength. So the energy E = hc/λ. Where h is Planck's constant and c is speed of light.

Let me compute E for that. But wait, the energy difference E = E1 - E2 = hc/(λ). Wait, but how does that relate to the ratio?

Alternatively, the ratio n1/n2 would be proportional to exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where ΔE is E1 - E2. Since the wavelength is given, we can compute ΔE.

But wait, wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the ratio of the populations. So, when the star has spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K, and without spots, it's 6000 K. So the ratio without spots (T=6000) divided by ratio with spots (T=5500) would be exp[ (1/(5500) - 1/(6000)) * (k * (ΔE)/k) ) ].

Wait, let me think again. The ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So when T is higher, the exponent is less negative, so the ratio is higher. So when spots are present, T is lower, ratio is lower.

So the ratio when no spots (R1) is higher than when spots are present (R2). The factor is R1/R2 = [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ].

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) [1/(T2) - 1/(T1)] )

Wait, let me compute that. Let me call T1 as 6000 K (no spots) and T2 as 5500 K (with spots).

So R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, wait, let me make sure. Because:

R1 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, no, no. Let me correct that. Because if R1 is with higher T, then:

R1/R2 = [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Which is exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Yes, because exponentials subtract when divided. So that would be correct.

Wait, but wait: The exponent in R1 is -ΔE/(k T1), and in R2 it's -ΔE/(k T2). So R1/R2 is exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) )

Wait, but T2 is lower than T1. So 1/(T2) is larger than 1/(T1), so the exponent is positive. So the entire factor is greater than 1, which makes sense because R1 is higher than R2.

Now, the question is to find R1/R2. So to compute this, I need to find ΔE from the wavelength.

ΔE = hc / λ

h is Planck's constant, which is 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

λ is given as 14
