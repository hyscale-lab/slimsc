Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think this through.

Alright, the question says that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix. The matrix is given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Wait, eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Right, for a matrix, the eigenvalues are solutions to the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0. So I should first construct the matrix Ay.

Let me write down matrix S first. S looks like:
[ 0 -i ]
[ i  0 ]

Then, c is h/(4π), so Ay = c * S. So each element of S is multiplied by c. So Ay would be:
[ 0       c*(-i) ]
[ c*(i)   0     ]

Simplify that:
Ay = [ 0 , -i c ]
      [ i c , 0 ]

Since c is h/(4π), substituting that in:
Ay = [0, -i*(h/(4π))]
      [i*(h/(4π)), 0]

Now, to find the eigenvalues, I'll set up the characteristic equation. The matrix Ay has elements:

a11=0, a12= -i h/(4π)
a21= i h/(4π), a22=0

The characteristic equation is determinant of (Ay - λ I ) = 0.

So the matrix becomes:

[-λ      -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)  -λ ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π) ) * (i h/(4π) ) ] = λ² - [ ( -i² ) (h²/(16π²)) ) ]

Wait, i squared is -1, so (-i)*(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. Let me compute the product:

(-i h/(4π))*(i h/(4π)) = (-i)(i) * (h²)/(16 π²) )

(-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So the product is (h²/(16 π²)) * 1.

So determinant equation: λ² - (h²/(16 π²)) * 1 = 0 → λ² = h²/(16 π²) → λ = ± h/(4π)

Wait, so the eigenvalues are plus and minus h/(4π). But wait, the problem says to consider the Y-component, which in angular momentum terms is ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, because for spin-1/2 particles, the spin matrices are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. Because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, so when multiplied by ħ/2, you get ± ħ/2.

Wait, but in our case, what's our c? c is h/(4π). Let me compute that. Planck's constant h is 2πħ. So h/(4π) = (2πħ)/(4π) ) = ħ/2. Oh! So c = ħ/2. So Ay = (ħ/2) * S, where S is the Pauli Y matrix. Wait, the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So indeed, S is sigma_y, so Ay = (ħ/2) sigma_y.

The eigenvalues of sigma_y are ±1, so the eigenvalues of Ay would be (ħ/2) * (±1) → ± ħ/2. But wait, the question's options don't have this
