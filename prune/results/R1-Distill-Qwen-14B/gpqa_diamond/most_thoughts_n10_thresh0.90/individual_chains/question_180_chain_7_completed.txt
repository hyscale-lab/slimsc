Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about electric potential energy in an isolated system of charges. Alright, I remember that electric potential energy between point charges is something to do with Coulomb's law.

The problem states: there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh, wait, 2e is twice the elementary charge. So each has a charge of 2 times 1.6e-19 coulombs. But wait, 12 of these are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So I'm picturing a setup where one charge is at the center, and 12 others are all located 2 meters away from that point. 

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. And the options are given in Joules. So I think I need to calculate the electric potential energy of this system.

Wait, I remember that the potential energy of a system of point charges is the work required to assemble those charges from infinity to their positions. For each pair of charges, you calculate the potential energy and sum it all up. But since all the charges are identical, maybe there's a way to simplify the calculation.

So, each charge is 2e, so q = 2e. The 13th charge is fixed at P, so the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So for each of those 12 charges, the distance from the one at P is 2 meters. So the energy between each of the 12 and the fixed charge is (k * q1 * q2)/r. But wait, since all 12 are identical, each contributes the same amount.

Wait, but wait. The potential energy is the sum of all pairs. So each of the 12 charges will interact with the fixed charge, and also with each other. Oh, right! So I can't just compute the energy between the fixed charge and the others; I also have to account for the potential energy between each of the 12 charges themselves because they're all at 2 meters from P, but what about their distances from each other?

Wait, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So I'm assuming they're all located on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters around P. But are they placed in some specific arrangement? Like, forming a regular dodecagon or something on the sphere? Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify their arrangement. It just says they're at 2 m from P. So perhaps for the calculation of the potential energy between each other, their mutual distances would vary, but maybe we can find an average or make an assumption.

Wait, but no. Wait a second. When calculating the potential energy of the entire system, you need to consider each pair of charges. So for the system of 13 charges, the potential energy is the sum of the potential energies between every distinct pair.

So the system's potential energy U is the sum over all pairs i < j of (k * q_i * q_j)/r_ij.

In this case, the charges are identical, so q_i = q_j = 2e for all i and j. So each term is k*(2e)^2 / r_ij.

Now, the system has 13 charges: one at P (let's call it charge A) and 12 others (B1, B2, ..., B12) each at 2 m from P.

So the pairs are:

- A and each B (12 pairs)
- Each pair of B's (the 12 choose 2 = 66 pairs)

But wait, what's the distance between the B charges? Since the 12 B charges are all at 2 m from P, but their mutual distances depend on how they're arranged. For example, if all B charges are at the same point (which can't be the case, but for the sake of calculation), then all mutual r_ij would be zero, which would make the potential energy infinite. But that's not possible; they must be spread out somehow.

But the problem doesn't specify their arrangement, so maybe it's assuming they're far apart? Or perhaps, since they're all at the same radius from P, the average distance between any two B charges can be approximated. Wait, no, that's getting complicated.

Wait, but in the absence of any specific arrangement information, perhaps the problem implicitly assumes that the mutual distances between the 12 charges are much larger than 2 meters, so their potential energy can be neglected. But that doesn't make sense because if they're all at 2 meters from P, their distances from each other could be on the order of 2 meters or less, depending on how they're arranged.

Wait, but maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between each B charge and A, and not between the B charges themselves. Because including the B-B interactions would complicate things beyond what's likely intended for a problem like this. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider all interactions, but given that all the B charges are at the same distance from A, perhaps their mutual distances can be considered in a certain way.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the charges are arranged such that all the B charges are at the same point. But that would lead to an infinite potential energy between them, which isn't physical, so that's probably not the case.

Wait, maybe the problem expects us to calculate only the potential energy between the fixed charge and the others, and not the potential energy between the moving charges. Because if you don't consider the mutual interactions, the calculation becomes easier. Let's see what the options are.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual interactions are negligible because the number is small? No, 12 is a large number, so the mutual potential energy could be significant.

Wait, but perhaps the problem wants us to consider only the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge at P. Because the other term (the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves) would depend on their arrangement, which isn't given, so maybe that part is omitted.

But that seems a bit odd. Let me think again. The problem says it's the minimum energy of the system. Hmm, wait, the potential energy of a system is the sum of all the pair-wise potentials. So for the minimum energy, perhaps all the charges are arranged in a way that minimizes the potential energy. But for point charges, the minimum potential energy configuration is when they are as far apart as possible. But in this case, since 12 of them are constrained to be at 2 m from P, perhaps their arrangement is fixed and the system's potential energy is just the sum of all the individual pairs.

Wait, but without knowing their mutual distances, it's impossible to calculate the sum for all B-B pairs. So perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and the others, and the mutual energy between the 12 is neglected. Let's see.

If that's the case, then each of the 12 charges contributes an energy term of (k*(2e)^2)/r, where r is 2 meters.

So the total potential energy U would be 12 * (k * (2e)^2) / (2).

Wait, let's compute that.

Compute each term:

k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

e is the elementary charge, 1.602 x 10^-19 C.

So each term is (8.988e9) * (2e)^2 / 2.

Wait, (2e)^2 is 4e².

So each term is (8.988e9) * 4e² / 2.

Wait, 4e² is 4*(1.6e-19)^2, but wait, no, 4*e^2 is 4*(1.6e-19)^2? Or wait, 2e is 2 * e, so (2e)^2 is 4e².

So let me compute each term.

Each term U_i = (k * (2e)^2) / r.

So U_i = (8.988e9) * (4 * (1.6e-19)^2) / 2.

Wait, wait, because the denominator is r, which is 2 meters.

So for each of the 12 charges, the potential energy with the fixed charge is (8.988e9) * ( (2 * 1.6e-19 C)^2 ) / 2 m.

Wait, perhaps I should compute that step by step.

First, calculate (2e)^2:

(2e)^2 = 4e² = 4*(1.602e-19)^2 = 4*(2.566e-38) ≈ 1.026e-37 C².

Then, for each pair (A and a B), the potential energy is (k * q1 q2)/r = (8.988e9 N·m²/C²) * (2e)^2 / (2 m).

Wait, no, hold on. Each term is (k * q_A * q_B) / r, where q_A is 2e and q_B is 2e, and r is 2 m.

So each term is (8.988e9) * (2e) * (2e) / (2).

Wait, let me compute that.

So (2e) * (2e) = 4e².

r is 2 m, so denominator is 2.

So each term is (8.988e9) * (4e²) / 2.

Simplify: 4e²/2 is 2e².

So each term is 8.988e9 * 2e².

Wait, wait, no, wait. Because e is 1.6e-19 C, so e² is (1.6e-19)^2.

Wait, let me compute that correctly.

Compute one term U_i:

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C²

q = 2e = 2 * 1.6e-19 C = 3.2e-19 C.

So U_i = (8.988e9) * (3.2e-19)^2 / 2.

Wait, wait no, the denominator is r = 2 m.

Wait, U_i = (k * q_A * q_B) / r.

So that's (8.988e9) * (3.2e-19 C) * (3.2e-19 C) / 2 m.

Let me compute the numerator first:

8.988e9 * (3.2e-19)^2.

Compute 3.2e-19 squared: (3.2)^2 =10.24, so 10.24e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 * 10.24e-38 = let's compute that.

8.988 *10.24 ≈ 92.04.

So 92.04e (9-38) = 92.04e-29.

Wait, 10.24e-38 is 1.024e-37, sorry, wait no: 3.2e-19 squared is (3.2)^2=10.24, exponent is (-19)*2=-38, so 10.24e-38 = 1.024e-37.

So 8.988e9 * 1.024e-37 = let's compute exponents and coefficients.

8.988e9 = 8.988 x 1e9.

Multiply by 1.024e-37: 8.988 * 1.024 ≈ 9.198.

Exponents: 1e9 * 1e-37 = 1e-28.

So 9.198e-28.

Then, divide this by 2 (because r=2 m): 9.198e-28 /2 = 4.599e-28.

So each U_i is approximately 4.599e-28 J.

Wait, but wait, for each of the 12 charges, this is the energy. So total contribution from these 12 charges is 12 * 4.599e-28.

Compute 12 *4.599e-28: 55.188e-28 = 5.5188e-27 J.

Wait, but that's for the A-B interactions. But what about the B-B interactions? Because the potential energy between each pair of B charges is also (k*(2e)^2)/r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between two B charges. But since the problem doesn't specify their arrangement, we can't compute this unless we make an assumption.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between A and the B charges, and neglects the B-B interactions, assuming that the 12 B charges are so arranged that their mutual distances are large enough that their contributions are negligible. But that seems unlikely, because 12 charges at 2m from P would have some mutual distances on the order of 2m or less, leading to significant potential energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the B-B interactions to be considered, but for that, maybe the charges are arranged in a way that each B is equidistant from every other B, but that's only possible if all B's are at the same point, which isn't possible because they are constrained to be at 2m from P but in different positions.

Wait, maybe the problem is intended to ignore the B-B interactions, perhaps because the question asks for the minimum energy. If so, then the minimum would be when the B-B interactions are minimized, perhaps by spreading them as far apart as possible. But without knowing their arrangement, it's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that all B charges are at the same point, but that's not possible because you can't have 12 charges at the same point without infinite energy.

Wait, but the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So perhaps they are arranged in a way that each is at a different point on the sphere of radius 2m, but their mutual distances can be considered as points on a sphere. So perhaps the average distance between any two B charges is such that the potential energy can be calculated. But this seems complicated, and perhaps beyond the scope of the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't consider the B-B interactions, so the total energy is just the sum of the A-B contributions. Let's proceed with that approach and see what answer we get.

So previously, we found that the sum of A-B contributions is approximately 5.5188e-27 J.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is roughly about 1.28 times that number. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, let me redo the calculation.

Each term U_i = (k*(2e)^2)/r, where r=2 m.

So:

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

(2e) = 2 * 1.6e-19 C = 3.2e-19 C.

So (2e)^2 = (3.2e-19)^2 = 10.24e-38 C².

So U_i = (8.988e9) * (10.24e-38) / (2).

Wait, wait, no: U_i = (k q^2) / r.

Because each B is at 2 m from A. So each U_i is (8.988e9) * (3.2e-19)^2 / 2.

Wait, (3.2e-19)^2 = 10.24e-38.

So (8.988e9) * 10.24e-38 = ?

8.988e9 * 10.24e-38 = (8.988 * 10.24) * 1e9 * 1e-38.

Multiply 8.988 *10.24: 8 *10.24=81.92, 0.988 *10.24≈10.113, total≈92.033.

So 92.033e(9-38) = 92.033e-29 = 9.2033e-28.

Then divide by 2: 9.2033e-28 / 2 = 4.60165e-28 J per pair.

Now, 12 such charges: 12 *4.60165e-28 = 55.22e-28 = 5.522e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is higher than this. So perhaps I missed some terms.

Ah, right! Because the problem includes the potential energy between each of the B charges themselves. So I need to calculate the sum of all A-B and B-B pairs.

But to calculate the B-B pairs, I need to know the distance between any two B charges.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify their arrangement. So perhaps the charges are all at the same point (which isn't possible, but maybe it's an approximation). If all B charges are at the same point, then the distance between any two is zero, leading to U = infinity, which is impossible. So that can't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the 12 B charges are arranged such that each is at the same distance from each other, but that's only possible in a regular 12-gon on the sphere. Hmm, but that's getting complicated. Without more information, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the B-B interactions.

But then, the total U would be 5.522e-27 J. Looking at the options, the closest is option C: 7.056e-27, which is about 1.28 times larger. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Oh wait, each B charge contributes a potential with all other B charges. So the number of B-B pairs is (12 choose 2) = 66 pairs. But without knowing their mutual distances, I can't compute this. Therefore, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the B-B terms, considering only the A-B terms.

But then the answer I got is around 5.5e-27 J, which isn't one of the options. The options are A)5.645e-26, B)2.822e-26, C)7.056e-27, D)122.330.

Wait, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 1.28 times my initial calculation. Maybe I made a miscalculation in exponents.

Let me recompute:

Each U_i (A-B) is (8.988e9) * (3.2e-19)^2 / 2.

Compute (3.2e-19)^2: 3.2 *3.2 =10.24; exponent is -38 (because (1e-19)^2 is 1e-38). So 10.24e-38 C².

So (8.988e9) * (10.24e-38) = 8.988 *10.24 ≈ 92.03, and exponents: 1e9 *1e-38 =1e-29. So 92.03e-29 = 9.203e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.6015e-28 per pair.

Multiply by 12: 12 *4.6015e-28 =55.218e-28 =5.5218e-27 J.

Hmm, that's about 5.5e-27, which isn't in the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the sum of all pairs, including the fixed charge and all others, but each B charge's self-energy is not counted. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12 others, and not the mutual potential between the 12.

But even then, 5.5e-27 J isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the formula for the potential energy of a system of point charges as the sum of (k q_i q_j)/r_ij for all i < j.

In this case, the system consists of 13 charges: one fixed at P (charge q), and 12 others each at 2 m from P, each with charge 2e.

So the potential energy U is the sum of:

- The potential between the fixed charge and each of the 12 others.
- The potential between each pair of the 12 others.

So U = U_fixed + U_mutual.

Where U_fixed is the sum of the potentials between the fixed charge and each of the 12, and U_mutual is the sum of potentials between each pair of the 12.

But to compute U_mutual, we need to know the distances between each pair of the 12.

Assuming the 12 charges are arranged on a sphere of radius 2 m, the average distance between two points on the sphere is something. But I think this might be where the problem is getting complicated, and perhaps the given options don't consider U_mutual. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore U_mutual because the charges are far apart, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the U_fixed term, and the answer is 5.5e-27 J, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm doing something wrong in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering all the charges as being at the same point as the fixed charge, but that's not possible because that would make r_ij zero for all pairs and the energy would be infinite.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the formula for the potential energy of a single charge in an electric field created by other charges. Wait, but the potential energy of a charge in an electric field is U = q * V, where V is the potential at the point where the charge is placed.

So the fixed charge at P contributes to the potential at each of the 12 charges. Alternatively, each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential at P.

Wait, perhaps the fixed charge at P is the 13th charge, so when you place each of the 12 charges at 2 m, the potential at each B charge is due to the fixed charge and the other B charges.

Wait, but when calculating the potential energy of the system, you have to consider all the interactions, including the fixed charge and the others, and the others with each other.

But without knowing the mutual distances, perhaps the problem is only considering the fixed charge and the 12 charges, and the mutual terms are neglected. If that's the case, then the total energy is 5.5e-27 J. But that's not an option. Hmm.

Looking at the options again, option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 5 times larger than what I calculated. Option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 1.28 times my 5.5e-27. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of U_i. Let me recompute U_i.

Each U_i (A-B) is (k * (2e)^2) / (2 m).

So (2e)^2 is (2)^2 * e^2 =4 e².

So (k *4 e²) /2 = (4/2) k e² = 2 k e².

Wait, maybe I should compute 2 k e².

k is 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e is 1.6e-19 C.

So 2 k e² = 2 * 8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

Compute (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 *2.56e-38 = ?

8.988e9 *2.56e-38 = (8.988 *2.56) * 1e9 * 1e-38.

8.988 *2.56 ≈ 23.01.

So 23.01e-29 = 2.301e-28.

Multiply by 2: 4.602e-28 J per pair.

But wait, each U_i is (k q^2)/r. So in this case, q is 2e, so q² is 4e².

So U_i = (k *4e²)/r.

r is 2 meters.

So U_i = (8.988e9 *4*(1.6e-19)^2)/2.

Compute 4*(1.6e-19)^2 =4*2.56e-38=10.24e-38=1.024e-37.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 *1.024e-37 = 9.204e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.602e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 12 *4.602e-28=55.224e-28=5.5224e-27 J.

So again, about 5.5e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is approximately 1.28 times 5.5e-27.

But perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the work done to bring each charge from infinity to their positions, which would require considering the potential due to all the other charges already present.

Wait, because when you bring a charge to a point where other charges are present, you have to account for the potential created by the other charges.

So when placing each of the 12 B charges, the potential at their position is due to the fixed charge A and the other B charges that were already placed.

But that complicates the calculation because each charge is placed one by one, and the potential at each step depends on the previously placed charges.

But perhaps, for the sake of calculation, we can find the total potential energy as the sum of each charge's contribution, considering the potential from all other charges.

Wait, but in this case, since all the B charges are identical and placed symmetrically, perhaps each one contributes the same amount.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy can be calculated as the sum of all pairs, which is what I did earlier. But without knowing their mutual distances, I can't compute that part.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12 others, and the mutual energy between the 12 is ignored. If that's the case, the total energy would be about 5.5e-27 J, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the sum of all pairs, including the B-B interactions, but assuming that all B charges are at the same point, which is impossible, but let's see.

If all 12 B charges are located at the same point (which isn't physically possible), then the distance r_ij between any two B charges is zero, which would make their potential energy infinite, which isn't possible. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering each B charge to be at a distance of 2 m from P, but their mutual distances are considered to be much larger than 2 m, so that their contributions can be neglected. But again, that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again: the potential energy between two point charges is given by U = (k q1 q2) / r, where r is the distance between them.

So for each of the 12 B charges, the potential energy with A is (k (2e)^2)/2.

Each of the 12 contributes that, so U_fixed = 12 * (k (2e)^2)/2.

Which is 12 * [ (8.988e9) * (4e²) /2 ].

Wait, let me compute this.

(8.988e9) *4 = 35.952e9.

Multiply by e²: (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38.

So 35.952e9 * 2.56e-38 = 35.952 *2.56 = approx 92.03, and 1e9 *1e-38 =1e-29.

So 92.03e-29 = 9.203e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.6015e-28 per pair.

Multiply by 12: 55.218e-28 =5.5218e-27 J.

Again, the same result. So that's about 5.5e-27 J.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J. Let me compute what that is compared to my result.

5.5218e-27 * (7.056e-27 /5.5218e-27) )= 5.5218 *1.2775 ≈ 7.056e-27. So perhaps the problem is considering both the A-B and B-B terms, but in that case, the B-B terms must contribute an additional 1.2775 times the A-B terms.

But without knowing the mutual distances, perhaps the problem is making an assumption that the B-B distances are all 2 m. Hmm, but that's unlikely because 12 charges can't all be 2 m apart from each other on a sphere of radius 2 m.

Wait, perhaps the mutual distances can be approximated as 2 m, which would make the B-B terms same as A-B terms, but that seems incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each B charge interacts with all other 11 B charges at a distance of 2 m. But that's not possible because if all B charges are at 2 m from A, their mutual distances would be less than or equal to 4 m (if diametrically opposite), but more likely varying.

Wait, perhaps the problem is treating the mutual distances as 2 m, which would be an incorrect assumption, but perhaps that's what the problem expects.

In that case, the number of B-B pairs is 12 choose 2 =66.

Each B-B pair's potential energy would be (k (2e)^2 )/2 m, same as the A-B pairs.

So each pair contributes 4.6015e-28 J. So 66 pairs contribute 66 *4.6015e-28 = 3.03699e-26 J.

Adding the A-B contribution of 5.5218e-27 J: 5.5218e-27 +3.03699e-26=3.58917e-26 J.

But none of the options match this either. The options are much smaller than this.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me recompute the B-B contribution.

Wait, each B-B pair is (k (2e)^2 ) /r_ij. If r_ij is 2 m, then each pair's U is 4.6015e-28 J.

So 66 pairs: 66 *4.6015e-28 = 3.03699e-26 J.

Adding the A-B contribution (5.5218e-27 J): 3.58917e-26 J.

But the options are much smaller than this, so perhaps I'm making a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the B-B terms, and I should proceed with the initial calculation of 5.5e-27 J. But that's not an option.

Wait, looking again, option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is approximately 1.28 times 5.52e-27.

Wait, 5.52e-27 *1.28 = approximately 7.05e-27.

Hmm, so perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 B charges is interacting with the fixed charge as well as with all the other 11 B charges, but the mutual distances are such that each B-B pair is 2 m apart. But that's not possible because 12 charges can't all be 2 m apart from each other on a sphere of radius 2 m.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, considering the potential energy as the sum of all charges, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the formula for the potential energy of a system of multiple identical charges arranged symmetrically, such as on a sphere. There's a formula for the potential energy of N identical point charges on the surface of a sphere of radius R.

The formula is U = (N k q^2) / (4 π ε0 R) ) * ( (N-1) / (2 N) ) ) ?

Wait, no, perhaps that's not correct.

Alternatively, I remember that for N identical charges on a sphere of radius R, the potential energy can be calculated as U = (N^2 k q^2) / (4 π ε0 R) ) * (some factor).

Wait, perhaps for a regular polygon arrangement, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is U = (N k q^2) * ( (N -1) ) / (4 π ε0 R) ) * (1/(something)).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of each charge interacting with all others.

Each of the N charges interacts with N-1 others. But for a sphere, the average distance between two points is (3 R)/(pi) ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, for a system of N identical charges on a sphere of radius R, the total potential energy is given by U = (N^2 k q^2 )/(4π ε0 R) ) * (something).

Wait, but I'm not recalling the exact formula, and perhaps it's beyond the scope of this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge, and not the mutual terms. So in that case, the total energy is 5.52e-27 J, but that's not an option.

Looking back at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is about 1.28 times my initial calculation. So perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that each contributes an additional factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of e.

Wait, e is approximately 1.602e-19 C. So (2e)^2 =4e² =4*(1.602e-19)^2 =4*(2.566e-38) =1.0264e-37 C².

So U_i = (8.988e9 *1.0264e-37 ) / (2) = (9.232e-28 ) / 2 =4.616e-28 J.

Multiply by 12: 55.392e-28 =5.539e-27 J.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the sum of all pairs, including the fixed charge, but the fixed charge isn't counted as part of the sum.

Wait, no, the fixed charge is included; it's the 13th charge.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12 others, and not the mutual terms. So the answer would be approximately 5.5e-27 J, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate the formula.

Wait, another approach: the potential energy of a system of charges is the sum over all pairs.

So for the 13 charges, the number of pairs is (13 choose 2) =78.

But for the fixed charge, it interacts with 12 others. The other 12 charges interact among themselves in (12 choose 2)=66 pairs.

So the total number of pairs is 78.

But without knowing the mutual distances between the B charges, I can't calculate their contributions.

Thus, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the B-B terms, leading to the earlier calculation of 5.5e-27 J.

But that's not an option, so perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the potential energy between two charges is (k q1 q2)/r, but when considering all pairs, each pair is counted once. So in the case of the 12 B charges, each pair is considered once, but in the term for the fixed charge, each B charge is counted once.

Wait, let me think about the total U_fixed: 12 pairs.

Each pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/2.

So 12 pairs: 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/2 = 6*(k*(2e)^2).

Wait, perhaps I should compute that.

k =8.988e9.

(2e)^2=4e².

So 6 *8.988e9 *4e².

Wait, 6*8.988e9 =5.3928e10.

Multiply by 4e²: 5.3928e10 *4=2.1571e11.

Multiply by e²: e is 1.6e-19.

So 2.1571e11 * (1.6e-19)^2.

Compute (1.6e-19)^2 =2.56e-38.

So 2.1571e11 *2.56e-38 = (2.1571 *2.56) *1e(11-38) =5.523e-27 J.

Ah! So the total U_fixed is 5.523e-27 J.

But that's about 5.5e-27 J, which is still not an option. However, option C is 7.056e-27 J.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the sum of each charge's contribution, but each charge is placed in the potential created by all others.

So when placing the first B charge, the potential at that point is only due to A. When placing the second, it's due to A and the first B, etc.

But this approach gets complicated, and I'm not sure how to compute it without more information.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each B charge is placed in the field of all others, but since they are identical and symmetrically placed, each contributes the same amount.

Wait, but without knowing the exact distances, it's impossible to proceed.

Given that, perhaps the intended approach is to consider only the A-B contributions, leading to 5.5e-27 J. But this isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/r.

k =8.988e9 N·m²/C².

(2e) =3.2e-19 C.

r=2 m.

So each term is (8.988e9)*(3.2e-19)^2/(2).

Compute denominator: 2.

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 * (3.2e-19)^2.

3.2e-19 squared is 10.24e-38.

So 8.988e9 *10.24e-38 = 92.03e-29 =9.203e-28.

Divide by 2:4.6015e-28 per term.

Multiply by 12:55.218e-28 =5.5218e-27 J.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as (k * (n q)^2 ) / (4 π ε0 r), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the potential energy of a single charge in the field of others, which is U = q * V, where V is the potential at the charge's position.

So for each B charge, the potential V is due to the fixed charge A and the other 11 B charges.

But without knowing the arrangement, it's impossible to calculate V for each B charge.

But perhaps the problem is assuming that the B charges are so arranged that their mutual potential is negligible, so V at each B is approximately (k*(2e))/r, where r is 2 m.

So each B's potential energy would be (2e) * [ (k*(2e))/r + sum of potentials from other B charges ].

But without knowing the sum from other B charges, this approach isn't helpful.

Given that, perhaps the intended solution is to compute only the A-B contributions, leading to 5.5e-27 J, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the charges are all being considered as point charges, and the potential energy is calculated as (n choose 2) * (k q^2)/(r).

Wait, for the 12 B charges, if each pair is at a distance r, then the mutual potential energy would be (66) * (k (2e)^2 ) / r.

But again, without knowing r, this isn't helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as considering the electric potential energy as ( (13) * (2e) )^2 * something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that all charges are the same and using a formula for the potential energy of a spherical shell, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the problem is using the formula for the potential energy of a single charge in the field of multiple charges.

The fixed charge A is 2e.

The potential at each B charge is V = (k*(2e))/(2) + sum of potentials from the other 11 B charges.

But without knowing their distances, this can't be calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual terms, leading to U =5.5e-27 J, but again, that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement has a typo, and the charges are 13 identical particles each with charge e, not 2e. Let me see what that would do.

If each charge is e, then each term would be (k e^2 )/(2) *12.

Which would be 12 * (8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2 ) /2.

So (8.988e9 * (2.56e-38) ) /2 = (2.30e-28)/2 =1.15e-28 per term.

12 terms:13.8e-28 =1.38e-27 J.

Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as considering the system as 13 charges, each contributing to the potential, but I'm not seeing it.

Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option C, 7.056e-27 J, which is approximately 1.28 times my initial calculation. So perhaps the problem is considering that each B charge's potential energy includes both the fixed charge and all other B charges, but with a certain arrangement that leads to this factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each B charge is at a distance of 2 m from P and from each other, which isn't possible, but let's compute it.

Assuming each B charge is 2 m away from P and 2 m away from every other B charge, which would require a very specific arrangement. In that case, each B charge would have 11 other B charges at 2 m, and the fixed charge at 2 m.

So for each B charge, the potential energy would be:

U_i = [k*(2e)*(2e)]/2 (from A) + sum over j (k*(2e)^2)/2 (from each B_j).

So U_i = (4e² k)/2 * [1 + 11].

Because there are 12 B charges, each interacting with 11 others.

Wait, no, each B charge interacts with A and 11 other B charges.

So U_i = (k*(2e)^2)/(2) * (1 + 11) = (k*(4e²)/2) *12 = (2e² k) *12.

Wait, k=8.988e9, e=1.6e-19.

So e²=2.56e-38.

So 2e²k =2 *2.56e-38 *8.988e9 = (5.12e-38) *8.988e9 = approx 4.603e-28 J.

Multiply by 12: 55.236e-28=5.5236e-27 J.

But that's the same as before. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering each B charge's potential energy as the sum of all other charges, including A and the other B charges.

So for each B charge, the potential energy is (2e) * V, where V is the potential at that point due to all other charges.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's impossible to compute V.

Given that, perhaps the intended solution is to compute only the A-B terms, leading to 5.5e-27 J, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for Coulomb's constant. For example, sometimes k is approximated as 9e9 N·m²/C².

Let's recalculate using k=9e9.

Each U_i = (9e9) * (3.2e-19)^2 / 2.

(3.2e-19)^2=10.24e-38.

9e9 *10.24e-38 =9.216e-28.

Divide by 2:4.608e-28.

Multiply by12:55.296e-28=5.5296e-27 J.

Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 B charges are arranged such that each is at a distance of 2 m from each other, which would require them to be on a circle with radius r, but this is getting too speculative.

Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option C, 7.056e-27 J, which is approximately the sum of the A-B and B-B terms if each B-B pair is at a certain distance.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, I can't compute it, so perhaps the problem expects the answer to be option C.


To determine the minimum energy of the system, we calculate the total electric potential energy, which is the sum of contributions from all pairs of charges. The system consists of 13 identical charges, each with charge \( q = 2e \), where \( e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \). The 13th charge is fixed at point \( P \), and the other 12 charges are constrained to stay at a distance of \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \) from \( P \).

### Key Contributions to Potential Energy
1. **Potential Energy Between the Fixed Charge and the 12 Moving Charges (A-B Contributions):**
   Each of the 12 charges interacts with the fixed charge. The potential energy for each pair is given by:
   \[
   U_{\text{A-B}} = \frac{k \cdot q^2}{r}
   \]
   where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \). Substituting \( q = 2e \), \( e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \), and \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \):
   \[
   q^2 = (2e)^2 = 4e^2 = 4 \cdot (1.6 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 1.024 \times 10^{-37} \, \text{C}^2
   \]
   \[
   U_{\text{A-B}} = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (1.024 \times 10^{-37})}{2} = 4.6015 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{J}
   \]
   Since there are 12 such pairs:
   \[
   U_{\text{A-B, total}} = 12 \cdot 4.6015 \times 10^{-28} = 5.5218 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
   \]

2. **Potential Energy Between the 12 Moving Charges (B-B Contributions):**
   The 12 charges are constrained to stay at \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \) from \( P \), but their mutual distances depend on their arrangement. Without explicit information about their spatial distribution, the problem likely assumes that the mutual distances are approximately \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \). The number of B-B pairs is:
   \[
   \binom{12}{2} = 66
   \]
   Each B-B pair contributes:
   \[
   U_{\text{B-B}} = \frac{k \cdot q^2}{r} = 4.6015 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{J}
   \]
   Thus, the total B-B contribution is:
   \[
   U_{\text{B-B, total}} = 66 \cdot 4.6015 \times 10^{-28} = 3.03699 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
   \]

3. **Total Potential Energy:**
   The total potential energy of the system is the sum of the A-B and B-B contributions:
   \[
   U_{\text{total}} = U_{\text{A-B, total}} + U_{\text{B-B, total}}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   U_{\text{total}} = 5.5218 \times 10^{-27} + 3.03699 \times 10^{-26} = 3.58917 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
   \]

### Comparison with Options
The calculated total potential energy does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest match to the A-B contribution alone (ignoring B-B terms) is approximately \( 5.52 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \). Option C (\( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)) is about 1.28 times this value, suggesting that the problem may implicitly include additional factors or assumptions about the mutual distances of the B charges.

Given the ambiguity in the problem and the provided options, the most reasonable choice is:

**ANSWER: C**
