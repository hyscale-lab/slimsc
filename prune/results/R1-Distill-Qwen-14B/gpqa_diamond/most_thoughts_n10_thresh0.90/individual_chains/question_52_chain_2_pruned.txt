Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again.

The question is about a star with certain parameters—1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When it doesn't have dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The main point is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. Oh wait, when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which the ratio changes.

Hmm. So the ratio is n1/n2, I think, where n1 and n2 are the number of atoms in level 1 and level 2. And this ratio decreases when there are spots. So I guess when the star is spotted, the ratio goes down compared to when it's not spotted.

Wait, but the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So it's the ratio without spots divided by the ratio with spots.

I remember that the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*T) ). Oh right, because higher energy states have fewer particles, so the ratio depends exponentially on the energy difference and temperature.

But wait, the effective temperature of the star has changed because of the spots. So the overall temperature of the photosphere is lower when spots are present. Oh, but wait, the spots are cooler regions, right? So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the average photospheric temperature goes down. But how does that affect the ionization or excitation of Ti?

Wait, the photosphere is in LTE, so each region (spot or non-spot) emits according to its local T. But the overall observed Teff is given as 5500 K. But how does that affect the average ratio? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the temperature in the photosphere when there are spots is lower on average, so the overall T is 5500 K. But when the spots aren't there, it's 6000 K. So perhaps the problem is about how the ratio n1/n2 depends on temperature.

Wait, the problem says that in the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of Ti neutral atoms in two energy levels, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has lower Teff, the ratio goes down. So the ratio without spots is higher than with spots.

So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

From the Boltzmann equation, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k*T) ) [Wait wait, wait. Let me get the equation right. The Boltzmann distribution is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ) ). So if E2 > E1, then the exponent is negative. So higher energy states have lower populations.

So the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ) ) ?

Wait, no. Let me write it correctly. The formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if E_i > E_j, then E_i - E_j is positive, so the exponential is exp(-ΔE/(kT)), which is less than 1. So n_i < n_j when E_i > E_j, which makes sense.

So in this problem, the two energy levels are level 1 and level 2. Let's say level 2 is higher in energy. So E2 > E1. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ) ) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1.

Wait, no, I think I got that backward. Let me correct: n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ) ). So if E1 < E2, then E1-E2 is negative, so the exponent becomes positive. So n1/n2 would be (g1/g2) * exp( ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2-E1. So when ΔE is positive, the ratio increases as T increases.

Wait, but wait. Let's say E2 is higher than E1. So E2
