Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex? The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, so I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, and the solution is 0.02 M in this complex. I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²+], in the solution.

Wait, the formation constant, K, for a complex is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where the metal ion and EDTA combine to form the complex. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

Right, the formation constant K is given by K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Since K is large (5e10), that means the complex is very stable. So the concentration of the complex is much higher than the concentrations of the individual ions.

But in this problem, we're told that the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, I think that all the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex. But wait, no, because the complex can dissociate a little, especially if K is so large. But wait, wait. Since K is so big, the dissociation should be minimal. So [Ca²+] would be very low.

Wait, but how do I approach this? Let me think about the dissociation. Let's denote the concentration of the complex as 0.02 M. So initially, [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] are close to zero, but due to dissociation, they'll have tiny concentrations.

Let me set up the equation. Let's say that x is the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates from the complex. Then, the concentration of EDTA^4- would be x as well, because each complex that dissociates releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

So, according to the formation constant:

K = [CaEDTA^2-] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

We can plug in the values. [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 - x. But since K is so large, x will be very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So we can approximate [CaEDTA^2-] as 0.02 M.

So the equation becomes:

5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x)

Which simplifies to:

5e10 = 0.02 / (x²)

We can solve for x²:

x² = 0.02 / (5e10) 

Let me calculate that. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2 /5) * 1e-12. 2/5 is 0.4, so 0.4e-12, which is 4e-13.

Wait, no, wait. Wait 0.02 is 2e-2, right? So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12. 2/5 is 0.4, so 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Wait, 0.4e-12 is 4e-13? Because 0.4 is 4e-1, so 4e-1 * 1e-12 is 4e-13. Yeah.

So x² = 4e-13. Taking square root, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. Wait, wait, wait, no, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5.

Wait, 1e-13 is 10^-13. The square root is 10^(-13/2) = 10^-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7.

So x is 2 * 3.16e-7, which is about 6.32e-7 M. Hmm, but wait, let me calculate that again.

Wait, x squared is 4e-13, so x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Let me compute 2e-6.5. Wait, 10^-6.5 is 3.16e-7, so 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7. So approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that
