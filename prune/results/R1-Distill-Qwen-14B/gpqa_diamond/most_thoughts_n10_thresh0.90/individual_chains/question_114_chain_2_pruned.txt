Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for two reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, butanone reacting with cyanide... I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition. NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So in a ketone, the carbonyl group (C=O) is attacked by the cyanide ion. But wait, what's the product here?

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would normally give (CH3)2C(OH)CN, but wait, no, that's not the product given. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write the structures:

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Or maybe it's a substitution. Wait, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide in something like a nucleophilic addition, the product is a cyanohydrin. So yes, the product would be a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So after adding CN-, it becomes (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Let me count the carbons. Butanone has four carbons, so the product must be 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, but butanenitrile is a five-carbon chain with a nitrile. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So that's a four-carbon chain where the second carbon is a hydroxyl and a methyl group, and a nitrile group.

Wait, the structure of butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when we add CN-, the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Let me count the carbons: The original ketone is 3 carbons (butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is propyl group with the carbonyl on C2). Wait, no, butan-2-one is CH2(CO)CH2CH3? No, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a three-carbon chain with the carbonyl on the second carbon.

Wait, but butanone has four carbons. Oh wait, no. Butan-2-one is methylacetone, which is (CH3)2CO, which has three carbons. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Wait, butane has four carbons. So butan-2-one would be (CH2)2(CO), but that's not possible. Oh wait, butan-2-one is actually (CH3)COCH2CH3, no, that's pentan-2-one. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, nomenclature: butan-2
