Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question describes a state vector |alpha> for an electron. It's given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think are the standard spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis.

Then, there's an operator whose matrix elements Aij are given as hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. I need to find two things: the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator, and the average value (expectation value) of that operator.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving two probabilities and an average value. My job is to pick the correct one.

Let me break this down. First, I need to find the eigenstates of the given operator because the probabilities are for measuring the system in those states. Then, I have to calculate the probabilities based on the state |alpha> and find the expectation value.

Wait, but wait—the operator's matrix is given. Let me try to write it out. The operator A is a 2x2 matrix because it's acting on a two-level system (up and down). The elements are:

For a 2x2 matrix, the indices i and j can be 1 and 2 (or 0 and 1, but probably 1 and 2 here). The diagonal elements (where i=j) are zero. The off-diagonal elements (i≠j) are hbar/2. So the matrix would look like:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

Hmm, that's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. Wait, no, wait: for 2x2, when i≠j, so A_12 and A_21 are hbar/2, and A_11 and A_22 are zero. So the matrix is:

[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0 ]

I think I remember that this type of matrix is a spin-flip operator or something related to the Pauli matrices. Oh, wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if I multiply that by hbar/2, I get exactly this matrix A. So A = (hbar/2) * sigma_x, where sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix.

But wait, the eigenstates of sigma_x are not the same as the spin-up and spin-down along z. The eigenstates of sigma_x are along the x-axis. So, the eigenstates of A would be the same as the eigenstates of sigma_x, since A is proportional to sigma_x.

So the eigenstates of operator A are the |+x> and |-x> states, where |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Or wait, maybe the signs are different. Let me think. The eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> = 1/sqrt(2)(|up> + |down>) and |-x> = 1/sqrt(2)(|up> - |down>). So the eigenstates of A are the same, but scaled by a factor.

But wait, the operator A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, so its eigenvalues would be ± (hbar/2) * 1, because sigma_x has eigenvalues ±1. So the eigenvalues of A are ± hbar/2.

Now, the problem is to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of A when the system is in state |alpha>, and compute the expectation value of A.

So first, I need to write |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A. Because the probabilities will be the square of the coefficients when |alpha> is expressed in this eigenbasis.

Wait, but let's proceed step by step. Let me first normalize |alpha>, as it's given to be proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. So, the state is proportional—so it's a vector in two dimensions, and we can find its normalization factor.

The vector has components (1+i, 2 -i). The norm squared is the sum of |1+i|^2 and |2-i|^2.

Calculating |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

|2 - i|^2: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 = 5.

So the total squared norm is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Thus, |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A. Let's denote the eigenstates of A as |+x> and |-x>, which I mentioned earlier.

So, |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, wait—actually, wait. Let me write that correctly. The eigenstates of sigma_x (and hence A) are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2),

|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait, sometimes it's written as (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) for |+x>, but I think that's correct.

So, I can express |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>.

Let me set |alpha> = c1 |+x> + c2 |-x>.

I can write this as:

|alpha> = c1 * (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + c2 * (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Grouping terms, the coefficients for |up> and |down> are:

( c1 / sqrt(2) + c2 / sqrt(2) ) |up> +

( c1 / sqrt(2) - c2 / sqrt(2) ) |down> 

But from earlier, |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So, equating coefficients:

c1/sqrt(2) + c2/sqrt(2) = (1 + i)/sqrt(7)

c1/sqrt(2) - c2/sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

Let me denote these as equations (1) and (2):

(1) (c1 + c2)/sqrt(2) = (1 + i)/sqrt(7)

(2) (c1 - c2)/sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

Let me solve for c1 and c2.

Adding equations (1) and (2):

[ (c1 + c2) + (c1 - c2) ] / sqrt(2) = [ (1+i) + (2-i) ] / sqrt(7)

=> (2c1)/sqrt(2) = (3) / sqrt(7)

So, 2c1 = (3 * sqrt(2)) / sqrt(7)

Wait, wait, because sqrt(2) is in the denominator. Let me compute:

(2c1) = (3) / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) ?

Wait, no. Let me compute the right-hand side correctly.

Wait, the left side is 2c1 / sqrt(2) = 3/sqrt(7).

So, 2c1 = 3/sqrt(7) * sqrt(2).

So, c1 = (3 * sqrt(2)) / (2 * sqrt(7)) ) → (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)).

Similarly, subtracting equation (2) from equation (1):

[ (c1 + c2) - (c1 - c2) ] / sqrt(2) = [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] / sqrt(7)

=> (2c2)/sqrt(2) = ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(7)

So,

2c2 = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7 )

So,

c2 = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) ] / ( 2 sqrt(7) )

Hmm, perhaps I can write sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) as 1/sqrt(7/2), but maybe it's easier to compute the coefficients as is.

But perhaps there's a better way. Alternatively, I can solve for c1 and c2 directly.

Another approach: Let me express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Express |alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>.

So,

a = < +x | alpha >
b = < -x | alpha >

Since |+x> and |-x> are orthonormal, the coefficients can be found by inner product.

So, let me compute a:

a = < +x | alpha > = [ (1, 1) / sqrt(2) ] multiplied by |alpha> which has components [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

Wait, the inner product is: (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Because |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), so the inner product would be (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up|alpha> + <down|alpha> ).

Wait, more precisely, < +x | alpha > is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]

So,

a = [ (1 + i + 2 - i) ] / sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)

Wait, wait, no: actually,

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| alpha> + <down| alpha> ]

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1 +i)/sqrt(7) + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]

Adding the numerators: (1 +i + 2 -i) = 3. So,

a = (3) / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) ) = 3 / sqrt(14)

Similarly for b:

b = < -x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| alpha> - <down| alpha> ]

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1 +i)/sqrt(7) - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Subtracting the numerators: (1 +i) - (2 -i) = (1 -2) + (i +i) = (-1) + 2i.

So,

b = ( (-1 + 2i) ) / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) ) = (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14)

So, |alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>

a = 3 / sqrt(14), and b = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)

Now, to find the probabilities: the probability of measuring +x is |a|^2, and the probability of measuring -x is |b|^2.

Compute |a|^2: (3)^2 / 14 = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

Compute |b|^2: | (-1 + 2i) |^2 is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5. So, |b|^2 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Wait a minute, but looking at the options, I only see 0.64, 0.36 in option A, 0.54, 0.46 in B, etc. Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is roughly 0.64, and 5/14 is about 0.3571, about 0.36. So that would match option A's first two numbers: 0.64 and 0.36.

But wait, let me check. 9+5=14, right? So 9/14 is about 0.642857, which is about 0.64. 5/14 is approximately 0.3571, which is about 0.36. So the probabilities are about 64% and 36%. So that's option A's first two values. Now, the average value.

The expectation value of operator A is given by <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, and |alpha> expressed in the eigenbasis of A would have expectation value (hbar/2)( |a|^2 - |b|^2 ), but wait, wait.

Wait, no. Since A has eigenvalues ± hbar/2 for |+x> and |-x>, the expectation value is (hbar/2) [ |a|^2 - |b|^2 ].

Because for each eigenstate, the contribution is the eigenvalue multiplied by the probability. So, the expectation value is (hbar/2)( |a|^2 - |b|^2 ).

Wait, because |a|^2 is the probability of the +eigenvalue (hbar/2) and |b|^2 is the probability of the -eigenvalue (-hbar/2).

So, the expectation value is (hbar/2) * ( |a|^2 - |b|^2 ).

Compute |a|^2 = 9/14, |b|^2 =5/14.

So, |a|^2 - |b|^2 = (9/14) - (5/14) ) =4/14 = 2/7.

So, <A> = (hbar/2) * (2/7) ) = hbar/(7).

So the expectation value is hbar/7.

Now, looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. So that matches.

Wait, let me check the other options quickly. Option D says 0.61 and 0.29, which would sum to about 0.9, but 0.61+0.29=0.9, which is less than 1. So that can't be. The probabilities must sum to 1, so the correct sum must be 1.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, and 5/14 is about 0.357143. So 0.642857 + 0.357143 = 1. So the probabilities are correct for option A.

So the answer should be option A: 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7.

Wait, but another thing to check: did I make a mistake in computing the expectation value?

Alternative approach: Compute the expectation value directly using the state |alpha> and the matrix of A.

Because A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

The expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Expressed in the z-basis, |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So, compute:

<alpha| A |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1-i), (2+i) ] * A * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i), (2 -i) ]^T.

Wait, because |alpha> is a column vector, and <alpha| is the conjugate transpose.

So, the calculation is:

(1/sqrt(7)) [ (1-i) (2+i) ] multiplied by A multiplied
