Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh right, |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. So, this is a spin-1/2 system, I think. But wait, the question is about the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j, else 0. Oh, interesting.

Wait, so the operator matrix looks like this for a 2x2 system. Since we're dealing with two states, |up> and |down>, the matrix would have zero on the diagonal and hbar/2 off-diagonal. So the matrix A is:

[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0 ]

Hmm, that's a 2x2 matrix. I remember that such a matrix might represent an operator that's related to the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A would be (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because each element is hbar/2 if i≠j.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are often used in spin operators. So maybe this operator A is something like (hbar/2) σ_x, since σ_x has 0s on the diagonal and 1s off-diagonal, multiplied by hbar/2.

Wait, but the question is about the eigenstates of this operator A. So I need to find the eigenstates of A, then find the probabilities of |alpha> being in each of those eigenstates.

Alternatively, since A is given, perhaps it's easier to find its eigenstates. Let me think: for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation.

The matrix for A is:
0   hbar/2
hbar/2 0

The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(A - λI) = 0.

So,

| -λ      hbar/2       |
| hbar/2  -λ        |  = 0

The determinant is λ² - (hbar/2)^2 = 0.

So λ² = (hbar²)/4 → λ = ± hbar/2.

Wait, so the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2. That makes sense for the Pauli matrices, as the eigenvalues are ±1. So in this case, the eigenvalues are ± hbar/2.

The eigenstates for A would then be the same as those for σ_x, right? Because A is (hbar/2) σ_x. So the eigenstates are the same as the eigenstates of σ_x. The eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are equally superpositions of |up> and |down>.

Wait, I remember that the eigenstates of σ_x can be written as (|up> + |down>)/√2 and (|up> - |down>)/√2, because σ_x flips the spin states.

But wait, σ_x is diagonal in the X basis, right? So the eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, where |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/√2 and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/√2.

So, for our operator A, the eigenstates are the same as these, because A is proportional to σ_x.

The problem is to find the probability of measuring the state |alpha> in each of these eigenstates.

Wait a second! So the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. But first, we need to normalize it, right? Because the question says it's proportional, not necessarily normalized.

So let's compute the normalization factor. Let me denote |alpha> as (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, but it's not normalized. So the norm is |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2.

Calculating |1+i|²: (1^2 + 1^2) = 2.

|2 - i|²: (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 + 1 = 5.

So the total norm is 2 + 5 = 7. So |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> divided by sqrt(7), because it must be normalized.

Wait, wait, but the proportionality is given as |alpha> proportional to that. So the actual state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, and then we should normalize it. So the state is |a> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the next step is to express |a> in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |-x>.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the projection of |a> onto each eigenstate of A.

Each eigenstate |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/√2, and |−x> is (|up> − |down>)/√2.

Wait, let me correct that: the eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/
