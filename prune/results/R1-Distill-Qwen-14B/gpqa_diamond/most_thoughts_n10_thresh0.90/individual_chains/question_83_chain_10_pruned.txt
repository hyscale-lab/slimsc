Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work it out.

Alright, the problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So, first, I need to find the new concentration after dilution. I remember that dilution follows the formula C1V1 = C2V2. Oh wait, yeah, so C1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. The total volume after adding 20 cm³ of water is 40 cm³. So plugging in: 0.05 * 20 = C2 * 40. That gives C2 as (0.05 * 20) /40. Let me calculate that: 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the concentration of acetic acid after dilution is 0.025 M.

Next, we're titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. I'll need to calculate both.

First, let's figure out the equivalence point. To find that, I should calculate the moles of acetic acid and then see how much NaOH is needed to neutralize it. 

Moles of acetic acid initially: Molarity * Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M * 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) equals 0.001 moles. After dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M but the volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L), so moles are 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles as well. Because the dilution didn't change the number of moles, just the concentration.

Since the reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH is 1:1 (CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O), the moles of NaOH needed would be 0.001 moles. 

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L or 10 cm³. That means the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Now, the problem asks for pH at 25% titration. So that's 25% of the equivalence volume. Oh wait, no, does 25% refer to the total volume or the amount of titrant added? I think it's the latter—25% of the equivalence point volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, but I'm a little confused. Another approach is that 25% titration refers to the amount of acid that's been neutralized. So, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. Let me think. If the equivalence point is 10 cm³, then 25% of that is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So, I'll go with that.

At 25% titration, the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since the reaction is 1:1, this converts 0.00025 moles of CH3COOH to CH3COO^-.

The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001. So moles remaining of acetic acid are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And moles of acetate ions (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.00025.

Now, the total volume is the original solution (40 cm³) plus the added NaOH (2.5 cm³) → 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

The concentrations are [Acetic acid] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M, and [Acetate] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]). The pKa is the negative log of Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is about 4.7368.

So plugging in: pH = 4.7368 + log(0.005882/0.017647). Let me compute that ratio. 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. The log of 0.333 is approximately -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.7368 - 0.477 ≈ 4.2598, roughly 4.26.

Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value. Option D is 4.57 and option B is 3.17. So maybe the 25% point is around 4.26.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Since sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid and strong base, the solution will be basic.

The concentration of acetate ions is moles / total volume. Moles of acetate are 0.001, and total volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ → 0.05 L. So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration is 0.02 M. Let's set up the ICE table.

Initial: [CH3COO^-] = 0.02, [CH3COOH] = 0, [OH^-] = 0.

Change: -x, +x, +x.

Equilibrium: 0.02 - x, x, x.

Kb = (x^2)/(0.02 - x) ≈ x²/(0.02) → since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02.

So x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 → x² ≈ 5.405e-10 *0.02 → 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

[OH^-] is approximately 1.04e-5. So pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. pH is 14 - 4.98 = 9.02. Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are A) 8.52, B) 6.73, D) 6.92.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's recalculate Kb. Oh wait, Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of x. Let me recalculate x squared: 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. Square root is about 1.04e-5, which gives [OH^-] = 1.04e-5. pOH is about 4.98, so pH is 9.02.

But looking at the options, none have 9.02. Hmm. Maybe I messed up the initial moles or concentration?

Wait, wait. After adding 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, the total volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³. Moles of acetate are 0.001, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the hydrolysis of acetate more accurately. Let me set up the equation properly without the approximation.

Kb = x²/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assume x is << 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. Then x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 =1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5.

So, I think my calculation is right, but none of the options have pH near 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait, another possibility: maybe I'm supposed to calculate the pH at the equivalence point using another method. Alternatively, perhaps the initial dilution step wasn't correctly accounted for.

Wait, let me recheck. The initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid. When titrated, the equivalence point is when all of it is neutralized. So moles of acetic acid: 0.025 M * 0.04 L =0.001 moles. So, correct.

So, at equivalence, it's 0.001 moles of acetate in 0.05 L → 0.02 M. So, that's correct.

Hmm, maybe I should use the exact solution for Kb. Let's try solving for x without approximation.

x² = Kb*(0.02 -x) → x² + Kb x - 2 Kb =0.

Wait, no: The equation is x² = Kb (0.02 - x). So, x² + Kb x - 2 Kb *0.02 =0 → x² + (5.405e-10)x - (2 *5.405e-10 *0.02) =0.

Wait, 2 Kb *0.02 is 2 *5.405e-10 *0.02 = 2.162e-11. So, equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -2.162e-11 =0.

Use quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a). Here a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -2.162e-11.

Discriminant: (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*2.162e-11 ≈ 2.921e-19 +8.648e-11 → approximately 8.648e-11.

So sqrt(8.648e-11) ≈ 2.941e-5.

So x ≈ [ -5.405e-10 + 2.941e-5 ] / 2. Since the negative solution doesn't make sense, we take the positive. So (2.941e-5 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈ (approx 2.94e-5)/2 → 1.47e-5. So [OH^-] ≈1.47e-5, which is a pOH of about 4.83. So pH is 14 -4.83=9.17. Hmm, that doesn't match any option.

Wait, maybe I should have considered temperature? The problem states 25°C, so Kw is 1e-14, so that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Wait, maybe I confused the initial solution. Oh wait, the initial solution is a mixture of acetic acid and water. Wait, but after the equivalence point, all the acid is neutralized, so the solution is just acetate and sodium ions. So the calculation should be correct. Hmm.

Looking back at the options, none have pH around 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculations, maybe in the moles or something else.

Wait, perhaps the question isn't about the equivalence point but about the half-equivalence point. No, the question clearly says equivalence point.

Alternatively, perhaps the dilution is being considered differently. Let me double-check the dilution. Original volume is 20 cm³, 0.05 M. Adding 20 cm³ of water. So total volume 40 cm³. So Molarity = (0.05 *20)/(40) = 0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps when I'm adding 25% of the NaOH volume, I should consider the total solution's volume correctly. Let me recalculate the 25% titration.

So, 25% of the equivalence volume (10 cm³) is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So total volume is 40 +2.5=42.5 cm³.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M *0.0025 L=0.00025 mol. Which reacts with 0.00025 mol of acetic acid to produce 0.00025 mol of acetate.

So moles of acetic acid left: 0.001 -0.00025=0.00075 mol.

Concentration of acetic acid: 0.00075 /0.0425=0.017647 M.

Concentration of acetate: 0.00025 /0.0425 ≈0.005882 M.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log (0.005882/0.017647). Ratio is about 0.333. Log(1/3)= -0.477. pKa is about 4.7368. So pH=4.7368-0.477=4.259, which is about 4.26. So that's the first value.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26;8.52, D is 4.57;6.92.

But earlier, the equivalence point calculation gave me a pH around 9.17, which isn't in any options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the pH at the equivalence point using another method. For the equivalence point of a weak acid and strong base, the solution is a salt of the conjugate base, so acetate in water. But I could also consider using the formula for the pH of a weak base solution, as I did before.

Wait, but another possibility is that I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb or the hydrolysis. Let me recheck.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake is that at equivalence, the solution is not just acetate but also includes the sodium ions, but sodium is a spectator ion and doesn't affect pH. So that part is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps when calculating Kb, I should have used the exact Ka value, not an approximation. Let me re-calculate Kb accurately.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa is log(1.85e-5) is about 4.73 (since log(1.85)=0.267, so 4.73).

Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85)*1e-9 → 0.5405e-9 =5.405e-10. Correct.

So, perhaps the mistake lies elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the half-equivalence point pH as one of the options. But no, the first part is 25% titration
