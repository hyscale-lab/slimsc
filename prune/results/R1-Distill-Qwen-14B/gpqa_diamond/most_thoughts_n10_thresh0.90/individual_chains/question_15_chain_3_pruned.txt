Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the probability of them transiting in front of their host stars. I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have the same minimum masses, and both have circular orbits. The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2 takes, say, 100 days, Planet_1 would take about 33 days. Wait, no, wait. No, the period is the time it takes to orbit, so if Planet_1's period is shorter, it's closer to the star. Oh right, because shorter orbital period means closer in.

We also know the masses of the host stars. The star with Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But interestingly, both stars have the same radius. Hmm, that's because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but has the same radius. So, same size but different masses.

The researchers want to observe the planet with the highest probability of transiting. So, I need to figure out which planet has a higher chance of transiting. Because if they're observing, they can only spend limited time, so they pick the one more likely to transit.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting depends on the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size. The formula for transit probability is roughly R_star divided by the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (a), squared? Or wait, wait. Let me think. The transit probability (P) is given by the ratio of the star's radius (R*) to the semi-major axis (a) of the planet's orbit. So P = (R*/a) * (1 / (1 + m_p/M*)) ), where m_p is the planet mass and M* is the star's mass. But wait, in this case, both planets have the same minimum masses, but their star masses are different.

Wait, but wait. The exact formula for the transit probability is P = (R*/a) * (1/(1 + (m_p/M*)))) )? Or is it something else? I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is given by (R* / a) * (1 / sqrt(1 - eÂ²)), but since both orbits are circular, e=0, so that part is 1. So the probability is P = (R* / a) * something else?

Wait, maybe I should think about the transit probability formula more carefully. So the transit probability is the area of the star's disk as seen from the planet's position, divided by the area of the planet's orbital path? No, wait, I think that's not exactly right. Alternatively, the probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis, but squared? Or perhaps it's (R*/a)^2 multiplied by something else.

Wait, no, the transit probability is actually the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view. Oh right! The transit probability is calculated as (R*/a) * (1 / (1 + m_p/(M*)))) ), but I might
