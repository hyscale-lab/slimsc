Alright, so I've got this problem about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Hmm, okay. So the number of excited iron atoms in star_1 is double that in star_2. I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution here. Right, the Boltzmann factor tells us how the population of different energy states in a system relates to temperature.

The energy difference between the levels is given as about 1.38e-23 J. Wait, 1.38 is a familiar number. Oh right, that's approximately the Boltzmann constant (k) multiplied by some value. Let me recall: the Boltzmann constant k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, exactly 1.38e-23 J/K. So the energy difference ΔE is k multiplied by a temperature difference term? Or maybe it's just given so we can use it in the equations.

Since the problem says the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), I can apply the Boltzmann equation for populations. The formula for the ratio of populations in two energy levels is N2/N1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where N1 is the lower level and N2 the higher, but wait, wait. I think it's more precise to say that the ratio depends on the energy levels. If level 1 is lower than level 2, then N2/N1 = exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ).

Wait, but in this problem, the higher level is more excited, so star_1 has twice as many excited atoms as star_2. Let's define the excited state as level 2 and the lower as level 1. So for star_1, the ratio N2_1/N1_1 = 2, since it's twice as excited. For star_2, the ratio is N2_2/N1_2 = let's say, x.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the problem says that the energy difference between the considered energy levels is 1.38e-23 J. So that's ΔE = E2 - E1 = 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, but the Boltzmann factor is exponential of ( -ΔE/(k T) ), right? So for each star, we can write the ratio of excited atoms to the lower ones as exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So for star 1, N2_1/N1_1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star 2, N2_2/N1_2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

Wait, no, wait. If the atoms are in the excited state, which is higher, so the population ratio N2/N1 is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So if a star has higher temperature, the exponent is less negative, so the ratio is higher. So a hotter star would have more atoms in the higher energy level compared to a cooler one.

In this question, star_1 has twice as many in the excited state as star_2. So N2_1/N1_1 = 2 * (N2_2/N1_2). Because star_1's excited state is twice that of star_2's.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that the excited level in star_1 is twice as excited as in star_2. So perhaps for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or lower state) is given. So N2/N1 for star_1 is twice as much as that for star_2.

So let me write that as (N2_1 / N1_1) = 2 * (N2_2 / N1_2)

But each of these ratios is given by the Boltzmann factor. So:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, because N2_1/N1_1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and same for star 2. So:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But wait, no. Because if star_1 has twice as many in the excited state, perhaps it's N2_1 = 2 * N2_2.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think. Let's say for star_2, the ratio is r = N2_2 / N1_2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Then for star_1, the ratio is R = N2_1 / N1_1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

The problem states that R = 2r, because star_1's excited level is twice that of star_2. So:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Hmm, but wait, that can't be correct because if T1 is higher than T2, then the exponent would be less negative, making R higher than r. So if R is 2r, then T1 must be higher than T2, but let's see.

Wait, let's take the natural logarithm of both sides to solve for T1 and T2.

ln(R) = ln(2r)

So:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + ln(r)

But r is exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ), so ln(r) = -ΔE/(k T2 )

So substituting:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2 )

Multiply both sides by -k to get:

ΔE / T1 = -k ln(2) + ΔE / T2

Wait, no, perhaps rearrange the equation:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2) )

Hmm, right. So moving the terms:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ -1/T1 + 1/T2 ] = ln(2)

Wait, that's the same as:

ΔE/(k) [ ( - T2 + T1 ) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Because [1/T2 - 1/T1 ] equals (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Wait, let me compute:

[ -1/T1 + 1/T2 ] = 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So substituting back:

(ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But wait, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k (since k = 1.38e-23 J/K). So ΔE = k.

So substituting, (k/k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Which simplifies to:

(1) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, let me write that as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Which can also be written as:

ln(2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, no, because (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1) ?

Let me check:

(1/T2 -1/T1) = ( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 )

Yes, correct. So ln(2) = (1/T2 -1/T1 )

Which can be rearranged as:

ln(2) = ( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 )

So looking at the options, which one matches this?

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which matches exactly.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Yes, that's exactly what we have.

So the correct equation is D.


The problem involves two stars, star_1 and star_2, where the number of iron atoms in an excited energy level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J, which matches the Boltzmann constant \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( N_2 \) and \( N_1 \) are the populations of the excited and lower energy levels, respectively, and \( T \) is the temperature of the star.

For star_1, the ratio of excited to lower energy levels is \( \frac{N_{2,1}}{N_{1,1}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) \), and for star_2, it is \( \frac{N_{2,2}}{N_{1,2}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right) \). Since star_1 has twice as many excited atoms as star_2, we have:

\[
\frac{N_{2,1}}{N_{1,1}} = 2 \cdot \frac{N_{2,2}}{N_{1,2}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann ratios:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} + \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \( \Delta E / k \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Since \( \Delta E = k \), this simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), we get:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A**: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_2}{T_1} \) does not match the derived equation.
- **Option B**: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 + T_2}{T_1 T_2} \) is inconsistent with the derived relationship.
- **Option C**: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{(T_1 T_2)^2} \) introduces an incorrect denominator.

Thus, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
