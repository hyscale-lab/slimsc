Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Then, there are several products formed through different reactions, and ultimately, I need to determine the coupling pattern of a specific hydrogen in the NMR of product 3.

First, I'll break down each step and see what's happening.

Step 1: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C gives a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR data for product 1 is provided, along with an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.

Hmm, I remember that KOH can act as a base, and when dibromides are heated with strong bases, elimination reactions can occur, forming alkenes. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons? Wait, no. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3 positions are across a bridged structure. So when KOH is used, it's likely to cause dehydrohalogenation, eliminating HBr twice to form a diene or something else?

Wait, but the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group. Oh, so maybe it's an elimination followed by some kind of rearrangement? Alternatively, maybe an epoxide? No, wait, epoxides have different IR regions. Another thought: when two adjacent bromides are eliminated, perhaps forming a ketone. Or wait, maybe it's a Dieckmann-type elimination if it were a cyclic ester, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, another possibility is that KOH could cause a nucleophilic substitution. But with two bromines, perhaps a double substitution. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromines on adjacent carbons? No, on different carbons. Oh wait, the structure of adamantane is a four-fused cyclohexane rings in a diamond shape. So 1 and 3 positions are across from each other in one of the rings.

When heated with KOH, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH group. But why the IR would show a carbonyl then? Or maybe each Br is eliminated as HBr, leading to the formation of a ketone. Let me think: If two adjacent H are abstracted, leading to each elimination as HBr, perhaps forming a double bond. But wait, let me think about the structure. Adamantane has a structure where each carbon is connected to two or three others in a rigid framework. So if two Brs are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond between those two carbons.

Wait, but if it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the Brs are on carbons that are not adjacent. Because in the structure of adamantane, the 1 and 3 positions are not next to each other. So, perhaps each Br is on a different bridgehead. So when KOH is used, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH group, but that would form a diol. But the IR here shows 1720, which is a carbonyl. So maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, another reaction: when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halides) are treated with a strong base like KOH, they undergo dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But in this case, the dihalide isn't vicinal. So maybe it's a double elimination, but leaving a ketone? Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: if each Br is on a bridgehead carbon, then eliminating each Br as HBr would form a carbonyl group. Because when you have a bridgehead Br and eliminate HBr, the adjacent carbons form a carbonyl. So for each Br, elimination would give a carbonyl. Wait, but that would require two eliminations, perhaps leading to a diketone? But the product is 1, so maybe that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is eliminated, but the two elimination steps form a single carbonyl group. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the product. The NMR of product 1 shows signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). The 4.79 ppm is probably an -OH group or possibly an -OCH₂- group. But wait, the IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl, which could be a ketone, ester, or maybe an alcohol's O-H stretch? No, O-H in alcohols is usually broad around 3300. So 1720 is more likely a carbonyl, like a ketone.

Wait, but what about if the product is a diketone? Or perhaps an epoxide? Wait, no, the IR for an epoxide isn't around 1720; it's more around 1250-1350 for the C-O-C stretching.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a cycloketone. Wait, perhaps the two Brs are on adjacent bridgeheads, and elimination leads to the formation of a bridge where a carbonyl is formed.

Wait, let me think about the structure. Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings fused together. The 1,3-dibromo positions are on bridgehead carbons opposite each other. So perhaps when KOH is added, each Br is removed by elimination, forming a double bond between the two bridgeheads. Wait, but can a double bond form in the bridgehead? I recall that bridgehead double bonds are allowed in norbornene systems, but in adamantane, it's more rigid. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a ketone.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the initial reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, forming a diene, but that would not explain the carbonyl in IR.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an alcohol, but where's the carbonyl then? Maybe it's a hemiacetal or something else. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the product after KOH is a diol. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH could undergo substitution, replacing each Br with an -OH group. So product 1 would be 1,3-diol adamantane. But then the IR would have O-H stretches, but the given IR is 1720 cm⁻¹, which is more likely a carbonyl.

Another possibility: Maybe it's a pinacol-like rearrangement. The pinacol rearrangement occurs when a 1,2-diol loses water to form a carbonyl. But that's for vicinal diols. Wait, in this case, if product 1 is a vicinal diol after substitution, then pinacol rearrangement could form a ketone. But the starting material was 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So substitution would give 1,3-diol adamantane, which is not vicinal, so pinacol rearrangement wouldn't apply. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone because of a different kind of elimination. Let me think about the structure again. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Bromines on adjacent bridgeheads, perhaps when KOH is added, each Br is eliminated as H
