Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos and the Sun's reactions. Hmm. Let me think. The question is about the flux of neutrinos in two energy bands after the pp-III branch stops. 

Wait, first I need to understand what the pp-III branch is. I remember that the Sun's core has different fusion processes. The pp chain is the proton-proton chain, right? And there are different branches. The pp-I branch is the main one, I think, where two protons fuse and eventually form helium. Then the pp-II and pp-III are other branches of this chain.

Oh, right! The pp-III branch involves the fusion of a proton with a carbon-12 nucleus. That particular step is part of the CNO cycle? Or wait, no, the CNO cycle is a different fusion process altogether. Wait, no, the pp chain has several branches. The pp-I branch doesn't involve carbon, while the pp-III branch does. So the pp-III branch is when a proton adds to a carbon-12 nucleus to form nitrogen-13, which then decays into carbon-13. But wait, that's all part of the proton-proton chain, right? 

But how does this relate to neutrino production? Oh, right, the proton-proton chain in the Sun produces neutrinos. The primary neutrinos are from the decay of beryllium-7 into lithium-7, which emits a positron and a neutrino. But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again. Oh, no, the main neutrinos come from the process where a boron-8 (which is formed in the CNO cycle?) decays into a lithium-7 and emits a neutrino. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up the CNO cycle with the proton-proton chain.

Wait, wait. The pp chain is the dominant fusion process in the Sun. The main pp-I branch produces a helium-4 nucleus, but along the way, there's a step where a beryllium-8 nucleus captures a proton to form boron-8, which then decays into two helium-4 nuclei and emits a neutrino. Oh no, wait, the decay of beryllium-7? Or maybe the decay of boron-8. I'm getting a bit confused.

But the key point is that the pp-III branch is a part of the proton-proton chain that produces neutrinos. So if the pp-III branch stops, the production of those neutrinos would stop. But how does that affect the overall neutrino flux?

The question says that the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh, that's the approximate time it takes for the Sun's photons to travel from the core to the surface. So any changes in the core's fusion would take about 8-9 minutes to affect the surface layers, but for neutrinos, which are produced in the core and can escape almost immediately, the effect would be almost instantaneous.

So if the pp-III branch stops, the production of neutrinos from that branch would stop. But the other reactions, like the pp-I branch and maybe the CNO cycle, continue as usual. But wait, does the CNO cycle produce neutrinos? I think the
