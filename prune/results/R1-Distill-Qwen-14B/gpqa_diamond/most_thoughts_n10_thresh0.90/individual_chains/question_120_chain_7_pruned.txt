Okay, so I've got this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (p) is the reciprocal of distance (d) in parsecs, so p = 1/d. That means as distance increases, parallax decreases.

The question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. Wait, so if I pick a small range of parallax, like from p to p+dp, how many stars are there in that range?

Since stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number density is the same throughout the volume. Oh wait, but how does that translate to parallax?

I think I should consider the volume of space that corresponds to a certain range of parallax. Because parallax is inversely proportional to distance, a small change in parallax (dp) corresponds to a larger change in distance when p is small (since d is large). So the volume element near us (small d, large p) is different from that of distant stars (large d, small p).

Wait, let me think about the volume. Volume in spherical shells, right? The volume element at a distance d is 4πd² dd, where dd is a small change in distance. So for a given parallax p, d = 1/p, so dd = - (1/p²) dp. Oh wait, because as p increases, d decreases. So substituting, the volume element would be 4π (1/p²)^2 * (-1/p²) dp. Wait, maybe I'm getting the signs wrong. Let me be careful.

So, d = 1/p → dd = - (1/p²) dp. So substituting into the volume element: 4π d² dd becomes 4π (1/p²)² * (-1/p²) dp. Hmm, but the negative sign probably just indicates direction, which we can ignore for the magnitude. So the volume element is 4π (1/p^4) * (1/p²) dp? Wait, wait, no. Wait, d² is (1/p^2), and dd is (1/p²) dp. So putting it together, the volume element at a particular p is 4π (1/p²)^2 * (1/p²) dp? No, wait. Wait, d^2 is (1/p)^2, so (1/p^2). Then multiplied by dd, which is (1/p²) dp. So 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp)= 4π (1/p^4) dp. So the volume element is 4π (1/p^4) dp.

But wait, the number of stars in that volume depends on the number density. If the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density n is constant. So the number of stars per unit volume is n, so the number in that volume element would be n * 4π (1/p^4) dp.

But the problem is asking for the number per unit range of parallax (dp). So the number is proportional to (1/p^4) * dp. So the number per unit dp is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 1/plx^4. But wait, wait, that can't be right because I think I'm missing a factor. Let me recheck the substitution.

Wait, volume element in terms of p is 4π d² dd. We have d = 1/p → d² = 1/p². And dd = (1/p²) dp. So the volume element is 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp = 4π / p^4 dp. So the number of stars in that volume is n * (4π / p^4 ) dp.

So the number per unit parallax (dp) is (n *4π ) / p^4. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/p^4, which is 1/plx^4.

Wait, but the question says "number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx." So the number per unit plx (like per parsec of plx) would be proportional to 1/p^4. So answer A.

But wait another angle: if I think about the number of stars in a certain range of parallax, like from p to p+dp, the corresponding distance range is from 1/p to 1/(p+dp). But when p is small (like nearby stars), dp is a small change in p, which can lead to a larger change in distance. Hmm, but I think the earlier approach is correct because it's using the volume element.

Wait, but wait again. Let's think about it differently. The number of stars in a thin shell of radius d and thickness dd is 4π d² dd * n
