Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for each step. Let's take it step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with sodium cyanide (NaCN) in the presence of reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, it's typically a nucleophilic addition. But wait, I think in the presence of an acid catalyst, the mechanism might change. Oh right, in a ketone, the carbonyl is attacked by the cyanide ion. But wait, if the reaction is under acidic conditions, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's an example of the Stephen reduction or some kind of cyanohydrin formation.

Wait, the product is a cyanohydrin. Because when a ketone reacts with CN-, it forms a cyanohydrin. The reaction is usually acid-catalyzed. So the reagent A would be an acid, like H3O+ (which is option A and B) or maybe something else. Looking at the options, choice A suggests A is H3O+ and B is HCl, which is an acid too. Wait, but the first reaction is between butan-2-one, NaCN, and A to form the cyanohydrin. So I think the reaction is: ketone + NaCN under acidic conditions.

But wait, I've read that the formation of cyanohydrins from ketones typically uses a dilute acid, like H2SO4 or H3O+ as the catalyst. So reagent A is probably H3O+.

Then the second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen?

Well, nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions. I remember two common methods: acidic hydrolysis and basic hydrolysis. In acidic conditions, using something like H2SO4 and heat, the nitrile becomes a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, in basic conditions, you get a carboxylate which can then be acidified.

But in this case, the reagent B is H2O. Wait, that doesn't make sense on its own. Maybe it's a different condition. Oh wait, perhaps it's a hydrolysis in the presence of an acid or base.

Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid. So the nitrile must have undergone hydrolysis. For nitrile to carboxylic acid, the typical reagents are H2O with HCl (acidic conditions) or with H2O and NaOH (basic conditions), followed by acid work-up.

Looking at the reagents in the options, B is either HCl or CH3COOH. So in the second reaction, the reagent B is H2O but perhaps with an acid catalyst.

Wait, no. Let me re-read the question. The second reaction says that B is H2O. Or wait, no, the problem statement says: the reagent B is H2O. Wait, no, the reaction is: [compound] + B (H2O) → [product]. Hmm, maybe I'm misreading. Let me check:

The second reaction is: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → ... So the reagent is B, which is H2O. Wait, that doesn't seem right because just water might not be sufficient. Maybe B is the catalyst. Or perhaps B is another reagent, like HCl or something else, and the reaction uses H2O as the solvent.

Wait, perhaps I'm confused. Let's think again. The reaction is the nitrile group being converted into a carboxylic acid. So the reagents involved would likely be hydrolysis conditions. For nitrile to carboxylic acid, the standard reagent is H3O+ and heat, but more commonly, using a strong acid like HCl with H2O.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the nitrile is treated with dilute acid and water. So in the second reaction, the reagent B would be HCl, because the options suggest B is either HCl (option A) or CH3COOH (option D).

Wait, but looking at the options, for each step, the reagents are A and B. So in the first reaction, butanone + NaCN + A → product. Second reaction: nitrile compound + B (H2O) → product.

Wait, maybe I got the first part wrong. Let me think again about the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN with an acid would form the cyanohydrin. So the product would have the structure with an OH and CN groups on the same carbon. So it's correct.

Then, in the second reaction, the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid. So the reagent B would be something that can hydrolyze nitriles to carboxylic acids. The standard method is using HCl and water under reflux, or perhaps using a strong base followed by acid work-up.

Wait, the reagent B is H2O. But that can't be right. So perhaps the reagent is an acid. Let me think about the options. Let's look at the options again.

Options:
A) A = H3O+, B = HCl
B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH
C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl
D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So for the first reaction, A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. For the second reaction, B is HCl, CH3COOH, etc.

Wait, in the first step, butan-2-one + NaCN → product, which is a cyanohydrin. The reaction for cyanohydrin formation is typically acid-catalyzed. So A would be an acid. So either H3O+ (options A and B) or NaHSO3 (which is a source of H+ and SO3^2-), but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyanohydrin formation can also be done under basic conditions, but I think it's usually acid-catalyzed. So A is probably H3O+.

So that narrows down the options to A or B for the first part.

Now, the second reaction requires the nitrile to become a carboxylic acid. The typical conditions are H2O with HCl (acidic). So reagent B would be HCl, which is option A or C.

Looking at the options, if A is H3O+ then option A has B as HCl. So that would fit. Because the first reaction uses H3O+ as an acid catalyst, and the second uses HCl as the acid for hydrolysis.

Wait, but another thought: the second reaction is hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid. The reaction could also be done in the presence of a base, but then you'd have to acidify. Alternatively, using a strong acid like HCl with H2O, which would directly form the acid.

So in the second step, the reagent B is HCl. So in the options, when A is H3O+ and B is HCl, that's option A.

Wait, but looking again, the second reaction is written as:

2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, maybe the reagent B is H2O with another acid. Or perhaps B is HCl, but the solvent is H2O. So the reagent is HCl and the solvent is H2O. So in the options, B is HCl or CH3COOH.

So for the second step, B is HCl (as in option A), which would make sense because HCl in water is an acidic environment, needed for the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the acid.

So putting it all together, the first reagent is H3O+ (A) and the second is HCl (B). That would be option A.

Wait, but another thing: the second reaction product is a hydroxybutanoic acid, which is a carboxylic acid. The nitrile group (-CN) becomes -COOH. So the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid. For that, the conditions are typically H2O under strong acidic or basic conditions.

Another method is the hydrolysis of nitriles using a strong acid, like HCl, with water and heat. So B would be HCl.

So yes, option A: A is H3O+ and B is HCl.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A. Cyanohydrin formation is typically acid-catalyzed, meaning reagent A must be an acid. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (option A) is the most suitable acid for this reaction.

The second reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid (-COOH) in the presence of reagent B. This transformation typically requires hydrolysis under acidic conditions, such as those provided by HCl in water. Therefore, reagent B must be HCl to facilitate this reaction.

Given these considerations, the correct reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, which corresponds to option A.

Answer: A
