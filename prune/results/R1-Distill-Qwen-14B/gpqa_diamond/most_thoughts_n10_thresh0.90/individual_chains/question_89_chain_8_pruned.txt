Okay, let's tackle this organic chemistry problem step by step. Hmm, the question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let's see what the starting material is. 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid hydrocarbon, right? It's a four-fused cyclohexane rings structure, very rigid. So 1,3-dibromo would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in this structure.

The first reaction is heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination reaction, like dehydrohalogenation. Since there are two bromine atoms, maybe it's a double elimination. Wait, but KOH is also a good nucleophile. Could it be a substitution? Oh, but with two bromines, perhaps it's an E2 elimination, forming an alkene.

Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid, and the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe the product is a ketone? Or an ester? But wait, KOH is a base, so maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but then maybe further oxidation?

Wait, in the presence of KOH, perhaps the dibromide undergoes a double elimination to form an alkyne. Because elimination of two HX (in this case, HBr) would form a triple bond. Alternatively, if it's two adjacent bromines, eliminating two HBr would form a triple bond. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane... but wait, in adamantane, the positions are such that 1 and 3 are not adjacent. Oh wait, no, maybe in the adamantane structure, 1 and 3 might be on adjacent carbons in one of the rings. Hmm, not entirely sure about the structure, but let's proceed.

Wait, another possibility: heating with KOH could cause a substitution. Since adamantane is a diamondoid, maybe each Br is on a bridgehead. If it's a vicinal dihalide, elimination would form a double bond. However, in this case, the product's IR has a carbonyl. So maybe elimination followed by some kind of oxidation? Or perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination, but that's usually for amines.

Wait, another angle: sometimes, when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) are treated with strong base like KOH, they can eliminate twice to form an alkyne. Because two E2 eliminations would lose two HX molecules, forming a triple bond. For example, 1,2-dibromoalkane would eliminate twice to make an alkyne. So in this case, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate two HBr molecules to form an adamantane with a triple bond. Wait, but 1,3 positions might not allow that, as they might not be adjacent. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, let me think. Adamantane is a diamondoid, so each carbon is part of multiple rings. The 1,3-dibromo would have Br on two non-adjacent carbons. So maybe the elimination isn't possible for a triple bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's a single elimination, but that would require losing just one HBr, forming a double bond. But then the IR peak suggests a carbonyl, not a double bond. So that doesn't fit.

Oh wait, maybe the base abstracts a β-hydrogen leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a carbonyl. Wait, that's not typical. Alternatively, maybe the base is causing a substitution, but substitution would not form a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the base causes an elimination of two HBr, forming a ketone. Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is acting as a base, and the elimination is forming an oxide. Wait, but I'm not certain.

Wait, what's the product's NMR? The 1H NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a singlet probably because the two protons are equivalent and not split. Then, 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), which is a lot of protons, likely from CH2 groups adjacent to some substituent. Then 1.94 ppm (2H), which could be another set of equivalent protons.

And the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl. So the product after KOH treatment is likely a ketone. How would that form?

Wait, perhaps elimination of HBr and then some kind of rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing a substitution where Br is replaced by OH, forming diol, but that doesn't fit the IR peak. Unless it's an ester or a ketone. Wait, wait, perhaps the product is an alcohol, but that's not giving the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the elimination leads to a conjugated diene, which under basic conditions could form an epoxide? No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, wait a minute. Another possibility: the reaction is a double elimination to form a ketone via a conjugated diene. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzil-like elimination, but that's typically for vicinal diketones.

Wait, perhaps the product is an enol ether? No, that doesn't fit the IR. Alternatively, maybe the product is a diketone, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. Wait, but substitution would require a good leaving group, which Br is, but in a substitution, I don't see how a ketone would form.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about cleavage. If KOH is acting in a cleavage reaction, perhaps via the hydroxide ion. Wait, if 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes cleavage, maybe the bridge is broken. Adamantane is four cyclohexane rings fused together in a chair-like structure. Cleavage of a bridge would form something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an enol, which then tautomerizes to a ketone. Wait, that might fit. If the base abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to a bromine, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a double bond. Then, maybe a conjugate base forms, which could tautomerize to a carbonyl group.

Wait, but how? Let me think. Let's say we have a structure like Br-C-C-Br, and upon elimination, we form a double bond. Then, maybe the structure becomes C=C, and then under basic conditions, perhaps an addition occurs. Alternatively, perhaps the base induces a shift, like a pinacol rearrangement, but that's for vicinal diols.

Wait, another approach: since the product after KOH is a ketone, maybe the reaction is a double elimination to form a carbonyl. For example, if two HBr are eliminated, and the structure rearranges to form a carbonyl. So perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane eliminates two HBr, forming an enol, which then becomes a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that requires a ketone to begin with, which it doesn't. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is adamantanone. Because heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH could lead to elimination of two HBr and form a ketone. So, the product 1 would be 1-adamantanone or similar.

Assuming that, product 1 is 1-adamantanone. Then, product 2 is formed by heating with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, 1-adamantanone is a ketone, which is not typically reactive in Friedel-Crafts as a substrate. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Claisen condensation or some kind of enolate formation.

Wait, heating with aluminum isopropoxide could be a way to form an enol or an enolate. Alternatively, perhaps the ketone undergoes some kind of acetylation or alkylation. Wait, but I'm not very sure.

Wait, aluminum isopropoxide is also used in the formation of enol ethers or in the dehydration of alcohols. Alternatively, perhaps it's used as a catalyst for some kind of elimination. Wait, if product 1 is a ketone, product 2 might be an enol ether if there's an elimination, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol. Wait, but the IR had a carbonyl, so that's less likely. Hmm.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an alcohol. No, because the IR would show an OH stretch around 3300 cm⁻¹, but here it's at 1720, which is a carbonyl. So, product 1 is probably a ketone.

So, product 1 is a ketone. Then, what happens when you heat it with aluminum isopropoxide? Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid. It can catalyze some reactions, like the formation of enolates. Or perhaps, it's used in the Claisen condensation.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether. Let me think: if product 1 is a cyclic ketone like adamantanone, then heating with Al(i-Pr)3 could cause the formation of an enol ether. For example, in the presence of a Lewis acid, the ketone can form an enol by proton abstraction, which then can form an enol ether if there's an adjacent leaving group. But in this case, the product after KOH is a ketone without any obvious leaving groups.

Wait, another approach. Alternatively, maybe product 2 is a dienone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the second step is a ring-opening or some rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe the aluminum isopropoxide is part of a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but again, I'm not sure. Wait, but if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an acyl chloride, but that doesn't make sense because aluminum isopropoxide isn't typically used for that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the aluminum isopropoxide is part of a Wittig reaction. Wait, no, the Wittig reagent is usually made from triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide. So that's probably not it.

Wait, another thought: maybe the ketone is undergoing aldol condensation. But that usually requires a base. Alternatively, if Al(i-Pr)3 is a catalyst, perhaps it's a different mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a bicyclic compound. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's move on to the next step and see if that helps.

The next step is ozonolysis of product 2 at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethylsulfide (DMS). Ozonolysis is typically used to cleave alkenes into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it.

Wait, but product 2 is formed from product 1, which was a ketone. So product 2 must have a double bond. So, perhaps product 2 is an enone—a compound with a conjugated double bond next to a carbonyl group.

Wait, that makes sense. Because when you have a ketone, and you add a double bond conjugated to it, you get an enone. So product 1 might have an enol, which upon treatment with Al(i-Pr)3, forms an enol ether, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a dienone. Let me think: if product 1 is a ketone, product 2 could be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone (enone) formed via some kind of elimination or condensation.

So, when you ozonolyse an enone, what happens? Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. The position of the carbonyls depends on the structure of the double bond. For example, a simple alkene like ethylene would give two formate esters, but in more complex structures, it would break into diols or other products depending on the substituents.

Now, product 3 is formed after ozonolysis and work-up with DMS, which is a reductive work-up. Ozonolysis followed by reductive work-up (like Zn/H2O) usually gives aldehydes and ketones. DMS is a mild reductant and can break the ozonides into carbonyl groups without over-oxidizing.

So, if product 2 is an enone (conjugated dienone?), ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

But wait, the ozonolysis is done at -78°C, which is a low temperature. I think that affects the type of ozonide formed—maybe a less stable or more reactive ozonide, leading to different cleavage products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction conditions influence whether it's oxidative or reductive cleavage. But DMS is a reductive work-up, so it should lead to formation of carbonyl groups rather than breaking them further.

So, product 3 would have additional carbonyl groups based on the structure of product 2.

Now, the question is about the 1H NMR spectrum of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen (excluding those that exchange with deuterated solvent).

The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

So, to figure this out, I need to know the structure of product 3. Let me try to piece it together.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → Product 1 (light yellow solid).

The IR of product 1 shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl. The NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H), which might be adjacent to the carbonyl. Then, 10H between 2.41-2.23 ppm, which could be from CH2 groups around the structure. The 1.94 ppm (2H) might be a bridgehead proton.

So, product 1 is likely a ketone. Perhaps 1-adamantanone, which is a known compound.

Step 2: Heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide (Al(i-Pr)3) forms product 2.

Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid. When a ketone is treated with a Lewis acid, it can form an enol or an enolate, depending on the conditions.

Wait, in the presence of a Lewis acid, a ketone can form an enol ether via a conjugate addition. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but since the ketone is already an acyl group, that seems unlikely.

Wait, another possibility: the ketone could undergo a ring-opening if it's part of a cyclic structure. For example, in a six-membered ring ketone, the Lewis acid might induce some ring-opening to form a more substituted double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone (enone), which would have a conjugated double bond next to the carbonyl group.

How would that form? Maybe via an elimination reaction, removing a proton and forming the double bond. So, perhaps the ketone loses a proton adjacent to the carbonyl, forming the double bond.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is 1-adamantanone, and product 2 is a dehydro version, like 1,2-adamantanedione, but that's a diketone. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether. If product 1 is a cyclic ketone, treating it with Al(i-Pr)3 could form an enol ether via an acid-catalyzed enol formation. Enol ethers are more reactive than ketones, so maybe that's the case.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think about product 3.

Product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, product 3 will have carbonyl groups at the ends of where the double bond was.

Now, assuming product 2 is an enone (like 1,2-adamantanedione), ozonolysis would cleave the double bond. Wait, but ozonolysis of an enone typically gives two carbonyl groups and possibly some other structure depending on substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a bicyclic compound with a double bond, and ozonolysis would break it in a specific way.

But let me get back to the NMR of product 3. The most deshielded hydrogen is probably adjacent to a carbonyl group because deshielded protons are usually near electronegative atoms or in an anisotropic environment.

In the NMR, coupling patterns arise from neighboring hydrogens. So, if a proton is next to two different sets of neighboring hydrogens, it could form a triplet of triplets, etc.

Wait, another thought: if in product 3, there's a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl and next to two different sets of CH2 groups, it might have a complex splitting pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps in product 3, there's a structure like a diketone with adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, maybe product 3 is a diketone, with a CH2 group next to the carbonyl. The hydrogen on that CH2 would be split by neighboring groups.

But I'm not entirely certain. Let me think about each step again.

1,3-dibromoadamantane → KOH, heat → product 1 (ketone, 1-adamantanone).

Product 1 treated with Al(i-Pr)3 → product 2 (perhaps forms an enone via elimination or some rearrangement).

Product 2 undergoes ozonolysis → product 3, which has carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

Assuming that product 2 is an enone, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, for example, if product 2 was a cyclopropane ring with a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls.

Wait, but adamantane is a four-ring structure. So, the enone in product 2 would be within that structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a bicyclic enone. Ozonolysis would break the double bond, creating two new carbonyl groups and possibly breaking the ring.

Wait, the ozonolysis of a bridged bicyclic enone would result in cleavage into smaller rings or chain segments.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's tough. Let me think about the possible NMR of product 3.

The most deshielded hydrogen would likely be near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. So, perhaps it's a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl.

If that CH is next to two sets of neighboring protons, it might have a complex coupling pattern. For example, if it's adjacent to a CH2 group, which in turn is adjacent to another CH2 group, the coupling could be a triplet of triplets or a doublet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the CH group is next to two different CH2 groups, each with two protons, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, another angle: the most deshielded proton is probably part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, which is split by neighboring protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis leads to a diketone with adjacent CH2 groups. For instance, consider a structure like
