Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, I remember that eigenvectors are vectors that only change by a scalar factor when a linear operator is applied to them. The problem says the operator is P, and we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, the operator is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So P is a vector operator, probably like the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2.

The problem states that the direction is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the vector n is in the x-z plane, which means that the direction has components in x and z, but not y. So the direction can be described by some angle θ, perhaps, from the z-axis, but since it's in the x-z plane, φ would be zero or 180 degrees, but wait, actually, n is arbitrary in x-z, so maybe the angle φ is zero. Hmm, but perhaps the general case is considered with the angle θ from z-axis, and φ=0.

Wait, no, because the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so the direction vector n can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but wait, actually, in the x-z plane, the angle φ is either 0 or π, but perhaps the general case is considering any angle in x-z, so maybe φ is fixed at 0, but that's not important for the eigenvector direction. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

The operator P is a vector operator, so I think it's the same as the spin operator for spin-1/2 particles, like the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. So the operator P is given by P = (Px, Py, Pz), where each component is (ħ/2) times a Pauli matrix.

So, the operator along an arbitrary direction n is P·n̂, which would be the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding direction cosine. So the operator in question is P·n = (P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z), where n_x = sinθ cosφ, n_y = 0, and n_z = cosθ. But since the direction is in the x-z plane, φ is 0, so n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, and n_y = 0. So the operator becomes P·n = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

Wait, no, because n is a unit vector, so n_x = sinθ, but wait, no, wait, in spherical coordinates, for a unit vector, n_x = sinθ cosφ, n_y = sinθ sinφ, n_z = cosθ. But since in the x-z plane, φ=0, so n_x = sinθ, n_y=0, n_z=cosθ.

So the operator P·n would be (P_x sinθ) + (P_z cosθ), because P_y is multiplied by zero.

Wait, but let me make sure. So the operator P·n is (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z). Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y=0, so P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Now, the eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. Because the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

Now, I need to find the eigenvector of the operator P·n corresponding to the eigenvalue ħ/2.

But wait, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, so when we scale them by ħ/2, the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2. So, the operator P·n has eigenvalues ±ħ/2.

So, the eigenvector we
