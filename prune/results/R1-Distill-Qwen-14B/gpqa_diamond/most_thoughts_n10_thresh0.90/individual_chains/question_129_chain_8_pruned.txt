Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. But let's take it step by step. 

The problem is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are a few steps, and some hints, so I need to piece everything together.

First, let me outline the reactions:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

And there are two hints provided:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1.

The options given are four different cyclic ketones, so E must be a ketone. Let's think about each step.

Starting with compound A. The IR peak at 1750 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group. But what kind? Could be ester, ketone, aldehyde, maybe acid? But since it's reacting with HCN, which is a nucleophile, perhaps A is a ketone or an aldehyde. Wait, HCN typically adds to carbonyl groups. For example, in a ketone, HCN would add in a nucleophilic attack, forming a cyanohydrin.

Wait, but if A is reacting with HCN, then B is a cyanohydrin. Let me think about cyanohydrin formation. So, the reaction would be something like:

R-CO-R' + HCN → R-C(OH)-CN-R' ?

Wait, no, the cyanohydrin formation is when a carbonyl (like ketone or aldehyde) reacts with HCN to add a hydroxyl and a cyano group to the same carbon. So for a ketone, R2CO → R2C(OH)CN.

But wait, the product from A reacting with HCN is B. Then B is reduced to C with H2 and Pd. Hydrogenation of a nitrile group? Because H2 and Pd would typically reduce nitriles to amines, but wait, wait. Alternatively, if B is a nitrile, then Pd and H2 could hydrogenate it. But the initial reaction is with HCN, which suggests that B has a nitrile group.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a cyclic ketone. Let me think. Let's imagine A is a cyclic ketone. So when it reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin, which would add a hydroxyl and a nitrile group to the same carbon.

Wait, but that's for a ketone. For example, cyclohexanone reacting with HCN would form a cyanohydrin, which is 1-hydroxy-2-cyanocyclohexane or something like that. But compound B is then reduced to C. What would that reduction do?

Wait, the reaction is with H2 and Pd. So Pd is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So if B is a nitrile, hydrogenation would reduce it to an amine. Wait, but nitriles (R-CN) when hydrogenated with H2 and a catalyst like Pd would typically become amines (R-CH2-NH2?), but wait, maybe under other conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrogenation of a triple bond, but in that case, B would have a triple bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me think about the first part again.

Hint a says that when A reacts with a phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, a phosphorous ylide is typically used in the Wittig reaction. The Wittig reagent (ylide) reacts with a carbonyl group to form an alkene.

So if A is a carbonyl compound (like a ketone), reacting with a Wittig reagent would form an alkene. So the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

Wait, the product is named as 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let's parse that.

The base is cyclopentane. At position 4, there's a substituent which is propan-2-ylidene, which is a vinyl group attached to the cyclopentane. And positions 1 and 2 have methyl groups.

The structure would be a cyclopentane ring with a double bond (from the Wittig reaction) leading to a substituent. Wait, the propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)-CH2- as a substituent? No, wait, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C^+=CH2? No, wait, a ylidene group is a =CH- group.

Wait, no. The substituent is propan-2-ylidene, which is CH2-C(CH2 group) but not sure. Alternatively, the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a propan-2-yl group. Maybe it's better to think of the product as having a cyclopentane ring with a double bond connected to a propyl group in a certain way.

But perhaps I should think about what the Wittig reaction does. The Wittig reagent would convert a carbonyl group (like ketone) into an alkene. So the starting material A must have a carbonyl group, and upon reaction with the ylide, forms an alkene.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me try to draw this structure.

Cyclopentane ring: positions 1, 2, and 4 have substituents.

At position 4, there's a substituent: propan-2-ylidene, which is CH2-C(CH3)=. Hmm, perhaps it's a vinyl group attached to a methyl group. Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be (CH3)C=CH2? No, wait, the structure would be CH2-CH2-C= but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), but with a methyl branch, making it (CH2)2C=CH- ?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 group attached at position 4. So the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, making it a propenyl group.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that A has a carbonyl group, because the Wittig reaction forms alkenes from carbonyls. So A must be a cyclic ketone, because when you do a Wittig reaction with a cyclic ketone, you add an alkene to the ring.

So A
