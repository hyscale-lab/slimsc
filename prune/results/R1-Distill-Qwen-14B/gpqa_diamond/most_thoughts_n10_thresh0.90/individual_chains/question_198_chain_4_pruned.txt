Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

Okay, the question is about the stability constants of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes and determining the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex among all cobalt species. Hmm, I remember that stability constants (β) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex tends to form.

The given data is:
- Cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 1e-2 M (0.01 M)
- Thiocyanate concentration, [SCN-] = 0.1 M
- Stability constants: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16

Wait, the stability constants usually apply to each step of complex formation. So, the first complex would be Co(SCN)n where n starts at 1, then 2, etc. Each β is for adding one SCN- to the previous complex.

So, β1 is for Co(SCN)^+ maybe? Because the first complex is CoSCN^2+ (assuming Co is +2 and SCN is -1). Or wait, the charge would change. Let me think: Co²+ + SCN^- → CoSCN^+? That might be. So each β is the formation constant for each successive step.

So the complexes in order are:
1. Co²+ (free ion)
2. Co(SCN)²+ (n=1)
3. Co(SCN)₂^0 (n=2)
4. Co(SCN)₃^– (n=3)
5. Co(SCN)₄^2– (n=4)

Wait, but the question is about dithiocyanato complexes, which I think have two SCN- ligands. So that would be the n=2 complex, Co(SCN)₂^0. The blue color probably refers to this species.

Our goal is to find the percentage of this species (n=2) among all possible cobalt species.

So the problem is about calculating the distribution of Co species based on the stability constants. I think this involves using the formation constants to find the fraction of each species.

The general approach for such problems is to use the logarithmic form of the stability constants and set up a system to find the distribution. But maybe a simpler way is to use the method of successive approximations or consider the dominant species based on β and concentrations.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the formula for the fraction of each species in terms of β and the concentrations of the ligand and the metal.

I remember that for each complex, the fraction (f_n) can be calculated using the formula:

f_n = (β1 * β2 * ... * βn * [M] ) / ( Σ (β1*β2*...*βk * [M] [L]^k ) )

Wait, more accurately, each species contributes to the total, and the fraction is the ratio of the species's concentration to the total concentration.

But since Co²+ can form complexes up to n=4, we need to consider all possible species.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model each species in terms of the stepwise formation constants. Let's think of each step.

The formation is stepwise, so each βn is the constant for the nth step. So, the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands is the product of β1 to βn.

So, for each species, the concentration can be written as [Co(SCN)_n] = β1 * β2 * ... * βn * [Co²+] [SCN^-]^n / (1 + ... + all possible products).

Wait, but this can get complicated because you have to account for all possible species, which are 5 in this case (n=0 to 4). So, the total concentration of Co is the sum of all [Co(SCN)_n] for n=0 to 4.

Alternatively, the fraction of each species is (β1β2...βn [Co][SCN]^n) / (sum over m from 0 to4 of β1β2...βm [Co][SCN]^m )

But wait, so for each species, the term is product β1 to βn multiplied by [Co][SCN]^n.

The total concentration of Co is the sum of all these terms.

Wait, since [Co] is the same for all terms, and [SCN] is given, perhaps we can factor them out.

Let me denote [Co]=c=1e-2 M and [SCN]=s=0.1 M.

Define for each n (0 to 4), the term Tn = product_{i=1 to n} βi * (s)^n.

So, Tn = (β1 β2 ... βn) * s^n

Wait, but for n=0, T0 = 1 * s^0 = 1.

Then, the fraction of each species is Tn divided by the sum of all Tm from m=0 to 4.

So, fraction f_n = Tn / (T0 + T1 + T2 + T3 + T4 )

Therefore, the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) is (T2) / (sum Tm) multiplied by 100%.

So our task is to compute T0, T1, T2, T3, T4 and then compute f_2.

Let me compute each Tn:

n=0: T0 = 1 * (0.1)^0 = 1 *1 =1

n=1: T1= β1 * s^1 = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

n=2: T2 = β1*β2 * s^2 = 9*40 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6

n=3: T3= β1β2β3 * s^3 = 9*40*63 * (0.1)^3 = 9*40=360, 360*63=22680; (0.1)^3=0.001 → 22680 * 0.001=22.68

n=4: T4= β1β2β3β4 * s^4 = 9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4. Let's compute step by step.

First, 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *16=362880.

s^4 is (0.1)^4=0.0001.

So T4= 362880 * 0.0001 =36.288.

Wait, let me check:

Wait 9*40=360. 360 *63: 360 *60=21600, 360*3=1080 → 21600+1080=22680. 22680 *16: 22680 *10=226800, 22680*6=136080 → 226800 +136080= 362880. Multiply by 0.0001: 362880 * 0.0001 =36.288.

So, T4=36.288.

So, now all Tn:

T0=1

T1=0.9

T2=3.6

T3=22.68

T4=36.288

Now sum all Tn: 1 +0.9=1.9 → +3.6=5.5 → +22.68=28.18 → +36.288=64.468.

So total sum is 64.468.

The fraction f_2 is T2 / sum = 3.6 /64.468 ≈ ?

Let me compute that. 3.6 ÷64.468.

Well, 3.6 /64.468 ≈ let's see:

64.468 × 0.055 = approximately 3.54574 → because 64 *0.055 is 3.52; 0.468*0.055≈0.02574; total approx 3.54574. So 0.055 is about 3.545.

But our numerator is 3.6, which is a bit higher. So 3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05556.

Wait, 3.6/64.468 = ?

Let me calculate it more accurately.

64.468 goes into 3.6 how many times?

64.468 × 0.055 = 3.54574

3.6 – 3.54574 = 0.05426.

So 0.055 + (0.05426 /64.468 )

0.05426 /64.468 ≈ approx 0.00084.

So total is approximately 0.055 +0.00084 = 0.05584, or 5.584%.

Wait that can't be right. The options given are around 16%, 25%, 38%, 42%. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of Tn. Let me recheck.

Wait, double-checking the Tn values.

n=0: T0=1→ correct.

n=1: β1=9, s=0.1 → 9 * 0.1=0.9 → correct.

n=2: β1=9, β2=40 → 9*40=360 → multiplied by s² (0.1)^2=0.01 → 360 *0.01=3.6 → correct.

n=3: β1β2β3=9*40=360, 360*63=22680 → 22680 *0.1^3=22680 *0.001=22.68 → correct.

n=4: β1β2β3β4=9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *16= 362880 → 362880 * (0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288 → correct.

So sum is indeed 1+0.9=1.9 +3.6=5.5 +22.68=28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So T2=3.6, sum=64.468, so 3.6/64.468= approx 0.05556 → 5.556% → but that's option D (16.9%) isn't close. So either I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, no—each Tn is (β1*β2*...βn) [SCN]^n. But in reality, the overall formation constant K for the complex with n ligands is K_n = β1 β2 ... βn.

So the concentration of each species is [Co(SCN)_n] = K_n [Co²+] [SCN^-]^n / (denominator), where denominator is the sum of all K_m [Co²+] [SCN^-]^m for m=0 to n.

Wait, but [Co²+] is the same for each term, so when calculating fractions, [Co²+] cancels out.

Thus, the fraction f_n = (K_n [SCN]^n) / (sum from m=0 to 4 of K_m [SCN]^m )

So, substituting K_n as the product of β's, and [SCN] =0.1, let's compute each term in the numerator and denominator.

So, let's compute K_n and [SCN]^n for each n.

n=0:

K0=1 (no ligands, so product is empty).

[SCN]^0=1 → term=1*1=1.

n=1:

K1=β1=9.

[SCN]^1=0.1 → term=9 *0.1 =0.9.

n=2:

K2=β1 β2=9*40=360.

[SCN]^2=0.01 → 360 *0.01=3.6.

n=3:

K3=β1β2β3=360*63=22680.

[SCN]^3=0.001 → 22680 *0.001=22.68.

n=4:

K4=β1β2β3β4=22680 *16=362880.

[SCN]^4=0.0001 →362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So the terms are the same as before.

Sum is 1 + 0.9 +3.6+22.68 +36.288=64.468.

So, the fraction for n=2 is 3.6 /64.468= approx 0.05556 or 5.56%.

But the options don't have this. Wait, the options are A:42.3%, B:25.6%, C:38.1%, D:16.9%.

Hmm, so I'm getting about 5.5%, which isn't an option. So clearly, I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I got the β values wrong. Let me check the question again.

The stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Hmm, wait, maybe I should think about the stability constants differently. Because sometimes, β is given for the overall complex, not stepwise. But no, the question says "stability constants of the complexes", which I think are the stepwise constants.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the order. Let me think: the first complex is CoSCN^2+ (n=1), the second is Co(SCN)₂^0 (n=2), then Co(SCN)₃^– (n=3), and Co(SCN)₄^2– (n=4).

But perhaps I'm miscalculating the number of ligands. Let me think: Co²+ has a charge of +2. Each SCN^- is -1. So for n=1, the complex is Co(SCN)²+ → charge +2 + (-1) = +1? Wait, no: Co²+ plus one SCN^- → Co(SCN)+. So n=1 is +1 charge.

n=2: Co(SCN)₂^0 → Co²+ + 2 SCN^- → 2*(-1) +2 = 0 → neutral.

n=3: Co(SCN)₃^– → 3*(-1) +2 = -1 → charge -1.

n=4: Co(SCN)₄^2– → 4*(-1) +2 = -2 → charge -2.

Wait, that makes sense. So the β's are for each step. So perhaps I didn't make a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, but looking back, the fraction came to ~5.5%, but the options are much higher. Maybe I should re-examine the problem statement.

Wait, the question states that the solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which is the n=2 species.

Wait, perhaps I should only consider the species up to n=4, but maybe the complexes can form more than four ligands? Hmm, the question specifies four stability constants, so I think we are to consider n=4 as the highest.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the total cobalt concentration includes all species, so the sum of all [Co(SCN)_n] is equal to c(Co) =1e-2 M. But in my calculation, I considered [Co] as a separate term, which I think is correct because the fractions are calculated based on the relative contributions.

Wait, perhaps the approach is correct, but I made an error in the calculation of the fractions. Let me recalculate the fractions:

sum =64.468.

f_2 =3.6 /64.468 → let me compute this precisely.

3.6 ÷64.468 → 3.6 ÷64.468.

Let me compute 64.468 × 0.055 =3.54574 → as before.

3.6 -3.54574 =0.05426.

0.05426 /64.468 ≈ 0.00084.

So total is 0.055 +0.00084=0.05584 → 5.584% → approximately 5.58%.

But none of the options is close to that. So perhaps I must have made a mistake in the way I'm calculating the terms.

Wait, perhaps the β values are for the overall complex, not stepwise. Oh! That might be the issue. Because sometimes, the stability constant can be given as the overall constant for the complex, not stepwise.

Wait, when the problem states "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. If they're overall constants, then β1 would be the constant for Co(SCN)²+ (n=1), β2 for Co(SCN)₂^0 (n=2), etc. But if they're stepwise, each βn is the constant for adding the nth ligand.

Wait, the stepwise β's are such that β_n = K_n / K_{n-1}, where K_n is the overall constant for the complex with n ligands.

So if someone gives you the overall K values, then the stepwise β would be K_n / K_{n-1}.

But in the problem, the given values are β1=9, β2=40, etc. So perhaps I should think of them as the stepwise formation constants.

But if that's not the case, perhaps the given β's are the overall constants. Let me try that approach.

Assume that β1 is the overall K for n=1, β2 for n=2, etc.

If that's the case, then for n=1, K1=9.

n=2, K2=40.

n=3, K3=63.

n=4, K4=16.

Wait, but that would make the stepwise β's as K_n/K_{n-1}.

Because the stepwise β for adding the nth ligand is K_n / K_{n-1}.

So if the given β's are the overall K's, then the stepwise β's would be:

β1 = K1 / K0 = 9 /1=9.

β2 = K2/K1 =40/9≈4.444.

β3=63/40=1.575.

β4=16/63≈0.254.

Wait, but that would change the calculation, because earlier I used the stepwise β's, but perhaps the given β's are the overall K's.

But the problem states "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." So I think the given β's are the overall K's.

Wait, no, the stability constants for complexes are usually given as the overall K for each complex, not the stepwise. Oh wait, no—stability constants are typically given as formation constants, which are stepwise. So I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands is β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

In that case, the formation constants would be:

n=1: 9.

n=2: 9*40=360.

n=3:360*63=22680.

n=4:22680 *16=362880.

Which is what I did earlier.

But then the fraction came out as about 5.5%, which isn't an option.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the conditional formation constant, which includes the ionic strength effect, but the problem doesn't mention any, so I'm assuming it's negligible.

Wait, perhaps I missed the fact that the initial [Co²+] is 0.01 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

Wait, but in the calculation, I considered [Co] as a separate term, and multiplied it into each Tn. So the [Co] was included.

Wait, perhaps I should instead include [Co] and [SCN] in each term. Let me re-express the terms.

Each term Tn is the product (β1β2...βn) * [Co] * [SCN]^n.

Wait, no, because [Co] is the same for all terms, and when calculating the fraction, they all cancel out. So the calculation I did earlier is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the stability constants are given in terms of the ligand added, meaning that for each step, βn is the constant for adding another SCN⁻.

But perhaps I should think of the logarithmic approach for the distribution. Maybe using the formula involving the logarithm of the fraction or the use of the stability constants in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the concentration of each species.

Total [Co] = [Co²+] + [Co(SCN)]+ + [Co(SCN)₂^0] + [Co(SCN)₃^-] + [Co(SCN)₄^2- ] = 0.01 M.

But without knowing the exact value of [SCN^-], which is given as 0.1 M, but in solution, some of it will form complexes.

Wait, but in this problem, the [SCN^-] is fixed as 0.1 M, so it's in excess. So [SCN^-] is approximately 0.1 M, and the change due to complexation is negligible.

So the calculation I did earlier should be correct.

Wait, but let me check the sum again.

T0=1 →1

T1=9 * 0.1 =0.9 → 0.9

T2=9*40 *0.1^2 → 360 *0.01=3.6 →3.6

T3= 9*40*63 *0.1^3 →22680 *0.001=22.68 →22.68

T4=
