Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I remember that mesons are particles made up of a quark and an antiquark, right? But the question is about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. And the options are various distances in the order of 10^-15 to 10^-16 meters. 

Wait, mean decay distance. Oh right, that's the average distance the particle travels before decaying. I think the formula for the mean decay distance involves the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula, as far as I recall, is something like c multiplied by the lifetime gamma, or maybe more accurately, c multiplied by the Lorentz factor times the proper lifetime. But wait, in high-energy physics, there's a standard approach to calculate this.

So the mean decay length (L) is given by L = c * τ * βγ, where τ is the proper lifetime, β is the velocity over the speed of light, and γ is the Lorentz factor. But wait, another approach I've heard about is using the relation involving the decay width. Oh, right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime τ via Γ = ħ / τ. So τ is ħ divided by Γ.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The decay width Γ is related to the mean proper lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So
