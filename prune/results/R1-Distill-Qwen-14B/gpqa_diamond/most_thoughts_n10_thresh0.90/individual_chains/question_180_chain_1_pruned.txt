Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's break it down step by step. 

The question is about finding the minimum energy of an isolated system of 13 identical particles. Each has a charge of 2e, and they have negligible mass. So, 12 of these are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. Hmm, I think I need to calculate the potential energy here.

Wait, potential energy between charges... Right, the potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula. The formula is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, which is approximately 8.988×10^9 N·m²/C². 

But wait, since there are multiple charges, I have to consider all the interactions. So, the system has 13 charges. The 13th is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are at a distance of 2 meters from P. So, each of the 12 charges is 2e, and the fixed one is also 2e. 

But wait, how do I calculate the potential energy for the entire system? I remember that the total potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So, I need to compute the potential energy for every pair of charges and then add them all up.

Wait, but how many pairs are there? Let's think. There are 13 charges, each interacting with the others. But since each pair is counted twice (charge A and B, and charge B and A), the total number of unique pairs is (13 * 12)/2 = 78 pairs, right? But wait, no, because in this problem, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the others are all at 2m from P. So, for each of the 12 charges, they're 2m away from the 13th. But what about their distances from each other?

Oh wait, hold on. The problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from point P. So, their positions are all on a sphere of radius 2m around P. But the problem doesn't specify their distances from each other. Hmm, that complicates things because without knowing their mutual distances,
