Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, this looks like a 2-dimensional metric, right? Because it's written in terms of dx and dy. So it's probably describing a 2-dimensional surface embedded in some space, maybe?

Wait, no, actually, in general, the metric is written in terms of coordinates, so this is a 2-dimensional spacetime? Or maybe it's a 2-dimensional spatial slice. But since the question is about a pseudosphere, which is a surface in 3D, but I'm not sure. Oh, well, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? Like a hyperboloid.

But wait, the metric given is in 2 dimensions, so I'm probably supposed to treat it as a 2D surface. Or maybe it's a higher-dimensional metric, but only considering two coordinates. Hmm.

Wait, the question is asking about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. So perhaps this metric is on a pseudosphere? Or maybe the metric is in 2D but represents a pseudosphere in some higher dimension? Not sure. Let me think.

Alternatively, the metric could be representing a 2-dimensional surface, and the question is about its area. But pseudospheres are 2-dimensional surfaces, so maybe that's the context.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me recall: a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative Gaussian curvature. In 2D, the Gaussian curvature is the reciprocal of the radius squared for a sphere, but for a pseudosphere, it's negative. So the Gaussian curvature K is -1/r², where r is the radius of curvature, which is the same as the pseudosphere's radius.

But how does this relate to the given metric? I think I need to compute the area of the pseudosphere using this metric.

Wait, the area would involve integrating the area element over the surface. The metric is given in a form that might make it easier to find the area element. The metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So the area element dA would be the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times dx dy.

Wait, the metric tensor here is diagonal, with both g_xx and g_yy equal to 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant is (g_xx * g_yy - 0) = (32/(4-x² -y²))^2. Wait, no, the determinant for a 2D metric is just the product of the diagonal elements since it's diagonal, right? Because the off-diagonal terms (g_xy and g_yx) are zero here.

So the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²)) * (32/(4 - x² - y²)) ) = (32)^2 / (4 - x² - y²)^2.

Then the area element dA is sqrt(det) dx dy. So sqrt( (32)^2 / (4 - x² - y²)^2 ) ) dx dy = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy.

Wait, but that's the same as the ds² expression? No, wait, the area element dA for a 2D metric is indeed sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant. So yeah, that's correct.

So the area would be the integral of dA over the region where the metric is defined. Now, what is the region of definition for this metric? The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), so the denominator must be positive to have a real metric. So 4 - x² - y² > 0 → x² + y² < 4.

Wait, but wait, if the denominator is 4 - x² - y², then when x² + y² approaches 4, the metric blows up. So the region is a disk of radius 2, because 4 is (2)^2. So the coordinates (x,y) are defined inside a circle of radius 2.

But the question is about a pseudosphere of radius 2. Hmm. Wait, maybe the metric is that of a pseudosphere, so the area should be calculated over the entire surface.

Wait, but the metric is expressed in terms of x and y, suggesting a 2D space. So perhaps the area is being considered on this (x,y) plane. But that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the metric is for a surface embedded in 3D, but expressed in 2D coordinates.

Wait, perhaps the metric given is conformally flat, since it's written as (something) times (dx² + dy²). So it's conformally equivalent to the flat metric.

So the area would be the integral of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy over the region where x² + y² <4. Because the area element is (32/(4 - (x² + y²))) dx dy.

So to compute this area, I can switch to polar coordinates. Let me let x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, so r² = x² + y², and the area element becomes r dr dθ.

So substituting, the area A is the integral over r from 0 to 2, and θ from 0 to 2π, of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So A = ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Let me compute the radial integral first. Let me denote I = ∫ (0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me make a substitution: let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → (-1/2) du = r dr.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes:

I = ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [32 / u ] * (-1/2) du.

The limits are changing from 4 to 0, and the integral is from higher to lower, so I can reverse the limits and remove the negative sign:

I = (32 * 1/2) ∫ (from 0 to4) (1/u) du.

Which is 16 ∫ (0 to4) (1/u) du → 16 [ln u] from 0 to4.

Wait, but ln u evaluated at u=0 is negative infinity. So the integral becomes 16 (ln4 - ln0). But ln0 is -infinity, so ln4 - (-infty) is +infty. So the integral I diverges to infinity.

So the area A is ∫θ=0 to 2π dθ * I → 2π * ∞ = infinity.

Wait, but that would mean the area is infinite. But that can't be right because the pseudosphere has finite area. Or does it?

Wait, no, wait. A pseudosphere is a surface with finite area? Or is it infinite? Because a pseudosphere is like a tractricoid, which is a surface of revolution of a tractrix. Wait, no, actually, the tractrix has infinite length, so when you revolve it around the asymptote, the surface area might be finite or infinite?

Wait, I thought the pseudosphere has finite area. Wait, let me think. The tractrix is a curve that has a finite arc length from the origin to infinity, but when you rotate it, the surface area might be finite. Wait, I'm a bit unsure.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric given isn't that of a pseudosphere but something else. Or perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the area.

Wait, the question says the pseudosphere has radius r=2. But in general, the Gaussian curvature K for a pseudosphere is -1/r², so K=-1/4. So the radius is 2. So maybe this metric is indeed for a pseudosphere with radius 2.

Wait, but the metric given is in (x,y) coordinates, and the area we computed is infinite. But the options include D) +infty. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait, I thought the pseudosphere area is finite. Let me double-check. Let me think about the surface area of a pseudosphere.

Pseudosphere is a surface of revolution, created by rotating a tractrix around its asymptote. The tractrix has a finite length, but when you rotate it, does the surface area become finite?

Wait, the parametric equations for the tractrix are known, and when you rotate it, the surface area can be calculated. Let me think about the formula for the surface area of a surface of revolution.

The surface area S is 2π ∫ y ds, where y is the radius at each point along the curve, and ds is the arc length element of the generating curve.

For the tractrix, which is parametrized as (x(t), y(t)), where x(t) = a sech t, y(t) = a (t - tanh t), with a being a constant. The asymptote is at x = a. So the length of the tractrix from t=0 to t→∞ is finite: it's a finite curve. But when you rotate it around the asymptote, the surface area might be finite.

Wait, but perhaps I'm mixing things. Let me check another approach. The Gaussian curvature of a pseudosphere is K = -1/r², where r is 2 here.

In 2D, the area can be related to the Euler characteristic via Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that the integral of Gaussian curvature over a compact surface is 2π χ, where χ is the Euler characteristic.

But a pseudosphere isn't compact because it has a cusp at the "north pole". So it's not a closed surface. So maybe the Gauss-Bonnet theorem doesn't directly apply here. Alternatively, the area would be infinite.

Wait, but that's conflicting with what I thought earlier. So if the metric's area is infinite, then the answer is D) +infty.

But wait, perhaps the coordinates given in the metric only cover part of the pseudosphere, which is why the area seems infinite. Because in reality, the pseudosphere is non-compact and the metric might have a singularity at r=2.

Wait, but the
