Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem states that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each giving a different energy value.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that the energy-time uncertainty principle is relevant here. The principle says that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least h-bar over 2π, which is a tiny number. Wait, more precisely, the formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ℏ/(2π), but sometimes people approximate it as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, depending on the exact formulation.

Wait, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, right? So ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But I'm not sure about the exact factors; sometimes I see it written as (ℏ/2π) for the uncertainty product. Oh wait, the energy-time uncertainty relation is often presented as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So that's the key.

So, the idea is that if the energy difference is too small, the two states won't be distinguishable because the uncertainty in the energy would be larger than the difference, making it impossible to tell them apart. 

In this problem, the lifetimes are given. Oh, wait, the lifetimes are the lifetimes of the states. So, each state has a certain lifetime, and the uncertainty in time for each state is roughly that lifetime. So for E1, the lifetime (Δt1) is 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, Δt2 is 1e-8 seconds. 

Wait, but how does that apply to the energy difference between E1 and E2? Let me think. If we're trying to resolve two energy levels, the energy difference ΔE must be such that the uncertainty in energy for each state is smaller than ΔE. Because if the uncertainty is bigger than the actual difference, the lines would overlap, and you wouldn't be able to tell them apart.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to calculate the uncertainty in energy for each state and ensure that the energy difference is larger than both uncertainties. Wait, but the states themselves have their own uncertainties. So the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state's energy, perhaps?

Wait, no. Let's think differently. When you have two states, each with a certain uncertainty in energy, their energy separation must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, right? Because otherwise, the two energy levels would overlap in the uncertainty range, making them indistinguishable.

So the energy difference ΔE should be greater than the uncertainty in E1 plus the uncertainty in E2. Because each state has an uncertainty in its own energy due to their lifetimes. So for E1, the uncertainty ΔE1 is ħ/(2 Δt1). Similarly, ΔE2 is ħ/(2 Δt2).

So, the minimal ΔE that allows clear distinction would be when ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2. Or perhaps, the minimal ΔE is when it's greater than the maximum of the two individual uncertainties. I'm a bit confused. Let me think step by step.

First, compute the energy uncertainty for each state.

For state 1: ΔE1 = ħ / (2 * Δt1)
Δt1 = 1e-9 s
So ΔE1 = (1.05e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) = (1.05e-34) / (2e-9) ) = approx 5.25e-26 J.

Wait, but I need that in eV. Hmm. Let me convert J to eV. Since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J.

So, 5.25e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = approximately 3.28e-7 eV.

Wait wait, let me do the calculation properly.

ΔE1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-9) = 5.272859e-26 J.

Convert J to eV: 5.272859e-26 J * (1 eV / 1.60217663e-19 J) ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

So ΔE1 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, for state 2, Δt2 = 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = (1.05457e-34) / (2 * 1e-8) )= 5.272859e-27 J.

Convert J to eV: 5.272859e-27 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

So, ΔE1 is approximately 3.29e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is about 3.29e-8 eV.

Now, the energy difference between E1 and E2 needs to be larger than the sum of these two uncertainties, right? Because if the difference is less than the combined uncertainty, you can't distinguish the two states.

Wait, but wait. Are the uncertainties additive? Or is each state's uncertainty a separate consideration?

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference ΔE must be larger than each individual uncertainty. Because if ΔE is larger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2, then E1's uncertainty is smaller than ΔE, and E2's as well. Or perhaps it's when the sum is considered.

Wait, I think the minimal condition is that the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Because if the two states' energies are within each other's uncertainty, you can't resolve them.

Wait, for example, suppose E1 is at E and E2 is at E + ΔE. The uncertainty around E is ΔE1, and around E2 is ΔE2. For them to be distinguishable, the lower edge of E2's uncertainty should be above the upper edge of E1's uncertainty.

So, E + ΔE1 < (E + ΔE) - ΔE2.

Wait, that would require ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Yes, because the lower end of E2 is E + ΔE - ΔE2, and the upper end of E1 is E + ΔE1. So for these not to overlap, E + ΔE - ΔE2 > E + ΔE1 → ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So the minimal ΔE is when it's just larger than the sum of ΔE1 and ΔE2.

So, sum of ΔE1 and ΔE2 is 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.619e-7 eV.

So, the energy difference should be larger than approximately 3.6e-7 eV.

Now, let's look at the options:

Option A: 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV. That's way smaller than 3.6e-7. So no.

Option B: 1e-11 eV → even smaller. Nope.

Option C: 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV. That's much larger than 3.6e-7 eV. So yes, that would work.

Option D: 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV. That's 1e-8 eV, which is smaller than 3.6e-7 eV, so it's insufficient.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, because I'm a bit confused about whether the energy difference needs to be greater than each individual uncertainty or the sum.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in the energy measurement. But the measurement uncertainty would be based on the minimum of the two lifetimes? Or perhaps the maximum?

Wait, another approach: when you have two states, the energy difference ΔE must be at least the uncertainty in energy of the system. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps each state has an uncertainty in its own energy, and the two states must be separated by enough so that their energy ranges don't overlap. So, the minimal ΔE would be when the energy difference equals the sum of their individual energy uncertainties.

So, ΔE = ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So, as I calculated earlier, that's about 3.6e-7 eV.

Looking back at the options, the only option that's larger than 3.6e-7 eV is option C, which is 1e-4 eV (0.0001 eV), which is much bigger. So that would work.

The other options are too small. Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is about 0.00000001 eV, way too small.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty of the measurement, which might be based on the average of the lifetimes or something else. But I think the correct approach is to sum the individual uncertainties because each state's uncertainty contributes to the overall separation needed.

So the correct energy difference should be greater than 3.6e-7 eV. The option that's larger than that is C (1e-4 eV), which is 1e-4 eV is 1e-4 = 0.0001, which is much larger than 3.6e-7.

So the correct answer would be option C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2\pi},
\]

where \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state and \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy. For distinguishability, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) between the two states must be larger than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties, \( \Delta E_1 \) and \( \Delta E_2 \), to ensure their energy ranges do not overlap.

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties
The lifetimes of the two states are \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). Using the uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_2}.
\]

Substituting \( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 5.27 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} = 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 5.27 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} = 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the required energy difference
For the two states to be distinguishable, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must satisfy:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

Adding the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 3.29 \times 10^{-7} + 3.29 \times 10^{-8} = 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, \( \Delta E \) must be greater than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is also much smaller than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 3.619 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so this is insufficient.

### Final Answer
The only option that satisfies the condition for distinguishability is **Option C**.
