Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it. The question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds and asks for their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm. Alright, I'll start by breaking it down.

First, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as classical mechanics. Right, because you can't just subtract the velocities. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from Einstein's theory of relativity. The formula is something like (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). So I think that's the right approach.

Let me plug in the numbers. Wait, wait. Because both are moving in the same direction, so one is moving faster than the other. So astronaut A is 2m, speed 0.6c; astronaut B is 3m, speed 0.5c. So from A's perspective, what's B's speed? Or maybe from the other way around. Or wait, the relative speed is the speed of one as seen from the other. So which one is which? Hmm.

Wait, the formula for relative velocity when objects are moving in the same direction. Let me think. If object 1 is moving at u, and object 2 at v, then the relative speed of 2 with respect to 1 is (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)). So in this case, if we consider astronaut A (2m) moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B (3m) at 0.5c, then from A's frame, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Wait, that would give a negative velocity, which would mean B is moving in the opposite direction as seen from A. But that doesn't make sense because both are moving in the positive x-direction. Oh wait, I must have mixed up the formula.

Wait, I think the correct formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is the speed of the second object relative to the first. Or maybe I should think more carefully. Let's define the observer's frame as astronaut A's frame. So in the rest frame of A, what's the speed of B?

In the lab frame (assuming that's the rest frame where both are moving), astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, what is B's velocity? So the formula for the relative velocity is (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)), where u is A's speed in the lab frame (0.6c), and v is B's speed in the lab frame (0.5c). Wait wait, no, because in A's frame, the lab is moving at -0.6c. So the relative speed of B would
