Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of relativity concepts. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem says there are two astronauts. Their masses are given as 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds: 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Hmm, I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. Like, if one object is moving at 0.6c and another at 0.5c, you can't just say the relative speed is 0.1c. Oh right, because of the velocity addition formula. Wait, but wait, what's the correct formula for relative velocity in special relativity?

Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). I think that's for when one frame is moving at v2 relative to another frame moving at v1. So let me plug in the values. Let me see, v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c.

So substituting, (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let's compute the numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c². Since c squared cancels, it's 1 -0.3 = 0.7.

So the relative speed v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. Oh wait, that's approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c for the relative speed.

Now, what about the total energy of the system? The system consists of two astronauts, so I think I need to calculate the relativistic energy for each and add them together.

Relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Let me compute each astronaut's energy.

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c². Let's compute that: 1.1547 *3 ≈ 3.464 m c².

Wait, wait, let me double-check. 3m multiplied by 1.1547 is 3 * 1.1547 = 3.4641 m c².

So E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc² ≈ 5.964 mc². So approximately 5.96 mc² when rounded.

Looking back at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option B has E=4.96, which is less than that. Option D has E=5 mc², which would be if I added just the rest energies, but no, because they are moving, their relativistic energies are higher.

So the correct answer should be option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

Wait, but did I calculate the velocities correctly? Let me double-check the velocity addition. v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So using (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²).

v1 - v2 is 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.6*0.5) = 1 -0.3=0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which rounds to 0.14c. So that's correct.

And for energies, adding 2.5 and 3.464 gives 5.964, so 5.96 mc². That's option C.

Wait, let me check if the masses are 2m and 3m correctly used in the energy calculation. Oh yes, because each has their own mass, so E should be gamma times their mass times c squared. So yeah, that's correct.

So the answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### First Astronaut (Mass \(2m\), Speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Second Astronaut (Mass \(3m\), Speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\)**.
