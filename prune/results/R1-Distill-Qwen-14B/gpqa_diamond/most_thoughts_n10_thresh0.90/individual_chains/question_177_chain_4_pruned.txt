Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think through it step by step. So the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. 

The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Wait, but wait, mass might not be directly relevant here since luminosity of stars is more related to their radius and temperature. Hmm, I remember that luminosity depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power, something like L = 4πσR²T⁴, maybe? Or was it another formula?

Then, the astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. 

Wait, but wait, actually, the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So λ1 = λ2. From Wien's Law, since λ_max = (hc)/(5kT) or something like that, so T is inversely proportional to λ_max. So if λ1 = λ2, then T1 = T2. So both stars have the same temperature.

So now, the luminosity formula L = 4π R² σ T^4. Since R and T are the same factors, let's compute the luminosity ratio.

Wait, but wait! The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. And since they have the same temperature (because λ_max same), T1 = T2.

So the luminosity of each star would be:

L1 = 4π (R1)^2 σ T^4
L2 = 4π (R2)^2 σ T^4

So L1/L2 = (R1²)/(R2²) = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. So the factor is approximately 2.25. So the answer would be option A which is ~2.25.

Wait, but wait, the question mentions that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. How does that affect the calculation? Oh! Oh right, radial velocity can affect the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So we're talking about the observed wavelengths, right?

Wait, so the actual emission from each star is at wavelength λ, but due to Doppler shift, the observed wavelength might change. So if Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, its light isn't Doppler shifted. But Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, so its light is redshifted or blueshifted depending on the direction. Wait, but how does that affect the peak wavelength?

Wait
