Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

Alright, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The problem then talks about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I'm asked to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. Oh, and the transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. They also mention LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, so we can assume that each region is behaving like a blackbody in terms of emission.

Hmm. So, the key here is understanding how the ratio of populations in two energy levels depends on temperature. I remember that the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. 

The Boltzmann factor is (n_j / n_i) = (g_j / g_i) * exp( - (E_j - E_i)/(k T) ), where g_j and g_i are the statistical weights, and E are the energies. If the levels are j and i, with j being higher than i, then E_j > E_i.

Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So, when the star is cooler (spots present), the ratio is lower. That suggests that the ratio depends on temperature in a way that when T decreases, the ratio decreases. So, I think the ratio is n1/n2, where level 1 is lower in energy than level 2. Because if the temperature drops, the ratio would decrease.

Wait, wait. Let me think. If the star is cooler, the excitation is lower. So, for two energy levels, the higher level would have fewer atoms if the temperature is lower. So, n_lower / n_upper would increase when T increases, because higher T makes the exponent less negative, so more atoms are in the upper level. But in this case, the ratio is n1/n2, and when the star has spots, it's lower. So, does that mean that in the cooler case, the ratio is lower? Which would imply that level 2 is higher in energy than level 1.

So, in the problem statement, the ratio is decreasing when spots are present. So, when the overall T drops from 6000 K to 5500 K, the ratio n1/n2 goes down. So, that would imply that when T is lower, n1/n2 is lower. So, the ratio n1/n2 is inversely related to T.

Wait, let me get this right. The Boltzmann factor: n_upper/n_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( - (E_upper - E_lower)/(k T) )

So, if E_upper > E_lower, then as T increases, the exponential becomes larger (since the exponent is negative, but T is in denominator, so higher T makes the exponent less negative). So, n_upper/n_lower increases with T.

So, n_lower/n_upper would decrease with T. Because as T increases, more atoms are excited to the upper level, so the lower level population decreases relative to the upper.

So, in the problem, when the star has spots, T_eff drops. So, the ratio n1/n2 (which is lower level to upper level) would decrease. So, when spots are present, the ratio is smaller.

So, the question is, what's the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So, the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

Which would be ( [n10/n20] ) / [ (n1s/n2s) ]

Wait, but actually, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So, the ratio without spots is higher than with.

So, the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_spots. So, the ratio increases by that factor when the star is spotless.

So, I need to compute this factor. So, I can model each case using the Boltzmann equation.

But wait, wait a second. The problem states that the overall Teff is 5500 K when spots are present. But what about the temperature of the spotted regions versus the non-spotted regions.

Oh, wait, the star's surface is 40% covered by spots. When the surface is not covered by spots, the Teff is 6000 K. But when the spots are present, the overall Teff is 5500 K. Hmm, but the spots themselves must be cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So perhaps the effective temperature is lower because the spots are at a lower temperature.

Wait a minute, but how does that affect the photosphere's overall emission? Oh, wait, the problem says that when the surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So that suggests that the star's total luminosity is now lower, so the effective temperature is lower.

But wait, effective temperature is determined by the total luminosity and radius. Oh, wait, the star's radius is given, but in this problem, the radius may not change. Wait, the star's radius is 1.5 solar radii regardless of spots. So, when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, which are cooler, the star's total luminosity would drop, leading to a lower Teff. So, the effective temperature of the entire star is 5500 K when 40% of the surface is cooler.

But how does that affect the photospheric temperature where the Ti lines are being measured? Because the problem says, "in the stellar photosphere", so maybe when the spots are present, the photosphere's temperature is lower on average.

Wait, no, perhaps each part of the photosphere is at a different temperature. But that complicates things. Alternatively, maybe the overall photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K. But wait, the photosphere is not the same as the effective temperature; the photosphere is the layer from which the star emits most of its light, and the effective temperature is the temperature a blackbody would have to emit the same total radiation. So, when the star has spots, which are cooler regions, the average flux is less, hence a lower Teff.

But when looking at the photosphere, each part is at a certain temperature. So, perhaps the majority of the photosphere is at 6000 K, and 40% is at a lower temperature, say T_spot, which is less than 6000 K.

Wait, but the problem states that when the surface is not covered by spots, the Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So, perhaps the star as a whole has an effective temperature of 5500 K when 40% of its surface is covered by spots that are at some lower temperature.

But how does that affect the photospheric temperature? Because in LTE, each region emits according to its local temperature. So, when considering the line formation (Ti atoms in the photosphere), each atom is in a region with a certain temperature.

Wait, but the problem says that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe when the star has spots, the photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the spots are cooler regions, and the rest of the photosphere is at higher temperature. So, the majority (60%) is at 6000 K, and 40% is at a lower temperature, say T_spot, and the overall Teff is 5500 K.

But how to model that? Let me think. The star's total luminosity is L = 4πR² σ Teff^4. So, when the star has spots, its total luminosity is L = 0.6 L_6000 + 0.4 L_spot.

Wait, perhaps that's the way to approach it. Because when spots are present, the star has 60% of its surface at T1 and 40% at T2. The total luminosity is then 0.6 * σ T1^4 * π R² + 0.4 * σ T2^4 * π R². The effective temperature is given by L = 4π R² σ Teff^4.

So, let me write that equation:

0.6 * T1^4 + 0.4 * T2^4 = (Teff)^4

In the case when there are spots, Teff is 5500 K. So,

0.6 * (6000)^4 + 0.4 * (T_spot)^4 = (5500)^4

Wait, because when there are no spots, the entire surface is at 6000 K, so T1 = 6000 and T_spot would be lower when spots are present.

Wait, actually, when the star has spots, the rest of the surface (60% coverage) is presumably at the original Teff of 6000 K, and the spots are at a lower T_spot.

Wait, no, that's probably not correct. Because when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. So, perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500 K. But that might not make sense because the spots are cooler regions. Alternatively, perhaps the question is simplifying things and considering the overall photosphere's temperature as 5500 K when spots are present. But that might not be accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present, but I'm not sure. Because the spots would be cooler, and the rest of the photosphere would be at a higher temperature, but the problem states that the overall Teff decreases.

Hmm, maybe I should proceed with the assumption that when the star has spots, the photosphere (the regions where the Ti atoms are) has an effective temperature of 5500 K. So, that would be the temperature to plug into the Boltzmann equation.

Wait, but that's probably not the case, because the spots are cooler, but the rest of the photosphere is at a higher temperature. So, the line formation would be occurring in regions with varying temperatures.

But the problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So perhaps the average temperature of the photosphere is now 5500 K.

Wait, but the effective temperature is the temperature of a blackbody that would emit the same total radiation as the star. So, when the star has spots, the total radiation is less, so lower Teff. But the individual photospheric regions have their own temperatures. So, the problem might be simplifying, assuming that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present.

Alternatively, maybe the effective temperature of the photosphere itself is 5500 K. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait,
