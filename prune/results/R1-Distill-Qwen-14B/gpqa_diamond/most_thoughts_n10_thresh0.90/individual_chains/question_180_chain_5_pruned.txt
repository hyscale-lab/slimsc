Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. They have negligible mass. Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are A to D.

Hmm, so I remember that when dealing with charges and potential energy, it's usually about calculating the potential energy between each pair of charges. Since the system is isolated, we're probably looking at the electrostatic potential energy.

Wait, the charges are identical, so each has a charge of 2e. What's 2e in coulombs? I think e is the elementary charge, approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So 2e would be 3.204 x 10^-19 C. But wait, I should double-check that. Oh yeah, the elementary charge is about 1.602e-19 C, so 2e is correct.

Now, in the system, there are two groups of charges: one is fixed at point P (the 13th charge), and the other twelve are at a distance of 2 meters from P. So the 13th charge is fixed, and the twelve are all at 2m from it.

Wait, but wait, the problem says 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the 13th is at P. So the setup is: one charge at P, and twelve others each at 2m from P. So each of the twelve is a distance of 2m away from the 13th charge at P.

But wait, also, the twelve charges are themselves a group. Are they fixed in space relative to each other, or are they free to move among themselves as long as they stay 2m from P? Hmm, the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2m from P, so perhaps their mutual distances aren't fixed. So when considering the potential energy, I need to think about all the interactions between each charge.

Wait, but the system's minimum energy. So the potential energy between the charges will depend on their arrangement
