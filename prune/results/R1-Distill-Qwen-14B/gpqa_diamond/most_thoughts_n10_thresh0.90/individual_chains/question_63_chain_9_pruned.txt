Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule and quantum models. Hmm, the question is about the momentum of a photon that causes a transition to the next energy state. Let me think through this step by step.

The molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model, also known as the rotation-vibration model. Oh right, this model considers both rotational and vibrational energy states. But wait, the question is about the fundamental state and moving to the next lowest energy. So I need to figure out what the allowed transitions are in this model.

In the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized and include both rotation and vibration. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be the first vibrational level and the lowest rotational state. But wait, what's the next state with the lowest energy? That would probably be the first vibrational excited state, right? Because higher vibrational states have higher energy than rotational states. Or is it the first rotational state plus the same vibrational state? I'm a bit confused here. Let me recall: vibrational energy levels are spaced more closely compared to rotational ones. No, wait, no. Actually, the spacing between vibrational levels is much larger than that between rotational levels. So the fundamental state is the ground state with v=0 and J=0 (the lowest rotational state). The next energy state would be either increasing J by 1 (to J=1) within the same vibrational state, or moving to v=1 with J=0. But which transition is lower in energy?

Wait, the vibrational energy levels have much higher spacing. So the energy difference for the first vibrational excitation would be much larger than the rotational transitions. So the next state with the lowest possible energy would actually be the next rotational state (J=1) within the same vibrational level (v=0). Because even though J=0 to J=1 is a small step, it's smaller than moving to v=1.

But wait, the question says, the molecule is in its fundamental state. Fundamental state is v=0 and J=0. The next state is the next possible energy state. So the possible options are either v=0 and J=1, or v=1 and J=0. Which one is lower in energy? Let me think about the energies.

The rotational energy is given by E_rot = (ħ² / (2I)) J (J+1), where I is the moment of inertia. The vibrational energy is E_vib = (1/2) h w (for v=0) and E_vib = (3/2) h w (for v=1) since each vibrational level is quantized. Wait, no, the energy levels for a harmonic oscillator (which is a simple model for vibrations) are E_v = (v + 1/2) h w. So for v=0, it's (1/2) h w, and v=1 is (3/2) h w. So the difference between v=0 and v=1 is h w.

Now, what's the difference in energy between J=0 and J=1 in the same vibrational state (v=0)? Let's compute E_rot for J=0 and J=1.

E_rot(J=0) = 0, E_rot(J=1) = (ħ²/(2I)) * 1*(1+1) = 2 * (ħ²/(2I)) = ħ²/(I). So E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = ħ²/(I).

So we need to compare h w (vib) and ħ²/(I) (rotational). Which is smaller? Let's compute both.

First, the given data: Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu. So the reduced mass μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Wait, 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 3.01e-27 kg.

The bond length R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. The moment of inertia I is μ R². So I = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg m².

Now, ħ is Planck's constant over 2π, which is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So ħ² is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

So E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = ħ² / I = (1.112e-68) / (1.204e-46) ≈ 9.23e-23 J.

Now, what's the energy difference for vibrational transition, ΔE_vib = h w. h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s. w is 4e14 rad/s. So ΔE_vib = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Comparing 9.23e-23 J (rotational) and 2.65e-19 J (vibrational). Clearly, the rotational transition is much smaller in energy. So the next state with the lowest energy would be the rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 within the same vibrational state.

Wait, but wait a second. The question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next possible state would be the one with the smallest energy increase. So the rotational transition requires less energy, so the photon would have to match that energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question implies that both vibrational and rotational transitions are allowed, and the photon's energy corresponds to the energy difference between these states. But wait, what is the exact scenario? If the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), and it absorbs a photon, what state will it go to? The next possible state would be either v=0, J=1 or v=1, J=0. Since the rotational transition requires less energy (smaller ΔE), the photon's energy should match the rotational energy difference.

So, the required photon energy is E_rot = ħ²/(2I) * [ J (J+1) - J_prev (J_prev +1) ].

Wait, no. The energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = (ħ²/(2I)) [2 - 0] = 2 (ħ²/(2I)) ) = ħ²/(I). Wait, earlier I calculated that as 9.23e-23 J.

But wait, in the rotational model, the energy levels are quantized as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. B is ħ²/(2I). So the energy difference between J and J+1 is B [ (J+1)(J+2) - J (J+1) ) ] = B [ (J+1)( (J+2 - J) ) ] = B (J+1)(2) ) = 2 B (J+1). So for J=0 to J=1, the difference is 2 B * (0+1) = 2 B.

But B is ħ²/(2I), so 2B = ħ²/I, which matches what I had before.

So the photon's energy should be E_photon = ħ²/(I) = 9.23e-23 J.

But wait, I think I made a mistake. Because the question is about the non-rigid rotor model, which includes both rotation and vibration. So perhaps the energy levels are a combination of both. So the total energy is E = E_rot + E_vib.

But the fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next state could be either v=0, J=1 or v=1, J=0. Since the rotational transition requires less energy, the molecule would prefer to make the rotational transition if possible.

So the photon must have energy equal to the rotational transition. So E_photon = ħ²/(I).

Wait, the photon's energy is E = h f = p c, where p is momentum and c is speed of light. Alternatively, E = p c.

Wait, but wait, the energy of a photon is also given by E = h f, and since f = c / λ, we have E = h c / λ. But I think the momentum p is related to energy as E = p c. So p = E/(c).

Hmm, so to find the momentum, I can compute p = E_photon / c.

So E_photon is 9.23e-23 J. The speed of light c is 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.23e-23 / 3e8 = approximately 3.077e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the given p values are around 1e-27 to 2e-27 N·s. Wait, N·s is kg·m/s, so the units match.

Wait, but 3.077e-31 kg·m/s is way smaller than the
