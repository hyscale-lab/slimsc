Okay, so I need to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's see, the compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and they're reacting it through a set of reagents. I'll need to figure out the structure based on the NMR, then see what the reactions do to it to get the final product.

First, looking at the NMR data. The peaks are:

9.72 (t, 1H)
6.98 (d, 2H)
6.51 (d, 2H)
6.27 (bs, 2H)
3.66 (d, 2H)

Hmm. Let me interpret this. The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. Triplet and around 9.7 ppm—could that be an aldehyde proton? Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm, and here it's a triplet, which might suggest coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, but aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and appear as singlets because they're adjacent to only one carbon. Maybe it's something else. Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring with some coupling?

Wait, the 9.72 ppm could be an aldehyde. But if it's a triplet, maybe it's a conjugated double bond situation. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic proton that's coupling with two others. Let me think about the other peaks.

6.98 and 6.51 are doublets, both integrating to 2H each. That looks like a pair of doublets, maybe from a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like a benzene ring with two substituents opposite each other. The 6.98 is a triplet? No, doublet. So maybe each is part of a para-substituted aromatic group.

Then the 6.27 is a broad singlet (bs) for 2H. Broad signals are often from alcohols or maybe something like an enol. But 2H as a singlet—could that be an aromatic ring with two substituents? Or perhaps it's an -OCH2- group? Not sure.

The 3.66 is a doublet for 2H. That's a bit upfield for CH2. Maybe a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2 or CH2O. Like in an ether or ester. Wait, but the formula is C8H9NO. So the molecular formula has one N and one O.

So putting this all together, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents. Let's think about the possible structure.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation can be calculated. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X=0, so (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation: maybe a benzene ring (three double bonds, which counts as three degrees), plus a double bond or ring elsewhere and another ring or double bond. Alternatively, a benzene ring (three) plus a conjugated double bond (one) plus a ring or another double bond.

Looking at the NMR, the 9.72 ppm could be an aldehyde (one double bond), and the 6.98 and 6.51 suggest two doublets, maybe a para-substituted benzene. Then what about the other protons?

Wait, the 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) could be -OCH2-. But that's speculative. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom like O or N.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a benzaldehyde with some substituents attached via an oxygen or nitrogen. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

Wait, perhaps it's a benzaldehyde attached to a chain that has some substituents. Let's think about the given reactions.

The reagents are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl: This is a nitrous acid condition, typically used for diazotization. Usually, this is done with aromatic amines, especially aniline derivatives, under cold conditions (like 0-5°C) to form a diazonium salt.

2. H2O: Maybe a hydrolysis step. Diazonium salts can undergo hydrolysis, especially under certain conditions. For example, in the presence of water and acid, they might form phenols.

3. Aq. KOH, heat: This could be a hydrolysis under basic conditions, perhaps a SN2 reaction, elimination, or some kind of condensation. Alternatively, for diazonium salts, when treated with aqueous KOH and heat, it can lead to the formation of hydroxyl groups (like in the Gattermann–Koch reaction? Or maybe it's a Sandmeyer reaction variant? Or perhaps it's a hydrolysis of a nitrile, but that doesn't fit here.)

Wait, but the initial compound has an N in the formula. So maybe the starting material has a nitro group or an amine group. Since the first reagent is nitrous acid, which reacts with amines, perhaps the starting material has an aromatic amine.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So the N is probably part of an amine group. Let's think: an aniline derivative. So the structure could be a benzaldehyde with an aniline substituent.

But wait, the molecular formula has one O. So if the starting compound is an aromatic aldehyde with an amino group, but that would give O and N. Let's see:

If the structure has a benzene ring, an aldehyde, and an amino group. Maybe a diphenylamine structure? Or perhaps a benzene ring with an aldehyde and an amino group attached.

But looking at the NMR, the triplet at 9.72 ppm. If that's an aldehyde, then perhaps it's a benzaldehyde derivative with substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is a benzaldehyde with an amino group attached. For example, p-aminobenzaldehyde.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the number of rings. The benzene ring is six carbons. Then, perhaps a two-carbon chain attached with an aldehyde and an amino group. Wait, maybe a benzaldehyde with a side chain that includes an amine.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a benzylamine derivative with an aldehyde group elsewhere. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a 4-aminophenyl group attached to a chain that includes an aldehyde.

Wait, let me think about the peaks again. The 9.72 ppm is a triplet (1H). That could be the aldehyde proton. The triplet suggests two neighboring protons. But aldehydes typically have only one proton, which is adjacent to a carbon. Wait, unless it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde, like a conjugated system. The aldehyde proton is at the end, and the conjugated double bond could cause coupling with two protons on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an aromatic aldehyde
