Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if plx is small, the distance is large, and vice versa.

Wait, the formula here is number of stars N = 1 / plx^5. So N is proportional to plx^(-5). But I need to find how the number of stars changes with distance. So I need to express N in terms of distance r instead of parallax.

I remember that the parallax plx is equal to 1 over distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is in parsecs. Wait, actually, I think plx is in arcseconds, and the distance r is in parsecs. The formula is plx (arcsec) = 1 / r (parsecs). So plx = 1/r. Therefore, r = 1/plx.

Now, substituting plx with 1/r in the expression for N. So N is proportional to (1/r)^(-5). Because plx is 1/r, so plx^5 is (1/r)^5. So 1 over plx^5 is 1/(1/r^5) which is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh right, it's the rate of change, like the number per unit distance. Hmm, so maybe I need to think about how N depends on r.

Wait, the given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. But since plx = 1/r, then 1/plx^5 is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So as r increases, N increases as the fifth power.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So for a given range of distance, say dr, how many stars are there? Or is it the number density as a function of distance?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of differential number. Like, dN/dr, the number of stars per unit distance. Because the question says "per unit range of distance, r."

Yeah, that makes sense. So if N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr would be the rate at which N changes with r.

So if N ∝ r^5, then dN/dr is 5 r^4. So the change in number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^4.

Wait, but let me double-check. So N ∝ r^5 → N = k r^5, where k is a constant. Then dN/dr = 5 k r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) is proportional to r^4.

Looking at the options, option C is r^4. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. So the initial relation was number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, which we converted to N proportional to r^5. So the
