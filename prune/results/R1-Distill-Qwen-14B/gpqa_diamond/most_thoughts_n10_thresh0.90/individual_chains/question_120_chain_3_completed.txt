Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, let's try to think through this.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in a star's position as observed from Earth as we orbit the Sun. The formula I recall is that distance (in parsecs) is the reciprocal of the parallax (plx in arcseconds). So, distance d = 1 / plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So, imagine we're looking at ranges of parallaxes and counting how many stars fall into each range. We want to see how this count changes as plx changes.

Wait, the stars are assumed to be uniformly distributed. Uniform in what sense? I think it's uniform in terms of space, meaning that the number density of stars is constant throughout the volume. So if you have a certain volume, the number of stars is proportional to that volume.

Let me think about the distribution of stars with respect to distance. Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, plx is higher for closer stars. So as plx decreases, the distance increases. 

If I consider a small range in plx, say from plx to plx + dplx, what does that correspond to in terms of distance? Since dplx is a small change, maybe I can express it in terms of distance. Let's see: plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Taking the derivative, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, but since d is positive, perhaps I should take absolute values. So dplx = (1/(d^2)) dd. Hmm, maybe it's easier to think in terms of how the volume changes with distance.

In 3D space, the number of stars in a shell between distance d and d + dd is proportional to the volume of that shell. The volume of a spherical shell is 4π r² dr. So for a small thickness dr, the number of stars would be proportional to r² dr. Because the number density is uniform, so N(r) ∝ r² dr.

But wait, our variable is plx, not distance. So let's express everything in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, then dd = -d² dplx (wait, let me compute the derivative properly). Let's compute dr as a function of plx. So r = 1/plx, so dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. That means that the change in plx, dplx, is related to the change in r as dplx = - (plx²) dr.

But when we're considering a small change in plx (dplx), the corresponding change in r (dr) is negative because as plx decreases, r increases. So I can write dr = -dplx/(plx²).

Now, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r is proportional to the surface area of the sphere (4π r²) multiplied by the thickness dr. So N = k * 4π r² dr, where k is some constant of proportionality.

Substituting dr from earlier, N = k *4π r² * (-dplx/(plx²)). But plx=1/r, so plx² =1/r². So substituting r =1/plx, r² = 1/(plx²).

So N becomes k *4π (1/(plx²)) ) * (dplx/( (1/plx)² )) )

Wait, let's compute this carefully. r² is (1/plx)^2 = 1/plx². And dr is - dplx/(plx²). Let me substitute these into N.

N = k *4π * (1/plx²) * ( -dplx/(plx²) )

Wait, wait—that can't be right. Wait, let's go back. dr is -dplx/(plx^2), which is -(1/plx²) dplx.

So substituting into N: N = k *4 π r² dr.

r² is (1/plx)^2 = 1/(plx^2).

dr is -(1/plx^2) dplx.

So substituting:

N = k *4 π * (1/(plx^2)) * ( -1/(plx^2) dplx )

Which becomes N = k *4 π * (-1/(plx^4)) dplx.

Wait, but we're looking for the number of stars per unit plx range, so dplx is the unit (or the small change). So for a given plx, the number per dplx is N/(dplx) = 4 π k * (-1/(plx^4)).

Wait, but the number can't be negative. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, the number decreases, which makes sense because higher plx (closer stars) would have more stars. So taking the absolute value, we have N = (4 π k) (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the number of stars per unit plx. So the number density in plx space is (number per dplx) divided by dplx. Or wait, perhaps I should think of it as the number per unit plx interval.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The number of stars with plx between p and p+dp is the number of stars in the volume between distance d and d+dd, where d=1/p and d+dd=1/(p+dp). Hmm, that's a bit tricky, maybe a differential approach is better.

Alternatively, since the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is proportional to 4π d² dd, and since d=1/plx, then dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So substituting, the number of stars is 4π d² dd =4π (1/plx)^2 * (-dplx/(plx^2)) ) = 4π (1/plx^2) * ( -dplx / plx^2 )

Which is 4π (-1)/(plx^4) dplx.

The negative sign indicates that as plx increases (distance decreases), the number of stars increases because you have more stars at smaller distances. But when considering the number per unit plx, you take the absolute value.

So the number of stars per unit plx is (4π k) * (1/plx^4), meaning that the number is proportional to 1/(plx^4).

Wait, none of the options have 1/plx^4 except option A. But wait, I'm a bit confused because earlier when I thought about the volume increasing with r^3, but the number per unit plx depends on the derivative.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's think again. The number of stars per unit volume is constant, say n. So the number of stars in a spherical shell between r and r+dr is n * 4π r² dr.

Since r=1/plx, dr = - dplx/(plx^2).

So substituting, N = n *4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx)/(plx^2) )

Wait, because dr is negative, but we take the magnitude, so dplx is the change in plx, and dr is the change in r. So the absolute value of dr is dplx/(plx^2).

So N = n *4π (1/plx^2) * (dplx/(plx^2)) ) = n *4π (dplx) / plx^4.

So the number per unit plx is N/dplx = 4π n / plx^4.

So the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/(plx^4). So the function would decrease as plx increases, which makes sense because higher plx (closer stars) are more numerous, but per unit plx, you have more at lower plx.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4, option D is 1/plx^3.

Wait, I'm getting 1/plx^4. But I'm a bit unsure because I might have messed up the substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the differential number. Let me think of it as the number per unit plx.

The number of stars in a small interval of plx (dplx) around p is dN = n * Volume between r and r+dr.

But r=1/p, so dr = -dplx/(p^2). So the volume is 4π r² dr =4π (1/p^2) * (-dplx / p^2 ) = -4π dplx/(p^4).

The number of stars is n times this volume: dN = n * (-4π dplx/(p^4)).

But the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, the number decreases. So the magnitude is dN = (4π n / p^4) dplx.

So dN/dp = 4 π n / p^4.

So the number per unit plx (dN/dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

Which would correspond to option A: ~1/plx^4. Hmm, but I'm not sure because earlier I thought the number per unit distance would be proportional to 1/r^2, but in terms of plx, it's 1/(1/r)^4 = r^4. Wait wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: If the number of stars per unit volume is n, then the number in a small volume element dV is n dV.

In spherical coordinates, dV is 4π r² dr.

But r=1/plx, so dr = -dplx/(plx^2).

So dV =4π (1/plx)^2 * (-dplx/(plx^2)) ) = -4π dplx/(plx^4).

Thus, the number of stars in this volume is n * (-4π dplx)/(plx^4).

So the differential number is dN = -4π n dplx / plx^4.

The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, the number of stars decreases. But when considering the number per unit plx, it's |dN/dp| = 4π n / plx^4.

So the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the answer would be option A.

But wait, I thought that the number of stars per unit distance would be proportional to 1/r^2, but that's another way to look at it. Let me think in terms of r.

At a distance r, the number of stars per unit distance (dr) is dN/dr = 4π r² n.

Because dN =4π r² n dr, so (dN/dr) =4π r² n.

In terms of plx, r=1/plx, so (dN/dr) =4 π (1/plx)^2 n.

But we can relate dN/dplx by using the chain rule. Since dr = -dplx/(plx^2), dN/dplx = (dN/dr) * (dr/dplx) ) = (4 π n (1/plx^2)) ) * (-1/(plx^2)) )

So dN/dplx = -4 π n / plx^4.

Again, the same result. So the number per unit plx is 1/plx^4.

So the answer should be option A, which is ~1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars in a spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). 

Since \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we can express \( dd \) in terms of \( d\text{plx} \): \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). Substituting this into the volume expression, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance \( d \) is:

\[
dN = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 dd = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right),
\]

where \( n \) is the constant number density of stars. Simplifying:

\[
dN = -\frac{4\pi n}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The negative sign indicates that as \( \text{plx} \) increases (closer stars), the number of stars decreases. Taking the absolute value, the number of stars per unit range of \( \text{plx} \) is:

\[
\frac{dN}{d\text{plx}} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of \( \text{plx} \) decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ 1/\text{plx}^4**
