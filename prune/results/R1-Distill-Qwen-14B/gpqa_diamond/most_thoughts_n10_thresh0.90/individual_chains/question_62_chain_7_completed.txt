Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using the correct sequence of reagents. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me break this down.

First, I should probably sketch the structures to visualize what's happening. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond connected to a CH2). The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a carbon that also has a hydroxymethyl group (OHCH2-) and another cyclohexane ring, with a formyl group (CHO). Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main structure is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, meaning a cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde group (CHO) attached. Then, at position 1 (which I think is the same as the position where CHO is attached), there's a cyclohexyl-hydroxymethyl substituent. So structure-wise, it's a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group, and the carbon adjacent to that (maybe the same carbon?) has a CH2 group connected to a hydroxyl (OH) and a cyclohexyl group. Hmm, maybe the structure is a cyclohexane ring where one carbon has both a formyl group and a CH2-OH and a CH2-cyclohexyl group? Or perhaps it's a branching point. I'm getting a bit confused, maybe I should think about the steps required to get there.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group. I think the ethynyl group is -C≡CH. So, the molecule is a cyclohexane ring with a triple bond attached to a CH2 group? Wait, no, ethynyl would be -C≡C-CH2- attached to the ring? Or is ethynyl cyclohexane just a cyclohexane with a triple bond between two adjacent carbons? No, wait, ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group, which is -C≡CH. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, maybe it's cyclohexane with a substituent that's a propargyl group. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but perhaps I can proceed.

The target molecule has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl group attached to a cyclohexane. So maybe the synthesis involves adding these groups step by step.

Looking at the options, each sequence of reagents is a set of reactions. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. Hmm, NaNH2 and methyl chloride sounds like a deprotonation followed by alkylation. Maybe it's a Birch reduction or something else. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. Methyl chloride could be an alkylating agent. So perhaps this is a deprotonation to form a cyclohexide anion, then alkylation with methyl chloride. Then H2/Pd is hydrogenation, maybe of a triple bond? Then Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, perhaps for elimination or forming epoxides? Wait, or Ba(OH)2 is used in the oxidation of alcohols to ketones, like in the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation? Alternatively, maybe it's used for elimination. Then the next step is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which sounds like the conditions for acid-catalyzed hydration or maybe for oxidation of alcohols.

Option B: 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH. So step 1 would be deprotonation and alkylation with ethyl chloride. Step 2 is Li and liquid NH3, which is typical for reductions, maybe Birch reduction or for deprotonating to form strong bases, or perhaps for elimination reactions. Step 3 is Ozone followed by H2O, which is ozonolysis. Step 4 is NH4OH, which could be a workup after ozonolysis, like reductive workup.

Option C: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2. Step 1 again is deprotonation and alkylation. Step 2 is hydrogenation with Pd over CaCO3, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation, perhaps of a triple bond to a single bond. Step 3 is ozonolysis using (CH3)2S as a reductant, which is a milder condition, so maybe it breaks double bonds into carbonyls. Step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which I'm not too sure about.

Option D: 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH. Step 1 uses methanol as the alkylating agent. Step 2 is Li/NH3, which might be for elimination or reduction. Step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, and step 4 is treatment with NH4OH.

Let me think about the target molecule. It has a formyl group (CHO) and a cyclohexylhydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane. So perhaps the synthesis involves introducing a ketone or aldehyde group and forming an alcohol that is then protected or transformed.

Wait, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main chain is cyclohexane with a carbaldehyde group (CHO) at position 1. Also, at the same position 1, there is a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group. So, perhaps the structure is like:

cyclohexane
|
CHO - CH2 - C(OH)(cyclohexyl)

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclohexane ring where the carbon with CHO also has a substituent which is CH2-OH and CH2-cyclohexyl? Or perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group that's attached to both an OH and a cyclohexyl group. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Let me think about the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with a triple bond attached. So, structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Wait, no, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a substituent that is -C≡C-CH2? Or is it -C≡CH attached to the ring.

Wait, ethynyl is the substituent. So, ethynylcyclohexane would be CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. So, structure is:

cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

So, starting from that, what can we do? The target molecule has a formyl group, so perhaps we need to introduce a carbonyl group. Looking at the options, some steps involve O3, which is ozonolysis, which breaks double bonds into carbonyls. Alternatively, hydrogenation steps may add H2 across triple bonds.

Option B and D have O3 steps, which suggests that perhaps a double bond is being cleaved. Let me think about each option's steps.

Option A's first step is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. NaNH2 is a strong base, perhaps deprotonating ethynylcyclohexane. Where would the acidic proton be? The sp-hybridized C-H in the triple bond is more acidic than alkanes, so perhaps deprotonating the ethynyl group to form a cyclohexyl acetylide. Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate it. So, the acetylide (strong base) would attack CH3Cl, giving cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C-CH3. Wait, no. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with CH2-C≡CH. Deprotonating would give cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C^- Na^+. Then methyl chloride would add methyl group: cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3. Wait, but that's a propargyl group. Hmm, but ethynyl is CH2-C≡CH, so deprotonating gives CH2-C≡C^- Na^+. Alkylation with CH3Cl would give CH2-C≡C-CH2Cl? No, wait, maybe CH3Cl would provide CH3- group. Wait, no, acetylide + CH3Cl would add CH3 to the acetylide carbon. So, the product would be CH2-C≡C-CH3. So, the molecule would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3. Then step 2 is H2/Pd, which would hydrogenate the triple bond. Triple bonds are hydrogenated with H2 and a catalyst like Pd to cis or trans double bonds? Wait, hydrogenation of triple bonds typically gives cis double bonds, but with Lindlar catalyst, you get cis, while with Na/NH3, you might get trans. Wait, but H2/Pd is for full hydrogenation to single bonds. So H2/Pd would convert the triple bond to a single bond, adding two H2 molecules. So cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3 would become cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 after hydrogenation. Wait, no. Wait, CH2-C≡C-CH3 hydrogenated becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's not correct. Because triple bond is between the two carbons. So, CH2-C≡C-CH3 becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, actually, hydrogenation of a triple bond (C≡C) with H2 and Pd would add two H2 molecules, turning it into a single bond. So, the triple bond (C≡C) becomes a single bond (C-C), with each carbon getting two H's. So, CH2-C≡C-CH3 becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that can't be right because that's a four-carbon chain. No, wait, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3, which upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's just a longer alkane, so that seems unlikely to get us closer to the target, which has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl substituent.

Then step 3 is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Maybe it's for elimination? Or perhaps it's for epoxidation, but I don't think so. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is used in the oxidation of secondary alcohols to ketones. Wait, but where would the alcohol come from? Or maybe Ba(OH)2 is used in the formation of epoxides from alkenes, but if we don't have a double bond yet, that's not helpful.

Then step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. Those are conditions for the oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids (like the Parke-Davis oxidation) or perhaps for the oxidation of aldehydes. Or maybe for hydration of alkenes. Alternatively, HgSO4 and H2SO4 in water could be for the oxidation of ketones, but that doesn't make sense here.

Hmm, this sequence doesn't seem to get us to the target. Let me check the next option.

Option B: Step 1: NaNH2, ethyl chloride. So, deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to form the acetylide, then alkylate with ethyl chloride. So, the product would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3. Then step 2: Li in liquid NH3. That's a condition for elimination, perhaps forming an alkyne? Wait, Li in NH3 is used for Birch reductions, which are for aromatic rings, but ethynylcyclohexane is an alkyne, so maybe it's for deprotonation. Alternatively, Li/NH3 can induce elimination. Wait, but after alkylating the acetylide, we have a longer alkyne. Then Li/NH3 might deprotonate it or cause elimination. Alternatively, perhaps Li in NH3 is for deprotonating to form a strong base, which could then eliminate. So, after step 1, the molecule is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3. Step 2 is Li in NH3, which is a strong base. Maybe it deprotonates the ethyl group, but that's not acidic. Alternatively, maybe it abstracts a proton from the cyclohexane ring. Hmm, not sure. Then step 3 is O3 in H2O, which is ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, but if the molecule is an alkyne, would that react with O3? Alternatively, if the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis double bond, then ozonolysis would break it. Wait, but in option B, there's no hydrogenation step. So perhaps step 2 converts the alkyne into a diene? Not sure.

Wait, maybe step 2 is Li in NH3, which is used for Birch reductions. If the starting material is an alkyne, perhaps it's for converting the alkyne into a diene. Hmm, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's for elimination to form a triple bond again. Not sure.

Alternatively, after step 1 and 2, maybe the triple bond becomes a double bond. Then, ozonolysis would cleave it. Suppose the alkyne becomes a trans-alkene in step 2, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. So, if we have a molecule with a CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3 group, after step 2, perhaps it becomes CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe step 2 converts the alkyne into a diene. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, maybe I should think about the target's functional groups again. The target has a formyl group (CHO), which is an aldehyde. So perhaps one of the steps is oxidation of a primary alcohol to an aldehyde. Or maybe oxidation of a ketone? No, aldehyde is a primary carbonyl.

Looking at the options, some include O3 (ozone) which would cleave double bonds into carbonyls. So, perhaps in the correct sequence, an alkene is formed, then ozonolysis cleaves it to form the aldehyde group.

So, maybe the steps involve adding a double bond, then ozonolysis to form the aldehyde.

Now, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Let's think about possible pathways.

First, maybe convert the alkyne into an alkene. Then, form a diol via some dihydroxylation, but that's not in any of the options. Alternatively, perform a hydrohalogenation or something else.

Wait, let's think about the target structure. It's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that has a formyl group. Also, the same substituent has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group connected to both a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group, and also connected to a formyl group on the cyclohexane.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis involves introducing a substituent that has both a formyl and a hydroxymethyl group attached to the cyclohexane ring, with the hydroxymethyl also connected to a cyclohexyl group.

So, perhaps the steps involve:

1. Adding a methyl group adjacent to the triple bond to set up for oxidation.
2. Hydrogenating the triple bond to a double bond.
3. Ozonolysis to break the double bond and form carbonyl groups.
4. Further oxidation or alkylation steps to introduce the cyclohexyl and hydroxymethyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is formed via an elimination and then oxidation.

Let me try to think about each option again.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; O3 with (CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2.

So, step 1: acetylide formation and alkylation with methyl chloride, giving cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2 and Pd over CaCO3. Hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond, turning it into a single bond. So, CH2-C≡C-CH3 becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So now, the molecule is cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Hmm, that's a longer chain. Then step 3 is ozonolysis. Wait, but if we have a single bond, ozonolysis won't do anything. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe step 2 doesn't hydrogenate the triple bond all the way. Oh, wait, Pd is a catalyst for hydrogenation, but depending on the conditions, maybe it stops at the cis-alkene. So, the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis-doubl bond. Then, ozonolysis would break the double bond into carbonyls.

So, after step 2, the triple bond becomes a double bond. So, from CH2-C≡C-CH3 to CH2-C=CH2-CH3. Wait, no, CH2-C≡C-CH3 hydrogenated with H2 and Pd would become CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is butane, but that doesn't have a double bond. Oh wait, perhaps I was wrong about the hydrogenation. Hydrogenation of a triple bond with H2 and Pd would add two H2 molecules, converting the triple bond into a single bond. So, cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3 becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then, step 3 is ozonolysis, but that requires a double bond. So, this path doesn't make sense. So maybe option C isn't the right one.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; Li/liq. NH3; O3, (CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Step 1: Deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to form acetylide. Then, alkylation with methanol. Wait, but methanol is an alcohol; would it act as an alkylating agent? Methanol is not a good electrophile for alkylation. Alternatively, maybe it's a quench after deprotonation. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, and when you deprotonate, you form a cyclohexyl acetylide. Adding methanol would quench the base and maybe lead to some reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a alkylation with MeOH, but that doesn't make sense because MeOH isn't a good methylating agent. Wait, perhaps the step is forming a methyl ether? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an alkylation with MeONa or something else, but the option says methanol. Hmm, this seems a bit confusing.

Another approach: perhaps the target molecule can be built via a Grignard or organometallic reaction, but I don't see any Grignard reagents in the options. Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of adding substituents in a way that allows for oxidation to form the aldehyde.

Wait, let me think about the target again. The molecule has a formyl group attached to the cyclohexane. So, perhaps oxidation of a primary alcohol to an aldehyde. So, one functional group in the molecule must be a primary alcohol that can be oxidized to the aldehyde.

Looking at the options, some steps involve O3 and other reagents which could form carbonyl groups.

Hmm, perhaps the correct sequence involves introducing a double bond, then ozonolysis to form a carbonyl, and then some alkylation steps.

Let me think about each step for each option.

Option B: Step 1: NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. So, the acetylide is formed, then alkylated with ethyl chloride, giving CH2-C≡C-CH2CH2Cl? No, wait, ethyl chloride is CH3CH2Cl. So, the acetylide (CH2-C≡C^- Na^+) would attack CH2CH2Cl? No, the acetylide would attack the ethyl chloride, giving CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3. Then step 2 is Li in liquid NH3, which could be a strong base. Maybe it deprotonates the molecule further or causes elimination. Alternatively, Li in NH3 is used for deprotonating to form a strong base, which could then react. Perhaps the ethyl group is deprotonated and eliminated, but I'm not sure.

Then, step 3 is O3 in H2O, which cleaves double bonds. So, perhaps in this step, a double bond is cleaved to form carbonyls. But if the molecule is CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3, after step 2, what would that become? Maybe step 2 converts the alkyne into a diene? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 2, the alkyne is converted into a trans-alkene, which upon ozonolysis would break into two carbonyl groups. For example, if we have CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with a double bond in the middle, ozonolysis would break it into two aldehydes. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a reduction. Wait, Li in NH3 could reduce triple bonds. Wait, no, Li in NH3 is more for Birch reductions, which are for aromatic compounds. But ethynylcyclohexane isn't aromatic. Hmm.

Option D's step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a milder condition and typically leads to the formation of aldehydes and ketones without further oxidation. Then step 4 is NH4OH, which is a mild reducing agent, perhaps for workup.

Wait, maybe the correct sequence involves:

1. Adding a methyl group via alkylation (step 1 in option C or D).
2. Hydrogenating the alkyne to a cis-alkene (step 2 in option C).
3. Ozonolysis to cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups (step 3 in options B, C, D).
4. Workup with a base or acid to form the aldehyde.

Let me think about the target. It has a formyl group, so perhaps one of the ozonolysis products is an aldehyde. Suppose the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene. Then, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane would become, after step 1 in option C, a longer alkyne. Hydrogenation would make a cis-alkene. So, structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between the CH2 and CH2 groups. Then ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups, each with two carbons. So, each fragment would have a carbonyl group.

But the target has only one formyl group, so maybe the other part is a cyclohexyl group. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Another approach: The target's structure includes a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, which is attached to a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So perhaps the synthesis involves adding a cyclohexyl group and a formyl group.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, then we add a methyl group (step 1), hydrogenate the triple bond to a double bond (step 2), then ozonolysis to form two carbonyl groups (step 3), and then perhaps some alkylation or oxidation steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is synthesized via a diels-alder reaction, but I don't see any dienophiles in the options.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is option B or D. Let me think about option D.

Option D steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol. So, deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to form acetylide, then quench with methanol? Not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Grignard-like reaction, but methanol isn't a typical Grignard reagent.

2. Li in liquid NH3. This could be a Birch reduction, but ethynylcyclohexane isn't aromatic. Alternatively, it could be a deprotonation to form a strong base, perhaps for elimination.

3. O3, (CH3)2S: Ozonolysis with a reductive workup, leading to aldehydes.

4. NH4OH: Perhaps a basic workup or to protonate something.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

- Step 1: Alkyne is deprotonated and then methylated, giving a longer alkyne.
- Step 2: Li in NH3 reduces the alkyne to a cis-alkene or something else.
- Step 3: Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond into carbonyls.
- Step 4: Workup with NH4OH to form the aldehyde.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option B.

Wait, another thought: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group. So, perhaps during the synthesis, a secondary alcohol is formed, which is then protected or transformed.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve forming a cyclic ether, but I don't see any such reagents in the options.

Wait, another angle: let's think about the reagents.

NaNH2 is used for deprotonating acidic hydrogens, like in alkynes, to form acetylides. Then, alkylation with an alkyl halide adds a substituent.

H2/Pd is for hydrogenation, typically of triple bonds or double bonds to single bonds.

Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination (like in the formation of epoxides from diols) or for oxidizing alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids.

O3 is for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds into carbonyls.

Li in NH3 is a strong base, used for elimination or for Birch reductions (which typically require aromatic rings).

So, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to form cyclohexylacetylide.
2. Alkylate it with methyl chloride to form a longer alkyne.
3. Hydrogenate the alkyne to a cis-alkene.
4. Ozonolyze the alkene to form carbonyl groups.

Wait, but in the options, option C's step 3 uses O3 with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup, leading to aldehydes and ketones without over-oxidizing. Then, step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which might do something else.

Alternatively, maybe the correct sequence is option B.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option's steps.

Option C: Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride → forms a methyl-substituted alkyne.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond (so a longer chain).

Step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S → but if the molecule is a single bond after step 2, ozonolysis won't do anything. So this seems unlikely.

Option B: Step 3 is O3, which would require a double bond. So perhaps step 2 forms a double bond.

Wait, step 2 in option B is Li in liquid NH3. Could that form a double bond from an alkyne?

I think Li in NH3 can be used to reduce alkynes to alkenes. So, perhaps the alkyne becomes a trans-alkene.

Wait, for example, if you have an alkyne, and you treat it with Li in NH3, it could form a trans-alkene via anti addition of hydrogen. So, step 2 would convert the alkyne into a trans-alkene.

Then, step 3 is O3 in H2O, which would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.

So, for option B:

After step 1: cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li/NH3 → converts triple bond to trans double bond: cyclohexane-CH2-C=CH-CH2CH3 (trans).

Step 3: Ozonolysis → cleaves the double bond into two carbonyls. So, the molecule would break into two parts. Each part would have a carbonyl group.

But the target is a single molecule, so perhaps this isn't the right way. Alternatively, maybe the ozonolysis is followed by a reductive workup.

Wait, in option B, step 4 is NH4OH. So, after ozonolysis, which typically fragments the molecule, and then workup with ammonium hydroxide. But the target isn't a fragment; it's the original molecule with new groups. So perhaps this isn't leading me to the right path.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the target's structure again. The target has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group and a substituent that's a cyclohexyl-hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is formed via some kind of Grignard reaction. Let me think: maybe the alkyne is converted into a ketone via ozonolysis, and then a Grignard reagent adds to it. But I don't see Grignard reagents in the options.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is alkylated, then hydrogenated to a cis-diol, which is then oxidized to a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, but the options don't show any dihydroxylation steps. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an epoxide, which is then opened to form a diol, but again, the options don't indicate that.

Wait, another thought: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group. So, perhaps that comes from a cyclopropane ring-opening or some kind of ring-expansion.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexyl group is formed via some alkylation after a ring-opening.

But I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should try to look for which option's reagents make sense for forming the necessary functional groups.

The target has an aldehyde group, so perhaps one of the steps must involve oxidation of a primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

Looking at the options, only options B and D have ozonolysis steps, which can form carbonyl groups.

Option D: Step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup, leading to aldehydes/ketones.

After ozonolysis, step 4 is NH4OH, which is a mild base. So perhaps the aldehyde is formed, and then some alkylation or protection occurs.

Wait, perhaps the steps in option D are:

1. Deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to form acetylide, then quench with methanol. Wait, but methanol isn't a good methylating agent. Hmm, maybe it's a workup, but I'm not sure.

2. Li in NH3: perhaps deprotonate to form a strong base, allowing for elimination or other reactions.

3. Ozonolysis: forms aldehyde groups.

4. NH4OH: workup, perhaps to protonate any deprotonated groups.

But I'm not certain about the sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct.

Option C's steps:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride → form cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond: cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3 with (CH3)2S: but if the molecule is a single bond, ozonolysis won't do anything.

So, this path doesn't seem to lead to the target.

Hmm. Maybe the correct option is B.

Option B steps:

1. NaNH2 and ethyl chloride → form cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li in NH3 → reduces the alkyne to a trans-alkene: CH2-C=CH2CH3 (trans).

3. Ozonolysis → cleaves the double bond into two carbonyls. So, the larger molecule would break into two parts, each with a carbonyl group.

But the target is a single molecule, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe one part is a cyclohexane ring, and the other part is the substituent.

Wait, the ozonolysis would break the molecule into two, but the target is a single molecule. So perhaps that's not the case. Therefore, perhaps option B isn't correct.

Wait, another angle: maybe the hydroxymethyl group comes from an epoxide opening. So, after forming an epoxide, it's opened with an acid to form a diol, which is then oxidized. But none of the options have epoxidation steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option D.

Option D steps:

1. NaNH2 and methanol → perhaps the acetylide is formed and then quenched with methanol, but I'm not sure what that would do.

2. Li in NH3 → maybe reduces the alkyne to a trans-alkene.

3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S → cleaves the double bond into carbonyls.

4. NH4OH → workup to form aldehydes.

But again, I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, perhaps after ozonolysis in option B, one of the fragments is the cyclohexane with the formyl group, and the other is the hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl group. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct answer is option C.

Wait, another thought: the target has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane ring. So, perhaps the synthesis involves introducing a ketone via oxidation and then a reduction to form the alcohol, followed by some protection.

But I'm not seeing the clear steps.

Given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to make an educated guess.

Looking back, the target has a formyl group which is an aldehyde. Ozonolysis can form aldehydes from alkenes. So, perhaps the correct sequence involves introducing a double bond, then ozonolysis.

In option B, after step 2, the alkyne is converted into a trans-alkene. Then, ozonolysis in step 3 would break it into two carbonyls.

But the target is a single molecule, so perhaps the starting material is part of a larger molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexane ring itself is part of the alkyne. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Option D: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. Methanol would react with the acetylide. Hmm, perhaps it's a quench. Then, step 2 is Li in NH3, which could be a Birch reduction, but that would require an aromatic ring. However, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which isn't aromatic.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a reduction of the alkyne to a cis-alkene. Then, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. Then, perhaps the workup forms the aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

After much thinking, I'm going to go with option B as the correct answer. Because after alkylation, Li/NH3 could reduce the alkyne to an alkene, then ozonolysis would form the aldehyde.


The question involves determining the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) and a hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl substituent. The analysis of each option is as follows:

### Option A:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the ethynyl group to form an acetylide, which is then alkylated with methyl chloride, resulting in a longer alkyne.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, forming a saturated chain.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or oxidation, but its role here is unclear.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Conditions for oxidation or hydration, but the sequence does not clearly lead to the target molecule.

This sequence does not effectively introduce the formyl group or the hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl substituent.

### Option B:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Deprotonates the ethynyl group to form an acetylide, which is then alkylated with ethyl chloride, resulting in a longer alkyne.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base that likely reduces the alkyne to a trans-alkene.
3. **O₃/ H₂O**: Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond, forming carbonyl groups.
4. **NH₄OH**: A mild reducing agent for workup.

This sequence is plausible because ozonolysis can form the aldehyde group, and the other steps could lead to the desired substituents.

---

### Option C:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the ethynyl group to form an acetylide, which is then alkylated with methyl chloride.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, forming a saturated chain.
3. **O₃/ (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis with a reductive workup, but the molecule is saturated after step 2, so ozonolysis cannot proceed.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, but its role here is unclear.

This sequence fails because ozonolysis requires a double bond, which is absent after step 2.

---

### Option D:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the ethynyl group, but methanol is not a strong alkylating agent, making this step unclear.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly for reduction or elimination.
3. **O₃/ (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis with a reductive workup, forming aldehydes or ketones.
4. **NH₄OH**: A mild reducing agent for workup.

While ozonolysis could form the aldehyde group, the unclear role of methanol in step 1 makes this sequence less likely.

---

### Conclusion:
Option B provides the most plausible sequence. The alkyne is reduced to a trans-alkene, which is then cleaved by ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups, aligning with the formation of the aldehyde group in the target molecule. The other steps could also contribute to forming the hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl substituent.
