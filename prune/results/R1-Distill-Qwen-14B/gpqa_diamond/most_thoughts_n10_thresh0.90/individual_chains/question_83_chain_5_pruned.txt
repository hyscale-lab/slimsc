Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration calculations. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The problem says that we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we're diluting it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

Alright, first, I should probably figure out what happens when we dilute the acetic acid. Dilution affects the concentration, right? So the initial step is to calculate the new concentration after mixing with water.

So, initially, we have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. The number of moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be Molarity multiplied by Volume in liters. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then, when we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So the new concentration after dilution is moles divided by new volume: 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Wait, that makes sense—diluting it by half would halve the concentration. So 0.05 to 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with NaOH. The reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So the NaOH will neutralize the acetic acid.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let's find out how much NaOH is needed for that. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001, so we need 0.001 moles of NaOH. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So at equivalence, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Wait, but the question isn't about the equivalence point directly; it's about the pH at 25% titration and equivalence. So for each of these points, I need to calculate the pH.

Let's tackle the 25% titration point first. That means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. Since the equivalence point is at 10 cm³, 25% would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. But wait, wait, is the 25% based on equivalence volume? Because when you titrate, the equivalence volume is the point where all the acid is neutralized. So 25% titration would be adding 25% of the equivalence volume, which is 2.5 cm³. 

So, when 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added, how many moles of NaOH is that? Moles = M * V (in L) = 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 moles. Since the reaction is 1:1, this neutralizes 0.00025 moles of acetic acid, producing 0.00025 moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-).

The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution were 0.001. After neutralization, moles of acetic acid left = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And moles of acetate ion formed = 0.00025.

But wait, the total volume now is the initial diluted solution (40 cm³) plus the NaOH added (2.5 cm³). So total volume is 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So concentrations are: [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M, and [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

This situation is a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let's calculate that. Let me think: 1.85e-5 is approximately 1.85 x 10^-5. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa is 4.733 (since 5 - 0.267 is 4.733). Rounded to maybe 4.73 or 4.74.

So pH = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let's compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is approximately -0.477. So pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253. So around 4.25.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Let me compute the exact ratio:

0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 1/3, which is 0.333...

So log(1/3) is log(0.333) ≈ -0.477. So pH = 4.73 + (-0.477) = 4.253.

So the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.25.

Now, for the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH), so the solution will be basic.

The concentration of acetate ions at equivalence point: Let's see. The moles of acetate are 0.001 moles. The total volume is initial 40 cm³ plus equivalence volume (10 cm³) = 50 cm³ (0.05 L). So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Acetate ions (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration of OH- can be found using the approximation for a weak base. The formula is [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C), where C is the concentration of the base (acetate here). So sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. Thus, pH = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

Wait, that's about 9.02. But wait, let me recalculate Kb more accurately.

Ka = 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.54054 * 1e-9 ≈ 5.4054e-10. So yes.

Concentration is 0.02 M.

So Kb = 5.4054e-10. Let's compute:

The hydrolysis reaction: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-], then Kb ≈ x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02, since x will be very small compared to 0.02.

So x² = Kb * 0.02 = 5.4054e-10 * 0.02 = 1.08108e-11.

x = sqrt(1.08108e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5. pOH is -log(1.04e-5). Let's compute that:

log(1.04) is about 0.017, so log(1.04e-5) is -4.983. So pOH is 4.983. pH is 14 - 4.983 = 9.017. So approximately 9.02.

But wait, looking at the options, I don't see any option with pH around 9.02 for equivalence. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17; 6.73  

C) 4.73; 7.00

D) 4.57; 6.92  

Hmm. None of the options have a pH near 9.02. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the equivalence point. Another approach: perhaps I should consider the dilution correctly. Let me think again.

Wait, at equivalence point, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. The moles are 0.001 moles. The total volume is 40 cm³ (diluted acetic acid) plus 10 cm³ (NaOH) = 50 cm³ (0.05 L). So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider activity coefficients or something, but that's probably beyond what's expected here. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me double-check.

Ka = 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.4054e-10.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should calculate the pH using the formula for a weak base. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: the concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. The Kb is 5.4054e-10.

So, Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02.

x² = 5.4054e-10 * 0.02 = 1.08108e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) = 1.04e-5 → [OH-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

Hmm, none of the options have 9.02. The closest is option D, which has equivalence pH 6.92. That's way lower. Option A has 8.52. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I did something wrong earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, when we add NaOH to the acetic acid, the equivalence point is when all the acid has been neutralized. But wait, the initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid. The NaOH is 0.1 M.

Wait, no—the initial moles were 0.001, right. So when all is neutralized, you have 0.001 moles of acetate. But perhaps I missed something in the dilution. Let me recheck the initial steps.

Wait, initial volume acetic acid: 20 cm³, 0.05 M → moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles.

Diluted with 20 cm³ H2O → total 40 cm³.

Concentration after dilution is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

Then, when titrated, each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid. So for equivalence, you need 0.001 moles of NaOH. NaOH is 0.1 M → volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L → 10 cm³. So that's correct.

So at equivalence, the solution is 0.02 M acetate, in 0.05 L. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the 25% titration as 25% of the volume added, not 25% of the moles. Wait, no. Titration is typically based on moles. So 25% of the equivalence volume would correspond to 25% of the moles. Because equivalence volume is 10 cm³, 25% is 2.5 cm³, which gives 0.25 moles of NaOH (0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles), which as I did before.

Wait, but perhaps I misapplied the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Let me recheck that.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

At 25% titration, [A^-] is 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M. [HA] is 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

So the ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333, as before. So log(1/3) is -0.477. So pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253.

So I think that's correct.

But none of the options have equivalence point pH around 9.02. Wait, looking at the options again:

Option A: 4.26; 8.52 → 25% is 4.26, equivalence 8.52.

Option D: 4.57; 6.92.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation for the equivalence point. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the solution is a buffer at equivalence? No, equivalence is when all the acid is neutralized to its conjugate base, so it's a solution of the conjugate base, not a buffer.

Wait another thought: perhaps I should calculate the pH using the hydrolysis of acetate ions. Let me write the equation again.

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb is Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

So, using the approximation for weak bases:

[OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98 → pH ≈ 9.02.

But none of the options have 9.02. Hmm. All the options have pH at equivalence between 6.73 and 8.52.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the initial moles? Let me recheck.

20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid: moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. That's correct.

Then diluted with 20 cm³ H2O, making 40 cm³.

So in the diluted solution, 0.001 mol in 0.04 L → 0.025 M. Correct.

Then, at equivalence, all 0.001 mol is neutralized, which requires 0.001 mol of NaOH. NaOH is 0.1 M → volume is 0.01 L (10 cm³). Correct.

So the acetate concentration is 0.001 / (0.05 L) = 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the dilution is not 40 cm³, but wait, 20 cm³ +20 cm³ is 40 cm³, correct.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the Kb calculation.

Wait, let me compute Kb again.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5
