Okay, I have this question about a rhombohedral crystal and finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances in crystals are important for things like X-ray diffraction. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

So the question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between adjacent atoms in the lattice, right? In a cubic system, that would be the edge length 'a'. But this is a rhombohedral crystal, which means all edges are equal but the angles aren't necessarily 90 degrees. Oh right, in this case, all angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. So it's a special case of a rhombohedral structure, maybe even a primitive one.

The interplanar distance formula for a crystal is given by the Bragg's law approach, but I think the formula for interplanar spacing d_hkl is d = a/(sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cosα + kl cosβ + lh cosγ) )) ). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Or was it another formula?

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + 2(hk cosγ + kl cosα + lh cosβ)/(a²)

Wait no, maybe I got that wrong. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. For a rhombohedral system, the unit cell is a cube with all edges equal but angles not 90 degrees. So the metric tensor is involved here. The general formula for interplanar distance is derived from the structure factor, which involves the reciprocal lattice vectors.

Alternatively, I recall the formula for d_hkl in terms of the unit cell parameters. For any crystal system, the formula is:

d_hkl = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) * (1/a²) + ... ) but no, that's not it. Wait, no, the formula is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + 2(hk cos θ + kl cos φ + lh cos ψ)/a², 

where θ, φ, ψ are the angles between the lattice vectors. But wait, in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are the same, right? Because α, β, γ are all 30 degrees here.

Wait, so for a rhombohedral system, the three vectors a, b, c all have the same length 'a' (since it's rhombohedral), and the angles between them are all equal to α. So α = β = γ = 30 degrees.

So the interplanar distance formula simplifies a bit. Let me write the formula again. The general formula for d_hkl in any system is:

d^2 = (a^2 b^2 c^2) / [ (b c sin α)^2 (h^2 + (k^2 + l^2) cos^2 α) + ... ] Hmm, no, maybe that's getting too complicated.

Wait, maybe it's better to use the formula that relates d to the Miller indices and the lattice parameters. For a cubic system, it's straightforward, but rhombohedral is more complex.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) in a rhombohedral system can be calculated using the formula:

d = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos α + kl cos β + lh cos γ) )

But since α = β = γ in this case, all 30 degrees, this simplifies to:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2kl cos α + 2lh cos α )

Wait, so for the (111) plane, h=k=l=1. So let's plug that in.

So d = a / sqrt( 1 + 1 + 1 + 2*(1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30) )

Wait, cos30 is sqrt(3)/2, approximately 0.8660.

So let's compute the denominator step by step.

First, calculate the sum h² + k² + l². That's 1+1+1=3.

Then, the cross terms: 2*(1*1 cos30 *3). Because each pair hk, kl, lh is multiplied by cos30. So 2*(3 * cos30) = 6 cos30.

So the entire denominator is sqrt(3 + 6 cos30).

Let me compute that numerically.

cos30 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

6 * 0.8660 ≈ 5.196.

So 3 +5.196 = 8.196.

Taking the square root: sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863.

Wait, 2.863 squared is about 8.196? Let me check: 2.86^2 = 8.1796, close enough.

So d = a / 2.863.

Wait, but wait, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, is 'a' the interatomic distance? I think so, because in a simple cubic structure, the edge length 'a' is the interatomic distance. So in this case, a=10 Angstrom.

So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈ ?

Let me compute that. 10 divided by approximately 2.863.

2.863 * 3.5 is about 10.02 (since 2.863*3=8.589, 2.863*3.5=8.589 + 1.4315=10.0205). So 3.5≈10/2.863.

Wait, wait, no, 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.492.

Wait, no, wait, what? Because 2.863 is about 2.86, so 10 / 2.86 ≈ 3.4965.

Wait, that can’t be right because looking at the options, the options are all around 9 Angstrom. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should write down the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

The correct formula for the interplanar distance d_{hkl} for a rhombohedral crystal is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h² + k² + l² + 2(hk \cos α + kl \cos β + lh \cos γ) }}

In this case, α = β = γ = 30°, so:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2kl cos α + 2lh cos α )

Which simplifies to:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2 cos α ( hk + kl + lh ) )

For the (111) plane, h=k=l=1.

So substituting:

Denominator D = sqrt( 3 + 2 cos30 * (1*1 +1*1 +1*1 ) )

= sqrt(3 + 2*(sqrt(3)/2)*3 )

Because hk + kl + lh = 1 + 1 +1=3.

So, let's compute that.

2*(sqrt(3)/2) is sqrt(3). So 2*(sqrt(3)/2)*3 = 3*sqrt(3).

So D = sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)).

Compute 3 + 3*sqrt(3): 3*(1 + sqrt(3)).

sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so 1.732 +1 =2.732. 3 * 2.732 ≈ 8.196.

So D = sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863, as before.

So d = a / 2.863.

Given a=10 Angstrom, d is 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.494 Angstrom. But that's way lower than the options given (the options are around 9 Angstrom). So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, that can't be right because the options are all around 9-10 Angstrom. So maybe the given interatomic distance isn't the lattice parameter 'a' but something else
