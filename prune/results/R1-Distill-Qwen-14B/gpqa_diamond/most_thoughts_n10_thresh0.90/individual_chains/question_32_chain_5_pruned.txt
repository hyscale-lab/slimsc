Okay, I need to find the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons, which I think means it's Li-6 because Li typically has 3 protons and 3 neutrons makes it Li-6. So the mass number A is 6, right?

First, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, I should use the relativistic energy equations. The energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared).

So v is 0.96c, which is 0.96 times the speed of light. Let me compute gamma. Plugging in the numbers, gamma equals 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). Let's calculate (0.96)^2. 0.96 times 0.96 is 0.9216. Subtract that from 1: 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 divided by 0.28, which equals approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that square root. 0.28 squared is 0.0784. Yes, correct. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.57142857.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is m*c². The mass of Li-6 is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). One atomic mass unit is about 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So 6 u is 6 * 1.6605390666e-27 kg = 9.9632344e-27 kg.

Wait, maybe I should find the molar mass. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to just use the fact that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So the rest mass energy would be 6 u * 931.5 MeV/u, which equals 5589 MeV, or 5.589 GeV.

Wait, no, wait. Because the atomic mass unit (u) is the mass of a proton or neutron approximately. For a nucleus with A nucleons, the mass is about A u. So for Li-6, which has 6 nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons), the mass is approximately 6 u. So the rest mass energy is 6 * 931.5 MeV = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV.

So the total energy (E) is gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is about 3.5714, and m*c² is 5.589 GeV. So E = 3.5714 * 5.589 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3.5714 *5 is 17.857, and 3.5714 * 0.589 is around 2.103. So adding together, 17.857 + 2.103 ≈ 19.96 GeV. Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 3.5714 multiplied by 5.589. Let's compute it step by step.

3.5714 * 5 = 17.857

3.5714 * 0.5 = 1.7857

3.5714 * 0.08 = 0.285712

3.5714 * 0.009 = 0.0321426

Summing the decimals: 0.5 + 0.08 + 0.009 = 0.589. So 1.7857 + 0.285712 = 2.071412; plus 0.0321426 gives 2.1035546.

So total is 17.857 + 2.1035546 ≈ 19.96055 GeV. So approximately 19.96 GeV.

Wait, but let me calculate it more precisely. Perhaps using a calculator approach.

3.57142857 * 5.589:

Let me write 3.57142857 as approximately 3.5714286.

5.589 can be written as 5 + 0.5 + 0.08 + 0.009.

But perhaps a better approach is to multiply 3.5714286 * 5.589.

Hmm, perhaps 3.5714286 * 5 = 17.857143.

3.5714286 * 0.589 = ?

Let me compute 3.5714286 * 0.5 = 1.7857143.

3.5714286 * 0.08 = 0.285714288.

3.5714286 * 0.009 = 0.0321428574.

Adding these together: 1.7857143 + 0.285714288 = 2.071428588; plus 0.0321428574 gives 2.103571445.

So total E = 17.857143 + 2.103571445 ≈ 19.96071445 GeV.

So approximately 19.9607 GeV.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps my gamma calculation is wrong. Let me recalculate gamma.

v = 0.96c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

v² = (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216 c².

So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.57142857. That part is correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the rest mass energy. Let me double-check the mass of Li-6.

Wait, the mass of a Li nucleus. The standard atomic weight of Li-6 is about 6.015 atomic mass units. Wait, wait, no, perhaps I should use the precise mass.

Wait, a lithium-6 atom has a mass number of 6, but the exact mass can be found in tables. Alternatively, perhaps the exact value is more precise.

Alternatively, perhaps the nucleus is a deuteron or something else. Wait, the question says Li with 3 neutrons. So Li has 3 protons (since it's Li), plus 3 neutrons, so total A=6, so it's Li-6. The mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015 u.

Wait, I think the exact value for the mass of Li-6 is about 6.015 atomic mass units. So when I calculate the rest mass energy, it's 6
