Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry concepts, but let's try to work through this.

First, I remember that C3h symmetry implies a trigonal planar structure with a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule should have a three-fold rotation axis and a mirror plane that's perpendicular to the rotation axis.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran... Hmm, that's a mouthful. I think triphenyleno suggests three phenyl groups attached. The structure has a central part with three substituents arranged symmetrically maybe. If the substituents are all the same and arranged around a central point, that might give C3 symmetry. But I'm not sure about the mirror plane here. Wait, if the molecule is flat and each substituent is identical and placed symmetrically, that could have a horizontal mirror plane too. So maybe this is a candidate.

Option B: Benzo...trifuran. So it's a benzo-fused trifuran. Trifuran has three furan rings fused, I think. Benzo would add a benzene ring fused somewhere. The numbering here is 1,3,4,6,7,9. Wait, the symmetry in this case—if the substituents are arranged in a way that each is 120 degrees apart, that might give C3. But I'm not sure about the mirror plane. Alternatively, maybe this molecule has a different symmetry, like C2 or D3h.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. That's BH3 with three isopropyl groups attached. Wait, no, triisopropyl borate would be (i-Pr)3BO, I think. So the boron is at the center, attached to three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl is a bulky group, but they are all the same. So the molecule's structure around B would be trigonal planar. So in that case, it would have C3 symmetry. But does it have a mirror plane? Well, since all three are the same, any plane that goes through B and a substituent would be a mirror plane, but that's vertical. Wait, but C3h symmetry requires a horizontal mirror plane, right? So maybe that's not it. Or wait, is the molecule planar? Because if it's planar, maybe a horizontal mirror plane would pass through the boron and the substituents. Hmm, maybe. I'm a bit confused about that.

Option D: Quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, a norbornane derivative. Its structure has a bridge, making it a seven-membered ring with a bridge. I think quinuclidine has a C2 axis of symmetry, not C3. So probably not this one.

So let's think again. The question is about C3h symmetry. So the molecule should have a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Triphenyleno...trifuran (A) has three substituents (phenyl groups) in a symmetric arrangement. If the molecule is flat, each substituent is 120 degrees apart. So that would allow a three-fold rotation symmetry. Now, for the mirror plane: in a planar molecule, a horizontal mirror plane would be perpendicular to the rotation axis. So if the molecule is planar, then yes, it would have that. But wait, are all the substituents in the same plane? If the structure is flat, like a trigonal planar arrangement, then yes. So option A's molecule might have C3h.

Option C's triisopropyl borate—if it's planar, then the three substituents are all around B in a trigonal planar arrangement. So rotation by 120 degrees would map onto itself. Now, the mirror plane—since all substituents are the same, any plane passing through B
