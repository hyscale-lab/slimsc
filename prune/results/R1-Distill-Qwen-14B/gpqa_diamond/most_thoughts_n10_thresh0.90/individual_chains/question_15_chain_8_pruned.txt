Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of a planet transiting depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance.

Wait, the question is about two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, which is detected via the radial velocity method. But they're looking to observe the one with the higher probability of transiting because they have limited time. So the higher probability means they're more likely to catch a transit, right?

The given info: Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3. Since orbital period is related to the distance from the star, shorter period implies closer orbit. Because Kepler's third law says P² is proportional to (a³)/(M) where M is the star's mass. Oh, but in this case, the host stars have different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. So maybe the actual distance of each planet's orbit is different.

Wait, the transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the distance of the orbit. The probability (I think) is roughly (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by some factor involving the orbital distance, but wait, no. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy. Let me think. The transit probability is proportional to (R_p / a)², where a is the semi-major axis. Because the planet has to be aligned in our line of sight, which depends on the orbital distance. Or perhaps it's (R_star + R_planet) over something else? Maybe I should think about the formula.

The transit probability (P) is given by P ≈ (R_p / R_s)² * ( (a / R_s) ) ... Wait, no, I'm mixing things up. I think the transit probability is actually (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a * sin i)), but wait, no, because sin i is involved in the RV method, not the transit. Alternatively, another approach: the probability that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is aligned such that it transits is approximately (R* / a), where R* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait, I think the probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's roughly R_star / a. No, wait, that's not right. Let me get this straight.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability (the chance that we observe a transit) for a given planet is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a * (something))). Wait, perhaps another angle. The transit probability is proportional to (R_p / a)^2. Wait, no, I think it's more about the geometry. The planet has to be along our line of sight, so the probability is the ratio of the area of the star (π R_s²) to the area of the sphere that the planet's orbital plane would subtend on the sky (which is 4π a², but maybe it's the area in the plane). So the probability is (R_s / a)^2 multiplied by (R_p / R_s)^2, because the planet needs to block a part of the star. Oh wait, maybe the transit probability P is roughly (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / (a / R_s))²?), but I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think the actual formula for the transit probability is: P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a / (R_s * sqrt(3))) )). Hmm, not sure. Maybe I should look up how transit probability is calculated. But since this is a thought process, I'll proceed with what I remember.

Alternatively, I think the transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a ), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, the probability is proportional to (R_p / a)^2. Wait, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, let's think in terms of geometry. The transit happens when the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. So the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s) ), but that's just a guess. Alternatively, another approach: the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a), because the area of the star is π R_s², and the area the planet's orbital plane covers is something else. Alternatively, the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s)), so that P = (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (R_s / a) ) =
