Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I need to think about what I remember from my studies. Oh right, this probably has to do with the Boltzmann equation and the excitation of energy levels.

Wait, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So the excitation level is higher in star_1. I remember that the Boltzmann distribution describes the population of particles in different energy states. The formula is something like n_i = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, that's equal to k_B times a certain term, because k_B is about 1.38e-23 J/K. So if ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, then T would be 1 K if k equals delta E divided by T. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Wait, the problem says the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So the ratio of the number of excited atoms (n1) to unexcited (n2) in star_1 is 2:1, whereas in star_2 it's perhaps a different ratio. Wait, no, actually, the question says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So the ratio n1/n2 (excited to ground?) is 2 in star_1, and maybe x in star_2. Or wait, no, perhaps for each star, the excitation level is compared. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the ratio of their excitation relative to each other. So for a given energy level, the fraction f is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So for each star, f1 = (something) and f2 = (something else), and f1 is twice f2. Or wait, perhaps f1/f2 = 2. Let me clarify.

Wait, the problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So maybe the ratio of the number of excited atoms to unexcited atoms is higher in star_1. So for each star, the ratio (n_i / n_j) = (g_i/g_j) exp( -(E_i-E_j)/(k T) ). Assuming that the statistical weights are the same for both stars (since it's the same element, same energy levels), then the ratio would be proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ).

Wait, perhaps it's the other way around. The excitation level being higher implies a higher temperature because higher temperature means more atoms are excited. So star_1 has a higher temperature than star_2.

Wait, the ratio for star_1 is n1,n_excited / n1,ground = (something), and for star_2 it's n2,n_excited / n2,ground = something else. And the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Or perhaps the excitation is twice as much, so n1/n2 = 2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the ratio of the populations in two different stars.

Wait, the problem says that the energy difference is the same for both stars. So ΔE = 1.38e-23 J is the same for both. But the excitation is twice as high in star_1. So, perhaps the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to those in the lower state is 2 for star_1. So, for star_1, n1_upper / n1_lower = 2. For star_2, the ratio is lower, so n2_upper / n2_lower = something else.

But wait, in LTE, the ratio is governed by the Boltzmann factor. So for star_1: (n1_upper / n1_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star_2: (n2_upper / n2_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

But the problem states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited, meaning n1_upper / (n1_upper + n1_lower) is higher than in star_2. Wait, maybe another approach. The excitation being twice as much could mean that (n_upper / n_lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of excitation in star_1 compared to star_2 is 2:1. So (n1_upper / n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower). Let me write that down.

So:

(n1_upper / n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower).

But since both are governed by the Boltzmann factor, we have:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Wait, because (n_upper/n_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So for star_1, it's exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for star_2, it's exp(-ΔE/(k T2)). So according to the problem, the star_1's ratio is twice that of star_2's ratio. So:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Wait, but that would give us a relation between T1 and T2. Let me take the natural log of both sides.

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2)).

Rearranging, I get:

ΔE/(k T1) = ΔE/(k T2) - ln(2).

Dividing both sides by ΔE/(k), we get:

1/T1 = 1/T2 - (ln(2) *k )/ΔE.

Wait, but wait, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me compute (ln(2)*k)/ΔE.

Wait, k is Boltzmann's constant, which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So ln(2) is about 0.693.

So (ln(2) * k ) / ΔE = (0.693 * 1.38e-23 J/K ) / (1.38e-23 J) ) = 0.693 * (1/(K)) ) * ( J cancels )? Wait, no, because ΔE is in J, which is J = K·J/(something). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, let me compute (ln(2) * k ) / ΔE. Since k is 1.38e-23 J/K, and ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, then:

(ln(2) * 1.38e-23 J/K ) / (1.38e-23 J) ) = ln(2) / K.

Wait, but J cancels. So it's ln(2) K^{-1}.

So the equation becomes:

1/T1 = 1/T2 - ln(2) / (1.38e-23 J/(1.38e-23 J)) ? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me re-express this.

Wait, let's go back to the equation:

ΔE/(k T1) = ΔE/(k T2) - ln(2).

Wait, that can't be right because when I subtract, the units might not match. Wait no, perhaps I should subtract the exponents properly.

Wait, starting from:

exp(A) = 2 exp(B), where A = -ΔE/(k T1), B = -ΔE/(k T2).

Then, taking ln of both sides:

A = ln(2) + B.

So,

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2).

Rearranging,

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2).

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln(2).

But ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K, so ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So,

1 K [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2).

Which simplifies to:

(1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2) / 1 K.

Wait, no, wait, 1 K multiplied by (1/T2 - 1/T1) equals ln(2), so:

(1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2) / 1 K.

Wait, but 1 K is just a unit, so perhaps it's:

(1/T2) - (1/T1) = ln(2).

Wait, but wait, if ΔE/(k) is 1 K, then 1 K times [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ] equals ln(2). So,

[ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2) / (1 K) * 1 K ) ? Hmm, I might be getting confused. Let me re-express the above step.

Wait, from ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2).

Since ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = K^{-1} * K → (J)/(J/K) ) = (J * K)/J = K. So, ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So,

1 K * [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2).

So,

(1/T2) - (1/T1) = ln(2) / 1 K.

Wait, but that would be in K^{-1}. Let me calculate:

Wait, 1 K * (something in K^{-1}) ) = dimensionless, which ln(2) is. So,

[ (1/T2) -
