Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me take it step by step. 

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of nitriles, but wait, no, wait—maybe that's another reaction. Alternatively, I think red phosphorus and HI are used to cleave alkyne groups, like in the Cleve elimination or something like that. Oh wait, right, with terminal alkynes. The reaction is called the hydroiodic acid cleavage. So when a terminal alkyne reacts with HI in the presence of red phosphorus, it gets cleaved into two carboxylic acid groups. Or wait, maybe that's with H2SO4 and heat. Hmm, perhaps I should think again. Oh wait, another possibility: when a nitrile group is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it gets converted into a carboxylic acid. Because I remember that this is a way to hydrolyze nitriles without using water, which would lead to amines. Wait, no, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids with H3O+ or using other reagents. 

Wait, maybe it's more about the structure of Compound X. Let me first try to determine what Compound X is based on the IR and NMR data provided. Once I know the structure, I can think about what reaction it undergoes with red phosphorus and HI.

Looking at the IR data: 3400–2500 cm-1 suggests an O-H stretch, but wait, that's a broad region. Wait, but 3400–2500 cm-1 is more like an N-H stretch, because O-H is usually around 3200-3600 cm-1, but that's broad. Alternatively, maybe it's an alkyne C-H stretch. Wait, the region 3400-2500 is for things like alcohols, amines, maybe alkenes. But wait, for alkyne C-H, it's usually around 3300–2500. Oh right, sp-hybridized C-H stretches. So if that's the case, then Compound X has a terminal alkyne. 

Other IR peaks: 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be an ester, ketone, aldehyde, acid, or maybe an acyl chloride. But the presence of another peak at 1610 cm-1 suggests possible conjugated double bonds. Benzos maybe? Because aromatic rings have C=C stretches around 1600 cm-1. The 1450 cm-1 peak is another stretch, perhaps in-plane bending in an aromatic ring or something else.

Now the NMR data. Let's look at the 1H NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm. That's a strong indication of a carboxylic acid proton. Because the carboxylic H is usually around 10-12 ppm. The broadness suggests it's exchanging, which is typical for -OH protons, but in this case, it's a carboxylic acid because of the chemical shift.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility is an aldehyde proton, but those are usually around 9-10 ppm, and split due to coupling. But 10.5 is more towards the carboxylic acid. Also, the NMR shows that as a singlet, so maybe it's not an aldehyde. Also, in some cases, a phenolic OH is around 10 ppm, but that's usually broad. But if the IR has a carbonyl, then maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

But wait, let me think again. If the compound has a carbonyl, like an ester or a ketone, but the NMR doesn't have a peak around 2 ppm that would correspond to an ester's CH3. Alternatively, let's look at other NMR signals.

The next peak is at 8.0 ppm, a doublet integrating 2H. That's likely the aromatic protons in a para-substituted ring. Because in para substitution, each proton is next to another para, so they are equivalent and split as doublets. For example, in a para-substituted benzene, the protons are a doublet each. Wait, but in a monosubstituted benzene, the aromatic protons are typically split into a specific pattern. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted ring. Let me think: in a para-substituted benzene, the two protons that are meta to substituents would be a doublet each. Wait, perhaps it's a di-substituted ring with substituents in the para positions. For example, if the ring has two substituents, each in the para positions relative to each other, then each set of aromatic protons would be a doublet. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted benzene where each substituent is in the para position relative to the main group.

Wait, perhaps it's a benzene ring with two substituents: one at the para position and another elsewhere. Or the substituents could be in the meta or para positions.

Looking further down the NMR, at 7.2 ppm, another doublet of 2H. That seems to match with a para-disubstituted benzene, where the substituents are in positions that cause the aromatic protons to split into doublets. For example, in 4-ethylphenyl group, the adjacent protons would be in a certain pattern.

Then, at 2.9 ppm, a multiplet (m) integrating 1H. That could be a methylene group adjacent to a branch, maybe a CH connected to another group. The 1.7 ppm multiplet (m, 2H) suggests another CH2 group, perhaps in a chain. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to something, like an oxygen or another CH. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl group, so perhaps a CH2CH2CH3 or similar.

Putting this together: let's try to sketch the structure.

The NMR suggests a benzene ring with two substituents. The 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm doublets each correspond to 2H, which could be a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Alternatively, perhaps a single substituent causing two sets of doublets. Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the integration is 1H for the 10.5 ppm, which must be the acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid. So the structure has a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carboxylic acid group. Wait, that would make sense. So perhaps the benzene ring has a substituent with a COOH group attached. But wait, looking back at the IR: the 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong carbonyl, which could be a carboxylic acid. Because in a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700 cm-1. The 1610 cm-1 could be the aromatic C=C stretching. 

So putting that together, Compound X might be a benzoic acid derivative. Let's think: if there's a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carboxylic acid group. The NMR shows a singlet at 10.5 ppm for that acidic proton.

Wait, but then the IR also has a peak at 3400–2500 cm-1, which could be the alkyne C-H stretch, but wait, if the compound is a benzoic acid, where's the alkyne?

Alternatively, perhaps the 1720 cm-1 is an ester, not a carboxylic acid. Because esters have carbonyls around 1720-1740 cm-1. Carboxylic acids are a bit lower, around 1700. So if it's an ester, then the 3400–2500 cm-1 would be the alkyne C-H stretch. Hmm.

Wait, but wait, in the NMR, if the 10.5 ppm is a carboxylic acid, then the IR should show a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3000 cm-1, which is present. The IR has 3400–2500, which is a broad peak, perhaps indicating O-H. Or it could be an alkyne.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the structure. The NMR has a triple of signals in the aromatic region. Wait, no, 8.0 and 7.2 each have doublets of 2H each. So for a benzene ring, each doublet could represent two protons. So if the substituent is in the para position, the ring has two substituents, each causing the protons ortho and meta to them to split as doublets. Alternatively, a single substituent that's a meta director would cause the ring protons to split into multiple peaks.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the compound is a benzene ring with a side chain that includes a carboxylic acid group, an alkyne, and some branching.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring attached to a propargyl group which is also attached to a carboxylic acid. But I'm not sure. Let's try to reconstruct the structure.

The NMR shows:

- 10.5 ppm (1H, bs): likely -COOH.
- 8.0 ppm (2H, d): aromatic.
- 7.2 ppm (2H, d): aromatic.
- 2.9 ppm (1H, m): maybe a CH next to a branching point.
- 1.7 ppm (2H, m): maybe a CH2 group.
- 1.4 ppm (3H, d): a CH3 attached to something, maybe an oxygen or another CH.
- 0.9 ppm (3H, t): a terminal CH3, perhaps in an ethyl group.

So, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a propyl group, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ethyl group attached to a branching point.

Wait, let's think about the entire structure. The presence of a carboxylic acid, a benzene ring, and a substituent that has a CH, CH2, and then a branching with a CH3 and a terminal CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is something like -CH2-C(CH2CH3)2? No, that might not fit the NMR. Alternatively, maybe it's a butyl group with a branch. Let me try to imagine.

Suppose the benzene ring has a substituent that is a propyl chain. But let me think of the substituent as being a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH group. That would give a structure where the benzoic acid is attached to a branching.

Wait, but looking at the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH that's next to a branching point. Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 connected to that CH. Then the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be a CH3 attached to the branching point. Finally, the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) would be the terminal methyl in an ethyl group.

So maybe the substituent is like this: 

The benzene ring is attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to a CH that has another CH2CH2CH3 group (but that's not matching the data). Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branching.

Wait, another approach. The NMR at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a methylene adjacent to a branching. For example, a CH that's connected to two CH2 groups. Alternatively, perhaps it's a secondary alcohol, but that doesn't fit with the IR. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a propargyl group (an alkyne) attached to a CH2 group, which then leads to a CH(CH3)2 group. But that might not fit the NMR.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl group but with a branch. Let's see: maybe it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH group. Wait, but then the NMR would have to reflect that.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) could be a methyl group attached to a CH, as in a CH(CH3) group. Then the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) would be that CH. Then the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the CH2 adjacent to it. And the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) would be the terminal CH3 of an ethyl group.

Putting that together, the substituent on the benzene would be a chain like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something. But what's the something? Oh, wait, the 10.5 ppm is a carboxylic acid, so perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)2-COOH. Wait, but that doesn't fit with the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl chain with a branch and a carboxylic acid. Let me try to imagine:

Benzoic acid with a substituent. For example, 4-(propyl)benzoic acid. But I'm not getting the exact structure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a prop-1-ynyl group (CH2CH2C≡CH), but that's an alkyne. Wait, but the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which I think cleaves terminal alkynes into carboxylic acids. So if the substituent is a propargyl group attached to the benzene, then upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, the alkyne would be cleaved.

Wait, let's think about the reaction. If the substituent is a propargyl group (like CH2CH2C≡CH), then when reacted with red phosphorus and HI, the alkyne would be cleaved, leading to the formation of a carboxylic acid. So for example, HC≡C-CH2-CH2-benzene would become HOOC-CH2-CH2-benzene after cleavage? Or wait, no, the reaction cleaves the terminal alkyne into two carboxylic acids. Wait no, when a terminal alkyne RX-C≡CH is treated with HI, it gets converted into RCOOH and CH3COOH.

So, if the substituent is a propargyl group, say CH2CH2C≡CH attached to benzene, then the reaction would cleave it to form HOOC-CH2-CH2-benzene, right? Or perhaps the cleavage is of the alkyne into two carboxylic acids. Let me recall: for a terminal alkyne like R-C≡CH, reaction with HI and red phosphorus would convert it into RCOOH and CH3COOH. So the alkyne is split into two carboxylic acids.

Wait, but in this case, the substituent is R-CH2-CH2-C≡CH. Then upon cleavage, the R would be attached to a COOH group. So the product would be R-COOH. Wait, but in the options, the products are either benzoic acids or other compounds.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would be a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group in the 4 position. So the substituent would be a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring, which is also attached to a COOH group. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the reaction is Compound X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. So if X is a benzene ring with a propargyl group attached
