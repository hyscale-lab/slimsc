Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare Symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. And the choices are combinations of these.

First, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the symmetries of the Standard Model (SM). So, any operator in SMEFT must preserve the symmetries that the SM respects.

I think the SM has the Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Wait, but Lorentz is part of Poincare, right? Because Poincare includes both Lorentz transformations and translations in spacetime. So, if operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare, then they automatically respect Lorentz as well.

Wait, but sometimes people discuss these separately. So, if the question lists Lorentz and Poincare as separate options, I need to consider them. Let me see: Poincare symmetry is a bigger symmetry group that includes Lorentz, translations, boosts, etc. So if an operator respects Poincare, it respects Lorentz. But could an operator respect Lorentz without respecting Poincare? Well, SMEFT's operators are typically written in a way that includes all the SM symmetries, so I think they respect both.

Next, CP and CPT symmetries. I remember that the SM is CPT symmetric. Because every particle has its antiparticle, and the theory is Lorentz invariant, which requires CPT symmetry. So, all SM interactions preserve CPT symmetry. Therefore, SMEFT operators should also respect CPT.

But what about CP? The SM doesn't require CP symmetry; in fact, there are CP-violating terms (like in the CKM matrix). So, SMEFT can include operators that violate CP. Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. Are there operators in SMEFT that violate CP, or do they all have to respect it?

Wait, no. SMEFT includes all possible operators, including those that violate CP. So, some operators in SMEFT might have CP violation, so CP symmetry is not necessarily respected by all operators. Hmm, but wait, no. The operators themselves must be written in a way that respects the symmetries of the SM except for the ones that are explicitly broken. So, the operators are organized in terms of their SM quantum numbers, and the structure of the operators must respect the SM's gauge symmetry, Lorentz symmetry, etc.

Wait, but does SMEFT require the operators to be CP-even? Or can they include terms with CP violation?

I think that SMEFT allows for CP violation. So, operators can violate CP, but in the SM, the operators are written with certain CP properties. Wait, no, the SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it can include all possible higher-dimension operators, including those that violate CP. So, the SM itself doesn't require CP symmetry, so SMEFT operators don't have to respect CP either.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if some operators
