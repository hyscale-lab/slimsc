Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the setup is that there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the position, all the particles were found between x=1 and x=3. So, the probability of finding a particle outside this range must be zero. That must mean the wave function has to be zero outside x=1 to x=3, right?

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. The wave function isn't necessarily zero; the probability of finding the particle outside is zero. So the wave function squared (the probability density) should be zero beyond x=1 and x=3. Oh wait, but the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that's a complex function. Hmm.

But in quantum mechanics, the wave function can be complex, but the probability density is the square of the absolute value. So, the probability density is |ψ|^2. So, for the wave function ψ(x) = a/sqrt(1+x) -0.5i, the absolute square would be (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2. Because when you have a complex number, say (a + b i), the absolute square is a² + b².

So, |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. 

Now, given that the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3, that means that the probability outside this region must be zero. So the probability density must be zero for x <1 and x>3. Wait, but wait: looking at the expression, (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. The only way this can be zero is if both terms are zero. But (a²)/(1+x) is zero only if a is zero, but then the second term is 0.25, which is non-zero. So that's impossible. So that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. Wait, the condition is that the particles are found only between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be non-zero only in that interval. That suggests that the wave function is zero outside x=1 and x=3. But wait, our given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. How does that become zero?

Wait a minute, maybe the wave function is zero outside x=1 and x=3. So for x <1 and x>3, the wave function must be zero. So let's see: when x <1, (1+x) is less than 2, so sqrt(1+x) is real, so a/sqrt(1+x) is real. So the wave function is real minus 0.5i. The only way this is zero is if both real and imaginary parts are zero. So real part: a/sqrt(1+x) = 0, which implies a=0. But then the imaginary part is -0.5i, which is not zero. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Maybe the wave function is given as ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i in some region, but it's zero elsewhere. But the condition is that the particle is found only between x=1 and x=3, so the wave function must be zero outside that region. So, perhaps ψ(x) is zero for x <1 and x>3, and equals a/(sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i in between.

Wait, but the problem statement says each particle can move along the tube, but when measured, all were found between 1 and 3. So the wave function must be non-zero only in that interval. So outside, ψ(x) is zero. So within 1<=x<=3, ψ(x) is as given, and zero elsewhere.

But wait, the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So that's a complex function, but for ψ(x) to be zero outside, within the region, it's non-zero. So perhaps the given expression is valid only between x=1 and x=3. So let's think about normalization.

The total probability must be 1. So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx must equal 1.

So, we can compute that integral.

The wave function is ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i.

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 is ∫ [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Let's compute this integral.

First, integrate a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x).

So a² * [ln(1+x)] from 1 to 3: a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Next, integrate 0.25 dx from 1 to 3. That's 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So total integral: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a is sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by analyzing the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is given by the absolute square of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the particles are only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the wave function must be normalized in this interval. The normalization condition requires that the integral of the probability density over \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \) equals 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

### Step 1: Compute the integral
1. **First term**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx
   \]
   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating from 1 to 3:
   \[
   a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second term**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
   \]

Adding both terms:
\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \( a \)
Rearranging:
\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5
\]
\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):
\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]
\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

### Conclusion
The value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
