Okay, so I need to find the energy of the RHIC when a nucleus X is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, let's see. The nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So a lithium nucleus. Let me think about what that means in terms of mass.

Lithium typically has 3 protons, and if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus. I remember that the mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons minus the mass defect due to binding energy. But wait, maybe for this problem, I can approximate the rest mass of the nucleus as the sum of the individual nucleons' rest masses.

Wait, but more accurately, I should use the actual rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Alternatively, if I don't have the exact value, perhaps I can use the atomic mass or the molar mass to find the rest mass.

Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.015 atomic mass units (amu). I think 1 amu is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So the rest mass energy would be 6.015 * 931.5 MeV.

Let me compute that. 6 * 931.5 is 5589, and 0.015 *931.5 is about 13.9725, so total approx 5602.9725 MeV, which is about 5.603 GeV.

Wait, but wait, the rest mass of a nucleus is a bit different. Because the atomic mass includes electrons, but when considering a nucleus, we have to subtract the electrons' mass. Wait, in the case of a nucleus, the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons, so for Li-6, it has 3 protons, so 3 electrons. But in reality, the nucleus is just the protons and neutrons, so perhaps I should just consider the mass of protons and neutrons.

Alternatively, maybe I should look up the exact rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. But I'm not exactly sure of that value right now. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for relativistic energy, which is E = gamma * m c². So I need to calculate gamma for v = 0.96c.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that. v is 0.96c, so v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714. Now, the energy E is gamma * m c², where m is the rest mass of the nucleus.

But wait, the rest mass of Li-6 is what? Let me get back to that. Let me think about the exact value. I think the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.015122 u. To convert this into energy in GeV, I can multiply by 931.5 MeV/u. So 6.015
