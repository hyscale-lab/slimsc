Okay, let's see. I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to take it step by step. Alright, the problem says that we have an electron state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think are the standard spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis.

The main question is about finding the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i is different from j and zero otherwise. Also, need to find the average value of that operator.

Wait, I remember that when an operator's matrix has zeros on the diagonal and non-zero off-diagonal elements, it's like a spin component in a different direction, maybe the x or y direction. Because for spin-1/2 particles, the Pauli matrices have structures like that. Let me think: the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], right? Similarly, the Pauli Y matrix is [[0,-i],[i,0]]. But the operator here has all off-diagonal elements as hbar/2. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal is 0 and the off-diagonal is hbar/2. Hmm, wait, no. Because if i != j, then A_ij is hbar/2. So the matrix looks like:

[ [0, hbar/2],
  [hbar/2, 0] ]

Oh wait, that's exactly the same as (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X matrix is:
[[0,1],
 [1,0]]

So, scaling that by hbar/2 gives the matrix for the operator. So the operator in question is (hbar/2) σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli x-matrix.

So the eigenstates of this operator would be the eigenstates of σ_x. The eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. They are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? Because σ_x |right> = +|right>, where |right> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and similarly for the left.

Wait, so the eigenstates of A are these |right> and |left> states. So the problem is asking for the probability of measuring the system in each of these eigenstates when the state is |alpha>.

First, I need to normalize |alpha>. Because the problem says it's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So the actual state is |alpha> = C * (1+i |up> + (2-i)|down>), where C is the normalization constant.

To find C, the sum of the squares of the amplitudes should be 1. So |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2.

Wait, let's compute that. The modulus squared of (1+i) is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because |a + ib|² = a² + b².

Similarly, |2 - i|² = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So the total is 2 +5=7. So the normalization constant is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> all divided by sqrt(7).

Now, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of operator A, which are |right> and |left> as I said.

Wait, let me write out |right> and |left>:

|right> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|left> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So any state can be expressed as a linear combination of |right> and |left>. So let me write |alpha> in terms of these.

Hmm, let me represent |alpha> as a combination of |right> and |left>:

|alpha> = a |right> + b |left>

I need to find a and b.

To find a and b, substitute:

a |right> + b |left> = (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> / sqrt(7)

Expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, |right> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |left> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So substituting, we have:

a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + b (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Let me factor out 1/sqrt(2) on the left:

[ a (|up> + |down>) + b (|up> - |down>) ] / sqrt(2) = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Multiply both sides by sqrt(2):

a(|up> + |down>) + b(|up> - |down>) = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] * sqrt(2/7)

Group |up> and |down> terms:

[ a + b ] |up> + [ a - b ] |down> = [ (1+i) sqrt(2/7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i) sqrt(2/7) ] |down>

So set up the equations:

a + b = (1+i) sqrt(2/7)
a - b = (2 - i) sqrt(2/7)

We can solve for a and b by adding and subtracting these equations.

Adding:
2a = [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] sqrt(2/7)
= (3) sqrt(2/7)
So a = (3/2) sqrt(2/7)

Subtracting:
2b = [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] sqrt(2/7)
= [ (1 - 2) + (i + i) ] sqrt(2/7)
= (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2/7)
So b = [ (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2/7) ] / 2

Hmm, but I think maybe another approach is better. Let me compute a and b using coefficients.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the overlap of |alpha> with |right> and |left> to find the probabilities.

Because the probability of measuring a particular eigenstate is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude.

So the probability of |right> is | < right | alpha > |², and similarly for |left>.

Compute < right | alpha >:

< right | alpha > = ( < up | + < down | ) / sqrt(2) * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)
= [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2 -i) <down|up> ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )

But <up|up> is 1, and <down|up> is 0, so this simplifies to:

(1+i) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )

So | < right | alpha > |² = |1+i|² / (2 *7)
= (1² +1²) /14
= 2/14 = 1/7 ≈ 0.1428

Wait wait, that can't be right because the probabilities should sum to 1. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check.

Wait, maybe I should compute the inner product correctly. Wait, |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, divided by sqrt(7). And |right> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). So the inner product is:

< right | alpha > = [ ( < up | + < down | ) / sqrt(2) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) )

= ( (1+i) <up|up> + (2-i) <down|up> + (1+i) <up|down> + (2-i) <down|down> ) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )

But <down|up> and <up|down> are zero. So this reduces to:

( (1+i)*1 + (2 -i)*1 ) / (sqrt(14) )

= [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(14)
= (3) / sqrt(14)
So the absolute value squared is (3)^2 / 14 = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

Wait, that's a probability of 9/14, which is about 0.6429. So that's the probability for the |right> eigenstate.

Similarly, compute the probability for |left>, which is < left | alpha >:

< left | alpha > = ( < up | - < down | ) / sqrt(2) * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

= [ (1+i) <up|up> - (2 -i) <down|down> ] / sqrt(14)
= [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(14)
= (1+i -2 +i ) / sqrt(14)
= ( (-1) + 2i ) / sqrt(14)

The absolute value squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) /14 = (1+4)/14=5/14≈0.3571.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, and 5/14 is about 0.3571. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see. Option A is 0.64 and 0.36, which are approximations of 9/14 and 5/14. 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, so 0.64 is close. 5/14 is about 0.3571, so 0.36 is roughly that, but perhaps more accurately 0.357.

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them directly correspond. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7

So 0.64 is 9/14≈0.6428. 0.36 is 5/14≈0.3571? Wait 5/14 is approximately 0.357, not 0.36. So 0.36 is a bit higher than 5/14.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate < right | alpha >.

Wait, |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

|right> is (|up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2).

So < right | alpha > is [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

Which is (3) / sqrt(14).

So |3/sqrt(14)|² is 9/14 ≈0.6428.

Similarly, <left|alpha> is [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(14) = [ (1 -2) + (i +i) ] / sqrt(14) = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

The modulus squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) /14 = (1 +4)/14=5/14 ≈0.3571.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. So 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357.

Looking at the options, option A lists 0.64 and 0.36, which are close to these values. So the first part is 0.64 and 0.36, but let me check the other options.

Wait, other options:

Option D: 0.61, 0.29. Hmm, no, that's not right.

Option B: 0.54, 0.46. No.

Option C: 0.28, 0.72. No, that's inverted.

Wait, but wait. Maybe I messed up the operator. Because the operator is A with elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i != j, else 0. So the matrix is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

So the eigenvalues of this operator are the same as those of sigma_x multiplied by hbar/2. The eigenvalues of sigma_x are +1 and -1. So the eigenvalues of A are (hbar/2)(1) and (hbar/2)(-1), so +hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

But for probabilities, the eigenvalues don't affect the probabilities of the state in each eigenstate. The probabilities are | <eigenstate | alpha> |^2.

Wait, but the question says, "the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator". So the eigenstates are |right> and |left>, each with probabilities 9/14 and 5/14, respectively.

But looking at the options, option A lists probabilities 0.64 and 0.36. Since 9/14 is approximately 0.6428 and 5/14 is about 0.3571, which is closer to 0.36 than 0.357, perhaps the option rounds them to two decimal places. So option A would have 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but let me check the other parts of the question. The average value of the operator.

The average value is <A> = < alpha | A | alpha >.

Since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, the average value is (hbar/2) times the expectation value of sigma_x in the state alpha.

The expectation value of sigma_x in |alpha> is <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

Alternatively, I can compute this expectation value by expressing |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of sigma_x, which are |right> and |left>.

Because sigma_x |right> = +|right>, sigma_x |left> = -|left>.

So |alpha> is a combination of |right> and |left>:

|alpha> = c_right |right> + c_left |left>

So <sigma_x> = |c_right|^2 (1) + |c_left|^2 (-1) + ... Wait, no, because sigma_x is diagonal in this basis.

Wait, no, because |alpha> is a combination of the eigenstates. Let me think: the expectation value is the sum over |c_i|^2 times the eigenvalues.

Wait, no, because |alpha> is a superposition of |right> and |left>, which are eigenstates of sigma_x with eigenvalues +1 and -1.

So the expectation value <sigma_x> is |c_right|^2 * (+1) + |c_left|^2 * (-1).

Wait yes, because sigma_x |right> = |right>, so <right| sigma_x |right> = +1, and similarly <left| sigma_x |left> = -1.

So |c_right|^2 is 9/14, |c_left|^2 is 5/14.

So <sigma_x> = (9/14)(1) + (5/14)(-1) = (9 -5)/14 = 4/14 = 2/7 ≈0.2857.

Multiply by (hbar/2), so <A> = (hbar/2)(2/7) )= hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A says average is hbar/7. So that fits.

So putting together the probabilities of 9/14 ≈0.64, 5/14≈0.36, and average hbar/7. So the correct option is A.

But wait, let me double-check the expectation value calculation.

Alternatively, I can compute <A> directly using matrix representation.

The state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

The operator A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

So <A> is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by A multiplied by |alpha>.

Let me compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

So, vector form:

|alpha> = [ a, b ]^T, where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Compute a* (0 * a + (hbar/2) b) + b* ( (hbar/2) a + 0 * b )

= a* (hbar/2 b) + b* (hbar/2 a )

= (hbar/2)( a* b + b* a )

Compute a* = (1-i)/sqrt(7), b* = (2 +i)/sqrt(7).

So a* b = (1-i)(2 -i) /7

Multiply (1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 +1*(-i) -i*2 +i^2*(-i^2? Wait, wait, no: (1 -i)(2 -i) = (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i^2
= 2 -3i + (-1) [since i^2 = -1]
= 1 -3i.

Similarly, b* a = (2 +i)(1 +i)/7.

Multiply (2+i)(1+i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 +i*i = 2 + 2i +i +i² = 2+3i -1 = 1 + 3i.

So a* b = (1 -3i)/7, b* a = (1 +3i)/7.

Adding these: (1-3i +1+3i)/7 = 2/7.

Multiply by (hbar/2):

( hbar/2 ) * (2/7 ) = hbar/7.

So the average is indeed hbar/7. So option A matches.


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The state is normalized by dividing by \( \sqrt{7} \), yielding:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

The operator in question has a matrix representation \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. This corresponds to the operator \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are:

\[
|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle),
\]

with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. Thus, the eigenstates of \( A \) are \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \), with eigenvalues \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), respectively.

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of \( A \), we compute the overlap of \( |\alpha\rangle \) with \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \). The overlap is given by:

\[
\langle +|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) \langle \uparrow|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i) \langle \downarrow|\uparrow\rangle \right),
\]
\[
\langle -|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) \langle \uparrow|\uparrow\rangle - (2-i) \langle \downarrow|\uparrow\rangle \right).
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
\langle +|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( 1+i + 2-i \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}},
\]
\[
\langle -|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( 1+i - (2-i) \right) = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these overlaps:

\[
P(+\rangle) = \left| \langle +|\alpha\rangle \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14}, \quad P(-\rangle) = \left| \langle -|\alpha\rangle \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively.

Next, we compute the average value of \( A \). The expectation value of \( A \) is given by:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha| A |\alpha\rangle.
\]

Since \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) in \( |\alpha\rangle \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \alpha| \sigma_x |\alpha\rangle.
\]

Using the eigenstates \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \), we find:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = P(+\rangle)(+1) + P(-\rangle)(-1) = \frac{9}{14} - \frac{5}{14} = \frac{4}{14} = \frac{2}{7}.
\]

Thus, the average value of \( A \) is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Finally, comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Probabilities: \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), Average value: \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \).**
