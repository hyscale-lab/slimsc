Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem about density matrices. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it step by step.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ and asks about its geometrical position in the qubit space. The options are coordinate points in 3D space, I think. Let me first recall what a density matrix represents.

A density matrix is a way to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. For a pure state, the density matrix is a projector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. But here, the given ρ isn't a pure state. Let me look at it again.

The matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Oh wait, that looks familiar. I think this is a classical mixture of the states |0⟩ and |1⟩. Each has a probability of 1/2. So this is a completely mixed state for a qubit.

Now, I remember that for a qubit, any state can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere has coordinates (x, y, z), and any density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (x, y, z) with magnitude ≤1.

Let me write down the given ρ. It's (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, another way to write this is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) multiplied by 1/2. So, let's expand that in terms of Pauli matrices.

The identity matrix is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). So, ρ is (I)/2. Because (|0><0| + |1><1|) is I, the identity matrix. So ρ = (I)/2.

Wait, but the general form is (I + r·σ)/2. So if I have (I + r·σ)/2 equal to ρ, which is I/2, then r·σ must be zero. That implies that r is the zero vector (0,0,0), because the only way r·σ =0 for all σ is if r is zero.

So the vector r is (0,0,0). Therefore, the geometrical position is at the origin in the Bloch sphere, which would correspond to the completely mixed state.

Looking back at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be C.

Wait, am I sure about that? Let me double-check. The density matrix I/2 is a maximally mixed state, which is the center of the Bloch sphere. Yeah, that makes sense because the Bloch sphere has radius 1, and the center is at (0,0,0). So yes, option C is correct.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a completely mixed state for a qubit, where the system is in a classical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with a probability of \(1/2\). 

For a single qubit, any density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch sphere representation as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\) is a vector with magnitude \(|\mathbf{r}| \leq 1\). Comparing this general form to the given \(\rho\), we see that \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\), which implies that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\). The only solution to this is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), meaning the density matrix corresponds to the origin on the Bloch sphere.

This origin represents the completely mixed state, which is consistent with the given density matrix. Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\)**  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\)**  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\)**  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\)**  

The correct answer is **C**, as the density matrix corresponds to the origin on the Bloch sphere.

Answer: C
