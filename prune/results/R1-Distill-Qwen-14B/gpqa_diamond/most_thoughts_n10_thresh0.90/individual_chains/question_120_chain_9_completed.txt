Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Wait, right, the parallax in astronomy is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I think is that distance is inversely proportional to parallax. So, parallax (in parsecs) is 1 divided by distance (in parsecs), or something like that.

So the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. Let me think. If stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number density of stars is the same in all regions. But wait, how does that translate when we look at parallax?

Parallax plx is given by plx = 1/distance. So as distance increases, parallax decreases. Now, the number of stars in a certain range of parallax would depend on how many stars exist at that distance. But since the distribution is uniform, the number of stars per unit volume is constant.

Let me try to model this. Let's say the number density of stars is n (constant). Then, the number of stars in a small volume dV is n*dV. Now, I need to express dV in terms of parallax.

Wait, the volume element in spherical coordinates is dV = 4π r² dr, where r is the distance. Since parallax plx = 1/r, then r = 1/plx. So dr = -d(plx)/(plx²). Hmm, but I might need to think in terms of how the volume relates to parallax.

If I consider a small range in parallax, dplx, that corresponds to stars at a distance r = 1/plx. So the distance range dr would be dr = -dplx/(plx²). Wait, negative because as plx increases, r decreases. But since I'm considering a small change, perhaps I can ignore the sign for the magnitude.

So, the volume element for stars in a thin shell at distance r is 4π r² dr. Substituting r = 1/plx and dr = dplx/(plx²):

dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx²) ) = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars in this dV would be n * dV = n * (4π / plx^4) dplx.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So, the number per dplx is (n * 4π)/plx^4.

But wait, the question says "number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx)", so that's stars per (dplx). So the number density in plx space is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, no, wait: the number per unit plx would be (n * 4π)/plx^4, but that's per unit plx. So as plx increases, the number per unit plx drops as 1/plx^4.

Looking back at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4, option B is 1/plx^2, and so on. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me go through this again.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx. The volume between r = 1/(plx) and r = 1/(plx + dplx) would be the volume of the shell at radius r. Wait, actually, the shell volume is 4π r^2 dr, but when plx is small, because plx is 1/r, and as plx increases, r decreases. So as plx increases, the corresponding distance r is getting smaller.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the volume element for a small plx change is dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx^2) ) = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. So the number of stars is n * dV = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. So the number per unit plx (dplx) would be (n *4π)/plx^4. So yeah, the number is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number per unit plx decreases as 1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait a second. Another approach: the number of stars in a small volume dV is n dV. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a volume element is just n multiplied by the volume.

But the volume element in terms of parallax is something else. Let me think about it. The volume between plx and plx + dplx is the volume of the spherical shell between r = 1/plx and r = 1/(plx + dplx). But that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, consider using r = 1/plx, so dr = -dplx / plx².

Wait, so the shell volume is 4π r² dr. Substituting r = 1/plx and dr = -dplx/(plx²), the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx/(plx^2)) ), which is 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. So the number of stars is n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx, meaning the number per unit dplx is (n *4π)/plx^4. So that's 4πn / plx^4. So the number of stars per unit parallax is inversely proportional to plx^4.

So the correct option is A, ~1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \), where \( r \) is the distance to the star. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number density of stars (\( n \)) is constant. 

The number of stars in a small volume element \( dV \) is given by \( n \, dV \). In spherical coordinates, the volume element for a thin shell at radius \( r \) is \( dV = 4\pi r^2 \, dr \). Substituting \( r = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dr = -\frac{d(\text{plx})}{\text{plx}^2} \), we find:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{d(\text{plx})}{\text{plx}^2} = 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \, d(\text{plx}).
\]

Thus, the number of stars in this volume element is:

\[
n \, dV = n \cdot 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \, d(\text{plx}).
\]

The number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( d(\text{plx}) \)) is therefore proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). This means the number of stars per unit parallax decreases as \( \text{plx}^{-4} \).

From the given options:
- **A)** \( \sim 1/\text{plx}^4 \) matches the derived relationship.
- **B)** \( \sim 1/\text{plx}^2 \) is incorrect, as it does not account for the full dependence on \( \text{plx}^4 \).
- **C)** \( \sim 1/\text{plx}^1 \) is incorrect, as it underestimates the dependence.
- **D)** \( \sim 1/\text{plx}^3 \) is incorrect, as it overestimates the dependence.

The correct answer is **A**, as the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( 1/\text{plx}^4 \).

Answer: A
