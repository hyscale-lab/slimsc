Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again.

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their mass is negligible. Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals, in Joules. The options are A to D.

Hmm, right. So, since these are charges, this must be an electrostatics problem involving potential energy. Because the system is isolated and the charges are either fixed or constrained, I think the potential energy between them is what's being considered here.

Wait, each particle has a charge of 2e. So each has twice the elementary charge. So their charges are +2e or maybe -2e. Oh, but since it's about potential energy, the sign might matter. But wait, I'm not sure if the problem specifies the sign, so maybe I can assume they're all positive or all negative, but perhaps it doesn't matter because potential energy is about the product. Hmm, maybe I should proceed without worrying about the sign for now.

The setup: 12 charges are at 2 meters from point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the 13th is at the center, and the others are arranged on a sphere of radius 2 meters around it. But wait, the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So the 12 are on a sphere of radius 2 m around P, and the 13th is at P.

So each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 meters from P, and the 13th is at P. So what interactions are we considering here?

Well, the potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. But since the system is isolated, I think the potential energy is calculated relative to a reference point, usually when all charges are infinitely far apart.

Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed at P. So the other 12 are arranged around it. So the potential energy comes from two parts: the potential energy due to the 13th charge and each of the 12, and the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but wait: the 12 are constrained, so perhaps their mutual distances are considered. But the problem states that each is 2 m from P, but it doesn't say anything about their mutual distances. So maybe I can assume that the 12 are all at the same distance from P, but perhaps they form a regular dodecahedron or something, but for calculating the potential energy between them, maybe it's easier to use the formula for the potential energy of a group of charges placed on a sphere.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge at P. Or perhaps all possible pairs.

Wait, the problem says "the minimum energy" of the system. So I'm thinking that maybe the charges are arranged in a way that minimizes the total potential energy.

Wait, but for a system of charges, the potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So for the 13 charges, how many pairs are there?

Wait, for n charges, the number of pairs is n choose 2, which is n(n-1)/2. So for 13 charges, that's 13*12/2 = 78 pairs. But in this case, the 13th is fixed, and the other 12 are at 2 m from P. So the distance between each of the 12 and the 13th is 2 m. But the distance between any two of the 12 charges could vary, but since the problem doesn't specify their positions beyond being at 2 m from P, perhaps they are arranged in such a way that their mutual distances are as uniform as possible to minimize the potential energy. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 12 and the 13th, not their mutual interactions. But that seems unlikely, because the mutual interactions would also contribute to the potential energy.

Wait, but let's think again. The problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So their positions are all 2 m from P, but their arrangement can vary. So maybe it's a sphere with 12 charges on the surface, each at 2 m from P. But without knowing where exactly each is placed relative to each other, how can we compute the potential energy between them? Hmm, perhaps that's more complicated, and maybe the problem is only considering the energy between the 12 and the 13th charge, not their mutual interactions. Or maybe the mutual interactions are considered as a point.

Wait, but let's look at the options. The options are on the order of 1e-26 J, which suggests that it's a calculation involving coulomb's law with e, but maybe it's only considering the energy between the 12 and the single charge at P.

Wait, but let's think: each of the 12 charges is interacting with the 13th charge. So each of those 12 has a potential energy with the 13th. So the total potential energy due to the 13th and each of the 12 is the sum of each of those.

The potential energy between two point charges is given by U = k * (q1*q2) / r.

Since all 12 are identical and at the same distance from P, each contributes the same amount to the potential energy with the 13th.

So the potential energy for each pair (each of the 12 and the 13th) is U = k * (2e)*(2e) / (2 m).

Wait, no. Wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So the charge at P is 2e. Each of the 12 is 2e, at a distance of 2 m.

So for each pair (13th and each of the 12), the potential energy is U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2 m). So each contributes U_i.

But wait, wait: the 13th charge is fixed, so when you bring each of the 12 charges to their positions, you're doing work against the electric field from the 13th charge.

So the potential energy for each charge would be U = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 m). But wait, each of the 12 charges is placed at 2 m from the 13th. So each has a potential energy of (k*(2e)^2)/(2 m).

Since there are 12 such charges, the total potential energy from these interactions would be 12 * U_i = 12 * [k*(4e^2)/(2 m)].

Wait, 2e times 2e is 4 e squared, right? So that's 4e². And that's divided by 2 meters.

So 4e²/(2 m) = 2e²/m.

Wait, but m is 2 meters. So yeah, 2e²/(2) is e².

So each U_i is k * (4e²) / (2*2) ?

Wait, wait, let me compute this correctly.

Wait, the charge at P is 2e, each of the 12 is 2e, and the distance is 2 m.

So U for each pair is k*(2e)*(2e)/(2 m) = k*(4 e²)/(2 m) = k*(2 e²)/m.

Wait, m is 2 meters. So U_i = k * (4 e²) / (2 * 2) ?

Wait, no: 2e * 2e is 4 e². The denominator is 2 meters.

So U_i for each pair is (k * 4 e²) / (2 m) = 2 k e² / m.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me write it down:

U = k * (q1 * q2) / r.

q1 = 2e, q2 = 2e, r = 2 m.

So U_i = k * (2e * 2e) / 2 m = k*(4 e²)/(2 m) = (2 k e²) / m.

So for each of the 12 charges, their potential energy with the fixed charge is (2 k e²) / (2 m). Wait, no: m is 2 m, so the denominator is 2*2=4? Wait no, the denominator is 2 meters. So 4 e² divided by 2 m is (2 e²)/m.

Wait, no: 4 e² over 2 m is (4/2) e²/m = 2 e² / m.

So for each charge, U = (2 k e²) / (2 m) ?

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute it again.

k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988e9 N m²/C².

e is the elementary charge, approximately 1.602e-19 C.

Each charge is 2e, so 2 * 1.602e-19 C = 3.204e-19 C.

So for each pair:

U_i = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2 m)
= k * (4 e²) / (2 m)
= (4 k e²) / (2 m)
= (2 k e²) / m.

Wait, but m is 2 meters? No, the distance r is 2 meters. So the denominator is 2 m, because r is 2 m.

So U_i = (k * 4 e²) / (2 m) = (2 k e²) / (2 m) ?

Wait, no, r is 2 m, so it's 2 in the denominator. So U_i = (k *4 e²)/(2 m).

4/2 is 2, so U_i = (2 k e² ) / m.

Wait, no, because 4e²/(2 m) is 2 e²/m. So U_i = (k * 2 e²) / m.

Wait, no, wait:

k * (4 e²) / (2 m) = (4/2) * (k e²) / m = 2 (k e²)/m.

So U_i is 2 k e² / m.

Wait, but m is 2 meters? No, the distance is 2 m, so the denominator is 2 m.

Wait, no, the denominator is 2 meters. So the expression is:

U_i = k * (2e)*(2e) / (2 m).

Wait, but 2e times 2e is 4 e². So 4 e² divided by 2 m.

So 4/2 is 2, so 2 e² / m.

Wait, but m is 2 meters. So 2 e² / (2 m) would be (e²)/m.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me just compute it numerically.

Each charge is 2e, so q1 = q2 = 2e = 2 * 1.6e-19 C = 3.2e-19 C.
