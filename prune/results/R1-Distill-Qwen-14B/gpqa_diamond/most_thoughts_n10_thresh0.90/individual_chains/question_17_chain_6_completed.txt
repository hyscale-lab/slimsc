Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. They also gave me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant tells us how strong that complex is.

Wait, what's the formula again for the concentration of free ions in a complex solution? Oh right, the formation constant (K) is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where the metal and ligand combine to form the complex. So for Ca-EDTA, the reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

The formation constant K is given by [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So if I have the concentration of the complex, which is 0.02 M, and I can assume that the concentration of free Ca²+ and EDTA is very low because K is large. Oh wait, K is 5e10, which is a big number, so the complex is very stable. That means most of the EDTA and Ca²+ will be tied up in the complex, so the free [Ca²+] should be really small.

But wait, the question is about the concentration of calcium ions. Since the complex is 0.02 M, all the Ca²+ and EDTA is in the complex, right? So wait, no, because some might dissociate. But when K is so large, the dissociation is minimal. Let me think about the expression again.

Assuming that the concentration of the complex (CaEDTA^2-) is 0.02 M, then we can say that [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. The K expression is K = [CaEDTA^2-] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But in solution, the EDTA is in different forms. Wait, but in the problem, we're told to assume the pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is mostly in the Y^4- form, the one that can form the complex.

So, the total EDTA concentration is the sum of [Y^4-] and [CaEDTA^2-]. But wait, initially, how much EDTA is present? Because the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So the total EDTA would be 0.02 M, but most of it is in the complex form. But wait, if all the EDTA and Ca²+ is tied up in the complex, then [Ca²+] would be zero, which can't be right because the formation constant is 5e10, but not infinite. So some small amount of Ca²+ must dissociate.

Let me model this. Let's say the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate. Then, for each mole of complex that dissociates, we get one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-. So [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x.

So substituting into the K expression: K = [CaEDTA^2-]/(x^2) = 5e10.

So, 5e10 = 0.02 / (x^2). Solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-3 / 5e10 = 4e-13. Wait, wait: 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12, which is 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. So x² = 4e-13. Taking square root, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, and sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7. Hmm, that looks familiar. So x is approximately 6.3e-7 M. So the concentration of Ca²+ ions is 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that should be the correct answer. Let me double-check the steps. 

We started with [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. We assumed that the dissociation gives x of both Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So K = 0.02 / (x^2) = 5e10 → x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) = (2e-2)/(5e10) = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) → 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.3e-7. Yep, that makes sense.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The equilibrium reaction for the complex is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The formation constant is expressed as:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]\) is 0.02 M, we assume that the dissociation of the complex is minimal due to the large value of \(K\). Let \(x\) represent the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions that dissociate. Since the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, the concentration of free \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) ions will also be \(x\). Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{x^2}
\]

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
