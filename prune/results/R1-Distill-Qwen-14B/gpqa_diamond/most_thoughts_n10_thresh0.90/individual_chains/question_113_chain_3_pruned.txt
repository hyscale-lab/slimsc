Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are four different chemical formulas, and I need to determine which one is correct based on the spectral data provided.

Let me break down the information step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually correspond to O-H stretches. A broad peak suggests hydrogen bonding, so maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid? But wait, the other strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong absorption, likely a carbonyl group (C=O), maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower; that could be another carbonyl, maybe an ester or an amide, but amides have lower peaks. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds because aromatic C=C stretches are around 1600-1680 cm^-1. Hmm.

Wait, but if there are two strong absorption peaks in the IR near 1700, maybe they're both carbonyls. Could the compound have two different C=O groups? Like maybe an ester and something else? Or perhaps an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl system, which could have two peaks due to conjugation.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond. So the compound must have at least one double bond, possibly an alkene or maybe conjugated with other groups.

Looking at the Mass Spectrometry data, there's a fragment peak at m/z=45. What could that correspond to? Well, 45 is a common mass for a fragment like CH3CO (which is 43?), wait, let me think. The molecular ion might break into smaller ions. Common fragments include CH3+ (15), but 45 could be something else. Maybe a (CH2)2O group or a CH3CO group. Wait, CH3CO would be 43 (12*2 + 1*3 + 16 = 24 +3 +16=43?), but 45 is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe it's an ethyl group with an oxygen? Or perhaps a fragment from a ketone or ester.

Now let's look at the options:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

The formulas I need to consider are either with O, O2, and varying H counts.

Let me think about the IR first. The broad peak suggests an O-H group. Since it's a broad peak, it's probably an alcohol or possibly a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very strong O-H stretch around 2500-3300, but also, their carbonyl is usually around 1700. But in this case, the IR shows two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. If it were a carboxylic acid, maybe the O-H is broad, the C=O is around 1700, but what about the 1650? Unless it's an ester, which has a carbonyl around 1700-1750, or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds.

Wait, but the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggests a double bond. So maybe it's a conjugated system, like an aromatic ring with substituents. Alternatively, maybe the compound has an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl, which would have both a C=O and a C=C, leading to the IR peaks around 1700 and 1650.

If the compound has an ester group, which has a C=O around 1700, and maybe another carbonyl elsewhere, but that seems less likely. Alternatively, the 1650 could be an aromatic C=C stretch. But then, the 1700 would be the carbonyl.

So, combining the IR data: O-H (broad, so maybe -OH group), a carbonyl group, possibly an aromatic ring (since 1650 could be C=C in benzene), but wait, benzene rings usually have C=C around 1450-1600 cm^-1. So 1650 is a bit higher, maybe conjugated carbonyl. So perhaps the compound has an aromatic ring with a conjugated carbonyl group, such as a ketone or ester.

Now, looking at the formula options, let's think about the possible structures.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: For C6H12O2, the formula is C6 H12 O2. The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. Wait, (2*6 +2)=14. 14-12=2, divided by 2 is 1. So DoU is 1. Hmm. That could be a double bond or a ring.

Wait, but if the compound has a benzene ring (which is 3 DoU), that would require more. Oh wait, perhaps my formula is wrong. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, the general formula for degrees of unsaturation is DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for C6H12O2: 2*6=12, +2=14. H is 12. So 14-12=2. 2/2=1. So DoU is 1. So that could be either a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, etc.

But wait, if the compound has a benzene ring, which has 3 DoU, that would require 3 from the ring and any other DoU. So perhaps another group.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think about each option's DoU.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU calculation: 2*6=12 +2=14. 14 -10 =4. Divided by 2 is 2 DoU. So two rings, or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU: (12 +2 -10)/2 = 4/2=2 DoU. Same as option B.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU: (12+2 -12)/2= 2/2=1 DoU.

So in the IR, we have a C=O, which is one DoU. Also, if there's a ring (like benzene which is 3 DoU), but perhaps the DoU counts differently.

Wait, maybe the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Or perhaps it's something else.

Looking at the mass spec: a fragment at m/z=45. I'm trying to think what fragments would have a mass of 45. Let's think of possible groups. CH3CO is 43, but 45 would be maybe CH3COO- (but that would be 59?), or maybe something else.

Wait, 45 could be (CH2)2O, which is 45 (each CH2 is 14, plus O is 16: 14*2=28 +16=44? Hmm, no. Wait 14*2 is 28 +16 is 44. So that's 44. Not 45. Alternatively, maybe a CH3CH2O group? Wait, that's 45? CH3CH2O would be 15 (CH3) + 14 (CH2) +16 (O) = 15+14=29 +16=45. Oh, yes. So a fragment of CH3CH2O would have a mass of 45. Alternatively, maybe something else, like a CH2CH2O, but that's not possible.

Wait, another possibility: a fragment from an ester group. For example, if the compound is an ester, perhaps the ester group could break into two parts. For example, if it's a methyl ester, the fragment could be (CH3O-) which is 31, but that's not 45. Alternatively, a larger fragment. Hmm.

Alternatively, think about the molecular formula and possible structures. Let's consider each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures could be a cyclic ester (lactone), which would have a ring and a carbonyl. Alternatively, it could be a diol ester. But wait, the IR has a broad O-H, so perhaps it's a diol. But an ester would have a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's an ortho ester, but I'm not sure.

The broad O-H in IR suggests a hydroxyl group, perhaps from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But if it's an ester, the O-H would come from an alcohol and a carboxylic acid during its formation. But in the ester itself, the O-H is not present unless it's a hemiacetal or something similar.

Wait, but the IR has a broad peak, which suggests an O-H group. So the compound might have an -OH group. So perhaps it's a carboxylic acid or an alcohol.

But if it's a carboxylic acid, then the molecular formula would have at least COOH, which is COO plus H. So the formula would have two oxygen atoms in the COOH group. Let's see.

Wait, let's think about the options again. Option A is C6H12O2. Which would have formula for something like a diol or an ester. Or a carboxylic acid. For example, hexanoic acid would be C5H11COOH, which is C6H12O2. So that matches option A.

In that case, the IR would show O-H (broad) from the carboxylic acid, the carbonyl (around 1700), and maybe some other peaks. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so that suggests a double bond. Hexanoic acid doesn't have a double bond, though. So that might not fit.

If the compound is an ester, maybe something like methyl something ester. For example, methyl benzoate is C6H5COOCH3, but that's C8H8O2, which doesn't match any of the options. Alternatively, maybe a smaller ester.

Wait, another possibility is an aromatic ester, but perhaps it's not necessary. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aromatic ring with an ester group and a double bond.

Alternatively, another approach: the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which means the compound has a double bond. So the structure must have a double bond, perhaps conjugated with a carbonyl.

So for example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. Let's say something like CH2=CHCOOR. That would have a double bond (vinyl Hs), a carbonyl, and an ester group.

In that case, the IR would show C=O (around 1700) and conjugated C=C (maybe around 1650). The broad O-H could be from an alcohol.

Wait, but if it's an ester, the O-H would come from the alcohol used to make the ester, but the ester itself doesn't have an O-H group. So the presence of a broad O-H in IR suggests the compound itself has an -OH group. So maybe it's a diol or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but when you make an ester, it's from an acid and an alcohol. The ester doesn't have an -OH group, but the acid does. So perhaps the compound is a diol, having two -OH groups. Or a carboxylic acid with a double bond.

Wait, if the compound is a diol, say 1,3-diol, then the FTIR would show a broad peak from the O-H groups. But then, where would the carbonyl groups come from? Diols don't have carbonyls. So that doesn't fit the IR data which has a peak at
