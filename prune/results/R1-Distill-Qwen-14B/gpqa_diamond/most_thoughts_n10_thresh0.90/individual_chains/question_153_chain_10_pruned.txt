Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem about Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The question gives three separate reactions, labeled A, B, and C, each with different reactants and conditions. The options for the products are A, B, C, etc., and I need to match each reaction to its product.

First, let's tackle reaction A. The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with the reagent NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). Oh wait, sodium ethoxide is a strong base, so this is probably a Michael addition.

Michael addition involves a nucleophile (enolate) attacking a beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. Wait, so dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile here because it can form an enolate. Dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH–, right? When treated with a base, it deprotonates to form the enolate, which is a strong nucleophile.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3, but wait, no, wait. Wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is probably CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3, but in the (E) configuration. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, with the p-tolyl group on C2 and the ester on C3. No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO...? Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. But in this case, it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So structure is CH2–(CH(p-tolyl))–COOCH3? No, wait, maybe it's more like CH2=CH–COOCH3 but with the substituent on the second carbon. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)–COOCH3, but that would make the double bond between C1 and C2, with p-tolyl on C2 and the ester on C3. So the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl is the enone or enoate here.

So in the Michael addition, the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the beta carbon (the one adjacent to the carbonyl) of the acrylate. So when the enolate attacks, we get a new carbon-carbon bond forming between the alpha (from malonate) and beta (from acrylate) carbons.

Wait, but wait, the acrylate is the acceptor here. The enolate is the nucleophile. So the attack happens on the beta position of the acrylate. So the product would have the structure where the malonate's enolate adds to the acrylate.

Let me sketch this mentally. The acrylate is CH2–C(p-tolyl)=CH–COOCH3? No, wait, no, wait. Wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. So 3-(p-tolyl) would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon. Wait, but that can't be right because the acrylate is three carbons in a row. Wait, maybe it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, because that would be 2-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Oh wait, the numbering is tricky. Acrylate is CH2=CH–COO–, so the alpha is CH2, beta is CH, gamma is COO–. So the 3 position would be the gamma, but that doesn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH–COOCH2CH3? No, no, the question says methyl, so it's CH2=CH–COOCH3.

Wait, but the substituent is at the 3 position. So 3-(p-tolyl) would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon? But that would be on the COOCH3 part. That doesn't make sense because the COOCH3 is the end. So maybe the structure is CH2–C(p-tolyl)=CH2–COOCH3? No, that would be a four-carbon chain, which doesn't fit the term 'acrylate' which is three carbons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COO
