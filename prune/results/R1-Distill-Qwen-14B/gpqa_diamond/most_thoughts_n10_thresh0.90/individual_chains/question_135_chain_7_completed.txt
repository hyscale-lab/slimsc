Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics and boson decay. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking.

The problem gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit rusty on my notation, but I think that's just describing an interaction where the boson X couples to fermions. The coupling term is probably proportional to the fermion fields, so it's something like Yukawa coupling maybe.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the possible kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So I need to figure out which fermion pairs X can decay into.

First, I remember that for a particle to decay into another pair of particles, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the daughter particles. Because energy and momentum have to be conserved. So for each possible fermion pair, I need to check if their combined mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

What fermions are available in the Standard Model? Let's list them: electrons, muons, taus (they're leptons), and quarks (up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top). Each has a corresponding antiparticle.

Now, I need to know the masses of these fermions. From what I remember:

- Up quark (u): ~2 MeV
- Down quark (d): ~4-5 MeV
- Strange quark (s): ~95-100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): ~173 GeV
- Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV

So, looking at the possible decay products, each pair should have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. Let's go through each option.

For each fermion pair, the sum of their masses must be ≤ 6 GeV. Let's check each possible decay channel.

1. b quark pair (b b̄): Each b is about 4.5 GeV. So two of them would be 9 GeV. That's way more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄ because it's too heavy. So any option that includes b b̄ is probably incorrect.

Wait, but wait. The mass of the X is 6 GeV. So for two fermions, each must be less than 3 GeV. Because 6 GeV is the maximum total energy available. Let me think: each fermion must have a mass less than 3 GeV. Because if each is 3 GeV, the pair is 6 GeV. So any fermion with mass above 3 GeV can't be in the decay products.

Looking at the fermion masses again:

- Top quark is way over, so t can't be produced. Similarly, b is ~4.5, which is over 3 GeV. So the decay into b b̄ is impossible. So any option that includes b b̄ is wrong.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b̄,... so A is out.

Option B: No b b̄, so possible.

Option C: No b b̄ either, so possible.

Option D: Also no b b̄, so possible.

Wait, let me check each option again.

Now, let's see which fermions are allowed.

Let's list all possible fermions that have mass less than 3 GeV:

- u: 2 MeV → yes.

- d: ~5 MeV → yes.

- s: ~100 MeV → yes.

- c: ~1.5 GeV → yes.

- e: ~0.5 MeV → yes.

- μ: ~105 MeV → yes.

- τ: ~1.78 GeV → yes, because 1.78*2 = 3.56 GeV, which is more than 6? Wait no, wait wait. Wait for each pair, the sum must be ≤6 GeV. So for τ pair, 2 * 1.78 = 3.56 GeV. Which is more than 6? No, wait 3.56 is less than 6. So wait, can X decay into τ+ τ-?

Wait, wait, I think I got confused. Because each tau is 1.78 GeV. So a pair would be 3.56 GeV. Which is less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into τ τ̄. So that is allowed.

Wait, but wait. Is the sum of the masses allowed? I think so. Because the X's mass is 6 GeV, so the decay products' rest masses must each add up to less than 6 GeV.

Wait, but wait another thing: in particle physics, the condition for a decay to be kinematically allowed is that the invariant mass of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of the parent particle.

In the case of two-particle decay, the invariant mass would be the sum of their rest masses if they are at rest. So for a boson X of mass M, decay into two particles each of mass m must satisfy 2m ≤ M.

So for X to decay into τ+ τ-, each τ is ~1.78 GeV. So 2*1.78 = 3.56 GeV ≤6 GeV. So that's allowed.

So the possible fermions that can be decay products are those with m ≤ 3 GeV.

Which are:

- u, d, s, c, e, μ, τ.

Wait, what about the tau? Each tau is 1.78 GeV, so 2*1.78 = 3.56 <6 GeV. So yes, tau can be a decay product.

Wait, but wait, the tau is a heavy lepton, but 3.56 is less than 6. So yes.

So possible decay channels are any pair where each fermion is in the above list.

So the possible decay pairs would be:

- u ū: 2*2 MeV → allowed.

- d d̄: 2*5 MeV → allowed.

- s s̄: 2*100 MeV → allowed.

- c c̄: 2*1.5 = 3 GeV → allowed.

- e+ e-: 2*0.511 MeV → allowed.

- μ+ μ-: 2*105 MeV → allowed.

- τ+ τ-: 2*1.78 GeV = 3.56 GeV → allowed.

Wait, but wait another thing. For a fermion and its antiparticle, the sum is 2m. So for each of these, the sum is under 6 GeV.

But wait, what about the top quark? Each top is 173 GeV, which is way higher than 6 GeV, so t can't be a decay product.

So possible decay channels are all the pairs listed above.

Now looking back at the options:

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

Wait, option B includes c c̄, which is allowed. But option B also includes mu and e, which are allowed.

Option C includes c c̄, and more, including t t̄. But t is too heavy, so C is wrong.

Option D: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

Wait, option D includes b b̄, which as we saw earlier, each b is 4.5 GeV, so two of them would be 9 GeV, which is way beyond X's 6 GeV. So D is incorrect.

Wait, no, that's a mistake. Because if X is 6 GeV, and each b is 4.5, then 4.5*2=9 GeV. That's bigger than X's mass, so decay into b b̄ is not allowed. So any option that includes b b̄ is wrong.

So the possible options are B and C and D? Wait, no. Because C includes t, which is too heavy. So C is wrong.

So between B and the others.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ−, e+ e−.

So that includes all possible except the b and t.

Wait, but wait, what about the tau? Because 2*1.78 is 3.56 GeV which is less than 6. So τ is allowed.

So option B includes all allowed fermions except the top and bottom.

Wait, but looking back at the problem statement: the interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps the fermions involved are only the ones with charge that can couple in this way. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says the interaction is given by that Lagrangian, which is a Yukawa coupling. Fermions ψ_f interact with X. So the possible decay modes depend on which fermions are present in the theory. But in the Standard Model, all fermions have such couplings except maybe the right-handed neutrinos, but assuming we're including all SM fermions.

Wait, but the fermion representations matter. For example, the Higgs field couples to up-type quarks differently than down-type, but in this case, the interaction is written as ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So perhaps X couples to all fermions. So any fermion that is lighter than 3 GeV can be a decay product.

So all the allowed fermions are u, d, s, c, e, μ, τ.

But wait, what about the bottom quark? Each is 4.5 GeV, so 9 GeV for a pair. Which is more than 6. So X cannot decay into b b̄.

So the possible decay channels are all the other fermions except b and t.

So now, looking at the options:

Option A: includes b, so no.

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. All allowed.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e, but also t, which is wrong.

Option D: includes b, which is wrong.

So the correct option would be B.

Wait, but wait. Are there any other considerations? For example, can the X decay into charged leptons and quarks, or only certain types?

Wait, the X is a boson, so it's neutral (assuming), so it can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that is neutral overall. So all the decay channels listed in the options are into fermion-antifermion pairs. So the X can decay into any of them, provided the mass condition is met.

So the allowed decays are all the pairs except those where each fermion is over 3 GeV. So only the bottom quark and top quark are excluded.

So among the options, only B and D have the right fermions, but D includes b which is excluded. So B is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let me list all possible fermions and their masses:

- u: 2 MeV → allowed.
- d: ~5 MeV → allowed.
- s: ~100 MeV → allowed.
- c: ~1.5 GeV → allowed (2*1.5=3 GeV ≤6).
- e: ~0.5 MeV → allowed.
- μ: ~105 MeV → allowed.
- τ: ~1.78 GeV → allowed (2*1.78=3.56 GeV ≤6).
- b: ~4.5 GeV → 9 GeV, which is over 6 → not allowed.
- t: ~173 GeV → 346 GeV → way over → not allowed.

So the possible decay pairs are: uū, ddbar, s sbar, c cbar, e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-.

Which is exactly what option B says.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but looking back, the options' wording is important. Option B says "c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−."

Yes, all these are allowed.

So the answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. For a decay to be kinematically allowed, the total mass of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of the parent particle. This means that for a fermion-antifermion pair \( f \bar{f} \), the mass of each fermion \( m_f \) must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses (in GeV)
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( \sim 0.002 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( \sim 0.005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( \sim 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (excluded due to very high mass)
- Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.000511 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 0.1057 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)

### Analysis of Decay Channels
1. **\( b \bar{b} \):** The bottom quark has a mass of \( 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} \), which is greater than \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This decay is not allowed.
2. **\( t \bar{t} \):** The top quark has a mass of \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} \), which is far greater than \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This decay is not allowed.
3. **\( c \bar{c} \):** The charm quark has a mass of \( 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_c = 3 \, \text{GeV} \), which is less than \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This decay is allowed.
4. **\( s \bar{s} \):** The strange quark has a mass of \( 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_s = 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \), which is less than \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This decay is allowed.
5. **\( u \bar{u} \):** The up quark has a mass of \( 0.002 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_u = 0.004 \, \text{GeV} \), which is less than \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This decay is allowed.
6. **\( d \bar{d} \):** The down quark has a mass of \( 0.005 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_d = 0.01 \, \text{GeV} \), which is less than \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This decay is allowed.
7. **\( \tau^+ \tau^- \):** The tau lepton has a mass of \( 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_\tau = 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \), which is less than \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This decay is allowed.
8. **\( \mu^+ \mu^- \):** The muon has a mass of \( 0.1057 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_\mu = 0.2114 \, \text{GeV} \), which is less than \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This decay is allowed.
9. **\( e^+ e^- \):** The electron has a mass of \( 0.000511 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_e = 0.001022 \, \text{GeV} \), which is less than \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This decay is allowed.

### Evaluation of Options
