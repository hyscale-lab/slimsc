Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). Hmm, I think I've seen similar matrices before in the context of spin operators.

Wait, I remember that for spin-1/2 particles, the Pauli matrices are involved. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Oh, wait, no, S here isn't a Pauli matrix directly. Let me think: The given S matrix is (0 -i; i 0), which actually looks like the Pauli matrix σy times i, maybe? Because the Pauli σy is (0, -i; i, 0), right? So wait, S is actually iσy, since σy is (0, -i; i, 0). Wait, no: Let me check. The Pauli matrix σy is (0, -i; i, 0). So S is exactly σy. Because the given S is (0 -i; i 0), same as σy. Oh, wait, no: Oh wait, wait. Let's see, the Pauli σy is defined as [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is exactly the matrix given for S. So S here is σy.

So the operator Ay is c times σy. Since c is h/(4π), but wait, actually, the intrinsic angular momentum operator components for spin-½ particles are given by ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices. Wait, because the spin angular momentum S is (ħ/2) σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So for the y-component, Sy would be (ħ/2) σy.

But in this problem, the operator Ay is c times S, where S is the matrix given (σy). Wait, but wait, the problem says Ay = c·S, and S is the given matrix. So S is σy, so Ay is c·σy. But wait, what is c? c is h/(4π), right?

Hmm, let me compute the value of c. Planck's constant h is h = 2πħ, so h/(4π) would be (2πħ)/(4π) )= ħ/(2). So c = ħ/2. So Ay is (ħ/2) * σy.

Wait, but because σy is a matrix, and the eigenvalues of σy are ±1 because it's a Pauli matrix. So, when I have an operator that's a multiple of σy, the eigenvalues would be the multiple times the eigenvalues of σy.

Wait, the eigenvalues of σy are ±1. So when you multiply σy by (ħ/2), the eigenvalues become ± (ħ/2). But wait, the problem is about the eigenvalues of Ay. So Ay has eigenvalues a = (ħ/2) * (±1) = ± ħ/2.

Wait, but looking at the options, they don't directly mention ħ/2. Let me check the options. Option B says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. That can't be right. Because the eigenvalues of a spin component operator are real, right? Because they're eigenvalues of an Hermitian operator.

Wait, wait, wait, S is σy, which is Hermitian? Let me check: σy is Hermitian because it's equal to its conjugate transpose. Because σy^dagger is (0, i; -i, 0), which is the same as σy, since σy is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. So yes, σy is Hermitian. So Ay = c σy is Hermitian because c is real and σy is Hermitian. So the eigenvalues of Ay should be real.

Wait, so the eigenvalues should be real numbers, meaning the real parts are the eigenvalues, and the imaginary parts are zero. So that would rule out any option that suggests eigenvalues have non-zero imaginary parts. Looking at the options:

Option A: Imaginary parts ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). But that's not possible because, as I thought, eigenvalues are real, so imaginary parts must be zero. So option A is wrong.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±½, real parts ±1. That also has non-zero imaginary parts, so that can't be right either.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can be eigen
