Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson field. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

The question gives the interaction Lagrangian as L(y) = -λf * ψ_f(y) * (v + X(y)) * ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm not super familiar with the notation, but I think this is a Yukawa-type interaction. The boson X couples to fermions, right? Like how the Higgs field interacts with fermions.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I need to find the kinematically allowed decay channels of X at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different possible fermion-antifermion pairs.

So, the first thing I remember is that for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the energy from the boson's rest mass must be sufficient to create those particles. Also, each fermion pair must have a combined mass less than or equal to the mass of the boson.

Wait, but wait. The decay is X → f f-bar, right? So the sum of the rest masses of f and f-bar must be less than or equal to the mass of X. Because at rest, the invariant mass of the decay products has to be less than or equal to the mass of the parent particle.

So, mass of X is 6 GeV. Let me list the masses of the known fermions.

Electron: negligible, but about 0.0005 GeV. So, 2m_e ≈ 0.001, which is way below 6 GeV. So e+ e- is allowed.

Same for muon: m_mu ≈ 0.105 GeV. So 2m_mu is about 0.21 GeV. That's way below 6 GeV. So mu+ mu- would be allowed.

Tau: m_tau ≈ 1.78 GeV. So 2m_tau ≈ 3.56 GeV. That's under 6, so allowed.

The quarks: Let's think about their masses. But wait, in the Standard Model, the masses are given by the current quarks. However, the up and down quarks are very light. But the strange quark is heavier. Wait
