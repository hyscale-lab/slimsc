Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, N ∝ 1/plx^5. Hmm, I need to find out how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. The options are A to D, with different exponents on r.

Wait, right, parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh wait, parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is the distance. So if r increases, plx decreases.

So let's write that down. plx = 1/r. So r = 1/plx.

The number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/r, substituting that in, we get N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5.

Let me compute that. 1/( (1/r)^5 ) is the same as (r^5). Because (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so the reciprocal is r^5. So N ∝ r^5. Oh wait, but wait a second. Because the number of stars increases with r^5? That seems a lot.

Wait, but the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. So it's about the number density, maybe? Like, how many stars are there per unit distance, or the rate of change of N with respect to r.

Wait, wait, actually, the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)"? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the relationship between N and r again.

So N is proportional to r^5. So as r increases, the number of stars increases as r^5. So for a small change in r, the change in N would be proportional to 5 r^4. But wait, maybe the question is just asking for the dependence, not the derivative.

Wait, the question is phrased a bit confusingly. Let me parse it again: The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k * (1/plx^5), where k is a constant. Since plx is 1/r, N = k * r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So when distance increases, the number of stars increases with r^5.

But wait, that doesn't make sense in real terms. Because as you look further away, each star is dimmer, but the number of stars... I thought the number might decrease because stars are farther apart and harder to see, but maybe this question is hypothetical, not real.

So according to the given relation, N is proportional to r^5. So the number increases with the fifth power of distance. So the answer would be B) ~ r^5.

Wait the options are A: ~r^3, B: ~r^5, etc. So the answer should be option B.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = C / plx^5. And since plx is 1/r, then N = C * r^5. So yes, number of stars increases with r^5.

So the correct option is B: ~ r^5.


The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely related to distance (\( r \)), we have \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting this into the given relationship, we get:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^5} = r^5
\]

Thus, the number of stars is proportional to \( r^5 \). This means that as the distance \( r \) increases, the number of stars in the region of the sky increases with the fifth power of \( r \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
