Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me read the problem again carefully. We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, it's titrated with 0.1 M NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

I remember that when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes. So the first step is probably to find the new concentration of the acetic acid after dilution.

So, initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluting with 20 cm³ of water, so total volume is 40 cm³. The moles of acetic acid should stay the same because we're only adding water. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). 

Wait, wait. Let me calculate that. So the initial moles are 0.05 M × 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L). That's 0.05 × 0.02 = 0.001 moles of acetic acid. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So the new concentration is moles / volume. 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh right, that makes sense. So after dilution, the acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate this with NaOH. The reaction is acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacting with NaOH (which provides OH-) to form acetate (CH3COO^-) and water. The reaction equation is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid. So I should find the equivalence point volume.

The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution are 0.025 M × 0.04 L = 0.001 moles (wait, no, that's the same as before because I calculated it already). The concentration was 0.025 M, which is 0.001 moles in 0.04 L. So for NaOH, which is 0.1 M, the volume needed for equivalence would be moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L or 10 cm³.

So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added. Now, the pH at equivalence point is determined by the acetate ion in solution. Since acetic acid is a weak acid, its conjugate base (acetate) will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic.

The pH at equivalence will require calculating the pH of a solution of sodium acetate. The acetate comes from the neutralization, so let's find the concentration of acetate.

The total volume at equivalence is initial acetic acid volume (40 cm³) plus NaOH volume (10 cm³), so 50 cm³ or 0.05 L. Moles of acetate are same as moles of acetic acid initially, which was 0.001 moles. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will react with water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb is 5.405e-10. Now, for a weak base, the OH- concentration can be found using the formula:

OH- = sqrt(Kb * C)

C is 0.02 M. So sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M. Then, pOH is log(1/[OH-]) → wait, no, pOH = -log[OH-]. So log(1.04e-5) is about 4.98, so pOH is around 4.98. Then pH is 14 - 4.98 = 9.02. Wait, but none of the options have that. The options at equivalence are 8.52, 6.73, 7.00, 6.92. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let's recalculate Kb. Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5. Let me compute that accurately.

1e-14 ÷ 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So Kb is 5.405e-10, and C is 0.02.

So for the hydrolysis: Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO^-]. Assuming x is small compared to 0.02, so x²/(0.02) ≈ 5.405e-10 → x² = 5.405e-10 *0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH-] is 1.04e-5. pOH is log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. pH is 14 -4.98 =9.02. But the options don't have this. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the assumption that x is small is invalid. Let's check.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. 5.405e-10 * 0.02 is 1.08e-11, which is x squared. So x is about 1e-5.5 (since 1e-5 squared is 1e-10, which is larger than 1e-11). So 1e-5.5 is about 3.16e-6. Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, sqrt(1.081e-11) is about 1.04e-5. So [OH-] is 1.04e-5, which is 1.04e-5 M. pOH is -log(1.04e-5). Let me compute that accurately.

Log(1.04) is about 0.017. So log(1.04e-5) is -5 + 0.017 = -4.983. So pOH is 4.983, pH is 14 -4.983=9.017. So approximately 9.02.

But the options don't have a pH near 9.02. Let me look again at the options. Option A is 4.26;8.52. Option D is 4.57;6.92. So none match. Did I make a mistake in initial calculations?

Wait, maybe I didn't account for the fact that when you dilute the acid, the pH changes before titration. Wait no, the question asks about the pH at specific points during the titration. So the equivalence point is definitely when all the acid is neutralized, as I did.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the Kb or concentration.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the solution at equivalence point is a buffer because some people forget that at equivalence, it's a salt of a weak acid and strong base. So the solution is of sodium acetate, which is a weak base. So the pH will be determined by the Kb of acetate, as I did.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb. Let me recalculate it. Ka = 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = (1/1.85) × 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405 × 1e-9 = 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the concentration of acetate is not 0.02 M. Let me double-check. The initial acetic acid after dilution is 0.025 M, and 40 cm³. Moles are 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles. At equivalence, after adding 10 cm³, the volume is 50 cm³ (0.05 L). So 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps the assumption that x is small is incorrect. Let's do it without the approximation.

The Kb expression is Kb = x² / (0.02 - x).

Since Kb is very small, 5.4e-10, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so the assumption is valid. So x is about 1e-5, which is much less than 0.02, so the assumption holds.

So why is the calculated pH not matching the options? Let me think. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial problem. Let me look at the options again. Oh wait, the options include at equivalence points of 8.52, 6.73, 7, and 6.92. So maybe I did a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps the initial moles of acetic acid are calculated wrong. Let me recheck. 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. 0.05 M ×0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Correct.

Dilution: 20+20=40 cm³, so 0.04 L. 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M, correct. So after dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M.

Wait, but when you add NaOH, which is a strong base, it will neutralize the acetic acid. So maybe I should check the point at 25% titration. Maybe that's where I made the mistake.

Wait, the question asks for pH at 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume has been added. The equivalence volume is 10 cm³, so 25% is 2.5 cm³.

At that point, the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M × 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001, moles remaining would be 0.001 -0.00025 = 0.00075 mol of acetic acid, and 0.00025 mol of acetate ion (CH3COO^-). Because for every mole of NaOH added, one mole of acetic acid is converted to acetate.

So the solution now has both acetic acid and acetate ions, making it a buffer solution. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.00025) / (0.00075) )= 1/3 ≈ 0.333.

So log(1/3) is log(0.333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 + (-0.477) ≈4.256. Approximately 4.26. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. But earlier, I calculated the equivalence point pH as about 9.02, but none of the options match that. So something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Maybe I should consider that at equivalence, the solution is sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid, so the solution is basic. But perhaps I should use the formula for a weak base correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the pH of the sodium acetate solution more accurately. Let's do that.

So, for CH3COO^- in 0.05 L (50 cm³) solution, 0.001 moles. Concentration is 0.02 M.

The reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

Kb = 5.405e-10.

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Let me let x = [OH^-] = [CH3COOH].

So, Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x² = 5.405e-10 × 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5 → pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈4.983 → pH =14-4.983=9.017, around 9.02.

But again, none of the options have this. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Let me think. Oh wait, wait! Another possibility: perhaps I messed up the volume when calculating the concentration of acetate. Wait, at equivalence, the total volume is 40 cm³ (from acetic acid) plus 10 cm³ of NaOH, which is 50 cm³. So 0.05 L. Moles of acetate is 0.001, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

Hmm, maybe the initial problem has a different approach. Let me think about the options. Option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the 25% titration point.

Wait, let's recalculate the 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume (10 cm³) is 2.5 cm³. So moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. So moles of acetic acid reacted are 0.00025, producing 0.00025 mol of acetate.

So, the remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. The total volume is 40 cm³ (diluted acetic acid) +2.5 cm³ NaOH =42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So concentrations are:

[Acetic acid] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[Acetate] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is approximately 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333. So the same as before, 1/3. So the pH using Henderson-Hasselbalch should be same as before: pKa + log(1/3) =4.73 + (-0.477)=4.253≈4.25.

So the pH at 25% is approximately 4.26, which matches option A's first value.

But the equivalence point in option A is 8.52. That doesn't align with my calculation of 9.02. So perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the solution after equivalence is not just the acetate ion, but maybe some other factors. Or perhaps I'm miscalculating the Kb.

Wait, another approach: maybe the initial concentration after dilution is not 0.025 M. Let me recheck.

Initial volume: 20cm³ (0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles: 0.05 * 0.02 =0.001 mol. After adding 20cm³ water, total volume 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So 0.001 /0.04 =0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the NaOH is more concentrated? No, it's 0.1 M. So the calculations are correct.

Wait, maybe I should not assume that the solution at equivalence is just the acetate ion. No, that's correct because all the acetic acid is neutralized, forming acetate.

Wait, perhaps the Kb is miscalculated. Let me recompute it.

Ka =1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 =5.405e-10. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the acetate concentration is not 0.02 M. Let me see. At equivalence, moles of acetate is 0.001, in 50 cm³ (0.05 L), so 0.02 M. Correct.

Hmm, maybe the calculation of pH at equivalence is correct, but the options have a different value. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option D says pH at equivalence is 6.92. That's acidic, which makes no sense because equivalence point for a weak acid titrated with strong base should be basic.

Option A's equivalence is 8.52, which is lower than what I calculated, but perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the acetate is not the only source of OH-? No, the solution is acetate in water.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the pH using the formula for a weak base:

pH = ½ (pKb - log C), but wait, that's not a standard formula I know. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the approximation method.

Wait, another way to approach the Kb calculation is to use the formula:

[OH-] = sqrt( Kb * C )

Which I did earlier. So 5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11. Square root is ~1.04e-5, same as before.

Hmm, perhaps I should check if I messed up the moles or volumes.

Wait, perhaps the equivalence point volume is not 10 cm³. Let me recalculate that.

Moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Moles of NaOH needed: same as moles of acetic acid, because 1:1 ratio. So NaOH moles =0.001. Molarity is 0.1 M, so volume = 0.001 / 0.1 =0.01 L=10 cm³. Correct.

So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³. So the volume at equivalence is 40 +10=50 cm³.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the way I calculated the pH at equivalence. Let me think again.

Wait, if the concentration of acetate is 0.02 M, and Kb is 5.405e-10, then the [OH-] is sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈1.04e-5 M.

So pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈4.98 → pH=9.02.

But the options don't have this. So either I'm wrong or the options are wrong, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when the solution is diluted, the pH is different. Wait, but no, the question is about the titration after dilution. So the initial pH after dilution would be different, but the question is about the pH during titration.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me think again about the 25% point.

Wait, the 25% titration is 25% of the way to the equivalence point. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So moles of NaOH added: 0.1 * 0.0025 =0.00025 mol.

So moles of acetic acid left: 0.001 -0.00025=0.00075. Moles of acetate formed: 0.00025.

Total volume is 40 +2.5=42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

So [HA]=0.00075 /0.0425≈0.017647 M.

[A^-] =0.00025 /0.0425≈0.005882 M.

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 0.005882 /0.017647≈0.333, as before.

pH= pKa + log(0.333) =4.733 -0.477≈4.256. So pH≈4.26, which matches option A's first value.

But equivalence point pH is 9.02, which is not listed. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the equivalence point but the midpoint, but no, the equivalence point is when all acid is neutralized.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should consider the dilution of the solution at equivalence point. Let me think: when you add NaOH, the total volume increases. But I accounted for that, so it's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the pH using the exact method without the approximation. Let's do that for the equivalence point.

At equivalence point, [CH3COO^-] =0.02 M.

Reaction: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. Kb =5.405e-10.

Let x be [OH^-] = [CH3COOH].

So Kb = x² / (0.02 -x) ≈ x² / 0.02 =5.405e-10 → x²=1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5. So same result.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, maybe I messed up the initial dilution.

Wait, the initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluting with 20 cm³ H2O. So initial moles =0.05 *0.02=0.001 mol. After diluting to 40 cm³, concentration is 0.001 /0.04=0.025 M. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about 25% titration of the original solution, not the diluted one. Let me think. Oh wait, no, because the solution is diluted before titration.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH at 25% of the equivalence volume, which is 2.5 cm³ added. So same as before. I think I did that right.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M, but when titrating, the initial solution is 40 cm³. So when 2.5 cm³ is added, the total volume is 42.5 cm³.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the concentrations again:

Moles of HA after 2.5 cm³ NaOH: 0.001 -0.00025=0.00075.

Moles of A^-: 0.00025.

Concentration HA: 0.00075 / 0.0425 L = 0.017647 M.

Concentration A^-: 0.00025 /0.0425=0.005882 M.

Henderson equation: pH=pKa + log(0.005882/0.017647)= pKa + log(0.333)=4.733 -0.477=4.256.

So pH≈4.26. So the first value is correct, but the second is not matching any options.

Wait, looking at the options, option D's equivalence pH is 6.92. Hmm, that's in the basic range but not as high as 9. How could that happen?

Wait another thought: Maybe the solution at equivalence is not just the sodium acetate but some other process. Alternatively, perhaps the pH at equivalence is not as high because the solution is not just acetate but maybe some other factors. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the Ka value.

Wait, the question says the Ka is 1.85e-5. I used that correctly.

Wait, maybe I should compute the pH using the exact expression for the acetate ion hydrolysis.

Let me set up the equation:

Kb = (x)(x)/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02. So x²=5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5. So same result.

But perhaps I should solve without the assumption. Let's see.

x² =5.405e-10 (0.02 -x)

x²=1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x.

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Using quadratic formula: x= [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a)

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c=-1.081e-11.

Discriminant: (5.405e-10)^2 +4 *1 *1.081e-11= (2.92e-19) +4.324e-11= approx 4.324e-11 (since the first term is negligible). So sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈6.576e-6.

So x= [ -5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6 ]/(2). Taking positive root:

x=(6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2≈ (6.576e-6)/2≈3.288e-6.

Wait, that's different from the previous 1.04e-5. Oh, so this gives x=3.288e-6 M. [OH-] is 3.288e-6.

pOH= -log(3.288e-6)=5.486. So pH=14-5.486=8.514. Approximately 8.51. So pH≈8.51.

Wait, that's about 8.51, which is close to option A's equivalence point value of 8.52.

So why did I get a different result when not assuming x is negligible?

Because when I assumed x is small, the denominator was 0.02, but without that assumption, x is about 3.29e-6, which is 0.000329% of 0.02, so indeed negligible. So why did the quadratic method give a different result?

Wait, because if x is 3.29e-6, then 0.02 -x is approximately 0.01999967, which is almost 0.02. So the assumption was correct, and the x is about 3.29e-6, which is approximately 1.04e-5? Wait, no, 3.29e-6 is 3.29e-6, while the initial assumption gave 1.04e-5. So that's a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic solution.

Wait, let me do the quadratic more accurately.

Equation: x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Discriminant D= (5.405e-10)^2 +4 *1 *1.081e-11.

Compute each term:

(5.405e-10)^2 = (5.405)^2 *1e-20 ≈29.214e-20=2.9214e-19.

4*1*1.081e-11=4.324e-11.

So D=2.9214e-19 +4.324e-11 = approx 4.324e-11 (since 2.92e-19 is negligible compared to 4.32e-11).

So sqrt(D)=√(4.324e-11)=6.576e-6.

So x= [ -5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6 ]/(2).

Taking positive root:

x= (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2=3.288e-6.

So x≈3.288e-6 M.

Wait, but when I calculated using the assumption x<<0.02, I got x=1.04e-5. So why the discrepancy?

Ah, because the assumption x<<0.02 is not valid here? Let me check.

x is 3.29e-6. 0.02 is 2e-2. 3.29e-6 / 2e-2 = 0.0001645, which is about 0.01645%. So x is about 0.016% of the initial concentration, which is indeed negligible. So why did the two methods give different results?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic solution. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact method.

Wait, another approach: Let me use the exact formula for weak base.

pH = ½ (pKb - log C) + pOH adjustment. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact expression.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH without any assumption.

So [OH^-] = x. Kb= x²/(0.02 -x)=5.405e-10.

Rearranged: x² =5.405e-10 (0.02 -x).

x² = 1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x.

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [ -5.405e-10 ± sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11 ) ] / 2.

Compute the discriminant:

(5.405e-10)^2 = 2.921e-19.

4*1*1.081e-11=4.324e-11.

So discriminant D=2.921e-19 +4.324e-11=4.324e-11 (approx, as 2.9e-19 is negligible).

So sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11)=6.576e-6.

So x=( -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 )/2 ≈ (6.576e-6 )/2=3.288e-6.

So x=3.288e-6 M.

pOH= -log(3.288e-6)= (log(3.288) is about 0.517) → -log(3.288e-6)=5.483.

pH=14-5.483=8.517≈8.52.

Ah, so that's why option A has 8.52 as the equivalence pH. I think I made a mistake earlier in assuming that the x was 1.04e-5, but actually, the correct x is about 3.29e-6, leading to pH≈8.52.

So that means option A is correct: pH at 25% is 4.26, at equivalence it's 8.52.

So I must have made an error in the initial Kb calculation without considering the quadratic properly. Now everything makes sense.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### At 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence volume is reached. The equivalence volume is calculated as:

\[
\text{Equivalence volume} = \frac{\text{Moles of acetic acid}}{\text{Molarity of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

Thus, 25% of the equivalence volume is:

\[
0.25 \times 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This reacts with an equal amount of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]
\[
\text{Moles of acetate formed} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume is now:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{Acetic acid}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{Acetate}] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{Acetate}]}{[\text{Acetic acid}]}\right),
\]
\[
\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733,
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log\left(\frac{0.00588}{0.01765}\right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

### At Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized, forming acetate ions. The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{Acetate}] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let \([OH^-] = x\). Then:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{Acetate}] - x}.
\]

Assuming \(x \ll 0.02\), we approximate:

\[
K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot 0.02 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11},
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[OH^-] = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98,
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

However, recalculating using the exact quadratic method gives:

\[
x = \frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 + 4ac}}{2a},
\]
where \(a = 1\), \(b = 5.405 \times 10^{-10}\), and \(c = -1.081 \times 10^{-11}\). Solving:

\[
x \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48,
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
