Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and something labeled A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (with water) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm. Let's break it down.

First reaction: butan-2-one (which is methyl isopropyl ketone) reacting with NaCN and reagent A. I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic substitution, especially under certain conditions. Wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone, so when it reacts with a cyanide ion (NaCN provides CN-), it's a nucleophilic addition maybe? Or substitution?

Wait, I think the reaction of ketones with CN- is more likely a nucleophilic addition, leading to a cyanohydrin. Oh right! The cyanohydrin formation. The ketone reacts with CN- in a basic condition or something else? Or does it require acid?

Wait the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me see, butan-2-one has a structure where the carbonyl is on C2. Adding CN- would add to the carbonyl, and then the OH would come from where?

Wait, the reaction is butan-2-one (CH3-CO-CH2-CH3?) No, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So structure is CH3-C(O)-CH2-? Wait, no. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So it's a ketone with the carbonyl on C2. So structure is CH2(COCH3)CH3? No, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so it's (CH3)C(O)CH3? No, wait, butan-2-one has four carbons. So it's CH3-CO-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no. Oh wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so it's (CH3)C(O)CH3, which is incorrect because that would be acetone, but butan-2-one is actually (CH3)COCH2CH3. Wait, no. Let me think. Butan-2-one has the ketone group on the second carbon of a four-carbon chain. So it's CH2(CO)CH2CH3? No, that's incorrect. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH3? No, wait, let's count. Butan-2-one is (CH2)2CO. Wait, perhaps it's CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH3. Oh wait, no. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So the structure is (CH3)2C=O. So, when the ketone reacts with CN-, it forms a cyanohydrin.

So, the cyanohydrin formation involves the nucleophilic addition of CN- to the carbonyl group. The general reaction is ketone + CN- â†’ cyanohydrin. But what conditions are needed for this?

I think that the reaction requires an acid catalyst. Because in the presence of an acid, the carbonyl becomes more electrophilic. So the mechanism would involve protonation of the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more positive, and then the CN- attacks.

So, the reagent A in the first reaction must be an acid, like H3O+? Because NaCN would provide CN- but you need an acid to protonate the carbonyl.

Wait, but looking at the options, the first reagent A could be H3O+ or NaHSO3. NaHSO3 would provide H+ and SO3^2-? Wait, but maybe it's for another reaction.

So for the first reaction, the reagent is likely H3O+ (option A or B) or NaHSO3 (option C or D). Because NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and SO3^2-, but in this case, maybe we need just an acid.

So the first reaction uses H3O+ as A. So options A or B for the first part, but let's move on to the second reaction.

The second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid. So the nitrile group (CN) is being converted into a COOH group.

How do nitriles get converted into carboxylic acids? I remember that under acidic conditions, especially with strong acids and water, nitriles can hydrolyze. For example, in the presence of H2O and HCl (like HCl and heat), nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids. But wait, sometimes other conditions are used, like in the presence of a strong base and then acid work-up.

Wait, let me think. The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can be done by using HCl (concentrated) and water under reflux. Alternatively, sometimes a mixture like H
