Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm supposed to figure out the electric field at a point outside a spherical conductor with a cavity. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

Alright, the setup: there's a spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the conductor's center, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.

Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and the distance from P to the cavity's center is l. Also, the angle between l and s is theta. And the options involve different expressions based on these variables.

Wait, I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding charges. Oh right, in electrostatics, the charges in a conductor redistribute themselves in a certain way. For a conductor with a cavity, if there's a charge inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge opposite to it because the electric field inside the conductor material must be zero. But in this case, the conductor itself was uncharged, so the total charge on the conductor must be zero. That means the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface would have +q to balance it because the conductor as a whole is neutral.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the conductor was uncharged. So the total charge on the conductor's outer surface should be +q because the inner surface has -q (induced by the +q in the cavity), so the outer must have +q to make the total conductor charge zero. Because the conductor's overall charge is zero, right? So the outer surface is +q.

But the question is about a point outside the conductor. So when you're outside a charged spherical conductor, the electric field behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. That's the shell theorem, right? So for a point outside, the field depends only on the total charge enclosed within a Gaussian surface that includes that point.

Wait, but in this case, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So any Gaussian surface outside the conductor (radius L > R) would enclose this +q charge. So the electric field at point P should be the same as that produced by a point charge +q at the center of the conductor.

But wait, the point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, but what about the position relative to the cavity's center? Hmm. Wait, the conductor's inner surface is at radius R, and the cavity is off-center by s. So the distribution of the charge on the conductor's inner and outer surfaces is a bit more complicated than the usual case.

Wait, let me think again. The conductor is neutral, so the charges on the inner and outer surfaces must balance. The inner surface (inside the cavity) has -q because of the +q in the cavity. Then the outer surface must have +q. Because the conductor's total charge is zero, the outer surface has +q.

So when considering the electric field outside the conductor, all that matters is the total charge outside the Gaussian surface. Since the outer surface has +q, the field at point P should be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L². Because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P, and the charge is at the center.

Wait, but the problem gives l and theta as variables. Hmm. l is the distance from P to the cavity's center, and theta is the angle between l and s, the separation between the two centers.

Wait, but according to what I was thinking earlier, the field at P only depends on the total charge of the conductor, which is +q at the outer surface. So the position of the cavity and the charge inside it shouldn't affect the external field because the conductor's outer surface's charge distribution is uniform or symmetric? No, wait, in this case, the cavity is off-center, so the inner surface isn't symmetric. So the charge distribution on the inner surface would be non-uniform. But the outer surface, which is a conductor, must have its charge distributed in a way that the field inside the conductor is zero. So how does that affect the outer surface's charge distribution?

I think the conductor's outer surface will have a uniform charge distribution only if the inner charge is at the center. Since the inner charge is off-center, the outer surface's charge distribution might not be uniform. But wait, no, because the conductor is a sphere. The outer surface should be spherically symmetric regardless of the inner charge's position. Oh wait, that's not right. Because the inner charge is inside a cavity, which is not at the center, the outer surface's charge distribution might be affected. Or wait, no, because the conductor's material allows charges to move freely. So for the outer surface, the charges will arrange themselves to make the external field look as if all the charge is at the center. But wait, if the inner charge is off-center, does that affect the external field?

Wait, think about the method of image charges. If there's a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the inner surface has an induced charge. But the outer surface's induced charge depends on the net charge of the conductor. In this problem, the conductor is initially neutral, so the inner surface has -q, so the outer must have +q regardless of the position of the cavity.

Wait, but the conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface should have a symmetric distribution. Because the conductor is a sphere, any internal charge (even if the cavity is off-center) would cause the inner surface to have an induced charge, but the outer surface would distribute its charge uniformly. Wait, is that correct? Because the conductor's material is a sphere, the outer surface charge should be uniform regardless of the inner charge's position. Because the electric field within the conductor (its material) must be zero, so the charges on the outer surface arrange themselves to cancel any fields within the conductor. But if the inner charge is off-center, would that influence the outer surface's charge distribution?

Hmm, maybe not. Because the outer surface is outside the inner cavity. So the field due to the inner cavity's charge (and its induced charges) would influence the charges on the inner surface, but for the outer surface, the only thing that matters is the net charge on the conductor. Since the conductor's net charge is zero, the outer surface must have +q. But wait, no: the conductor's net charge is zero, so it's possible that the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q, making the total zero. So the outer surface has a charge of +q.

But since the outer surface is a sphere, the charge distribution is uniform, so the electric field outside would be as if the +q were at the center. Therefore, the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor (L > R), depends only on the total charge of the outer surface, which is +q, and the distance from the center of the sphere to P, which is L. So the electric field should be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/L².

Looking at the options, option B is exactly that: E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/L².

But wait, what about the position of the point P relative to the cavity's center? The problem gives us l and theta, but if the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform, then the electric field at any point outside the conductor is as if the charge were at the center, regardless of where the inner charge is. So the presence of the cavity and the charge inside it doesn't affect the external field because the conductor's outer surface acts as a spherical shell with charge +q.

So the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Conductor Properties**: The spherical conductor is initially uncharged, and a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The inner surface of the conductor will induce a charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor's material. The outer surface of the conductor, being neutral overall, will then have a charge of $+q$ to balance the system.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within a Gaussian surface that includes the point of interest. Since the outer surface of the conductor has a total charge of $+q$, the electric field at any point outside the conductor behaves as if the charge $+q$ were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

3. **Relevance of $l$, $s$, and $\theta$**: The problem introduces variables $l$ (distance from $P$ to the cavity's center), $s$ (distance between the centers of the conductor and the cavity), and $\theta$ (angle between $l$ and $s$). However, these variables do not affect the electric field outside the conductor because the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform. The electric field at $P$ depends only on the total charge $+q$ of the outer surface and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor to $P$.

4. **Final Expression**: Using Coulomb's law, the electric field at $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]
   This matches option B.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
