Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. 

The problem states that the concentration of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. And the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. I think the formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So, the reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

Wait, right, the formation constant Kf is given by [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, in this solution, the only thing present is the Ca-EDTA complex. So, the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- according to the Kf value.

So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and we can assume that it dissociates completely? No, wait, no, because K is a very large number. Wait, K is 5e10, which is a big number, meaning the reaction favors the formation of the complex. So, when the complex dissociates, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would be low, because most of the complex remains intact.

Wait, but wait, I think I should model this with the dissociation of the complex. Let me think. The complex is [CaEDTA]^2-, which dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

So, the initial concentration is all complex: 0.02 M. As it dissociates, let's say the change is 'x'. So, the concentration of Ca²+ would be x, and the concentration of EDTA^4- would be x as well. Because each complex gives one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

So, the equilibrium expression is Kf = [CaEDTA]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ). Wait, wait no, wait. The complex is in the numerator, but wait, no: Kf is [complex]/([metal][ligand]). So, Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ) ) = 5e10.

But wait, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and when it dissociates, the complex decreases by x, so [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 - x. But since K is so large, x is going to be very small compared to 0.02. So, [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02 M. So, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, Kf = (0.02) / (x * x) = (0.02)/(x²) ) = 5e10.

So, solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-12 /5e10? Wait, wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So, 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5)*1e-12, which is 0.4e-12 or 4e-13. So, x² = 4e-13 → x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13, sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5 (since 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2). So, x = 2e-6.5 M.

Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6. So, 2e-6.5 is 2 * 1e-6.5 ≈ 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7 M. So, x is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

So, the concentration of calcium ions is x, which is about 6.3e-7 M. Let me check the options. Option C is 6.3e-7 M. That must be the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure. So, the complex is 0.02 M, and K is 5e10. So, the formula is x² = (0.02) / K. So, 0.02 is 2e-2. 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 → 4e-13. So, x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = approx 6.32e-7. Yep, that's correct.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of the complex:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Given:
- \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \)
- Initial concentration of the complex, \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]_0 = 0.02 \, \text{M}\)

At equilibrium, the dissociation of the complex produces \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\). Since \( K_f \) is very large, the dissociation is minimal, and \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\). Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
