Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. There are two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits.

The key data points are the periodic shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is, how many times longer is the orbital period of Planet #2 compared to Planet #1?

Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift of a star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth, and the shift in the lines corresponds to the star's velocity.

The formula I think I need is the one that relates the velocity semi-amplitude (K) of the star to the orbital period (P) of the planet. I remember something about the formula involving the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, the period, and other constants.

Wait, the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula K = (v * sin i) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But since the eccentricity e is zero (they're in circular orbits), that term drops out. Also, since the planets are similar in mass to Neptune and the stars are similar to the Sun, M_p is much less than M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*.

So the formula simplifies to something like K ≈ ( (G * M_p) / (M_* ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ) * (some constant factors). Wait, maybe I should recall the exact formula.

I think the formula for K is:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^2 ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) ) * (2π / (c)) )

Wait, no, maybe that's not right. Let me think again. Oh, another approach: for a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (2π) / (P * c ) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p / M_*)^(1/3) )) )

No, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me try another approach. The RV method relates the star's velocity to the planet's orbit. The formula I remember is:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But I think when M_p is much less than M_*, which is the case here (Neptune's mass is about 1/17th Earth's, and the star is like the Sun, which is much more massive), M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so M_p/(M_*) can be considered as a small term. So simplifying, K ≈ ( (G M_p) / (M_*)^2 )^(1/3) * (2π / (P c) ) ) * (1) )

Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, I think the Doppler shift (K) is proportional to (M_p / M_*) * (1 / P^(1/3)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period, because K = (v) = (2π a) / P, where a is the semi-major axis. Wait, but that's the star's velocity, so a would be the star's orbit around the barycenter.

Wait, perhaps for the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But since M_p << M_*, this simplifies to K ≈ ( (G M_p) / (M_* c) )^(1/3) ) * (2π / P )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps I shouldn't go too deep into the formula. Let's think about the key point: the velocity semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. Because in the formula, K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3). So if K1 and K2 are the velocities for planet 1 and 2, then K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3).

Wait, wait, no. Because if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K1 = (1/P1^(1/3)) * const, K2 = (1/P2^(1/3)) * const. So K1/K2 = P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of periods, P2/P1. We are given K1 and K2. So if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then K1/K2 = 5/7.

From K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) / (P2/P1)^(1/3) ?

Wait, no, perhaps:

Let me write the formula correctly. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3) )

But since M_p << M_*, (M_* + M_p) ≈ M_*, so:

K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3) )

But since both planets have the same mass (Neptune-like), M_p is the same for both. The stars are the same mass, so M_* is the same. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Therefore, K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3).

Thus, K1 = (1/P1^(1/3)) * C, K2 = (1/P2^(1/3)) * C, where C is some constant.

So, K1/K2 = P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) → (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

We can rearrange this to find the ratio (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, no, because K1/K2 = (1/P1^(1/3)) / (1/P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get the ratio right.

We have K1 ∝ 1/P1^(1/3) and K2 ∝ 1/P2^(1/3). So, K1 = k * (1/P1^(1/3)), K2 = k * (1/P2^(1/3)), where k is a constant (since M_p and M_* are same for both).

So, K1/K2 = (1/P1^(1/3)) / (1/P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Therefore, (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3.

So, if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then K1/K2 = 5/7. So, (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3 ) = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So, P2 is about 0.36 times P1. Which means the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. So, the period of planet #2 is shorter than planet #1, which means planet #2's period is shorter, so the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. Wait, that would be P2/P1, which is about 0.36 times, so it's shorter. So the ratio is less than 1.

Wait, but the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

So, if P2 is shorter, then it's not longer. So the ratio is less than 1. So if the options have 0.36 as an option, that would imply that P2 is 0.36 times P1, meaning it's shorter. But the question is how many times longer than P1 is P2's period. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times as long, meaning it's shorter.

But wait, the options given are:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

So, the question is, P2 is how many times longer than P1? So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's 0.36 times as long as P1, meaning it's shorter. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36. So the answer would be option A, which is ~0.36.

But wait, let me double-check the formula. Did I get the ratio correct?

Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So, higher K means shorter period.

So, K2 is larger than K1. So Planet #2 has a larger RV shift → higher K → shorter period.

So, P2 is shorter than P1. So P2/P1 = 0.36 → it's 0.36 times as long as P1. So the question is, "how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1?" which would be 0.36 times, so the answer is A.

Alternatively, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the proportionality.

Let me think: K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) * (1/P^(1/3)).

But both M_p and M_* are same for both planets. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3).

So, K1 = C / P1^(1/3)

K2 = C / P2^(1/3)

So, K1/K2 = (C / P1^(1/3)) ) / (C / P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

We have K1 =5, K2=7 → K1/K2 =5/7

So,

(5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Cubing both sides:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1 → 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So planet 2's period is about 0.36 times that of planet 1. So the period of planet 2 is shorter, meaning it's not longer. So when the question asks how many times longer is planet 2's period than planet 1's, the answer is 0.36 times, which is option A.

So the correct answer is A) ~0.36.


The problem involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, given their respective radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitudes. Both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and both planets have masses similar to Neptune. The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), i.e., \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \). This relationship arises because the RV method measures the star's velocity, which depends on the orbital period and the gravitational interaction with the planet.

For planet #1 and planet #2, the RV semi-amplitudes are \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), respectively. Since \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \), the ratio of the periods can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.
