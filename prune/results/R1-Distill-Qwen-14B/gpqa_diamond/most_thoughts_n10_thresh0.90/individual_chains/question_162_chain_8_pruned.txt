Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me think through this.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. I remember that metrics can describe different kinds of spaces, like spheres or hyperboloids. So, the form of this metric might tell me what kind of surface we're dealing with.

Let me write it out again to visualize better. The ds² is a function of x and y multiplied by (dx² + dy²). The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), and the numerator is 32. So the coefficient is 32/(4 - r²) where r² is x² + y². Oh, that makes it a function of r, the radial coordinate in 2D.

Wait, when I see a metric like this, it reminds me of the metric for a sphere. For a sphere of radius a, the line element in 2D would be something like (dr² + r² dθ²) / a², but this is different. Alternatively, I remember that the metric for a hyperbolic space can sometimes have a similar form but with a negative curvature.

Wait, another thought. Pseudosphere usually refers to a surface with constant negative curvature, right? Like a tractricoid. The metric for a pseudosphere in 2D would have a specific form. Let me recall. The metric for hyperbolic space in coordinates can be written as ds² = dr² + (a^2 / cosh²(r/a)) dθ² or something similar. But here, the form is (32/(4 - r²))(dx² + dy²), which looks a bit different.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the form of the metric for a sphere. For a sphere of radius a, the metric in polar coordinates would have a term like (a²/(a² - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²), but that's in 3D. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with 2D and 3D metrics.

Alternatively, I remember that the metric for a 2D sphere can be written in a different coordinate system, perhaps. Wait, but the denominator here is (4 - x² - y²) which can be written as 4
