Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics question about density matrices. Let's see... I remember that a density matrix is used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I need to think carefully.

The question gives me a specific density matrix:

ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)

I need to find its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are labeled A to D with different r vectors, but I'm not exactly sure how these relate to the density matrix.

Wait, I remember that a qubit can be represented as a point in a 2D Bloch sphere. The density matrices for qubits are 2x2 positive semi-definite matrices with trace 1. But how does this relate to the options given? The options are 3D points, which is confusing because a qubit is 2D. Hmm, maybe the question is using some kind of vector representation in 3D space.

Let me think about the general form of a density matrix for a qubit. It can be written as:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2

Where I is the identity matrix, r is a 3D vector, and σ are the Pauli matrices. The vector r determines the direction and magnitude of the qubit state on the Bloch sphere. So for a pure state |ψ⟩, r would have a magnitude of 1, but for a mixed state, r would be shorter. Wait, but in this case, the given ρ is a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩. Let's compute what r would be.

The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let's expand this. Each |i⟩⟨i| is a projector. So, |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]] and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ is (1/2) I. 

Wait, so ρ = (I)/2. If I plug this into the general form, ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. Let's solve for r·σ. 

Multiply both sides by 2: 2ρ = I = I + r·σ. Subtracting I from both sides gives 0 = r·σ. So r·σ is the zero matrix. 

But σ here are the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So r·σ = r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z. For this sum to equal zero, each component must be zero. So r_x, r_y, r_z must all be zero. So r is (0,0,0).

Wait a second, that's one of the options. Option C is (0,0,0). So the geometrical position is at the origin in the Bloch sphere, which makes sense because the state is completely mixed. A completely mixed state in a qubit is equivalent to having no information, so it's at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Let me double-check. If a density matrix is ρ = I/2, it's maximally mixed. The Bloch vector for such a state is zero, meaning it's at the center. So its position in the 3D space (the Bloch sphere) would be (0,0,0), which is option C.


The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten using the general form of a single-qubit density matrix:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \vec{r} \cdot \vec{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\vec{r}\) is a 3D vector, and \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. Comparing the given \(\rho\) with the general form, we see that:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

This implies that \(\vec{r} \cdot \vec{\sigma} = 0\), meaning all components of \(\vec{r}\) (i.e., \(r_x\), \(r_y\), and \(r_z\)) must be zero. Therefore, the Bloch vector \(\vec{r}\) is \((0,0,0)\), indicating that the state is at the center of the Bloch sphere. This corresponds to a maximally mixed state, which has no directional preference and is completely depolarized.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is \((0,0,0)\), which matches option C.

Answer: C
