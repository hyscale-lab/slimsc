Okay, so I have this astronomy question to tackle. Let me read it carefully. The question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. 

Hmm, the key here is understanding the brightness limits for each spectrograph. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, and HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, any star that is brighter than 17 mag can be seen by ESPRESSO, but HIRES can only see down to 16 mag. So, the star's apparent V magnitude must be <=17 for ESPRESSO and <=16 for HIRES. Wait, no, wait. The question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO, but in astronomy, brighter means lower magnitude. So, if a star has V magnitude less than 17, it's brighter and can be observed by ESPRESSO. Similarly, for HIRES, it's brighter than 16, meaning V <16.

Wait, wait wait. Let me think again. The way magnitude works is that lower magnitudes are brighter. So, "brighter than 17 mag" would mean apparent V magnitude less than 17. So, for a star to be detectable by ESPRESSO, its V must be <17. For HIRES, V must be <16.

So the same star must satisfy both conditions. That is, V must be <16 because HIRES requires a brighter star. Because if a star is visible by HIRES (V <16), it's automatically brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can also see it. So the more restrictive condition is the HIRES limit of V <16.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question is which stars can be detected by both. So the star must be bright enough for both. So the star's V must be less than 17 (for ESPRESSO) and less than 16 (for HIRES). So the combined condition is V <16, because that's the stricter condition. So any star with apparent V magnitude less than 16 can be detected by both.

But wait, for some stars, the apparent magnitude depends on their distance and absolute magnitude,
