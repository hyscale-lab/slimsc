Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit, given certain parameters. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

So, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with a higher probability of transiting because that's more likely to happen. They have limited time, so they need to pick the better bet.

Both planets have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Wait, so Planet_1's period is shorter—so it's closer to its star because orbital period is related to distance via Kepler's third law. Right, shorter period means closer orbit.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radius because Planet_2's star is slightly evolved but their radii are equal. Interesting. So, even though Planet_1's star is more massive, they have the same radius. So, higher mass but same radius as Planet_2's star.

Now, I need to figure out the transit probability for each planet. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the planet's orbital distance.

The formula for the transit probability is roughly (R_planet + R_star) / a_planet, but wait, no, more precisely, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a_planet) * (something else?), or maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, the transit probability (P) is given by the ratio of the size of the planet plus the star (but since the planet is much smaller, it's approx R_star) to the orbital distance (a). So P ≈ (R_p + R_s) / a. But more accurately, it's (R_p + R_s) / a, but since R_p << R_s, it's approximately R_s / a. But wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me think again.

Oh right, the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star to the area that the planet can cover. Wait, no, the area-based approach is for the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. The actual probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's roughly R_star / a_planet. But wait, no, that can't be. Because the distance is much larger than the star's radius, the probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the orbital distance, divided by something else.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is (R_star / a_planet) squared? No, that doesn't seem right. Let me try to remember. So, the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star (as seen from Earth) to the area of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, that's not exactly correct. I think the transit probability is (R_star / a_planet) times some factor.

Alternatively, I remember that the geometric probability
