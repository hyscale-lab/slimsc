Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking me to find the energy of the collider so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formulas involved here. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to figure out what the nucleus X is. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium nucleus has 3 protons and usually 4 neutrons, making it Li-7. But here, it's Li with 3 neutrons, so that would be Li-6 because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6, so it's a Li-6 nucleus.

Now, the problem is about relativistic speeds. The speed is given as 0.96c, so I probably need to use the relativistic energy equations. I remember that the total energy of a particle is gamma times its rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity.

Gamma is calculated using the formula gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me plug in v = 0.96c. So v squared is (0.96)^2 c², which is 0.9216 c². So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28, since 0.28² is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. Yep, that's right. So gamma is 1/0.28 which is approximately 3.57142857... Let me write it as 3.5714286 for more precision.

Now, the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The rest mass energy E_rest is m*c². But what is the mass m of Li-6? I need the atomic mass of Li-6. I think the atomic mass is approximately the same as the mass number in nucleons for heavier elements. Wait, no, the atomic mass isn't exactly the mass number. Because the mass of a nucleus is actually a bit less due to binding energy, but since we're dealing with relativistic energies, maybe we can approximate using the mass number. Hmm, but perhaps using the actual atomic mass would be better.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The mass of the nucleus can be found using the atomic mass of the isotope. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.01222159 u (atomic mass units). Wait, I might need this value
