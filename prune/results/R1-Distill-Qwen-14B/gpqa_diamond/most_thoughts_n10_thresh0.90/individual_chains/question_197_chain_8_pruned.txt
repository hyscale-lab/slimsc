Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's all about. The question is about identifying the product formed when compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Clemmensen reduction. That reaction usually reduces ketones to alkanes, right? So the starting material must have a ketone group.

Looking at the IR and NMR data for compound X. Let's break it down. The IR data shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1. That broad range suggests maybe an alcohol or an acid, but wait, wait—if it's a carbonyl, maybe stretching from a ketone or an ester. Oh, wait, the IR also has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, possibly a ketone or an ester. But wait, the other peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be from aromatic rings, maybe C=C stretching.

The NMR data is given. Let's go through it. The 1H NMR has several signals:

- 10.5 ppm, broad singlet, 1H. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehyde protons usually appear around 9-10 ppm. Or maybe it's an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. Wait, but in a carboxylic acid, the proton is usually around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak. But wait, in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, which makes me think it's a carboxylic acid proton. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a strong IR peak around 2500-3300 for the O-H stretch. The IR shows 3400–2500 cm-1, which could be a broad O-H stretch. So if compound X has a carboxylic acid group, then the IR would have a broad peak in that region. But wait, the IR given is 3400–2500, which I think might be an aldehyde's stretch? Or maybe an alcohol. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone and an aromatic ring.

Wait, but wait another thing. The 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl, like a ketone or ester. If it's a ketone, the IR wouldn't show a broad O-H. But the 3400-2500 cm-1 is a broad region, perhaps an alcohol or maybe an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet. For a carboxylic acid, that would make sense because the -COOH proton is usually a broad peak around 10 ppm. So maybe compound X has a carboxylic acid group. But then, if it's reacting with red phosphorus and HI, which is the Clemmensen reagent, but Clemmensen is for ketones. If it's a carboxylic acid, perhaps that's not the case. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the carbonyl is an ester, but then the IR would have a peak around 1720, which is typical for esters. But again, the IR's 3400–2500 cm-1 might indicate an O-H stretch for an alcohol or acid.

Wait, but if the compound has an aldehyde group, the IR would have a peak around 2820 and 2720 cm-1 for the aldehyde C-H stretches. But the given IR doesn't show those. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone with some other functional groups.

Let's look at the NMR again. The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, 1H. Then, aromatic protons: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like two doublets, suggesting a para-substituted aromatic ring. So maybe it's a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. For example, a benzene ring with two substituents: one in the para position of another group.

Then we have a 2.9 ppm multiplet for 1H, 1.7 ppm multiplet for 2H, 1.4 ppm doublet for 3H, and 0.9 ppm triplet for 3H. So that's a chain of carbons. Let's think about that. The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 3H suggests a CH2CH2CH3 group, perhaps. Wait, the triplet usually comes from coupling with two adjacent protons. Like in a CH2CH2CH3 group, the end CH3 is a triplet because the adjacent CH2 has two protons.

So putting that together: maybe a butyl group. Let me think. The 1.4 ppm doublet for 3H suggests a CH(CH3) group, perhaps. Because the doublet implies coupling with one adjacent proton. So if it's a CH group with a CH3 attached, like in isobutyl group.

Wait, let's piece this together. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be a CH group connected to another CH2. Then the 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be a CH2 group attached to that CH. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) would be a CH3 attached to a CH, making it a CH(CH3). The 0.9 ppm triplet would be the terminal CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, so let me think
