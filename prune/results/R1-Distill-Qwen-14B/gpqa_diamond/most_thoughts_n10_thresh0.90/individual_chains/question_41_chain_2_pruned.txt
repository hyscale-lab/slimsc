Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light passing through a moving glass. Hmm, let me try to think this through step by step.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. What's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

The options are A, B, C, D. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember what I learned about relativity and how light behaves in different frames.

Wait, so the glass is moving. I think about how different observers perceive the speed of light. Oh right, Einstein's postulate says that the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames. So no matter how fast the source is moving, the speed of light observed is still c (which is 1 in this case). But wait, here the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, and toward the observer?

Wait, no, the glass is moving at velocity v toward the observer. So the observer is in the lab frame, and the glass is moving towards them. But the light is going through the glass, same direction as the beam, which is toward the observer.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me visualize this: the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. So if the light beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer as well. But the glass is the medium through which the light is propagating.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer (so, same direction as the beam). Hmm, that's a bit tricky.

So, in the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is c/n, right? Because the index of refraction n is c divided by the speed of light in the medium. So v_light_medium = c/n.

But when the glass is moving, how does that affect the speed of light observed in the lab frame?

Wait, no. The speed of light in the medium is c/n regardless of the medium's motion. But according to special relativity, the speed of light in any inertial frame is c. So whether the glass is moving or not, the speed of light in the lab frame should still be c. But wait, that's only when the light is in a vacuum, right? Or does it apply when the light is in a medium?

Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's think again. If the medium is moving, does that affect the speed of light as measured in the lab frame?

Wait, in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at v_light = c/n. Now, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So we need to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab frame.

But according to Einstein's theory, the speed of light in any inertial frame is c. So regardless of the medium's motion, the observer in the lab should see the light moving at c. But wait, that's only if the light is in a vacuum. Because when the medium is moving, the light's speed might change in other frames.

No, wait a minute. I'm getting mixed up here. The speed
