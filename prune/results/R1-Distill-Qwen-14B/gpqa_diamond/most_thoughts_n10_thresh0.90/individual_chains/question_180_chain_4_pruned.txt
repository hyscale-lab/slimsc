Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. The mass is negligible, so I probably don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, so I think this is an electrostatic potential energy problem. Since all the charges are the same, they're either all positive or all negative. The 13th charge is fixed, and the 12 are around it. Wait, but the 12 are fixed at 2 meters from P. So the setup is like a central charge with 12 others around it, maybe in a sphere or something, but the exact arrangement might not matter because we're dealing with potential energy between each pair.

Wait, but wait. How do I calculate the potential energy of a system of charges? I remember that the potential energy of a system of point charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. And since the system is isolated, I can ignore any external fields or anything.

Because the charges are identical and we're looking for the configuration with the least potential energy, right? Wait, but how do you find the minimum energy? Hmm. Wait, for like charges, they repel each other. So arranging them as close as possible would lower the potential energy, but wait, wait. Wait, no: putting like charges close together increases the potential energy. Because the potential energy between two positive charges is positive when you bring them closer. Because you have to do work against their repulsion. So to minimize the potential energy, perhaps I need to arrange them as far apart as possible? Oh wait, but the problem says 12 are constrained at 2m from P, so I canâ€™t move them. So all the 12 are at 2m from P, and the 13th is at P. So maybe I need to calculate the potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12, and also among the 12 themselves.

Wait, but the 12 are at a fixed distance from P, so their positions relative to each other may vary, but the problem doesn't specify. Wait, but since the problem gives no information about their arrangement beyond their distance from P, perhaps we can assume they're all at the same position? No, wait, that can't be right because then they would be on top of each other. But perhaps the problem assumes that all 12 are at the same point at 2m from P, but that would mean they're all at the same spot, which is not possible for point charges. So maybe they're arranged on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m, each at a point on the sphere. But for the purposes of calculating potential energy, maybe the exact arrangement of the 12 charges among themselves doesn't matter because we're considering each pair's contribution. Wait, but the potential energy between multiple charges is the sum of each pair's potential energy. So for the 12 charges, each pair among them contributes to the
