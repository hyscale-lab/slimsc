Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

So the question is about a star that's similar in radius to the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. The scenario is that these spots make the star's brightness vary as it rotates, and this variation looks similar to what we'd see if there were an exoplanet transiting the star. The task is to find out what the radius of such a planet would need to be to produce the same amplitude in the light curve as these spots do.

Hmm, I think I need to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots to that of a planet. So first, I should calculate the change in brightness due to the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same change.

I remember that the flux from a star is proportional to the surface area times the temperature to the fourth power. Wait, no, actually, the Stefan-Boltzmann law says that the power emitted per unit area (flux) is sigma * T^4, where sigma is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So, the total flux from the star without any spots would be the surface area of the star multiplied by sigma * Teff^4. But when there are spots, part of the surface is cooler, so the total flux changes.

The star has a radius Rstar, same as the Sun's. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, a hemisphere is half the star's surface. So one hemisphere is 50% of the total area. The spots are 20% of that hemisphere, so the spot area is 0.2 * (0.5 * 4πRstar²) )? Wait, no, the star's total surface area is 4πRstar². A hemisphere is 2πRstar². So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2πRstar² = 0.4π Rstar².

So the spots cover 0.4π Rstar². But wait, I'm not sure if the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * area of the hemisphere. That's correct.

Now, the star's total flux without spots is F0 = sigma * Teff^4 * 4π Rstar². But when spots are present, the flux is F = F0 - (F_spot * area of spots) + (F_cool * area of spots). Wait, no, the spots are cooler, so their flux is lower. So the flux from the star when spots are visible would be F = F0 - (F_spot - F_unspot) * area of spots.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the ratio of the flux with spots to without, and see what the brightness variation is.

The flux without any spots is F0 = sigma * T^4 * (4π R²) ). When the spots are visible, the flux is F = sigma * T^4 * (4π R²
