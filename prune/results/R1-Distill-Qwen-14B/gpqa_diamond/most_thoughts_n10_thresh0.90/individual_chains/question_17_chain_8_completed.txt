Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution with EDTA. Hmm, I remember EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds to metal ions like calcium. The question says the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K, is 5x10^10. They ask what the concentration of free calcium ions is. 

Wait, formation constant. Right, the formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). 

So in this problem, the solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. Assuming that the pH is ideal, which probably means that EDTA is in its active form (Y^4-), so I don't have to worry about protonation or other forms of EDTA. 

Let me think about the initial situation. The complex is at 0.02 M, and the solution is in equilibrium. So initially, I might think that all the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex. But wait, no, because the complex can dissociate a little. So the [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M, and we need to find [Ca²+].

The formation constant equation should be Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Since Kf is so large (5e10), that suggests that the complex is very stable, so [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] should be very small. 

But wait, in this solution, the only source of Ca²+ is the dissociation of the CaEDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, but some of it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. Let me let x be the concentration of Ca²+ produced. Then, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x, assuming that each dissociation gives one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

So the complex's concentration would be 0.02 - x. But wait, wait, because when the complex dissociates, the amount of complex decreases by x, so [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x. But given that Kf is so large, the dissociation x would be very small compared to 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. That would make the math easier. 

So plugging into the equation: 
Kf = (0.02) / (x * x) = 5e10. 
So 0.02 / x² = 5e10. 
Rearranging, x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 2e-12 → x = sqrt(2e-12) → sqrt(2) is about 1.414, so x ≈ 1.414e-6. 

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me check the options again. Option C is 6.3e-7, which is about half of what I got. Oh, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 / x² = 5e10 → x² = (2e-2)/(5e10) = 2/(5e12) → 2/(5) is 0.4, so 0.4e-12 → 4e-13. So x = sqrt(4e-13) → 2e-6.5? Wait, no: sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, no,  sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5. Let me compute that: 10^-6.5 is about 3.16e-7, so 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7. Oh, that's about 6.3e-7. Which matches option C. So maybe I messed up the exponents earlier.

Wait, let's compute x again properly. 0.02 is 2e-2. 

So x squared is (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 → (0.4) * 1e-12 → 4e-13. So x is sqrt(4e-13) → 2e-6.5. Because sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is approx 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7. Which is about 6.3e-7 M, matching option C.

So the answer should be option C. 

Wait, but why did I think earlier that x would be 1.4e-6? Oh, I think I made a miscalculation in the exponents. Let me double-check. 

Yes, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. Sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is approximately 6.3e-7. So yeah, option C is correct.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The equilibrium reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The formation constant is given by:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Let the concentration of dissociated \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) be \(x\). Since the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, the concentration of \(\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}\) is approximately \(0.02 - x\). Given that \(K_f\) is very large, \(x\) will be negligible compared to 0.02, so we approximate \([CaEDTA^{2-}] \approx 0.02\).

Substituting into the equation:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}
\]

Since \(10^{-6.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-7}\), we find:

\[
x \approx 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7}\) M, which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
