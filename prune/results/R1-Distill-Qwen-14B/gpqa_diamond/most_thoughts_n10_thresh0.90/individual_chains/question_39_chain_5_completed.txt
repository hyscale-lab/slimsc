Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The problem says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle that's under the same conditions. Each particle can move along a tube, which is along the x-axis. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, where i is the square root of -1. When they measured the position of the particles, none were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So they're all found between x=1 and x=3.

The question is asking for the numerical value of 'a'. The options are A) 1.1, B) 0.85, C) 0.35, D) 0.6.

Hmm. Okay, so I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. So the wave function must be normalized because the total probability should be 1.

Wait, the wave function given is a function of x. The form is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. But wait, that doesn't look like a typical wave function. Usually, when I've seen wave functions, they're in the form of a real part and an imaginary part. Oh wait, but the wave function can be complex. But when calculating probabilities, it's the modulus squared that matters.

So the modulus squared of the wave function is [ (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2 ] because the imaginary part is 0.5i, whose square modulus is (0.5)^2. So the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but wait a second. The wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So when calculating the modulus squared, we take the real part squared plus the imaginary part squared. So that would be [a^2/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. So modulus^2 is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, that's the probability density. The integral of the modulus squared over all space should be 1 because of normalization.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, when they measured the particles, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is zero outside this interval, and the integral of the modulus squared from x=1 to x=3 must be 1.

Wait, no, I think the question is saying that when they made the measurements, all the particles were found between x=1 and x=3. That implies that the wave function is zero outside that region. So the wave function only exists between x=1 and x=3, and is zero elsewhere. So the wave function is non-zero only in that region, so that's where the integral for normalization would be applied.

So, the wave function is zero outside 1 and 3. But the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So within x=1 to x=3, this is the form.

Wait, but wait. The wave function can't be zero just because we didn't find any particles outside. That's not how wave functions work. The wave function is zero outside the allowed region if the particle is confined, but in this case, the problem states that the measurements show no particles outside x=1 and x=3. So perhaps the wave function is zero outside, and non-zero inside.

Alternatively, maybe the given wave function is the actual one, and the probabilities are non-zero only between 1 and 3. So the modulus squared is non-zero between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. Therefore, the integral of |psi|^2 from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1.

So the modulus squared is |psi|^2 = [a/sqrt(1+x)]^2 + (0.5)^2. So that's a²/(1+x) + 0.25. But wait, that's the probability density. So integrating this from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1.

But wait, wait. That can't be right because if the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, then the modulus squared would be [ (a / sqrt(1+x)) ]^2 + (0.5)^2. So the integral is ∫ (a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ) dx from 1 to 3 equals 1.

But wait, wait a minute. That might not make sense because the wave function's modulus squared is a sum of two terms. Let me think again. So if the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, then ψ*(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. So the modulus squared is ψ*(x) * ψ(x) = [ (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 ] because the cross terms (the imaginary parts) would involve i^2 which is -1, but wait, no. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, actually, ψ(x) = A + Bi, where A = a/sqrt(1+x), B is -0.5. Then ψ*(x) = A - Bi. So ψ*ψ = (A + Bi)(A - Bi) = A² + (B)^2. So modulus squared is A² + B².

In this case, A is a/sqrt(1+x), B is -0.5. So modulus squared is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So the integral of (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1, because the wave function is normalized.

Wait, but let me check the integral. Let's compute the integral.

So, integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx.

The integral of a²/(1+x) dx is a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3, which becomes a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

The integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

I can compute that. Let me compute ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So, a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a = sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I make any mistakes in the setup?

Wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be normalized, so the integral of |psi|^2 dx must equal 1.

Wait, but if the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, then the modulus squared is (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2, as I said earlier. So integrating this from 1 to 3 gives the total probability, which must be 1.

So the integral becomes a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 + 0.25*(3-1) = a² ln(4/2) + 0.5.

Which is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Yes, that's correct. So a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.721. So a is sqrt(0.721) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

So the correct answer is option B) 0.85.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function is given as \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \). The probability density is proportional to the modulus squared of the wave function, which is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

Since the wave function is normalized, the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over the interval \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \) must equal 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

Breaking this into two terms:

1. The integral of \( \frac{a^2}{1+x} \) from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \) is:
   \[
   a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = a^2 \ln(1+x) \Big|_1^3 = a^2 [\ln(4) - \ln(2)] = a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. The integral of \( 0.25 \) from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \) is:
   \[
   0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 0.25 (3 - 1) = 0.5.
   \]

Adding these results, the total integral becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849.
\]

Thus, \( a \approx 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
