Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let me try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Hmm. I remember that metrics are used to measure distances in spacetime or curved spaces, right? So in this case, it's probably a 2-dimensional metric since there are dx² and dy² terms.

Wait, pseudosphere? Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. But wait, the term can sometimes refer to different things. Oh, wait, another thought: in some contexts, a pseudosphere might be a hyperbolic space, which is non-Euclidean with negative curvature. So the area of a pseudosphere with radius r probably relates to the hyperbolic area.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Let me think about the formula for the area of a sphere in different geometries. In Euclidean space, the area is 4πr². But for a pseudosphere, which is hyperbolic, the formula is different, right?

Wait, no, wait. Maybe I should consider the metric given and compute the area from that. Because the metric is provided, perhaps I don't need to recall the general formula. The area can be found by integrating over the space, but maybe there's a smarter way.

So the metric is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let's see. It's conformally flat because it's a scalar multiple of the Euclidean metric (dx² + dy²). The function in front is the conformal factor, which tells us about the curvature.

The area element in such a metric is dA = (32 / (4 - x² - y²)) dx dy. Wait, no, wait. The area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since this is a diagonal metric, g is the product of the coefficients of dx² and dy². Both are multiplied by the same factor, so g = [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². Wait no, wait. Actually, the metric tensor is diag[32/(4−x²−y²), 32/(4−x²−y²)]. The determinant is the product of the diagonal elements, so sqrt(g) would be [32/(4−x²−y²)].

Wait, no. Wait, the area element in a 2D metric is sqrt(g_xy) dx dy, where g_xy is the determinant. Here, the metric tensor is diagonal, so g_xy = (32/(4−x²−y²)) * (32/(4−x²−y²)) ) = (32)^2 / (4−x²−y²)^2. Therefore, sqrt(g) is 32/(4−x²−y²). So the area element is dA = [32/(4−x²−y²)] dx dy.

But wait, what are the limits of x and y? Because the metric has 4−x²−y² in the denominator, that term must be positive to have real distances. So 4−x²−y² >0 → x² + y² <4. So the domain of x and y is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin. So the area would be the integral over x and y such that x² + y² <4, of [32/(4−x²−y²)] dx dy.

So to find the area, I need to compute the double integral over x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - r²)] dr dθ, where r is the radial coordinate (since it's symmetric, polar coordinates would help).

Wait, right. Let me switch to polar coordinates. x² + y² = r², so dx dy = r dr dθ. So the integral becomes:

Area = ∫ (θ from 0 to 2π) ∫ (r from 0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Factor out constants and separate the integrals:

Area = 32 * ∫0^{2π} dθ ∫0^2 [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

Compute the θ integral first: ∫0^{2π} dθ = 2π.

So Area = 32 * 2π * ∫0^2 [ r/(4−r²) ] dr.

Now compute the r integral. Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → (-1/2) du = r dr.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=4−4=0. So the integral becomes:

∫ [r/(4−r²)] dr from 0 to 2 = ∫ (1/u) [ (-1/2) du ] from u=4 to u=0.

Which is (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du from 4 to 0.

But integrating 1/u is ln|u|. So:

(-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] = (-1/2) [ (-infty) - ln4 ].

Wait, but ln(0) is negative infinity. So let's think about the limits. The substitution gives:

∫ from r=0→2 → u=4→0. So integral becomes:

∫ (from u=4 to u=0) (1/u) * (-1/2) du = (-1/2) ∫ from 4 to 0 (1/u) du = (-1/2) [ ln(u) from 4 to 0 ].

Which is (-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ) ] = (-1/2) [ (-infty) - ln4 ] = (-1/2) * (-infty - finite) → positive infinity? Wait, because ln(0) is -infty, so ln(0) - ln(4) is -infty - finite = -infty. Multiply by (-1/2), you get positive infty.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because the area can't be infinite. Did I make a mistake in substitution?

Wait, let me recheck the substitution.

The integral is ∫ [ r/(4−r²) ] dr from 0 to 2.

Let u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → (r dr) = (-du/2).

So the integral becomes ∫ [ 1/u ] * ( - du/2 ) as r goes from 0 to 2, which translates to u going from 4 to 0.

So ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of (1/u) (-du/2) = (1/2) ∫ from u=0 to u=4 of (1/u) du.

Ah, because switching the limits from 4 to 0 to 0 to 4 removes the negative sign. So it's (1/2) ∫ from 0 to4 (1/u) du.

But wait, the integral of 1/u from 0 to4 is divergent. Because as u approaches zero, 1/u goes to infinity. So the integral diverges to infinity.

Wait, that would imply that the area is infinite, which would suggest the area is infinity. Looking back at the options, option D is +infty.

But that's a bit confusing. The pseudosphere's area being infinite? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, let me think again. The metric given is for a 2-dimensional surface, so perhaps it's a model of hyperbolic space. Because in hyperbolic space, the area of a sphere (well, in 2D, the length of a circle) is 2πr, but here it's about the entire space's area.

Wait, no, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is for a pseudosphere, and we're to compute the area of the surface.

Wait, maybe the metric is for the entire pseudosphere, but in that case, the area would be finite. Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is for a finite area.

Wait, perhaps I should reconsider the integral. Because the denominator 4−x²−y² can be written as 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4 ), which is 4(1 - r²/4). So 4−x²−y² = (4 − r²) = 4(1 - (r²/4)).

Wait, but that doesn't change the fact that as r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, making the integrand go to infinity. So the integral is ∫ [32/(4−r²)] * r dr from 0 to2. Let me compute it again.

Let me compute the integral ∫ (r dr)/(4−r²).

Let me make substitution u = 4 − r² → du = -2r dr → - (du/2) = r dr.

So ∫ [ r dr / (4−r²) ] = ∫ ( - du/(2u) ) = (-1/2) ln|u| + C.

So evaluating from r=0 → u=4, r=2 → u=0.

So the integral becomes (-1/2)[ ln(0) - ln(4) ] = (-1/2) [ (-infty) - ln4 ] = (-1/2)(-infty - ln4) → which is (1/2) (infty + ln4) → which is infty.

So the integral diverges. Therefore, the area is infinite. So the answer would be option D, +infty.

But wait, that seems counterintuitive. A pseudosphere (which is a surface in hyperbolic geometry) should have finite area, right? Or perhaps I'm confusing pseudosphere with something else.

Wait, another thought: a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, but it's a finite area surface. The metric given might not be that of a pseudosphere but of a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. Because the hyperbolic plane is unbounded, its total area is infinite.

Wait, but the question says "the pseudosphere of radius r=2." So perhaps I'm conflating the hyperbolic plane with the pseudosphere. The hyperbolic plane has infinite area, but a pseudosphere is a finite surface.

Wait, but perhaps in this context, the given metric is for a pseudosphere. Wait, the given metric is conformally flat, and it's defined in a disk of radius 2 (since x² + y² <4). So the domain is finite. But when you compute the area, the integral diverges because the conformal factor blows up at the boundary.

Hmm. So the area is infinite. So the answer would be D) +infty.

Wait, but why would the pseudosphere have an infinite area? Because, perhaps, the given metric is not for a pseudosphere but for some other space. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the area.

Wait, wait. Another approach: perhaps the metric is for a hyperbolic disk of radius 2, which would have an infinite area. But a pseudosphere is a finite area surface, like the tractricoid, which is a surface of revolution of a tractrix, and it has finite area.

So perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

Wait, the metric given is in 2D, so it's a 2-manifold. The question is about the area of the pseudosphere, but perhaps the given metric is for a hyperbolic disk, which indeed has infinite area.

Wait, but the problem states: "the pseudosphere of radius r=2." So perhaps the given metric is for a hyperbolic plane, and the area is infinite, so answer D.

Alternatively, maybe the pseudosphere as in the tractricoid has finite area, but in this case, the metric is for a different object.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric isn't a pseudosphere but a different surface. Let me think about the metric again.

The given metric is ds² = [32/(4−x²−y²)](dx² + dy²). Let's see what happens in polar coordinates. So ds² = [32/(4−r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). Hmm, the coefficient for
