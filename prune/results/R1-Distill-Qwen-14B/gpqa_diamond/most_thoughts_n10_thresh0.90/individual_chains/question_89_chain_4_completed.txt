Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The first part is about heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, specifically dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. So heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH should give an alkene. The product is a light yellow solid—makes sense because alkenes are usually less soluble and might be waxy or solid, depending on structure.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: 4.79 ppm (2H), which is probably a -CH2- group adjacent to something electronegative, like an oxygen. Wait, but KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's a diol? No, wait, if it's elimination, the product would be an alkene, which would have protons maybe in a different region. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Oh wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction forms a carbonyl compound. Oh because sometimes when dihalides are treated with strong bases, they can form ketones via a double dehydrohalogenation, especially if it's a vicinal dihalide. But wait, wait—if it's KOH in a high temperature, maybe it's more likely elimination to form an alkene. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide? Because I know that treating dihalides with a base can sometimes form epoxides. Wait, but for epoxide formation, the dihalide would be vicinal, and the base would abstract a beta proton, leading to the formation of an epoxide. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons? Wait, no, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. Are those adjacent? Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four fused cyclohexane rings. The positions 1 and 3 are actually on adjacent carbons because in adamantane, each carbon is connected in such a way that 1 and 3 are next to each other. So when KOH is added, it could form an epoxide. Because when you have a 1,2-dihalide, you can form an epoxide, but wait, our starting material is 1,3-dibromo. Wait, no—maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 1,2-dibromo structure. Wait, the name is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3, which in the structure would probably be vicinal—so adjacent.

So if two bromines are on adjacent carbons, then in the presence of a strong base like KOH, it's possible to form an epoxide. So the product after KOH would be an epoxide.

Looking at the NMR data: 4.79 ppm (2H). Epoxide protons usually appear around 3.5-4.5 ppm. So maybe that's the epoxide. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol. Wait, if KOH was in a different condition, like with water, perhaps it would hydrolyze to a diol, but KOH is a strong base. Wait, but heating with KOH—could it be elimination to form a double bond? Because when vicinal dihalides are treated with KOH, they eliminate to form alkenes. So perhaps the product is an alkene.

Wait, but the IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that suggests the product has a carbonyl group. So maybe it's a ketone.

Hmm, so how can a dihalide form a ketone? Oh, wait, maybe via a dehalogenation. Vicinal dihalides can lose two molecules of HX (like HBr) to form an alkene via elimination, or if a strong base is present, perhaps a double dehydrohalogenation occurs, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps when a dihalide is treated with a strong base, it can form a ketone via a peroxide or some kind of elimination. Wait, but maybe it's more likely that the base induces elimination to form an alkene, but the IR doesn't show a peak around 1650 cm-1 (which would be C=C). Instead, it's 1720, which is more like a carbonyl.

So perhaps the product is a ketone. How? Oh, wait, maybe it's a pinacol-like rearrangement. Wait, but pinacol rearrangement is for 1,2-diols, which upon dehydration form ketones. But in this case, we started with a dihalide, not a diol. Alternatively, perhaps some kind of elimination followed by some rearrangement.

Wait, another possibility: when a dihalide is treated with a strong base, it can form a carbene, but that's for geminal dihalides. Wait, no, this is 1,3-dibromo, which is vicinal, not geminal.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation twice, leading to a carbonyl group. Oh wait, I think I remember something about the formation of ketones from vicinal dihalides. When a vicinal dihalide is treated with a strong base, it can lose two equivalents of HX to form an alkene (as in dehydrohalogenation), but if the structure allows, it can form a carbonyl. How?

Wait, maybe via a mechanism where the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond, but then another elimination occurs with another HX. Wait, but that would form an alkene. Alternatively, could it form a ketone if the structure allows for a cyclic transition state? Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone, but that doesn't fit with the description. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bridged ketone. Wait, let me think about adamantane's structure. Adamantane has a structure where each bridgehead is a quaternary carbon. So if the dihalide is 1,3-dibromo, and upon elimination, perhaps the two bromines are removed, and a double bond forms between C1 and C3. But wait, those carbons are bridgehead carbons, which are usually not able to form double bonds due to Bredt's rule. So forming a double bond there would be difficult. Therefore, maybe the reaction doesn't form a double bond but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the base causes the dihalide to undergo a nucleophilic substitution. Wait, but with KOH, which is a strong base, and heating, substitution is less likely unless it's a very good leaving group. But dibromide would need a good base for elimination, which is more likely.

But wait, the IR shows a carbonyl, so product 1 is a ketone. Maybe via a double elimination followed by a keto-enol tautomerism? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an enol, which then tautomerizes to a ketone.

Wait, but if the initial product is an enol, which tautomerizes to a ketone, then the NMR would show a carbonyl. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Claisen-like rearrangement, but that's usually for allyl vinyl ethers.

Wait, another angle: the NMR of product 1. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a methyl group next to an oxygen. Or perhaps a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative group, like O. But given that the IR has a carbonyl, maybe the 4.79 is a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, product 1 has a 1H NMR of 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Let's think about the structure.

If it's a ketone, then it's something like R-CO-R'. The CH2 at 4.79 could be next to the carbonyl. For example, maybe an acetone group, but in a more complex structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone, but that would complicate the NMR. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the product is a cyclopropane. No, that wouldn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. But with KOH, it's more likely elimination.

Wait, but maybe another reaction: the dihalide could undergo a coupling reaction, but I don't think KOH does that.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck on the first step. Let's try to proceed further and see if that helps.

The product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1 is a carbonyl compound, so perhaps it undergoes some kind of Friedel-Crafts reaction. But wait, product 1's structure is important here. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's undergoing some cyclopropanation or another reaction.

Wait, but let's think about the next step: product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl compounds. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into smaller fragments, each with carbonyl groups. Then, product 3 would have these carbonyl groups.

So, if product 3 is the result of ozonolysis, then product 2 must have an alkene. That suggests that product 1, when treated with aluminum isopropoxide, forms an alkene.

Wait, but product 1 was a ketone (due to IR), so how does it form an alkene when heated with aluminum isopropoxide? Maybe it's a dehydration reaction. If product 1 is a diol, then heating with a Lewis acid could cause it to lose water and form an alkene. But earlier, I thought product 1 is a ketone. Hmm, maybe I need to correct my earlier assumption.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. Because if 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, it could form an epoxide. Then, when product 1 (epoxide) is heated with Al(OiPr)3, which is a Lewis acid, it could open the epoxide. How? Epoxides can open under acidic conditions. So maybe the Al isopropoxide acts as an acid catalyst, causing the epoxide to open.

Wait, but let me think: epoxide ring-opening under acidic conditions typically leads to the formation of a carbocation, which can then undergo various reactions. If the epoxide is part of a bridged structure, the carbocation formed could lead to some rearrangement or ring-opening.

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide under acid catalysis would open, but I'm not exactly sure how that would proceed in this adamantane structure.

Wait, but let's put that aside for a moment. So product 2 is the result of product 1 heated with Al isopropoxide. If product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 has an alkene, perhaps product 2 is formed via some elimination.

Wait, maybe the epoxide is part of a structure that, under acid catalysis, loses a molecule to form a double bond. For example, if the epoxide is in a position where, upon acid treatment, a water is lost, leading to the formation of a double bond. So, perhaps product 2 is an alkene.

If product 2 is an alkene, then ozonolysis would break it into carbonyls. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups.

Now, back to product 1: let's think again. If the initial reaction with KOH forms an epoxide, then product 1 is an epoxide. The NMR of product 1 shows 4.79 (2H), which could be the two protons on the epoxide oxygen. The integration is 2H, so that makes sense. The other signals: 2.41-2.23 (10H) and 1.94 (2H). Those could be the protons on the adamantane structure. So perhaps the epoxide is formed at the bridgehead, but let's think about how that would look.

Now, when product 1 (epoxide) is heated with Al isopropoxide, which is a strong Lewis acid, it could protonate the epoxide oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then, perhaps a neighboring group could attack, leading to ring opening. But in adamantane, the structure is rigid, so the ring opening might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide ring opens to form a diol, but that doesn't create an alkene. Wait, but maybe under certain conditions, the diol could lose water to form an alkene.

Wait, if the epoxide opens to form a diol, and then under acid conditions, it undergoes elimination (like E1 or E2) to form an alkene. That would make product 2 an alkene. So, product 2 has a double bond.

Now, ozonolysis of product 2 (alkene) would cleave the double bond, forming carbonyl compounds. The ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

Now, the question is about the 1H NMR of product 3. Specifically, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom, excluding those that exchange with D2O.

In ozonolysis, the products are typically carbonyl compounds. So, product 3 might have ketones or aldehydes, depending on the structure of product 2.

But wait, the most deshielded proton in the NMR would typically be near an electronegative group, such as near a carbonyl. So perhaps it's on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl.

Let me think about the structure of product 2. If product 1 is an epoxide, then product 2 is an alkene. Let's assume the alkene is in a bridge position of adamantane.

When ozonolysis is done, the double bond is cleaved, and each resulting fragment gets an O from ozone. So, if the alkene was in a bridge, the ozonolysis would break the bridge, leading to two carbonyl groups on each fragment.

But perhaps in this specific case, the ozonolysis would result in two ketone groups attached to the adamantane structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis of the alkene in product 2 forms two carbonyl groups, each in a position that leads to specific coupling in the NMR.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try to think about the NMR of product 3, particularly the most deshielded proton.

If product 3 has a carbonyl group, the protons adjacent to it would be deshielded. For example, a CH2 group next to a ketone. The coupling pattern depends on the neighboring protons.

If a CH2 is next to a carbonyl, each of its protons would couple with the adjacent CH2 protons. Let's say the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R', then each CH2 would have two neighboring Hs, but wait, if it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, each CH2 proton would couple with the adjacent CH2 protons.

Wait, but the most deshielded proton would be the one closest to the carbonyl. Let's say the structure is R-CO-CH2-X. The CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would have two protons, each coupling with the other. So in the NMR, each would be a doublet. But wait, if each of those protons is also coupled with another set of protons, perhaps from another group.

Alternatively, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-Y, then each CH2 would couple with the next. The first CH2 (next to carbonyl) would have two protons, each coupling with the two on the adjacent CH2. So each would be a triplet.

Wait, but let me think about the splitting. Each proton in the first CH2 group would be split by the two protons in the adjacent CH2 group. So each would have a triplet pattern. But if there are more adjacent protons, like if the CH2 is next to another CH2 which is next to another CH2, the splitting can get more complex.

But in the case where the CH2 is next to another CH2, each proton would couple with two protons from the adjacent group. So each H would have a triplet (since n+1, where n=2). But if the adjacent CH2 is itself split by another group, the pattern could become a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but in the case of ozonolysis, the products would typically have carbonyl groups at the ends. So perhaps each end group has a CH2 next to the carbonyl. So each of those CH2 groups would have two Hs, each coupling with the neighboring Hs.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is something like two carbonyl groups with CH2 groups attached. So, maybe each carbonyl is connected to a CH2 group. If each CH2 is next to another CH2, then each H in the CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent group, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to another CH2, which is next to another CH2 with neighboring Hs, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, but in the ozonolysis product, the CH2 groups would be at the end, so each CH2 would only have one adjacent CH2 group. So each H in the CH2 next to the carbonyl would couple with two Hs from the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Wait, so each H in the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would have a triplet.

But the question is about the most deshielded hydrogen. The most deshielded would be the one closest to the electronegative group, like the carbonyl. So, the Hs on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be more deshielded than others.

So in their NMR, each of these Hs would be a triplet. But wait, the options include 'triplet of triplets' and 'doublet of triplets' as possibilities. So maybe there's another coupling involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 next to the carbonyl is adjacent to another group with Hs, leading to more splitting.

Wait, maybe the CH2 next to the carbonyl is part of a larger structure. Suppose the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-Y. Then, the Hs on the first CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, giving a triplet. But if the adjacent CH2 is itself split, perhaps into a doublet, then the overall splitting could be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the H next to the carbonyl is coupled with two sets of Hs: from the adjacent CH2 and from another group, leading to a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, if the H is not only coupled with the adjacent CH2 but also with another set of Hs elsewhere, such as from a bridge in adamantane, it could result in a more complex pattern.

Wait, but in the ozonolysis product, if each end has a carbonyl group, perhaps the structure has a central CH2 group connected to two carbonyls. So the CH2 would be between two carbonyl groups. Each H in that CH2 would couple with the two Hs on either side. Wait, but each adjacent CH2 would have two Hs.

Wait, but if the CH2 is between two carbonyl groups, then each H would be adjacent to two Hs on each side. Wait, no, each CH2 group would be -CO-CH2-CH2-CO-. So the middle CH2 would have two Hs, each adjacent to another CH2 group. So each H would be coupled with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group. So each H would have a triplet. But if they are also coupled with another group, like another CH2 further away, it could lead to a more complex pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs from one CH2 and another two from another, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the coupling is more like a doublet of triplets.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think of an example. Suppose the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O.

Wait, no, wait. Ozonolysis of a double bond typically gives carbonyl groups on each end. So if the alkene was between two CH2 groups, ozonolysis would give two carbonyls, each attached to a CH2. So the structure would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Ozonolysis of an alkene R-CH2-CH2-R' would give R-O and R'-O, but that's not right. Wait, no, ozonolysis cleaves the double bond and adds O groups. For a simple alkene like R-CH2-CH2-R', ozonolysis would produce R-CO and R'-CO (if the alkene is between two CH2 groups).

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. So if the alkene was in a position where ozonolysis would create two ketone groups, then product 3 would have two ketone groups.

In that case, the Hs adjacent to the ketones would be on CH2 groups. Each CH2 group would have two Hs, and each H would be coupled with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group. So each H would be a triplet.

But the question is about the most deshielded H. So perhaps the Hs closest to the carbonyl would be more deshielded. If each of those Hs is in a CH2 group that's next to another CH2 group, each would be a triplet.

But wait, the options don't have 'triplet' as the correct answer? Let me check the options:

Options:
A) triplet
B) triplet of triplets
C) doublet of triplets
D) pentet

So if the H is a triplet, option A is possible. But maybe I'm missing another coupling.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group is next to another CH2, which is next to another group. For example, the structure might be like:

CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO

In this case, the middle CH2 would be between two CH2 groups. Each H in the middle CH2 would couple with the two Hs on each adjacent CH2. So each H would have coupling with two groups, leading to a triplet from each, so the pattern would be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but this is getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 group is part of a larger system where each H is coupled with two Hs from one side and two from the other, leading to a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl are each coupled with two Hs from the same CH2 (which is not possible because they are on the same carbon) and another set from an adjacent group.

Wait, no, same carbon Hs don't split each other because they're equivalent and the splitting is usually between non-equivalent nuclei.

So each H on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would couple with the two Hs on the next CH2 group. So it would be a triplet.

But another possibility is that each H also couples with another H from a different part of the molecule, like a bridgehead proton, leading to more splitting.

Wait, but the question says to exclude protons that exchange with D2O. So they're probably not considering any acidic protons like -OH or -NH. So, assuming the most deshielded H is a CH2 next to a carbonyl.

So, if each H is split by two neighboring Hs, it's a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet, which is option A.

But wait, I'm not seeing why it would be more complex. Alternatively, perhaps the H is also coupled with another set of Hs, leading to a triplet of triplets.

If the H is coupled with two Hs from one group (triplet) and another two from another group (another triplet), then the overall pattern would be a triplet of triplets (option B).

Alternatively, if it's coupled with three Hs, it would be a quartet, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, but if the H is in a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 group, and that CH2 is adjacent to another group, perhaps a bridge, then each H in the CH2 would couple with two protons on the adjacent CH2 and perhaps another two from a different part, leading to more splitting.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. Based on the data given, the most logical conclusion is that the H is a triplet, so option A.


The problem involves a multi-step organic reaction sequence, and the goal is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in the final product (product 3) based on its 1H NMR spectrum. Here's the analysis:

1. **Step 1: Reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH**  
   - The starting material, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, reacts with KOH at 240°C. This is a vicinal dihalide, and KOH promotes elimination to form an alkene. However, the IR spectrum of product 1 shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O). This suggests that the reaction proceeds via a mechanism involving the formation of a ketone, likely through a double dehydrohalogenation followed by rearrangement or tautomerization.  
   - The 1H NMR spectrum of product 1 includes a signal at 4.79 ppm (2H), which could correspond to a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl group. The other signals (2.41-2.23 ppm and 1.94 ppm) likely correspond to the protons on the adamantane framework.

2. **Step 2: Reaction of product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide**  
   - Product 1 (likely a ketone) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, a strong Lewis acid. This step likely facilitates the formation of an alkene (product 2) through a dehydration or elimination reaction. The exact mechanism is not explicitly detailed, but the formation of an alkene is consistent with the subsequent ozonolysis step.

3. **Step 3: Ozonolysis of product 2**  
   - Ozonolysis involves cleavage of the double bond in product 2, forming product 3, which contains carbonyl groups. Ozonolysis typically converts alkenes into carbonyl compounds, such as ketones or aldehydes, depending on the structure of the starting alkene.

4. **Analysis of the 1H NMR spectrum of product 3**  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely a proton adjacent to a carbonyl group. In the NMR spectrum, the coupling pattern of this hydrogen depends on the number and arrangement of neighboring protons.  
   - If the hydrogen is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, it would couple with the two protons of the adjacent CH2 group, resulting in a triplet. However, if there is additional coupling with protons from another group, the pattern could become more complex, such as a triplet of triplets or a doublet of triplets.  
   - Based on the options provided and the reasoning, the most likely coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen is a **triplet**, as it corresponds to coupling with two equivalent protons from an adjacent CH2 group.

**Conclusion:** The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3 is a triplet. 

Answer: A
