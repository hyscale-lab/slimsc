Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The stability constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10.

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The EDTA is a ligand, and in this case, it's binding with calcium. The complex is Ca-EDTA, so the formula would probably be something like CaY^2- or CaEDTA^2-.

The problem says the solution is 0.02 M in the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But we're asked about the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

I think this involves the concept of the formation of a complex ion. The reaction should be something like:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-

But wait, I'm a bit confused about the charges. EDTA in its deprotonated form is usually Y^4-. So the reaction is Ca²+ + Y^4- → CaY^2-.

The stability constant, K, is given by the formula:

K = [CaY^2-] / ([Ca²+][Y^4-])

But wait, in this case, the problem gives the concentration of the complex as 0.02 M. So [CaY^2-] is 0.02 M. We need to find [Ca²+].

Hmm, but wait, what about the concentration of Y^4-? The EDTA can dissociate in solution, but in this problem, the pH is ideal, so I guess that the concentration of Y^4- isn't a concern because the pH is such that EDTA is fully deprotonated. So [Y^4-] would be... wait, but that's assuming that EDTA is in excess. Or maybe the solution is such that all EDTA is available as Y^4-.

Wait, but if we have 0.02 M CaY^2-, and assuming that the solution is such that EDTA is in excess, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the EDTA is in stoichiometric amounts with Ca. Hmm.

Wait, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So that suggests that the initial concentration is 0.02 M of the complex. But in solution, some of the complex might dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, but the question is about the concentration of Ca²+ in solution. So the complex [CaY^2-] is 0.02 M, but due to some dissociation, we have some free Ca²+ and EDTA. But the K is given, which is the stability constant. Since K is large (5e10), the complex is very stable, meaning that dissociation is minimal. So [Ca²+] should be very small.

Wait, but how do I calculate it? The K is given as 5e10, which is a very large value, indicating that the equilibrium lies heavily towards the complex. So the concentration of free Ca²+ and EDTA would be very low.

Let me think about the expression again:

K = [CaY^2-] / ( [Ca²+][Y^4-] )

We know K is 5e10, and [CaY^2-] is 0.02 M. But what about [Y^4-]? Hmm, because in the solution, the EDTA is part of the complex. If we start with only the complex, then initially, [CaY^2-] is 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [Y^4-] are zero, but that can't be. Wait, no, because when the complex dissociates, it produces Ca²+ and Y^4-.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is assuming that the EDTA is in excess, so that the concentration of Y^4- is approximately constant. Wait, but in this problem, we are given the concentration of the complex, and not the total EDTA concentration.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is that the concentration of Ca²+ is equal to the concentration of the complex divided by the stability constant. Because if [Y^4-] is much larger than [Ca²+], but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think of the solution. Let me denote:
Let’s let the concentration of free Ca²+ be x. Then, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x, because for
