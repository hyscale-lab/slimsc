Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativistic mechanics, but let's try to think it through.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So, the natural lithium isotope is Li-7, which has 3 neutrons. So X is Li-7, which has a mass number A = 7. That means the mass of the nucleus is the mass of a Li-7 nucleus.

Now, the question is about relativistic energy. So I think I need to calculate the total energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Oh wait, right, gamma is the factor by which time dilates or lengths contract.

So, v is 0.96c. Let me compute gamma first. Plugging in v = 0.96c:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)
Let me calculate (0.96)^2. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... Hmm, sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, let me double-check that because 0.28 * 3.5714 is approximately 1. So yes, gamma is about 3.5714.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me make sure I do that correctly. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784). Let me see, 0.28 times 0.28 is 0.0784. So yes, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.57142857... So I'll write gamma ≈ 3.5714.

Now, the mass of the Li-7 nucleus. What's the mass of a single Li-7 nucleus? I think the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². So Li-7 has 3 protons and 4 neutrons, right? Wait, wait, no. Wait, no: Wait, Li has atomic number 3, so 3 protons. The isotope Li-7 has 3 protons and 4 neutrons because 3 + 4 = 7. So the mass would be (3 * m_p) + (4 * m_n). But wait, the exact mass of a nucleus isn't just the sum of the individual nucleons because of binding energy, but in high-energy physics, they often approximate the mass using the sum of the individual masses minus the binding energy. Oh wait, but for this calculation, perhaps we can use the rest mass of the nucleus, which is approximately the sum of the masses of the nucleons minus the binding energy, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, sometimes people use the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the protons and neutrons, but I think more accurately, the mass would be the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, maybe I should look up the mass of a Li-7 nucleus. Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate. Let me think: the mass number is 7, so the nucleus has 7 nucleons (3 protons, 4 neutrons). The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². So total would be 3 * 938 + 4 * 939. Let's compute that: 3*938 is 2814, 4*939 is 3756. Adding those together gives 2814 + 3756 = 6570 MeV, which is 6.57 GeV. Wait, but that's the sum of the individual nucleon masses. However, the actual mass of the nucleus is less due to the mass defect (E=mc² from binding energy). The mass defect for Li-7 is about 0.0182u (I'm not sure, but I remember that for helium-4, it's about 0.03u, but for lighter nuclei, the binding isn't as tight). Alternatively, perhaps I should use the atomic mass of Li-7.

Wait, perhaps I can find the atomic mass of lithium-7. Let me think: the atomic mass of Li is about 7.016 g/mol. Wait, no, wait. The atomic mass unit (u) is about 1.66e-27 kg. The mass of a Li-7 atom would be approximately 7 * 1.66e-27 kg, but that's the mass number. Hmm, but let me think in terms of energy. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c².

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the mass of the nucleus as approximately the sum of the nucleons' rest masses minus the binding energy. But I'm not sure about the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps the mass is approximately (A * u) * c², where A is the mass number. Wait, but in terms of energy, 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c².

Wait, let's compute the mass of the Li-7 nucleus as roughly A * 931.5 MeV. So 7 * 931.5 = 6520.5 MeV, which is about 6.52 GeV. But this is an approximation because it ignores the binding energy. Alternatively, if the binding energy is about 0.5 MeV per nucleon (for light nuclei), but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the individual nucleon masses, without considering the binding energy. So that would be 3 * 938 +4 *939 = 6570 MeV = 6.57 GeV.

Wait, but that might be overestimating because the actual mass is less. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the mass number multiplied by the average mass of a nucleon. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem simplifies and assumes that the mass of the nucleus is the same as that of a nucleon times the number of nucleons. So, considering that the nucleus is Li-7, with A=7, so the rest mass m0 is approximately 7 * (average mass of a nucleon). So if each nucleon is about 938 MeV/c², then m0 is 7 * 938 = 6,566 MeV, which is 6.566 GeV.

Hmm, but maybe I should calculate the exact mass using the atomic mass of lithium-7. Let me think: the atomic mass of Li-7 is about 7.016 g/mol. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me try to find the exact value. Alternatively, I think the mass of a Li-7 nucleus (without electrons) is about 7 * 1.007276 (proton mass) + 4 * 1.008665 (neutron mass) minus binding energy. Wait no, actually, the atomic mass of Li-7 is given as approximately 7.016 u. Wait, but wait: no, that's the atomic mass including electrons. Hmm, the atomic mass of Li-7 is about 7.016 u. But the nucleus has a mass slightly less than that because you subtract the mass of the electrons. Li has atomic number 3, so three electrons. The mass of each electron is about 0.00054858 u. So the nucleus would have a mass of 7.016 u - 3 * 0.00054858 u.

Let me compute that: 3 * 0.00054858 is 0.00164574 u. So 7.016 u minus 0.00164574 u is approximately 7.014354 u. So the mass of the Li-7 nucleus is about 7.014354 u.

Convert that to GeV/c². Since 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c², so 7.014354 u is 7.014354 * 931.5 MeV/c². Let's compute that: 7 * 931.5 is 6520.5 MeV. 0.014354 * 931.5 is approximately 13.35 MeV. So total is 6520.5 + 13.35 = 6533.85 MeV, which is 6.53385 GeV. So m0 ≈ 6.53385 GeV/c².

Wait, but earlier without considering the electrons, I had 6.57 GeV. Hmm, perhaps the exact mass isn't crucial here because the options are given to four decimal places, but maybe I should use the approximate value of m0 = 7 * 938 MeV (since each nucleon is about 938 MeV) which is 6566 MeV or 6.566 GeV.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think: perhaps the problem expects me to consider the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the individual nucleon masses. So 7 nucleons, each about 938 MeV.

So m0 ≈7 * 938 MeV = 6566 MeV = 6.566 GeV.

So E = gamma * m0 c². Wait, but gamma is already unitless, and m0 is in GeV/c². So E in GeV would be gamma * m0.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714 as we found earlier.

So E = 3.5714 * 6.566 GeV. Let me compute that: 3.5714 *6 is 21.4284, 3.5714 *0.566 ≈ 2.023. So total is around 23.45 GeV? Wait, wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Let me compute 6.566 * 3.5714. Breaking it down:

6 * 3.5714 = 21.4284.

0.566 * 3.5714 = Let's compute 0.5 *3.5714 = 1.7857. 0.066 *3.5714 ≈ 0.235. So total for 0.566 is about 1.7857 + 0.235 = 2.0207.

Adding to 21.4284 gives 21.4284 + 2.0207 = 23.449 GeV.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 23.069 GeV, option C is 20.132, D is 21.419.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me recompute gamma.

Wait, velocity v =0.96c. So gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

0.96^2 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

So gamma = 1/0.28 = 3.571428571...

So that part was correct.

Wait, but perhaps the mass of the nucleus is being considered as the atomic mass, including electrons. Wait, no, in high-energy physics, when dealing with nuclei, we use the rest mass of the nucleus, which is the mass without the electrons. So the electrons' mass is negligible compared to the nucleus's mass, but perhaps in this case, considering that the nucleus is Li-7, which has 3 electrons, but their mass is about 0.001645 u as I calculated before, which is about 0.001645 * 931.5 MeV = around 1.53 MeV. So 1.53 MeV is 0.00153 GeV. So when I calculated the nucleus's mass as 6.53385 GeV/c², that was including the electrons. Wait, no, no: when I subtracted the electrons' mass from the atomic mass, that gave
