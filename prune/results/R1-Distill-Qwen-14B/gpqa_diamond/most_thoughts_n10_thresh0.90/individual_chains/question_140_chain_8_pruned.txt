Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question describes a reaction involving Substance X. It says that X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analogs.

Hmm. So, I think I need to identify what X, Y, W, G, and B are. Let me break it down.

First, gas W: same number of neutrons and protons. So, the molecule of W has equal neutrons and protons. So, if it's a molecule, perhaps it's a diatomic molecule. Let me think, which gases fit this?

Like, maybe H2O? No, because H and O have different numbers. Wait, no, wait—H2O is a molecule, but the atoms are H and O. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (if it's H-1). O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons in O-16. So the molecule as a whole would have 2 H (each with 1p, 0n) and one O (8p, 8n). So total protons: 2 +8 =10, total neutrons: 0 +8=8. Not equal. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe the molecule is something like CH4? No, that's not a gas with equal protons and neutrons. Or maybe CO2? No, wait, that's not a diatomic gas. Oh, maybe the gas is something like NH3? No, but that's not a diatomic. Wait, maybe the gas is something like O2. O2 is diatomic—each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, so each molecule has 16 protons (8 from each O atom) and 16 neutrons (same). So that's equal. So for O2, number of protons and neutrons are both 16? Let me calculate: each O atom has 8 protons. Two atoms, so 16 protons. Each O-16 has 8 neutrons, so two atoms have 16 neutrons. So yes, so O2 would fit this description.

But wait, another possibility is H2. H2 has each H as 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So the molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. So they're not equal. So no. What about O3? It's a triatomic molecule. Each O has 8p and 8n. So 3×8=24 protons, 24 neutrons. So yes, equal. So O3 could be it. Alternatively, maybe it's another isotope. Wait, but O2 is more common.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is something else. Let me think about another possibility. Another gas could be CH4, but that's not diatomic. Or maybe the gas is something like D2O? No, that's a heavy water molecule. Wait, but that's a compound, not a pure element.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the gas is CO. No, because CO has a different number of protons and neutrons. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe it's N2 gas. N has 7 protons each, so N2 would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons if each N is N-14. But normally, N is N-14 (7p,7n) is the most common isotope. So N2 would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons, so that fits. So W could be N2.

Wait, but the problem says "the same number of neutrons and
