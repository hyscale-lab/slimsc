Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I remember that at relativistic speeds, we can't just use classical mechanics; we need to apply special relativity principles.

First part is finding the relative speed. Wait, relative to each other, right? So if one is moving at 0.6c and the other at 0.5c in the same direction, how do we find the speed of one from the other's perspective?

Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me plug in the numbers. So v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c.

Calculating the numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) which simplifies. Let's see: (0.3c²)/c² is 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is 0.1c / 0.7. 0.1 divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.142857... which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. That matches option C and D for the relative speed.

Now the total energy of the system. I think each astronaut has their own relativistic energy, and the total would be the sum of both. Relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m * c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Let me compute each energy separately.

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma for 0.6c is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So his energy is 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.25)) = 1/sqrt(0.75). Let's compute sqrt(0.75). 0.75 is 3/4, so sqrt(3/4) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660. So 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So gamma is approximately 1.1547. His energy is 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.4641 mc².

Adding the two energies: 2.5 + 3.4641 = about 5.9641 mc². Rounding to two decimal places, that's approximately 5.96 mc².

Now looking at the options, option C has relative speed 0.14c and E=5.96 mc². That fits. Option B has E=4.96, which is lower. Option D's energy is 5 mc², which is less than 5.96, so no. Option A's v_rel is 1.1c, which is faster than light, which isn't possible, so A is out.

So the correct answer must be option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using principles of special relativity.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds \( v_1 \) and \( v_2 \) in the same direction is given by:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( v_1 = 0.6c \) and \( v_2 = 0.5c \):

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### First Astronaut (Mass \( 2m \), Speed \( 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### Second Astronaut (Mass \( 3m \), Speed \( 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.4641mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.4641mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is \( 5.96mc^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
