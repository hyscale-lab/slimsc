Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's about the Michael addition reaction, which I remember is a type of conjugate addition. Let me think through each part step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C. Each involves a Michael addition, and I need to find the products from the given reactants and conditions. Then, match them with the options provided.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile, right? It's a diethyl ester of malonic acid. In the presence of a base like NaOEt, it can form an enolate. The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the beta position of another carbonyl compound, which in this case is the methyl acrylate.

The acrylate has an E configuration. So the substituents on either side of the double bond are on opposite sides. The p-tolyl group is on the 3-position of the acrylate. So the structure is CH2=CH-p-tolyl, but wait, no. Wait, the structure is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. But 3-(p-tolyl) would mean that the substituent is on the third carbon. Wait, no, I think I got that wrong.

Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. If it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C3. So it's CH2-CH2-C(p-tolyl)=O? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, wait. Let's clarify. The structure of (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate methyl ester would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Or is it CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3 with a substituent on the third carbon? Maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think the correct structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group attached to the acrylate. So, the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, and the 3-position would be the CH2. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Wait, no, because 3-(p-tolyl) would be at the third position, which is beyond the double bond.

Wait, maybe the molecule is structured as CH2=CH-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. But that doesn't fit the acrylate structure. Oh
