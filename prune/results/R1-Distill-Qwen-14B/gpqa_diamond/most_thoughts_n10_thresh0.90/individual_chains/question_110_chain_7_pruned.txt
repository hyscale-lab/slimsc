Okay, so I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Let's see what the question says. 

ESPRESSO is at Paranal, and it can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, brighter than 17? Oh wait, no, I think I have it backwards. Magnitudes are a bit confusing. The lower the number, the brighter the star. So if a telescope can observe stars brighter than a certain magnitude, that means the apparent magnitude (the brightness as seen from Earth) must be less than that number, right? Or wait, no. Wait, when the apparent magnitude is lower (like 16 mag), that's brighter. Because the scale is inverted. So if a telescope can observe stars up to, say, 17 mag, that means it can see stars as bright as 17 or brighter (apparent magnitude ≤ 17). Because higher magnitudes are dimmer. 

So, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V brighter than 17 mag. So apparent magnitude <17? Or <17? Wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Wait, if a star's V magnitude is brighter than 17, it means its V is less than 17. Because, for example, a star that's 16 mag is brighter than 17. So ESPRESSO can detect stars with apparent V magnitude ≤17. Because brighter than 17 would be, like, 16.5, which is brighter, so that's allowed. 

HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So apparent magnitude ≤16. Because brighter than 16 would be anything below 16, like 15. 

So the stars that can be detected by both would have apparent V magnitudes ≤16, because HIRES can't go beyond 16, and ESPRESSO can go up to 17. So a star that is ≤16 can be seen by both. 

Wait, but wait. No. Because ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so any star with V ≤17 can be seen by ESPRESSO. HIRES can go up to 16, so V ≤16 can be seen by HIRES. So
