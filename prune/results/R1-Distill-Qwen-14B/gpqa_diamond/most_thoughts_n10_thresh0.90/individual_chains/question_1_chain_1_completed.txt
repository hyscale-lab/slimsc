Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question talks about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. The goal is to find the energy difference that would allow us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A through D.

Hmm, okay, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It says that there's a fundamental limit to how precisely certain pairs of physical properties can be known. One of the key applications is the energy-time uncertainty relation. The formula I recall is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

Wait, but I think in many contexts, people use ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt, ignoring the 1/2 factor because the exact value isn't critical for order-of-magnitude estimates. So the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime (which is the time uncertainty). That makes sense because a shorter lifetime means a less precise measurement of energy.

So the idea here is that for each energy level, the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime. If the energy difference between the two states is much larger than the uncertainties, then they can be distinguished. But if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the states might not be resolvable.

Let me think about each state. The first has a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds. Let's compute the uncertainty in energy for that. Similarly, the second has 10^-8 seconds.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between the two states. So, we need to ensure that the energy difference is larger than the combined uncertainties of both states? Or do we compare it to each individually?

No, wait, actually, each state's energy has its own uncertainty. The energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties, or perhaps each state's uncertainty contributes. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think again.

Suppose E1 has a lifetime τ1, so ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1. Similarly, E2 has τ2, so ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2. The energy difference ΔE = |E2 - E1|. For them to be distinguishable, ΔE must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties, I think. Or wait, maybe each state's ΔE is the uncertainty in its own energy, so the difference ΔE must be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties? Or perhaps the maximum of the two, or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. So, if ΔE is larger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2, then the two states can be resolved.

Wait, let me get this straight. Each state has an uncertainty in energy proportional to 1/τ. So for E1, ΔE1 = ħ / τ1, and for E2, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2.

Given that τ1 is 1e-9 seconds, τ2 is 1e-8 seconds. So τ2 is ten times longer than τ1. Therefore, ΔE2 is smaller than ΔE1 because as τ increases, ΔE decreases.

Let me compute the ratio. τ2 = 1e-8 s, τ1 = 1e-9 s. So τ2 is 10 times larger. So ΔE2 would be ΔE1 multiplied by (τ1/τ2) = (1e-9)/(1e-8) ) = 0.1. So ΔE2 is 10% of ΔE1.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the energy difference ΔE that allows us to distinguish E1 and E2. So I need ΔE to be larger than some value. What's that value?

I think that for two energy levels to be distinguishable, the energy difference should be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than the sum, the two states might blend into each other, making it hard to resolve them.

Alternatively, sometimes in these cases, the energy uncertainty is given by ΔE ≈ ħ / τ, and the energy difference needs to be much larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is much larger than the uncertainties, you can clearly tell them apart.

Wait, perhaps the formula is that the energy resolution ΔE is given by ħ / τ, where τ is the measurement time. But wait, in this question, what's the context? Are we talking about the energy width of each state, and how that affects the ability to distinguish two states?

Alternatively, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach it step by step.

The uncertainty principle states that ΔE * τ ≈ ħ/2. So ΔE ≈ ħ / (2τ). So for each state, the uncertainty in its energy is inversely proportional to its lifetime.

So for E1, ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1)
For E2, ΔE2 = ħ/(2 τ2)

So τ1 is 1e-9 s, τ2 is 1e-8 s.

Compute ΔE1 and ΔE2:

Let me plug in the numbers.

But wait, maybe I can just compute the ratio. Since ħ and 2 are constants, the ratio of the uncertainties is inversely proportional to the ratio of the lifetimes.

So ΔE1 / ΔE2 = τ2 / τ1 = (1e-8) / (1e-9) ) = 10. So ΔE1 is ten times larger than ΔE2.

So ΔE1 is larger than ΔE2 by a factor of 10.

Now, the energy difference between the two states, ΔE = |E2 - E1|.

To distinguish the two states, ΔE should be larger than the sum of the two uncertainties. Or perhaps each uncertainty? Wait, maybe each state's energy uncertainty is similar to the width of its peak in an energy spectrum. So for two peaks, their separation (ΔE) needs to be larger than the sum of their half-widths (ΔE1 and ΔE2) to be resolved.

But in some cases, the resolving condition is that the separation is greater than the sum of the half-widths. For example, in spectroscopy, the resolving power is often given by the condition that the separation between two lines is greater than the sum of their linewidths (which are proportional to the uncertainties in energy). So, if ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2, then the two lines are resolvable.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's the exact condition here. Another approach is to think about the energy resolution required. The energy resolution ΔE_res is determined by the measurement time, which in this case is the lifetime of the state. So for each state, the energy resolution is ΔE1 and ΔE2.

Wait, perhaps the question is more about the combined uncertainty. Let me think.

Suppose we have two states with energies E1 and E2. The uncertainty in E1 is ΔE1, and the uncertainty in E2 is ΔE2.

The energy difference between them is ΔE = E2 - E1.

To distinguish E1 and E2, the energy difference must be significantly larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Or perhaps the sum.

Wait, let's think about it: if the two energy levels are very close, then their uncertainties could overlap, making it impossible to distinguish them. So the separation must be greater than some measure.

In the energy axis, each state's energy has a spread of ΔE1 and ΔE2 around it. So if the separation is more than the sum of the spreads, then it's clear. But if the separation is less than the sum, it's possible that the energy levels' distributions overlap, making it hard to distinguish them.

In other words, the condition for distinguishability is ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So the energy difference should be larger than the sum of the two uncertainties.

Now, let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

Using ΔE ≈ ħ / (2 τ), but perhaps we can ignore the constants for an order-of-magnitude estimate.

So, ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1
ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2

Since τ1 is 1e-9 s, ΔE1 is about ħ / 1e-9 s.
Similarly, τ2 is 1e-8 s, so ΔE2 is about ħ / 1e-8 s.

Thus, ΔE1 is 10 times larger than ΔE2.

So ΔE1 = 10 * ΔE2.

So, the sum ΔE1 + ΔE2 = 10ΔE2 + ΔE2 = 11 ΔE2.

But wait, wait, I think I got that wrong. Since τ2 is larger, ΔE2 is smaller. Because ΔE is inversely proportional to τ.

Wait, ħ is a constant. Let me plug in numbers.

Let me compute ΔE1 and ΔE2 numerically.

The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

But energy in eV. Hmm, so I'll convert J to eV. 1 eV = 1.60218e-19 J.

So 1 J = 1 / 1.60218e-19 eV ≈ 6.242e18 eV.

So ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s = 1.0545718e-34 * 6.242e18 eV·s ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

Now, compute ΔE for each state.

ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) ) = 6.582e-7 eV.

ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2 = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (1e-8 s) ) = 6.582e-8 eV.

So, ΔE1 is approximately 6.582e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is about 6.582e-8 eV.

So the sum of the two uncertainties is approximately 7.24e-7 eV.

Wait, that's 7.24e-7 eV. So the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than this sum.

So, ΔE = |E2 - E1| must be > 7.24e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 → way too small.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller.

C) 1e-4 eV → 1e-4 is 1e3 * 1e-7 → much larger than 7.24e-7.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.1 * 7.24e-7 → 7.24e-8 is about 0.1 times 7.24e-7. So 1e-8 is even smaller than that.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, let me compute ΔE1 and ΔE2 again more accurately.

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = 6.582e-16 eV·s / 1e-9 s = 6.582e-7 eV.

ΔE2 = 6.582e-16 eV·s / 1e-8 s = 6.582e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 6.58e-8 eV.

So the sum is approximately 7.24e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be larger than this sum to be resolvable.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. 1e-4 eV is much larger than 7.24e-7 eV (since 7.24e-7 is 0.000000724), so 1e-4 is bigger. So option C would satisfy the condition.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the energy difference just needs to be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is larger than the larger uncertainty, then the two states can be distinguished.

In this case, the larger uncertainty is ΔE1 ≈ 6.58e-7 eV. So if the energy difference is larger than that, it's definitely resolvable.

So, for example, if ΔE is larger than 6.58e-7 eV, then it's resolvable.

Looking at the options again:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 (0.0001) eV. Which is larger than 6.58e-7 eV. So that would work.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is smaller than ΔE2, so no.

So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but let me think again. The question asks which energy difference would allow us to clearly resolve the two levels. So the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in each state. But the sum of the two might be the more stringent condition. Wait, perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the sum of the two uncertainties.

In that case, the sum is approximately 7.24e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be greater than that.

Looking at the options, only option C (1e-4 eV) is larger than 7.24e-7 eV.

Therefore, option C is the correct choice.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) to the lifetime (\( \tau \)) of the state: 

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau}
\]

Here, \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant (\( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \)). For the two states:

- \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \), so \( \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \),
- \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), so \( \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \).

The energy difference between the two states, \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \), must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties in energy to ensure distinguishability:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-7} + 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, \( \Delta E \) must be greater than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Evaluating the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** Too small, as \( 10^{-9} < 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \).
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** Too small, as \( 10^{-11} < 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \).
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** Sufficiently large, as \( 10^{-4} > 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \).
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** Too small, as \( 10^{-8} < 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \).

The only energy difference that satisfies the condition is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).
