Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. They provided the components of the operator P in the X, Y, and Z directions. So I think the first step is to figure out the matrix representation of the operator P along the direction n.

Wait, right. The operator P is a vector operator, so in an arbitrary direction n, it's given by the dot product of P with n. So P = P · n, where n is a unit vector in the direction we're considering. Since n is in the x-z plane, it can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), wait no, wait. Wait, in spherical coordinates, a direction in the x-z plane would have φ=0, right? Because x-z is the plane where y=0. So the angle φ is zero. So the direction vector n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), since θ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

So, n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So the operator P along this direction would be P·n = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ. Because the Y-component of n is zero, so the P_y term drops out.

So I need to compute the matrix P·n. Let's write down each component matrix.

Given:
P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, P·n = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ. Let me compute each part.

First, calculate P_x sinθ:
(ħ/2) sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]]

Similarly, P_z cosθ:
(ħ/2) cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Adding these together:

P·n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute the matrix elements:

Top-left element: (ħ/2)(0*sinθ + 1* cosθ )? Wait no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the matrices are multiplied by scalars, so:

sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] is:
[[0, sinθ],
 [sinθ, 0]]

Similarly, cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] is:
[[cosθ, 0],
 [0, -cosθ]]

So adding these matrices:

Top-left: 0 + cosθ = cosθ
Top-right: sinθ + 0 = sinθ
Bottom-left: sinθ + 0 = sinθ
Bottom-right: 0 + (-cosθ) = -cosθ

So the matrix is:

[[cosθ, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Wait, no, wait. Because each term is multiplied by (ħ/2). So the full matrix is:

(ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

Wait, let me double-check that:

P_x sinθ: [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]] multiplied by ħ/2.

P_z cosθ: [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]] multiplied by ħ/2.

So adding them:

Each element is (ħ/2) * [ (cosθ, sinθ), (sinθ, -cosθ) ]

So the operator is:
[[ (ħ/2) cosθ, (ħ/2) sinθ ],
 [ (ħ/2) sinθ, -(ħ/2) cosθ ] ]

Now, this is the matrix for the operator P·n. We're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue equation is:

(P·n | ψ ) = (+ħ/2) |ψ>

Which can be written as:

[ [ (ħ/2 cosθ), (ħ/2 sinθ) ],
  [ (ħ/2 sinθ), -(ħ/2 cosθ) ] ] 
 * [ a ]
   [ b ]
= (+ħ/2) [ a ]
          [ b ]

So setting up the equations:

(ħ/2 cosθ) a + (ħ/2 sinθ) b = (ħ/2) a → equation (1)
(ħ/2 sinθ) a + ( - ħ/2 cosθ ) b = (ħ/2) b → equation (2)

We can divide both sides by ħ/2 to simplify:

Equation (1): cosθ a + sinθ b = a → cosθ a + sinθ b = a → (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b =0.

Equation (2): sinθ a - cosθ b = b → sinθ a = (cosθ +1) b → a = [ (cosθ +1)/ sinθ ] b.

Wait, assuming sinθ is not zero, which it isn't because the direction is in x-z plane, so θ is between 0 and π, but not 0 or π? Well, wait, if θ is zero, that's along z, but in that case, the problem would be different, but the question says arbitrary direction in x-z plane, so θ can be anything except where sinθ is zero. Hmm, but maybe we can proceed regardless.

So let's proceed with equation (2):

sinθ a = (cosθ +1 ) b → a = [ (cosθ +1 )/( sinθ ) ] b.

Let me denote this as a = k b, where k = (cosθ +1)/sinθ.

Substituting into equation (1):

( cosθ -1 ) a + sinθ b = 0 → (cosθ-1)(k b ) + sinθ b =0 → [ (cosθ -1)k + sinθ ] b =0.

Since b can't be zero (eigenvector can't be zero), the coefficient must be zero.

So (cosθ -1)k + sinθ =0.

Substituting k:

(cosθ -1) * [ (cosθ +1)/ sinθ ] + sinθ = 0.

Let me compute this:

[ (cosθ -1)(cosθ +1) ) / sinθ ] + sinθ =0.

Note that (cosθ -1)(cosθ +1) = cos²θ -1 = - sin²θ.

So: [ (- sin²θ ) / sinθ ] + sinθ =0 → (- sinθ ) + sinθ =0 → 0=0.

So the equation is satisfied, which means any a and b that satisfy a = [ (cosθ +1)/ sinθ ] b are solutions.

So, the eigenvector can be written as [ a, b ]^T where a = [ (cosθ +1)/ sinθ ] b.

Let me express this as:

Let’s choose b as a parameter. Let’s set b = sinθ, then a = (cosθ +1).

Wait, wait, because a = [ (cosθ +1) / sinθ ] * b → if I set b = sinθ, then a = cosθ +1.

So the eigenvector is [ cosθ +1, sinθ ].

Wait, but this is up to a scalar multiple because eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar.

But wait, we need to normalize the eigenvector. The eigenvector components are [a, b] = [ (cosθ +1), sinθ ], but since it's up to a scalar, perhaps I should express it in terms of a normalized vector.

Wait, the actual components might not be in the given options, but perhaps we can find a better way.

Wait, let me think about the form of the eigenvectors when the direction is along the z-axis. For example, if the direction is along z, θ=0, n = (0,0,1). Then the operator is P_z, which has eigenvalues ±ħ/2.

The eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 is [1,0]^T. So plugging θ=0 into our expressions:

cosθ =1, sinθ=0.

Wait, but if θ approaches zero, the expression for a becomes (1 +1)/0, which is infinity. Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps there's a better approach.

Alternatively, maybe using the spin-1/2 system and the eigenstates.

Wait, the operator P is a spin operator. Wait, the muon is a spin-1/2 particle, so P is analogous to the spin angular momentum operator ħ/2 σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

So for a direction n, the operator is (ħ/2) σ · n.

The eigenvectors of σ · n for eigenvalue +1 are (cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2))^T, which is the standard spherical basis for spin-1/2.

Wait, but since our direction is in the x-z plane, φ=0. So the eigenvector would be (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2))^T.

Wait, because φ=0, the e^{iφ} term is 1. So the components are (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)).

But wait, let me think again. I'm a bit confused.

In the standard spin-1/2 system, the eigenstate for spin-up along direction n=(sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ) is given by:

|+⟩ = cos(θ/2) |↑⟩ + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) |↓⟩.

So in terms of the basis vectors |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ (which are [1,0]^T and [0,1]^T), the components are [ cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ].

Since in our problem, φ=0, because the direction is in the x-z plane, the eigenvector would be [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

So the normalized eigenvector has components proportional to cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2).

Looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ), which matches this.

Option B is (cosθ, e^{iϕ} sinθ ), but that's a different form; probably for higher spins or something else.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors multiplied with cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). Why would those factors be there? Maybe if the direction is fixed, but the problem says it's arbitrary, so the answer should hold for any θ.

But wait, the options are about the elements of the normalized eigenvector. Wait, the eigenvector I have is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), which is already normalized because cos^2 + sin^2 =1.

So option C is correct.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Yes, that's exactly what I got for the components.

But wait, looking back at the problem statement, the options are given as:

A) (sqrt(2/3)ħ, sqrt(1/3)ħ)

B) (cosθ, e^{iϕ} sinθ )

C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

D) (sqrt(2/3)ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3)ħ sin(theta/2) )

Wait, but the muon's eigenvector is a state, so the components are dimensionless. But in the options, A and D have factors with ħ, which is a unit of action (J·s), so that might be a mistake. But quantum states are vectors in a Hilbert space, typically without units.

Hmm. So maybe options A and D are incorrect because they include ħ, which shouldn't be part of the state vector components.

So the correct answer is C.

Wait, but I should double-check. Let me re-derive.

The eigenvalue equation for the operator P·n is (with eigenvalue +ħ/2):

[ [ (ħ/2 cosθ), (ħ/2 sinθ) ],
  [ (ħ/2 sinθ), -(ħ/2 cosθ) ] ] 
 * [ a ]
   [ b ]
= (ħ/2) [ a ]
          [ b ]

So each component:

( (ħ/2 cosθ) a + (ħ/2 sinθ) b ) = (ħ/2) a → cosθ a + sinθ b = a → (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b =0.

Similarly, ( (ħ/2 sinθ) a ) + ( -ħ/2 cosθ b ) ) = (ħ/2) b → sinθ a - cosθ b = b → sinθ a = (cosθ +1) b → a = [ (cosθ +1) / sinθ ] b.

So taking b=1, a = (cosθ +1)/ sinθ.

Wait, but if the vector is [a, b] = [ (1 + cosθ)/ sinθ , 1 ].

But in the spin-1/2 case, the eigenstate is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, perhaps I can relate these expressions.

Let me compute (1 + cosθ) and sinθ.

We know that 1 + cosθ = 2 cos^2(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So (1 + cosθ)/ sinθ = [2 cos^2(theta/2)] / [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] ] → [ cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ] → cot(theta/2).

So a = cot(theta/2) when b=1.

So the eigenvector would be [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

But to make it a unit vector, we need to normalize it.

The norm squared is cot^2(theta/2) + 1 = csc^2(theta/2) → 1/sin^2(theta/2).

So the normalized vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Which matches the option C.

So the correct answer is option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, and the direction $\vec{n}$ is specified as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$ since it lies in the x-z plane.

### Step 1: Matrix Representation of $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$
The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is constructed as:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x \sin\theta + P_z \cos\theta
\]
Given the matrices for $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$:
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix},
\]
we compute:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenvalue Equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \right) \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Substituting the matrix for $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$, we get the system of equations:
\[
\cos\theta \, a + \sin\theta \, b = a, \quad \sin\theta \, a - \cos\theta \, b = b.
\]
Simplifying these equations leads to the relation:
\[
a = \frac{\cos\theta + 1}{\sin\theta} b.
\]

### Step 3: Eigenvector and Normalization
Using the relation $a = \frac{\cos\theta + 1}{\sin\theta} b$, we express the eigenvector as:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = b \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\cos\theta + 1}{\sin\theta} \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
To normalize, we compute the norm:
\[
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \sqrt{\left( \frac{\cos\theta + 1}{\sin\theta} \right)^2 + 1}.
\]
Using trigonometric identities, $\cos\theta + 1 = 2\cos^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, the normalized eigenvector becomes:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect for a normalized eigenvector.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ does not match the derived form and is inconsistent with the eigenvalue problem.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ includes unnecessary normalization factors and $\hbar$, which is incorrect.

### Final Answer
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.

Answer: C
