Okay, so I've got this physics question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, what do I remember about SMEFT? I think SMEFT is a framework that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with the Standard Model symmetries. So the SM has certain symmetries, and SMEFT should respect those as well, right?

So the Standard Model has Lorentz symmetry, which is about how the laws of physics look the same in any inertial frame. Lorentz symmetry must be a given in any relativistic theory, so SMEFT would definitely respect that. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is a must.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like shifting position and time). So Poincare symmetry is a broader symmetry. But wait, in SMEFT, the operators are classified by their Lorentz and gauge indices. Do they need to respect Poincare? I think that in SMEFT, the operators are organized in terms of their Lorentz representations, but does that imply Poincare symmetry? Hmm, because Poincare includes both Lorentz and translations. Wait, but the SMEFT Lagrangian should be invariant under Poincare symmetry because it's a relativistic theory. So operators in SMEFT must be invariant under Poincare. So both 1 and 2 are correct. So the operators have to respect both Lorentz and Poincare. But wait, I thought that in some cases, maybe Poincare isn't strictly needed. Or maybe Poincare is a given because all terms in the Lagrangian are written in a way that the whole Lagrangian is Poincare invariant. So for the operators to be part of a Poincare invariant theory, the individual operators must transform correctly under Poincare. So yes, operators must respect Poincare symmetry, so 2 is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. Are all the operators in SMEFT automatically Poincare-invariant? Because the Lagrangian must be. So each term in the Lagrangian must transform as a scalar under Poincare. So each operator (like Oμν, etc.) must be arranged such that when you include the appropriate coefficients and field strengths, the whole term is a scalar. So yes, the operators are arranged to make the terms in the Lagrangian Poincare invariant. So operators must respect Poincare symmetry.

So 1 and 2 are both correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 1 and 2. Option C is 1, 2, and 4. Hmm.

Next, what about CP and CPT symmetries. I remember that in the Standard Model, the symmetry is CPT, not necessarily CP or T. So SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry because the underlying SM does. But what about CP?

Wait, the SM has CPT symmetry but not necessarily CP. For example, in the SM, processes that violate CP do exist, like in certain meson decays. But CPT is always a symmetry because of the CPT theorem, which states that any Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory must be CPT symmetric.

Wait, so SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry. But what about CP? The operators can violate CP, right? Because the effective operators can have terms that change the strong CP, for example. Like the famous θ term in QCD, which is a CP-violating operator. So the SMEFT includes operators that can break CP. So the operators don't have to respect CP, but they must respect CPT.

Wait, but the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So all operators must be CPT-invariant? No, wait. Because CPT is a symmetry of the theory, the entire theory must be CPT-invariant. But individual operators can change under CPT as part of the structure. Wait
