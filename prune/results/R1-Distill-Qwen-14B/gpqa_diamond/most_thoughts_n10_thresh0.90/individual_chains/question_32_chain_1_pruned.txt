Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve. It's about calculating the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC accelerates heavy ions like gold nuclei, but in this case, the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Let me think—Li usually has 3 electrons, so if it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number A would be protons plus neutrons. Li has atomic number Z=3, so protons are 3, neutrons are 3. So A=6. So it's Li-6.

The question is asking for the energy of the collider such that the nucleus's speed is 0.96c. Oh wait, I think I need to find the total energy of the nucleus. Since RHIC is a collider, each beam has particles moving in opposite directions, but I think the energy here refers to the energy per particle, assuming they're accelerated to that speed.

So the nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. I remember that in relativity, the total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Let me calculate gamma first. v is 0.96c, so v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. Therefore, gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me calculate it more accurately. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is sqrt(784e-4) which is 28e-2, so 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy of the nucleus is m*c². The mass of a Li-6 nucleus is needed. The mass number A is 6, so the mass is roughly 6 times the mass of a proton. Wait, but protons and neutrons have slightly different masses. The exact mass might be necessary, but perhaps we can approximate. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², but a neutron is a bit more, around 939.565 MeV/c². So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So the mass would be 3*(mass of proton) + 3*(mass of neutron). Let me get exact numbers. Proton mass is about 938.272 MeV/c². Neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So calculating:

3 * 938.272 = 2814.816 MeV

3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV

Total is 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV. That's 5.633511 GeV.

Wait, but wait—the actual mass of Li-6 might be slightly different because when you combine protons and neutrons into a nucleus, there's a mass defect due to binding energy. Oh, right, the mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of individual nucleons because of the binding energy. So perhaps I should look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, maybe the question expects me to use the mass number A multiplied by the mass of a nucleon. Hmm, but I think the question expects me to proceed with the given information. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes using the rest mass as A times the mass of a proton, but that's probably an oversimplification. Alternatively, if I don't have exact values, perhaps I can use the approximate method.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass is given by the sum of the protons and neutrons. But I think that for a precise calculation, the accurate mass is needed. Since I don't have the exact mass of Li-6, maybe I can proceed by finding the exact rest mass.

Wait, I can look up the atomic mass of Li-6. The standard atomic weight is about 6.9409 g/mol. But that's the molar mass. To get the mass of one nucleus, I need to calculate it.

The molar mass of Li-6 is about 6.9409 g/mol. So one mole is Avogadro's number (6.022e23) atoms, each with mass 6.9409 g / 6.022e23 ≈ 1.152e-23 kg per nucleus.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the molar mass is 6.9409 g/mol, so each mole is 6.022e23 atoms. So the mass of one atom is 6.9409e-3 kg/mol / 6.022e23 atoms/mol = approximately 1.152e-26 kg.

Wait, let me compute that:

6.9409 g/mol = 0.0069409 kg/mol.

Number of atoms per mole: 6.022e23 atoms/mol.

So mass per atom = 0.0069409 kg/mol / 6.022e23 atoms/mol = approximately 1.1525e-26 kg.

So the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 1.1525e-26 kg.

But that's the rest mass in kg. To get the energy in GeV, I need to compute m c².

Speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s.

So m c² = 1.1525e-26 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 = 1.1525e-26 * 9e16 = 1.1525e-26 *9e16 = (1.1525 *9 )e-10 = 10.3725e-10 J.

Now, converting Joules to GeV. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 1 GeV is 1e9 eV = 1.602e-10 J.

So 10.3725e-10 J / 1.602e-10 J/GeV = approximately 10.3725 / 1.602 ≈ 6.473 GeV.

Wait, that's about 6.47 GeV for the rest mass energy. But wait, that seems low? Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, more accurately: 1.1525e-26 kg * (3e8)^2 = 1.1525e-26 *9e16 = 1.03725e-9 J.

Wait, no, 3e8 squared is 9e16, and 1.1525e-26 *9e16 = 1.1525 *9 = 10.3725, but the exponent is e-26 + 16 = e-10. So 10.3725e-10 J.

Yes, that's 1.03725e-9 J, because 10.3725e-10 is 1.03725e-9.

So 1.03725e-9 J divided by 1.602e-10 J/GeV is (1.03725e-9)/(1.602e-10) ) = (1.03725 / 1.602) * 10 = approx 6.473 GeV.

Wait, because 1.03725e-9 / 1.602e-10 = (1.03725 / 1.602) * 1e1 = (0.647) *10 = 6.47 GeV.

Wait, that's about 6.47 GeV for the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus.

But wait, the problem is to find the total energy when moving at 0.96c. So the total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy.

Earlier, I calculated gamma to be about 3.5714.

So total energy E = gamma * m c² = 3.5714 * 6.47 GeV ≈ let me compute that.

3.5714 * 6.47:

First, 3 * 6.47 = 19.41.

0.5714 *6.47 ≈ 3.695.

So 19.41 + 3.695 = 23.105 GeV.

But wait, let me compute more accurately.

3.5714 * 6.47:

= (3 + 0.5714) *6.47 

= 3*6.47 + 0.5714*6.47 

3 *6.47 = 19.41.

0.5714 *6.47:

Compute 0.5 *6.47=3.235.

0.0714 *6.47 ≈ approx 0.4627.

So total 3.235 + 0.4627 = 3.6977.

So total E ≈ 19.41 + 3.6977 = 23.1077 GeV.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 23.069 GeV.

Option D is 21.419.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the mass.

Wait, earlier I calculated the rest mass energy as about 6.47 GeV. Let me double-check that because if I miscalculated that, the entire result will be off.

Wait, the mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.9409 u (atomic mass units). 1 u is about 1.6605e-27 kg. So 6.9409 u * 1.6605e-27 kg/u = let's compute that.

6.9409 * 1.6605e-27 = approx 6.9409 *1.6605 is about 11.526e-27 kg.

Wait, 6.9409 *1.6605:

6 *1.6605 = 9.963

0.9409 *1.6605 ≈ 1.562.

So total approx 11.525e-27 kg.

So mass m = 11.525e-27 kg.

Then, m c² = 11.525e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

= 11.525e-27 * 9e16 = 11.525 *9 = 103.725e-11 = 1.03725e-9 J.

Converting to GeV: 1.03725e-9 J / (1.602e-10 J/GeV) = approx 6.473 GeV.

So yes, that's correct. So E = gamma * 6.473 GeV = 3.5714 *6.473 GeV.

Let me compute that more accurately:

3.5714 *6.473.

Compute 3 *6.473 =19.419.

0.5714 *6.473: Let's compute 0.5*6.473=3.2365.

0.0714 *6.473: 0.07 *6.473=0.45311, 0.0014 *6.473=0.0090622. So total approx 0.46217.

So 3.2365 + 0.46217 =3.69867.

Total E =19.419 + 3.69867=23.11767 GeV.

But the options are:

A)18.475

B)23.069

C)20.132

D)21.419.

Hmm, so 23.117 is closest to option B, 23.069. But wait, perhaps I should calculate gamma more accurately.

Earlier, I approximated gamma as 3.5714. Let me compute gamma more precisely.

v=0.96c.

v²/c² = 0.96^2 = 0.9216.

1 - v²/c² = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

So 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

But wait, let me compute 1/0.28 precisely.

0.28 is 28/100 = 7/25. So 1/(7/25)=25/7≈3.57142857.

So that's correct.

So perhaps the exact value for gamma is 25/7 =3.57142857.

So E= (25/7) *6.47333 GeV.

Wait, 6.47333 GeV is the rest energy.

So (25/7) *6.47333 = (25 *6.47333)/7.

25 *6.47333 = 161.83325.

161.83325 /7 ≈23.1190357 GeV.

Which is about 23.119 GeV.

But the option B is 23.069 GeV, which is a bit lower.

Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rest mass energy.

Wait, maybe the exact rest mass of Li-6 is different. Let me think. The actual mass of Li-6 is 6.9409 atomic mass units. Wait, but the exact value of the rest mass includes binding energy, so perhaps the rest mass is a bit less than 6 * 938 MeV. Let me calculate the exact value.

Wait, the mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c².

So for Li-6, 3 protons and 3 neutrons:

3 *938.272 = 2814.816 MeV.

3 *939.565 = 2818.695 MeV.

Total = 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV.

But the actual mass of Li-6 is less due to binding energy. The mass defect is about the binding energy divided by c². So the exact mass of Li-6 is (5633.511 MeV) * (1 - (binding energy)/(sum of individual masses * c²)).

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to look up the exact mass of Li-6 in MeV/c².

Alternatively, another approach: the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.9409 u. 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c².

So 6.9409 u *931.5 MeV/c²/u = ?

Compute 6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.9409 *931.5 ≈ 875.6 MeV.

So total is 5589 +875.6 ≈6464.6 MeV or 6.4646 GeV.

Ah, so that's where the 6.473 GeV I calculated earlier comes from. So that's correct.

So E = gamma * m c² = (25/7) *6.4646 GeV.

Wait, 25/7 is approximately 3.57142857.

So 3.57142857 *6.4646 = let's compute this accurately.

3 *6.4646 =19.3938.

0.57142857 *6.4646 ≈.

Let me compute 0.5 *6.4646=3.2323.

0.07142857 *6.4646 ≈ let's compute 6.4646 *0.07142857.

6.4646 *0.07=0.452522.

6.4646 *0.00142857≈ approx 0.00923.

So 0.452522 +0.00923 ≈0.46175.

So total for 0.57142857 is 3.2323 +0.46175≈3.69405.

So E=19.3938 +3.69405 ≈23.08785 GeV.

So approximately 23.088 GeV.

Looking back at the options, option B is 23.069 GeV. Hmm, that's close but slightly lower.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute 1/(sqrt(1 -v²/c² )) when v=0.96c.

v=0.96c, so v²/c²=0.9216.

1 - v²/c²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28, since 0.28^2=0.0784.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

So no error here.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass energy is slightly less than 6.4646 GeV.

Wait, considering the exact mass of Li-6. The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.9409 u. Let me compute 6.9409 *931.5 MeV/u.

6.9409 *931.5 = ?

Compute 6 *931.5 =5589.

0.9409 *931.5: Let's compute 0.9 *931.5=838.35.

0.0409 *931.5= approx 38.14.

So 838.35 +38.14=876.49.

So total is 5589 + 876.49=6465.49 MeV, which is 6.46549 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *6.46549 GeV.

Let me compute 3 *6.46549=19.39647.

0.57142857 *6.46549.

0.5 *6.46549=3.232745.

0.07142857 *6.46549≈0.461885.

So total 3.232745 +0.461885=3.69463.

So E=19.39647 +3.69463=23.0911 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 23.091 GeV, which is approximately 23.09 GeV.

Looking back at the options:

Option B is 23.069 GeV.

Hmm, but why the discrepancy? Perhaps because the actual mass of Li-6 is slightly less than 6.9409u due to binding energy, but I think 6.9409u is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation error in the gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute gamma for v=0.96c.

v = 0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) 

= 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216)

=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

That's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value of 0.96, which is 24/25. So v=24c/25. Then, v² = (24² c²)/25² = (576/625)c².

So 1 - v²/c² = (625 -576)/625 =49/625.

So sqrt(49/625)=7/25=0.28.

So gamma=25/7 ≈3.57142857.

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the rest mass energy is different. Let me think.

Another approach: The exact rest mass energy of a Li-6 nucleus.

But I'm not sure, perhaps I can look for the exact value. The standard value for the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is about 6.9409 u.

But perhaps the precise calculation of the mass in MeV/c² is 6.9409 *931.5 = ?

Let me compute 6.9409 *931.5.

6 *931.5=5589.

0.9409 *931.5.

0.9 *931.5=838.35.

0.04 *931.5=37.26.

0.0009 *931.5=0.83835.

So 0.9409 = 0.9 +0.04 +0.0009.

So 838.35 +37.26=875.61 +0.83835=876.44835.

So total is 5589 +876.44835=6465.44835 MeV, which is 6.46544835 GeV.

So E=gamma * m c² = (25/7) *6.46544835.

Compute 25/7 =3.57142857.

So 3.57142857 *6.46544835.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *6.46544835.

We can compute this as:

3.57142857 ×6.46544835.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, multiply 3 ×6.46544835=19.39634505.

Then, 0.57142857 ×6.46544835.

0.5 ×6.46544835=3.232724175.

0.07142857 ×6.46544835 ≈0.461884.

So 3.232724175 +0.461884=3.694608175.

Adding to the 3 * part: 19.39634505 +3.694608175=23.09095322 GeV.

So approximately 23.091 GeV.

But the option B is 23.069 GeV. Hmm, which is about 23.07.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass energy is 6.465 GeV, but I'm getting a bit more precise calculation. Let me compute with more decimals.

Wait, perhaps using more precise gamma.

Alternatively, let me compute (25/7) *6.46544835 exactly.

25/7 is approximately 3.571428571428571.

Multiplying by 6.46544835:

Let me compute 6.46544835 ×3.571428571428571.

Breaking it down:

6 ×3.571428571428571 =21.428571428571425.

0.46544835 ×3.571428571428571.

Compute 0.4 ×3.57142857=1.428571428.

0.06544835 ×3.571428571428571.

0.06 ×3.57142857=0.214285714.

0.00544835 ×3.57142857= approx 0.01942857.

So 0.214285714 +0.01942857=0.233714284.

So 0.46544835 ×3.57142857= approx 1.428571428 +0.233714284=1.662285712.

So total E=21.428571428571425 +1.662285712≈23.09085714 GeV.

So approximately 23.09086 GeV.

Which is close to 23.091 GeV.

But the option B is 23.069 GeV, which is about 0.022 GeV lower.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the relativistic energy formula with exact calculations.

Wait, perhaps the speed is given as 0.96c, and I should compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, another approach: gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 )=1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

But perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise calculation, but I think 3.57142857 is correct.

Wait, perhaps the mass is not exactly 6.9409 u. Let me check the exact value of Li-6.

Upon checking, the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.94094026 u. So perhaps I should use this precise value.

So 6.94094026 u ×931.5 MeV/u = ?

Compute 6 ×931.5=5589 MeV.

0.94094026 ×931.5 MeV.

Compute 0.94 ×931.5=876.39.

0.00094026 ×931.5= approx 0.8763.

So total for 0.94094026 is 876.39 +0.8763=877.2663 MeV.

So total mass is 5589 +877.2663=6466.2663 MeV, which is 6.4662663 GeV.

So E=gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *6.4662663 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.57142857 ×6.4662663.

3 ×6.4662663=19.3988.

0.57142857 ×6.4662663.

0.5 ×6.4662663=3.23313315.

0.07142857 ×6.4662663≈0.4616466.

So total 3.23313315 +0.4616466=3.69477975.

So E=19.3988 +3.69477975=23.09357975 GeV.

Approximately 23.0936 GeV.

Still, the closest option is B)23.069 GeV, but it's about 0.024 GeV difference. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should take into account the exact value of the speed, perhaps using more precise calculation for gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma with more precise calculation.

v=0.96c.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

Compute (0.96)^2=0.9216.

1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So no, no error here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact formula for gamma.

gamma = (1 - (v²/c²))^-0.5.

v=0.96c, so v²/c²=0.9216.

So gamma=1/(1 -0.9216)^0.5=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Hmm, I think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question wants the kinetic energy, not the total energy? No, the question says "energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)" which typically refers to the total energy per particle.

Wait, but the question says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So it's the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy.

Wait, no, the total energy is gamma m c², which is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy.

So perhaps the options are correct, and I have a miscalculation.

Wait, let me check the rest mass energy again.

Li-6's mass is 6.94094026 u.

Each u is 931.5 MeV/c².

So 6.94094026 ×931.5 = ?

Compute 6 ×931.5=5589.

0.94094026 ×931.5:

Compute 0.94 ×931.5=876.39.

0.00094026 ×931.5=approx 0.8766.

So total 876.39 +0.8766=877.2666 MeV.

So total mass is 5589 +877.2666=6466.2666 MeV=6.4662666 GeV.

Now, compute gamma * m c².

gamma=3.57142857.

3.57142857 ×6.4662666.

Let me compute this accurately.

3 ×6.4662666=19.3988.

0.57142857 ×6.4662666.

Compute 0.5 ×6.4662666=3.2331333.

0.07142857 ×6.4662666.

Let me compute 0.07 ×6.4662666=0.452638662.

0.00142857 ×6.4662666≈0.00923294.

So sum is 0.452638662 +0.00923294=0.4618716.

So 3.2331333 +0.4618716=3.6950049.

Now, E=19.3988 +3.6950049=23.0938049 GeV.

Approx 23.0938 GeV.

Looking at the options, option B is 23.069, which is about 0.025 GeV less.

Hmm, perhaps the actual rest mass is slightly less. Let me think—maybe the actual binding energy is a bit higher, making the rest mass energy lower.

Wait, the binding energy for Li-6 is about 6.94 MeV. Wait, that's the binding energy per nucleus.

Wait, no, the binding energy for a nucleus is the energy released when the nucleus is formed, so the mass is reduced by the binding energy divided by c².

So for Li-6, the mass is 6.9409 u.

The binding energy is the mass defect times c².

So the binding energy is (6.9409 u -6 u *1u) *931.5 MeV/u.

Wait, 6 u would be 6 *1.00727
