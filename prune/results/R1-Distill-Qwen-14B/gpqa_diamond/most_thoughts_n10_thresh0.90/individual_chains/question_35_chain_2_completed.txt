Okay, so I've got this problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit rusty on angular momentum in quantum mechanics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that Ay is a 2x2 matrix operator given by c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), right? And S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row [0, -i] and the second row [i, 0]. Oh wait, that S matrix looks familiar. Isn't that similar to the Pauli matrices? Let me recall. The Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. Oh, so S must be the Pauli Y matrix. So then, Ay is c times the Pauli Y matrix.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are used in spin-1/2 systems, like electrons. Since muons are also spin-1/2 particles, this makes sense.

So, the eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ. We need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

First, let's figure out what Ay looks like. c is h/(4π), so Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. Let me compute that matrix.

Actually, maybe it's easier to find the eigenvalues of S first and then scale by c. Because Ay is just c multiplied by S, so their eigenvalues are related by the same scaling.

S is the Pauli Y matrix. The eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1. So the eigenvalues of S are +1 and -1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay would be c * 1 and c * (-1), which is c and -c.

Wait, let's double-check. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So for Ay = c * S, the eigenvalues a would be c*(±1) = ±c. What's c? c = h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). That's a real number, right? Because h is Planck's constant, which is a real number. So the eigenvalues are real.

But let me think again. Wait, S is the Pauli Y matrix, which is Hermitian, so its eigenvalues are real. So Ay is also Hermitian because it's a multiple of a Hermitian matrix. So its eigenvalues must be real. Therefore, the eigenvalues a are real: ±h/(4π).

Looking at the options, the options A and B suggest eigenvalues with both real and imaginary parts. Wait, but if the eigenvalues are real, then the imaginary part should be zero. So options A and B are probably wrong because they mention non-zero imaginary parts.

Wait, the problem says that the eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ. So a must be real because Ay is Hermitian. So the correct eigenvalues are real.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). But since eigenvalues are real, the imaginary parts should be zero. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Imaginary parts are ±1/2, real ±1. Again, imaginary parts not zero. So B is incorrect.

So options C and D are left.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az (the Z-component). Hmm. Well, in quantum mechanics, for angular momentum operators, the square of the angular momentum (like A²) commutes with all components (Ax, Ay, Az), so they share eigenfunctions. So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it's also an eigenfunction of A². So Ay and A² share the same eigenfunctions. But what about Az?

Wait, in the case of spin-1/2 particles, the components don't commute. So eigenfunctions of Ay aren't eigenfunctions of Az. Because [Ay, Az] ≠ 0. So C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A², which is correct, and not of Az, which is also correct. So C could be correct.

Option D says that the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm. I'm a bit confused about what that means. Basis functions for the matrix operator? Maybe it refers to being a basis for the space on which Ay operates. But since Ay is 2x2, its eigenvectors form a basis. But the statement says "the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." Maybe it's suggesting that the eigenvectors are the same as the basis vectors for the matrix. Or perhaps it's saying that the eigenfunctions form a basis. But I'm not sure if that's necessarily correct.

Wait, for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors (if they are two and linearly independent) form a basis. So the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space. So D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Hmm, that seems correct as well. But the matrix operator Ay is defined in terms of these functions; the eigenvectors would form a basis.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So during the calculation, which statement is correct.

So far, from the eigenvalues, we can eliminate A and B. So the possible correct answers are C or D.

Now, looking at option D: the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, I think that's a bit ambiguous. The matrix operator Ay is a 2x2 matrix, so the basis functions are the standard basis vectors, like [1;0] and [0;1]. The eigenvectors are not necessarily the same as these. Unless the matrix is diagonal, which it isn't. Because the matrix S (Pauli Y) is not diagonal. So the eigenvectors are not the standard basis vectors. Therefore, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are not the same as the basis functions (standard basis). So statement D might be incorrect.

Wait, the question says "the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." Ay is a 2x2 matrix, so the basis is the standard basis vectors. But the eigenvectors of Ay are different. Unless the matrix is diagonal, which it isn't. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are not the basis functions of Ay. So D is incorrect.

So that leaves option C as the correct statement. So during the calculation, the correct statement is C.

Wait, another thought: the question is about the operator Ay. Since A² is the square of the angular momentum, which for spin-1/2 is ( (ħ/2)^2 ) * 3 * I, which is a multiple of the identity matrix. So any vector is an eigenfunction of A². Therefore, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². So C is correct.

And because Ay and Az don't commute, the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So C is correct.


The problem involves the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), for a muon, which is represented as a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix operator. The operator is given by \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli Y matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is \( A_y \phi = a \phi \), where \( a \) is the eigenvalue and \( \phi \) is the eigenfunction. To solve this, we first note that the eigenvalues of the Pauli Y matrix \( S \) are \( \pm 1 \). Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are scaled by \( c \), giving \( a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). These eigenvalues are real, as \( A_y \) is Hermitian.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**: This suggests that the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) have both real and imaginary parts, specifically \( \pm 2\pi h \) for the imaginary part and \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \) for the real part. This is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)).

2. **Option B**: This suggests that the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) have imaginary parts \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and real parts \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)).

3. **Option C**: This states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) but not of \( A_z \) (the Z-component of angular momentum). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), so their eigenfunctions are shared. However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).

4. **Option D**: This claims that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is ambiguous and likely incorrect because the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not the same as the standard basis vectors (which form the basis for the \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix space). The eigenfunctions are specific to the operator and its eigenvectors.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) and the operators \( A^2 \) and \( A_z \).

Answer: C
