Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power, or 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r. The options are various power laws like r^3, r^5, etc.

Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh yeah, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. The formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So if the distance increases, the parallax decreases.

So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Let me write that down:

N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in:

N ∝ (d)^5. Because 1/( (1/d) )^5 is d^5. Wait, let's compute that:

1/(plx)^5 = (1/(1/d))^5 = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So I think they're asking about the number per unit distance, which would be the derivative of N with respect to d, maybe?

Wait, wait. Let's think. The number of stars counted in a certain volume probably depends on the density of stars. But in this case, they've given a specific relation to parallax, which relates to distance.

Wait, the initial statement says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k / (plx)^5, where k is a constant. So N is proportional to plx^-5.

But since plx = 1/d, N is proportional to (1/d)^-5, which is d^5. So N = k d^5.

But we're looking for how the number changes with distance, per unit range. So maybe we need to find the rate of change of N with respect to d, which is dN/dd.

If N = k d^5, then dN/dd = 5k d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases as d^4. But wait, the options don't have d^4 as an answer. Wait, let me look at the options again.

Options are:
A) ~ r^3
B) ~ r^5
C) ~ r^4
D) ~ r^2.

Wait, so option C is r^4. So the derivative is proportional to r^4. So the change in number per unit range is proportional to r^4. So the correct answer would be C.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. The number of stars in a region is proportional to 1/plx^5. So N = k (1/plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, N = k d^5. So N increases with d^5.

But the question is about how the number changes with distance. So maybe it's about the number per unit distance, which is the derivative. So, if you have more stars as you go farther, but how quickly does the number increase as you move a small step in distance.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of differential number. How many stars are there in a thin shell between d and d + dr? The number of stars in that shell would be the derivative of N with respect to d, multiplied by dr.

So, for a thin shell, the number of stars dN is proportional to d^5 * dr. Wait, no, wait. If N within a distance d is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars between d and d+dr (the number added when moving a dr distance) would be the derivative of N with respect to d times dr.

So dN = (dN/dd) dr = 5k d^4 dr. So, dN is proportional to d^4 dr. So per unit distance (i.e., per dr), the number of stars added is proportional to d^4.

So the number of stars in a given distance interval (like per parsec) increases as d^4. So the correct option is C, which is r^4. So the answer should be option C.


To determine how the number of stars changes with distance, we start with the given relationship: the number of stars \( N \) varies with parallax \( \text{plx} \) as \( N \propto 1/\text{plx}^5 \). Parallax is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), i.e., \( \text{plx} = 1/d \). Substituting this into the relationship gives:

\[
N \propto d^5
\]

This means the total number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance. However, the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance \( r \). This corresponds to the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( d \), which represents the rate of change of the number of stars per unit distance:

\[
\frac{dN}{dd} = 5k d^4
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( d^4 \). Among the given options, this matches \( r^4 \), where \( r \) represents distance.

**Critical analysis of options:**
- **A) \( r^3 \):** Incorrect, as the relationship involves \( r^4 \), not \( r^3 \).
- **B) \( r^5 \):** Incorrect, as \( r^5 \) represents the total number of stars, not the rate per unit distance.
- **C) \( r^4 \):** Correct, as shown by the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dd} \propto r^4 \).
- **D) \( r^2 \):** Incorrect, as the relationship does not involve \( r^2 \).

The correct answer is \( r^4 \), corresponding to option C.

Answer: C
