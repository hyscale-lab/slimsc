Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me see what it's about. The question is talking about how the number of stars varies with parallax in a specific region of the sky. Hmm.

Wait, the question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power, so N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So I need to find the relationship between N and r (distance), and specifically how it behaves per unit range of r.

I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. The formula, I think, is plx = 1/distance in parsecs. Oh right, yes, because parallax is measured in arcseconds, and it's the reciprocal of the distance in parsecs. So if the distance r is measured in parsecs, then plx is 1/r.

So plx = 1/r. That means r = 1/plx. So as r increases, plx decreases.

The given relationship is N ∝ 1 / plx^5. Since plx is 1/r, substituting that in, 1/plx becomes r. So 1/( (1/r) )^5 would be (r)^5. Wait, let's see:

Let me do that substitution properly. Plugging plx = 1/r into N ∝ 1/(plx^5) gives N ∝ 1/( (1/r)^5 ) = r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars change with distance per unit range. So I think it's asking for the rate of change of N with r, which would be dN/dr. Because per unit distance, like how many more stars you get as you go from r to r+dr, which is proportional to dN/dr multiplied by dr.

So if N ∝ r^5, then dN/dr is proportional to 5 r^4. But wait, the question is about the change per unit range of r, so the number of stars per unit distance. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.

The question says, "How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So perhaps it's the density, like dN/dr. Or maybe it's the number in a shell of thickness dr at radius r, so that would be proportional to r^5 times the volume element, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The total number of stars in a region might depend on the volume, but in this case, perhaps the specific relation given is N ∝ 1/plx^5, which we converted to N ∝ r^5. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars increases as r^5.

But wait, the question is about how it changes with distance per unit range. So maybe it's the rate of change, like how much N changes as you move a small distance dr. So that would be dN/dr.

If N = k r^5, then dN/dr = 5k r^4. So the change in number per unit distance is proportional to r^4. But looking at the options, option C is r^4, but I thought the answer was r^5. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars per unit volume is what's being considered. But I'm not sure. Let me re-examine the setup.

The problem says "number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So N = C / plx^5, where C is a constant. Since plx = 1/r, this becomes N = C r^5. So the total number of stars up to distance r is proportional to r^5. But wait, wait a second. That doesn't make much sense because the volume of a sphere is r^3. So if N scales with r^5, that's faster than the volume. But in reality, the number of stars should scale with volume, but maybe in this specific case, the distribution is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r (i.e., between r and r+dr) would be proportional to the surface area (4π r^2) times the number per unit area in that shell. Or perhaps not, because the question isn't specifying a particular distribution.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous on whether N is the cumulative number up to a distance or the number in a differential shell. Let me think again.

The initial statement says, "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/r, N is proportional to r^5.

But the question is about the change with distance, per unit range. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the change in N with r (dN/dr) is proportional to r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance would be proportional to r^4. So looking at the options, option C is r^4, which would be the answer.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the number density (stars per unit volume) is what's being considered. But in that case, number density would be N / (volume), which would be r^5 / ( (4/3) π r^3 ) ) = (3/(4π)) r^2. But that would make the number density proportional to r², which is option D. But I'm not sure if that's what the question is asking.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the number of stars in a given volume, so as you increase the distance, the volume increases, but the number of stars increases more steeply. But the way the question is phrased, it's about "number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Wait, perhaps the "number of stars per unit distance" is the rate of change, so that would be dN/dr. If N = k r^5, then dN/dr = 5k r^4. So the number of stars in a small distance dr is proportional to r^4.

Looking at the options, option C is r^4.

So the correct answer should be C) ~ r^4.


The question involves determining how the number of stars in a specific region of the sky changes with distance, given that the number of stars varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is related to distance (\( r \)) by \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \), substituting this into the given relationship gives \( N \propto r^5 \). 

The question asks specifically about the change in the number of stars with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)), which corresponds to the rate of change \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). If \( N \propto r^5 \), then \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4 \). Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( r^4 \).

Among the options provided:
- **A) \( \sim r^3 \)**: Incorrect, as this does not match the derived relationship.
- **B) \( \sim r^5 \)**: Incorrect, as this represents the total number of stars, not the rate of change per unit distance.
- **C) \( \sim r^4 \)**: Correct, as \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto r^4 \).
- **D) \( \sim r^2 \)**: Incorrect, as this does not align with the given relationship.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as the number of stars per unit distance increases proportionally to \( r^4 \).

Answer: C
