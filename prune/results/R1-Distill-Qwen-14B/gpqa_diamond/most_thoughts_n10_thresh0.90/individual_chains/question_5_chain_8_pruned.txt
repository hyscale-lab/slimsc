Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of operators and eigenvectors. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Hmm. I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and their eigenvectors represent the possible states when a measurement of that observable is made.

The operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down to get a clear picture.

Px = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Wait, so these are the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. Pauli matrices are used for spin-1/2 particles, like electrons or muons. Right, because the muon has spin 1/2.

The operator in question is vector P, which I think is the sum of its components in the direction of n. Since n is in the x-z plane, its direction can be described using an angle θ from the z-axis and φ from the x-axis. But wait, in the x-z plane, φ would be 0 or π, so maybe the direction is just determined by θ, the polar angle. Or perhaps φ is arbitrary but it's in the x-z plane, so maybe φ is 0 or π/2. Hmm, actually, since n is in the x-z plane, its direction can be represented by angles (θ, φ=0) or maybe (θ, φ=π) depending on the direction. Wait, no, the x-z plane implies φ=0 or φ=π when considering spherical coordinates. So in terms of direction, n can be any point on the circle where y=0. That is, the direction is given by an angle θ from the z-axis and φ=0 or φ=π, but maybe it's sufficient to just say that the direction is in
