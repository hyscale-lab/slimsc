Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Alright, the problem is about the formation of cobalt thiocyanato complexes and finding the percentage of a particular blue complex. Let's see what the question says.

So, the solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2 complex, but maybe it's another one. Wait, what's the blue complex? Oh, right, the blue one is probably the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex. I'm a bit unsure, but I'll proceed.

Stability constants, β, are for the formation of complexes. The general formula for each complex would be Co(SCN)_n, where n is the number of SCN- ions attached. So βn is the formation constant for the nth complex.

Wait, the way the stability constants are given, β1 is for Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)_2, β3 for Co(SCN)_3, and β4 for Co(SCN)_4. Hmm, but wait, the β values are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that seems a bit odd because β3 is higher than β2, but β4 is lower than β3. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the order.

Wait, the stability constants usually increase with the number of ligands up to a certain point because each additional ligand adds more stability. But maybe the complexes have different structures. Alternatively, perhaps β4 refers to a different complex, perhaps a different oxidation state, but no, the question says Co(II) ions.

Wait, the problem is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ions. So the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

So I need to find the fraction of Co that is in the form of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+. But wait, perhaps I need to consider all possible Co species and then find the fraction that is the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex.

Wait, the total Co concentration is given as 1e-2 M. But wait, in solution, Co could exist as free Co^2+ ions or as various complexes. The thiocyanate can also be in different forms, but since SCN- is present in 0.1 M, which is a higher concentration than the Co, I think the Co will form complexes.

So the approach is probably to consider all possible complexes and calculate their concentrations using the stability constants and the given concentrations.

The general approach for this kind of problem is:

1. Write all possible complexes that can form given the number of SCN- ions attached. For Co(II), the possible complexes are Co^2+, [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^- , [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me think about the charges. Co^2+ is +2.

Each SCN- is -1. So each complex would have a charge of:

- [Co(SCN)]^+ → Co^2+ + SCN^- → charge is 2+ -1 = +1 → so β1 is for +1 charge.
Similarly, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 → Co^2+ + 2SCN^- → 2+ -2 = 0 → neutral complex. β2 is for this.
[Co(SCN)_3]^- → 2+ -3 = -1 → β3.
[Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} → 2+ -4 = -2 → β4.

Hmm, that makes sense. So the four complexes are Co^2+ (n=0), [Co(SCN)]^+ (n=1), [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (n=2), [Co(SCN)_3]^- (n=3), [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} (n=4).

But wait, the β values given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So β3 is the highest, which suggests that the third complex is the most stable. Hmm, but then β4 is lower, so maybe the fourth complex isn't as stable as the third.

But the problem is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is the n=2 complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So I need to find the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 relative to all other Co species.

The method to calculate this is to model the distribution of Co between the various complexes. This involves setting up the mass balance equation, considering the formation of each complex from the free Co^2+ and SCN-.

The general expression for each complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} is given by:

βn [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} = [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n

So each complex's concentration is proportional to [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n / βn.

But wait, no, the formation of the complex is:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} ; Kf = βn.

So the concentration of the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n / (1 + sum over all possible βm [SCN^-]^m [Co^2+] )

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the method of successive approximations or set up the equilibrium expressions.

Alternatively, since the concentration of SCN- is much higher than Co (0.1 M vs 1e-2 M), perhaps the assumption can be made that [SCN^-] is approximately constant. But I'm not sure if that's valid here.

But let's proceed step by step.

First, let me denote:

Let’s define x as [Co^2+], which is the free ion concentration.

Then, the various complex concentrations can be written in terms of x and [SCN^-].

But wait, the total Co concentration is given as c = 1e-2 M. So, the sum of all Co species must equal this.

So:

c = x + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

Each complex can be expressed as:

[Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 x [SCN^-] / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

Similarly for the other complexes.

Hmm, but this approach could get complicated because each complex's concentration depends on x, which is the free Co^2+ concentration.

Alternatively, we can express each complex concentration in terms of x, then set the sum equal to c, which allows solving for x.

Let me write each complex concentration in terms of x.

[Co(SCN)]^+ = (β1 x [S]^1 ) / (1 + β1 S + β2 S^2 + β3 S^3 + β4 S^4 )

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = (β2 x [S]^2 ) / denominator

Similarly,

[Co(SCN)_3]^- = (β3 x [S]^3 ) / denominator

[Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} = (β4 x [S]^4 ) / denominator

Where S is [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

The denominator is (1 + β1 S + β2 S^2 + β3 S^3 + β4 S^4 )

So, the total cobalt concentration is:

x + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} = c

Which can be written as:

x + (β1 S x + β2 S^2 x + β3 S^3 x + β4 S^4 x ) / denominator = c

Factor out x:

x [ 1 + (β1 S + β2 S^2 + β3 S^3 + β4 S^4 ) / denominator ] = c

Wait, the denominator is (1 + β1 S + β2 S^2 + β3 S^3 + β4 S^4 ), so we can write the above as:

x [ (denominator) + (β1 S + β2 S^2 + β3 S^3 + β4 S^4 ) ) ] / denominator = c

Wait, wait, that's not correct. Let me think again.

Wait, the denominator is D = 1 + β1 S + β2 S^2 + β3 S^3 + β4 S^4

So the sum of the complexes is [ β1 S x + β2 S^2 x + β3 S^3 x + β4 S^4 x ] / D

So, the total Co is x (free) plus (β1 S x + β2 S^2 x + β3 S^3 x + β4 S^4 x) / D = c.

Which can be written as:

x [ 1 + (β1 S + β2 S^2 + β3 S^3 + β4 S^4 ) / D ] = c

But D = 1 + β1 S + β2 S^2 + β3 S^3 + β4 S^4

So, the term inside the brackets is [ 1 + (D - 1) / D ]

Wait, because D = 1 + ... So (β1 S ... ) is (D -1).

So, [1 + (D -1)/D ] = [ (D + D -1 ) / D ] → Not sure. Let's see:

Wait,

[1 + (β1 S + β2 S^2 + β3 S^3 + β4 S^4 ) / D ]

But β1 S + ... = D - 1, so:

1 + (D -1)/D = [ D + D -1 ] / D = [ 2D -1 ] / D.

Wait, no. Let me compute:

1 + ( (D -1) ) / D = 1 + 1 - (1/D) ) → 2 - (1/D).

Yes, because D =1 + sum, so sum = D -1.

So,

x [ 2 - (1/D) ] = c

So,

x = c / [ 2 - (1/D) ]

Hmm, that's manageable. Now, let's compute D.

Given S=0.1 M,

Compute each term:

β1 S = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

β2 S^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4

β3 S^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063

β4 S^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016

So,

D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 =

Let's calculate step by step.

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3

2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363

2.363 + 0.0016 = 2.3646

So D ≈ 2.3646.

Now, compute 2 - (1/D):

1/D ≈ 1/2.3646 ≈ 0.4223

2 - 0.4223 ≈ 1.5777

So,

x = c / 1.5777

c is 1e-2, so x ≈ (1e-2) / 1.5777 ≈ 0.00634 M.

Wait, but let me compute this more accurately.

Wait, 1/2.3646:

Let me compute 2.3646 * 0.4223 → 2.3646 * 0.4223 ≈ approximately 1. So 2.3646 ≈ 1/0.4223.

So, 1/D is 0.4223, so 2 - 0.4223=1.5777.

So, x ≈ (0.01) / 1.5777 ≈ approximately 0.00634 M.

Now, with x known, we can compute the concentration of each complex.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the formula. Let me recheck.

Wait, the total Co is x (free) plus the sum of all complexes, which we have as (β1 S x + β2 S^2 x + ... ) / D.

So, the sum is [ x * (β1 S + β2 S^2 + β3 S^3 + β4 S^4) ] / D.

Which is x * (D -1) / D.

Because D = 1 + sum, so sum = D-1.

So, sum of complexes is x (D-1)/ D.

So the total Co is x + x (D-1)/D = x [ 1 + (D-1)/D ].

Which is x [ (D + D-1) / D ] → x [ (2D -1)/D ]

So,

x = c * D / (2D -1 )

Wait, let me rederive:

Total Co = x + sum_of_complexes.

Sum_of_complexes = x (sum of (βn S^n )) / D → x (D-1) / D.

So,

Total Co = x + x (D-1)/D = x (1 + (D-1)/D ) = x ( D + D -1 ) / D ) = x (2D -1 ) / D.

So,

x = c * D / (2D -1 )

Ah, that's better. So,

x = c * D / (2D -1 )

Given c=1e-2, D=2.3646,

x = (1e-2) * 2.3646 / (2*2.3646 -1 )

Compute denominator: 2*2.3646=4.7292 → 4.7292 -1=3.7292.

So,

x = (0.01 * 2.3646) / 3.7292 → 0.023646 / 3.7292 ≈ 0.00634 M.

Same as before.

Now, the concentration of each complex is:

[Co(SCN)_n] = (βn S^n x ) / D.

We need the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is (β2 S^2 x ) / D.

So, let's compute β2 S^2 x / D.

β2=40, S=0.1 → S^2=0.01 → 40*0.01=0.4.

x=0.00634.

So,

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = (0.4 * 0.00634) / 2.3646.

Compute numerator: 0.4 * 0.00634 ≈ 0.002536.

Divide by 2.3646 → 0.002536 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.001072 M.

But wait, let's compute more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the fraction of each complex relative to the total.

The fraction f_n for each complex is (βn S^n x ) / ( D x + βn S^n x )

Wait, no, the total is x (free) + sum of all complexes. So the fraction is (βn S^n x ) / ( D x ), because the denominator for each complex is D, and x is factored out.

Alternatively, the fraction for each complex is (βn S^n x ) / (sum of all (βm S^m x )) → which is (βn S^n ) / (sum of βm S^m )

Because x cancels out.

Wait, because when considering the fraction of a complex, it's the concentration of that complex divided by the total Co concentration.

Total Co concentration is c = x (2D-1)/D → but perhaps the fraction can be calculated as (βn S^n ) / (sum of βm S^m + D )

Wait, no, perhaps another approach. Let me think.

Each complex's concentration is (βn S^n x ) / D.

The total Co is x + sum (βm S^m x / D ) = x (1 + (sum βm S^m ) / D )

But sum βm S^m is D -1, so 1 + (D-1)/D = (D + D -1)/D = (2D-1)/D.

Which we already used.

So, the fraction f for each complex is [ (βn S^n x ) / D ] / c.

Because c is the total Co concentration, which is [Co^2+] + sum [complexes].

So,

f_n = (βn S^n x ) / ( D c )

But x = c D / (2D - 1 )

So,

f_n = (βn S^n * (c D/(2D-1)) ) / ( D c )

Simplify:

= βn S^n / (2D -1 )

Because c cancels, D cancels.

So,

f_n = βn S^n / (2D -1 )

Now, for n=2,

f_2 = β2 S^2 / (2D -1 )

Which is β2=40, S^2=0.01 → 40 *0.01=0.4.

Denominator: 2D-1 = 2*2.3646 -1 = 4.7292 -1=3.7292.

So,

f_2 = 0.4 / 3.7292 ≈ 0.10725, or about 10.725%.

Wait, but the options are A to D, and none is around 10%. Hmm, that's a problem. Perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, but wait, the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ which is the n=2 complex, but wait, in the initial setup, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is neutral. So perhaps the question refers to the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex, but that would be n=3, because each SCN- is -1. Wait, no: [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ → Co is +2, each SCN is -1, so 2+ + 2*(-1) → 0 charge. Wait, no, [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the charge calculation.

Wait, Co^2+ + 2 SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

So, the complex is neutral. So, the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So that's n=2.

So, according to the calculation, the fraction is 0.10725, about 10.7%, but the options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Hmm, that doesn't match any options. So probably I messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the stability constants are given in a different way. For example, sometimes, the stability constant (β) is for the formation of the complex from the ions. So for [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}, the formation reaction is:

Co^{2+} + n SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}, with Kf = βn.

Wait, perhaps I need to correct the equation.

Wait, the formation constant βn is given by:

βn = [ [Co(SCN)_n^{2-n} ] ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n )

So, [Co(SCN)_n^{2-n}] = βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

So, the concentration of each complex is βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

So, the total Co is [Co^2+] + sum ( βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n ) for n=1 to 4.

Let’s denote [Co^2+] as x.

Total Co = x + x (β1 S + β2 S^2 + β3 S^3 + β4 S^4 )

So,

c = x ( 1 + β1 S + β2 S^2 + β3 S^3 + β4 S^4 )

So,

x = c / ( 1 + β1 S + β2 S^2 + β3 S^3 + β4 S^4 )

Which is x = c / D, where D = 1 + sum βn S^n.

So, with D=2.3646, x=0.01/2.3646 ≈ 0.004223 M.

Now, the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is β2 S^2 x.

So,

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 S^2 x = 40 * (0.1)^2 * (0.004223 )

= 40 * 0.01 * 0.004223 = 0.4 * 0.004223 ≈ 0.001689 M.

The total Co concentration is 0.01 M. So the fraction is 0.001689 / 0.01 = 0.1689, which is 16.89%, approximately 16.9%. That's option D.

Ah, I see where I went wrong earlier. Initially, I thought x was 0.00634, but that was under a different approach. But the correct approach is that x is c/D, which is 0.01 /2.3646≈0.004223.

So the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is 0.001689, which is 16.89% of the total Co, which is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but let me recheck.

So, D is 1 + (9*0.1) + (40*0.01) + (63*0.001) + (16*0.0001)

=1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.

x = c / D → 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004223 M.

Then, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 * S^2 * x = 40 * 0.01 * 0.004223 = 40 * 0.00004223 ≈ 0.001689 M.

So, 0.001689 / 0.01 = 0.1689 → 16.89%, which is option D.

So the correct answer should be D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the equilibrium distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants and concentrations.

### Key Information:
- **Total cobalt concentration**: \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \)
- **Thiocyanate concentration**: \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \)
- **Stability constants**: \( \beta_1 = 9 \), \( \beta_2 = 40 \), \( \beta_3 = 63 \), \( \beta_4 = 16 \)

### Approach:
1. **Equilibrium Distribution**: Cobalt exists in various forms: \( \text{Co}^{2+} \), \( [\text{Co(SCN)}]^+ \), \( [\text{Co(SCN)_2}]^0 \), \( [\text{Co(SCN)_3}]^- \), \( [\text{Co(SCN)_4}]^{2-} \). The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all these species.

2. **Stability Constant Relation**: For each complex \( [\text{Co(SCN)_n}]^{2-n} \), the formation constant is given by:
   \[
   \beta_n = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)_n}^{2-n}]}{[\text{Co}^{2+}][\text{SCN}^-]^n}
   \]
   Rearranging, the concentration of each complex is:
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)_n}^{2-n}] = \beta_n [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^n
   \]

3. **Total Cobalt Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration is:
   \[
   c = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + \sum_{n=1}^4 [\text{Co(SCN)_n}^{2-n}]
   \]
   Substituting the expressions for each complex:
   \[
   c = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{Co}^{2+}] \sum_{n=1}^4 \beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n
   \]
   Factoring out \( [\text{Co}^{2+}] \):
   \[
   c = [\text{Co}^{2+}] \left( 1 + \sum_{n=1}^4 \beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n \right)
   \]
   Let \( D = 1 + \sum_{n=1}^4 \beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n \). Then:
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] = \frac{c}{D}
   \]

4. **Fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0**: The concentration of \( [\text{Co(SCN)_2}]^0 \) is:
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)_2}]^0 = \beta_2 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^2
   \]
   Substituting \( [\text{Co}^{2+}] = \frac{c}{D} \):
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)_2}]^0 = \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 \frac{c}{D}
   \]
   The fraction of \( [\text{Co(SCN)_2}]^0 \) relative to the total cobalt concentration is:
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)_2}]^0}{c} = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{D}
   \]

### Calculations:
1. **Compute \( D \):**
   \[
   D = 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4
   \]
   Substituting values:
   \[
   D = 1 + (9)(0.1) + (40)(0.01) + (63)(0.001) + (16)(0.0001)
   \]
   \[
   D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

2. **Compute \( f_2 \):**
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{D}
   \]
   Substituting \( \beta_2 = 40 \) and \( [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = (0.1)^2 = 0.01 \):
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{40 \cdot 0.01}{2.3646} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.1689
   \]

3. **Convert to Percentage:**
   \[
   f_2 \times 100 = 0.1689 \times 100 = 16.89\%
   \]

### Final Answer:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, \( [\text{Co(SCN)_2}]^0 \), among all cobalt-containing species is approximately **16.9%**.

**Answer: D**
