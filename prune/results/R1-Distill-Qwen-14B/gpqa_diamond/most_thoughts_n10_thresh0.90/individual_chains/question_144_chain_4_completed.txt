--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about a meson resonance called X. I remember that mesons are particles made up of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances in particle physics are unstable particles that decay quickly. The question is asking for the mean decay distance of this meson X.

The given data are:
- Production energy, E_X = 8 GeV
- Mass, m_X = 1.2 GeV
- Width, Γ_X = 320 MeV

And there are four options provided, all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters. So I need to calculate the mean decay distance and choose the correct option.

Hmm, I think the mean decay distance depends on how long the particle lives on average before decaying. The longer it lives, the further it travels before decaying. But how do I calculate that?

I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its decay width. The decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by the equation Γ = ħ / τ. Wait, or is it Γ = ħ τ? Wait, no, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that the uncertainty in energy (Γ) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (τ) is about ħ, so Γ ≈ ħ / τ. Or maybe Γ is the total decay rate, which is ħ times the decay width in natural units. Wait, I might be getting this mixed up.

Wait, I think the formula for the mean lifetime τ is τ = ħ / Γ. Oh wait, no. Because in natural units (where ħ = c = 1), the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ τ. So τ = ħ / Γ, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think.

Wait, more accurately, the lifetime τ is related to the total decay width Γ by τ = ħ / (Γ). Because the width is the uncertainty in energy, which is inverse time, so the product is ħ. So yes, τ = ħ / Γ. That makes sense.

But wait, natural units have ħ = 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So I'll need to use that conversion factor.

Once I have the lifetime τ, I can find the mean decay distance by multiplying the velocity of the particle by the lifetime. So the mean decay distance L is L = v * τ.

So the steps I need to do are:
1. Calculate the lifetime τ using τ = ħ / Γ.
2. Find the velocity v of the meson X.
3. Multiply v by τ to get L.

Wait, how do I find the velocity? Since it's a relativistic particle, I can use the energy-momentum relation. The production energy is given as E_X = 8 GeV. The mass of X is 1.2 GeV. So the energy is much larger than the mass, so it's definitely moving at a relativistic speed.

The energy of a relativistic particle is E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. But since we're working in natural units where c=1, E = γ m.

The momentum p can be found from E² = (p c)² + (m c²)². Again, in natural units, E² = p² + m². So p = sqrt(E² - m²).

Wait, but in natural units, c is 1, so the equation is correct. So let's compute p.

E_X = 8 GeV, m_X = 1.2 GeV.

So p = sqrt( (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 ) GeV. Let's compute that.

8 squared is 64, 1.2 squared is 1.44. So 64 - 1.44 = 62.56. The square root of 62.56 is about 7.91 (since 7.9^2 is 62.41, 7.91^2 is roughly 62.56). So p is approximately 7.91 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Is the production energy the same as the energy of the meson? I think so. Because the meson is produced with that energy. So E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV.

Once I have p, the velocity v can be found using the relation p = γ m v. Because in natural units, p = γ m v. So solving for v: v = p/(γ m).

Alternatively, since E = γ m, gamma is E/m. So γ = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

So, v = p / (γ m). Let's compute that.

p is 7.91 GeV, gamma is 6.6667, m is 1.2 GeV.

v = (7.91) / (6.6667 * 1.2) = ?

Compute denominator: 6.6667 * 1.2 = 8. So 7.91 /8 = 0.98875. So v ≈ 0.98875 c, which is about 0.989 times the speed of light. So v ≈ 0.989 c.

Wait, but in natural units, c is 1, so when I compute v, it's in units of c. So I can write v ≈ 0.989, which is 0.989 c.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. Let me compute gamma again: E =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV, so gamma is 8/1.2 = 6.666666..., which is 20/3. So gamma is 20/3.

p is sqrt(8^2 - 1.2^2) = sqrt(64 -1.44)=sqrt(62.56).

Calculating sqrt(62.56): 7.91 because 7.9^2=62.41, 7.91^2= (7.9 +0.01)^2 = 7.9^2 + 2*7.9*0.01 + (0.01)^2 = 62.41 + 0.158 + 0.0001=62.5681. So sqrt(62.56)=7.91 GeV.

So p=7.91 GeV.

Then v= p/(gamma m) =7.91 / ( (20/3) * 1.2 ) .

Wait, let me compute the denominator:

(20/3) * 1.2 = (20/3) * (6/5) ) [since 1.2=6/5], so (20/3)*(6/5) )= (20*6)/(3*5) )= (120)/(15)=8.

So denominator is 8 GeV.

So v=7.91 GeV /8 GeV = 0.98875. So v≈0.98875 c.

Wait, that's about 0.989c, so v is approximately 0.989 times the speed of light.

So now, the lifetime tau is ħ / Γ. We have to make sure the units are consistent.

Given that Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ=0.32 GeV.

But ħ in GeV·s is approximately 6.582 ×10^-25 GeV·s. So:

tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s ≈ ?

Let me compute that: 6.582e-25 /0.32 = (6.582 /0.32) * 1e-25.

6.582 /0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So tau ≈ 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, no—wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32. Let me compute 6.582e-25 / 0.32.

6.582 / 0.32 is 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s.

So tau is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Now, the mean decay distance L is v * tau.

v is approximately 0.98875 c. The speed of light c is about 3e8 meters per second.

So L = v * tau = 0.98875 * c * tau.

Let me compute that.

0.98875 * 3e8 m/s = approximately 2.96625e8 m/s.

Multiply by tau (2.056875e-24 s):

2.96625e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = ?

Let me compute 2.96625e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Multiplying the coefficients: 2.96625 * 2.056875 ≈ let's see.

2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375

0.96625 * 2.056875 ≈ let's compute 0.96 * 2.056875 ≈ 1.974, and 0.00625 * 2.056875≈ 0.012855469. So total approx 1.974 + 0.012855 = 1.986855. So total is approximately 4.11375 + 1.986855 = around 6.1006.

But wait, more accurately, 2.96625 * 2.056875. Let's compute 2 * 2.056875=4.11375. 0.96625 * 2.056875.

Let me compute 0.96625 *2 = 1.9325.

0.96625 * 0.056875 = approximately:

0.96625 *0.05 = 0.0483125,

0.96625 *0.006875 ≈ 0.0066359375.

Adding those: 0.0483125 + 0.0066359375 = 0.0549484375.

So 0.96625 *2.056875 = 1.9325 + 0.0549484375 = 1.9874484375.

So total 2.96625 *2.056875 ≈4.11375 + 1.9874484375 =6.1011984375.

So the product is 6.1011984375e(8-24) = 6.1011984375e-16 meters.

Wait, but wait, in the exponents: 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16. So 6.101e-16 meters.

But wait, the options are around 5e-15 and 4e-16. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, let me re-do the calculation step by step because I might have messed up the exponents.

Wait, the calculation is (2.96625e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) ) = (2.96625 * 2.056875) * 1e8 * 1e-24 = (approx 6.10) * 1e-16 meters.

So that's 6.1e-16 meters, which is 6.1 ×10^-16 m.

But looking at the options, the closest I see is option A:5.0223e-16 m and D:4.0655e-16 m.

Wait, but I got approximately 6.1e-16 m. That's not matching any option. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, wait. Maybe I should double-check the mean decay length formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should be using the velocity as v = p/(E), since for relativistic particles, v ≈ (p c^2)/E when E ≫ m c². Wait, but in natural units, v = p c / E, since E = gamma m c², and p = gamma m v. So v = (p c)/(gamma m c²) )= (p/(gamma m)) c. Wait, maybe I should approach it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute beta (β) as v/c. Then, beta = p c / E. Because E = gamma m c², and p = gamma m v. So v = (p c) / (gamma m), but E = gamma m c², so gamma m = E/(c²). So v = (p c) / (E/(c²)) ) * c^2? Wait, perhaps I should use beta = v/c = (p c^2) / E.

Wait, yes, actually, beta is (p c)/E. Because for a relativistic particle, E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2. So p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2). So beta = [sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) ] / E.

In natural units where c=1, beta = sqrt( E² - m² ) / E.

So in our case, E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So beta = sqrt(64 -1.44) /8 = sqrt(62.56)/8 ≈ 7.91/8 ≈ 0.98875, which matches what I had earlier. So v = 0.98875 c.

Hmm. So that part is correct.

So back to the decay length. So decay length L = v * tau.

Tau is ħ / Γ. But wait, I think I might have the formula wrong. Because the mean lifetime is tau = ħ / Γ, but decay length is L = c * beta * tau. Because v = beta c, so v * tau = beta c tau.

So L = beta * c * tau.

Tau is ħ / Γ, so L = beta c (ħ / Γ).

So wait, let me recompute.

Beta is 0.98875, c is 3e8 m/s.

Tau is ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 /0.32 = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So L = beta * c * tau = 0.98875 *3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by beta (0.98875):

6.170625e-16 * 0.98875 ≈ 6.1e-16 m.

Wait, same as before. So it's about 6.1e-16 meters. But the options are 5e-16 and 4e-16. Hmm, none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, maybe I should use more precise values for ħ. Let me check.

The value of ħ is approximately 6.582 ×10^-25 GeV·s. Let me use that precise value.

So ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

Tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 = ?

Let me compute 6.582 / 0.32. 0.32 * 20 =6.4, 0.32*20.56875=6.582. So yes, 6.582 /0.32 =20.56875.

So tau=20.56875e-25 seconds? Wait, no. Wait, 6.582e-25 /0.32 =20.56875e-25? Wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 /0.32) *1e-25. 6.582/0.32 is 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So that's correct.

Then, beta is 0.98875, c is 3e8 m/s.

So L =0.98875 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 3*2.056875 = 6.170625, then 1e8 *1e-24 = 1e-16, so 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by 0.98875: 6.170625e-16 *0.98875.

Compute 6.170625 *0.98875.

Let me compute that:

6.170625 * 0.98875 = ?

I can compute 6 *0.98875 =5.9325

0.170625 *0.98875 ≈ approximately 0.170625 * ~0.99 ≈ 0.1689.

So total approx 5.9325 +0.1689=6.1014.

So L≈6.1014e-16 m.

But the options don't have this. So what's going on? Am I missing something?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the mean decay length is given by L = c * beta * gamma * tau. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps I should be using the proper time instead.

Wait, another approach: the mean path length is L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Wait, no, because tau is the proper lifetime, the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. The time experienced in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. So the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau.

So the time the particle lives in the lab frame is t = gamma * tau.

Wait, so L = v * t = v * gamma tau.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Because v = beta c, and t = gamma tau.

So L = beta c * gamma tau.

Which is the same as gamma beta c tau.

Hmm, let me think. Because in the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is longer by a factor of gamma. So the time it lives is gamma * tau. So the distance it travels is v * gamma tau.

Which is beta c * gamma tau.

Which is gamma beta c tau.

So perhaps earlier I forgot to account for gamma.

Wait, that's a possibility. I think I missed the gamma factor in the lifetime.

So let's recalculate.

Tau is the proper lifetime, the lifetime in the particle's rest frame: tau = ħ / Gamma.

In the lab frame, the lifetime is t = gamma * tau.

So the decay distance L is v * t = beta c * gamma tau.

So L = beta gamma c tau.

So I need to compute beta, gamma, and tau.

Beta we have as 0.98875.

Gamma is E / m c². But in natural units, E = gamma m, so gamma = E/m.

E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV, so gamma = 8/1.2 ≈6.666666667.

So gamma = 6.666666667 ≈20/3.

So L = beta * gamma * c * tau.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So compute all together.

So L = (0.98875) * (6.666666667) * (3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s).

Compute step by step.

First, compute 0.98875 *6.666666667.

0.98875 *6.666666667 ≈ let's see:

6.666666667 is 20/3.

20/3 *0.98875 ≈ (20 *0.98875)/3 ≈ 19.775 /3 ≈6.5916667.

So approximately 6.5916667.

Then, multiply this by 3e8 m/s and 2.056875e-24 s.

So 6.5916667 * 3e8 = 1.9775e9.

Then multiply by 2.056875e-24 s:

Wait, no, let me think.

Wait, the terms are [0.98875 *6.666666667 *3e8 *2.056875e-24].

Wait, another way: (0.98875 * 6.666666667) = approximately 6.591666667.

Multiply 6.591666667 * 3e8 = 1.9775e9.

Then multiply by 2.056875e-24:

1.9775e9 * 2.056875e-24 = ?

Multiply 1.9775 *2.056875 ≈4.072.

Then, 1e9 *1e-24=1e-15.

So 4.072e-15 meters.

Wait, that's approximately 4.07e-15 m. Looking back at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, option C is 5.02e-15. So 4.07e-15 would be close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m.

So the correct answer would be option B:4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but why did I get a different result earlier when I didn't account for gamma? Because when I included gamma, the distance increased by a factor of gamma (about 6.666), which made the distance about 4e-15, which is option B.

So I think that's the correct approach. The initial mistake was forgetting to include the gamma factor in the lab frame lifetime.

So let's redo the calculations with proper steps:

1. Compute the proper lifetime tau = ħ / Gamma.

Tau = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 2.056875e-24 s.

2. Compute gamma = E / m = 8 / 1.2 ≈6.666666667.

3. Compute beta = sqrt(1 - (m²/E²)) = sqrt(1 - (1.44/64))=sqrt(1 -0.0225)=sqrt(0.9775)=approx 0.98875.

4. Compute L = beta * gamma * c * tau.

So:

beta = 0.98875

gamma =6.666666667

c =3e8 m/s

tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So,

L = 0.98875 * 6.666666667 *3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 0.98875 *6.666666667:

0.98875 *6 =5.9325.

0.98875 *0.666666667≈0.659166666.

Total ≈5.9325 +0.659166666=6.591666666.

So 6.591666666.

Multiply this by 3e8 m/s: 6.591666666 *3e8=1.9775e9 m/s.

Multiply by tau (2.056875e-24 s):

1.9775e9 *2.056875e-24 = (1.9775 *2.056875 ) * 1e9 *1e-24 = approximately 4.0723 *1e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.0723e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close to this value. The small discrepancy is probably due to more precise intermediate steps.

So the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the following steps:

### Given Data:
- Production energy: \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Mass: \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Decay width: \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \)

### Key Equations:
1. **Proper Lifetime**:  
   \[
   \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
   \]
   where \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \).

2. **Relativistic Velocity**:  
   \[
   \beta = \frac{p}{E} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2}{E^2}}
   \]

3. **Mean Decay Distance**:  
   \[
   L = \beta \gamma c \tau
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \).

### Calculations:
1. **Proper Lifetime (\( \tau \))**:  
   \[
   \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
   \]

2. **Relativistic Factor (\( \gamma \))**:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667.
   \]

3. **Velocity Factor (\( \beta \))**:  
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2}{E^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1.2^2}{8^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1.44}{64}} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.98875.
   \]

4. **Mean Decay Distance (\( L \))**:  
   \[
   L = \beta \gamma c \tau.
   \]
   Substituting values:
   \[
   L = (0.98875)(6.6667)(3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s})(2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}).
   \]

   First, calculate \( \beta \gamma \):
   \[
   \beta \gamma = (0.98875)(6.6667) \approx 6.5917.
   \]

   Then, calculate \( c \tau \):
   \[
   c \tau = (3 \times 10^8)(2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}.
   \]

   Finally, calculate \( L \):
   \[
   L = (6.5917)(6.170625 \times 10^{-16}) \approx 4.0723 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
   \]

### Comparison with Options:
The calculated mean decay distance \( L \approx 4.0723 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B: \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**. The small discrepancy arises from rounding during intermediate steps.

**Answer: B**
