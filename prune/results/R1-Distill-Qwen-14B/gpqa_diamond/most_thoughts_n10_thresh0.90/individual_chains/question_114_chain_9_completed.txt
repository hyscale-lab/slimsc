Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right reagents for the given reactions. Let me start by breaking down what each reaction is doing.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that ketones reacting with nitriles usually involves some kind of addition. Oh wait, maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrins are formed when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with a cyanide source, right? So for that, I think the reaction is done under acidic conditions. Because the cyanide ion is a good nucleophile, but maybe it needs a proton to make the ketone's carbonyl more electrophilic. So the reagent A is probably something that provides H+ ions. Like H3O+ or maybe something else.

Looking at the product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, it seems like the cyanide added to the carbonyl carbon, and the hydroxyl group came from water. So the cyanide attack would form the nitrile and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. That makes sense for a cyanohydrin formation.

So for the first reaction, reagent A should be an acid catalyst. Options A and B suggest H3O+ as A, while C and D suggest NaHSO3 for A. NaHSO3 is a source of H+ as well, but I'm not sure if it's necessary here. Alternatively, sometimes for cyanohydrin formation, you use a weak acid or strong acid. I think H3O+ is a common choice, so maybe A is H3O+.

Moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it's reacting with reagent B (H2O) to form the corresponding butanoic acid. Wait, I think this is a hydrolysis reaction. The nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen? Oh right, hydrolysis of nitriles under acidic conditions typically yields carboxylic acids. Or maybe under basic conditions followed by acid workup?

Wait, the reagent B is H2O, but with what acid or base? Let's think about the reaction conditions. The second reaction's starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. So when nitriles hydrolyze, they can form amides first, then acids. But I think the main pathway is under acidic conditions. Alternatively, sometimes it's done under basic conditions, like with H2O and HCl (H+), or maybe in H2SO4.

Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid. So the hydrolysis must have gone all the way to the acid. For that, the conditions are usually strong acid and heat. Or perhaps a strong acid like HCl is used as a catalyst. Let me think, the second reaction is using H2O as the other reagent, so it's a hydrolysis in water. But what's the catalyst B? If the reaction is B = HCl, that's a strong acid. If B is CH3COOH, that's a weak acid.

So in the second reaction, the reagent B is H2O and another component. Wait, no, the question says the reagent is B (H2O). So maybe B is the acid catalyst. Because in the reaction, it's written as + B (H2O). Wait, the way it's written is a bit confusing. Let me re-read the question.

The second reaction is: [starting material] + B (H2O) → [product]. Hmm, perhaps the reagent is aqueous HCl or something else. Oh, wait, no, it's written that the reaction uses B and H2O. So B is the catalyst or a reagent. So in the second reaction, H2O is present, and B is another component.

Wait, maybe B is an acid. Because nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid usually requires acidic conditions. Alternatively, if done under basic conditions, it would form the sodium salt, which then needs to be acidified. But in this case, the product is the acid, so maybe it's done under acidic conditions.

So if the second reaction uses H2O and an acid (like HCl), or perhaps a base? Wait, hydrolysis of nitriles can be done in acidic or basic conditions, but for the formation of the acid, it's usually acid. So the reagent B could be HCl. Looking at the options, option A has B as HCl, and option C also has B as HCl.

Wait, let me recap the options:

Options:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So for the first reaction, if A is H3O+ (options A and B), then it's an acid catalyst. For the second reaction, B could be HCl or acetic acid.

But wait, in the second reaction, is the hydrolysis done under acidic or basic conditions? Let me think again. The starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group in the same carbon. So the molecule is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it's being hydrolyzed to 2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait, but that would require the nitrile group (CN) to become COOH.

The typical hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids involves either strong acid (like H2SO4) with heat or using a strong base followed by acid workup. But if B is a reagent and H2O is the solvent, then B must be providing the acid or base.

If B is HCl, then it's acidic hydrolysis. If B is CH3COOH, that's a weak acid. Alternatively, NaHSO3 is a source of H+ (since it's sodium bisulfate, which is a strong acid, H2SO3? Wait no, HSO3- is a weak acid).

Wait, in the second reaction, the product is a carboxylic acid. So for the hydrolysis, we probably need strong acid conditions. So B would be HCl, which is a strong acid. So looking at the options for B, options A and C have B as HCl. So which one is correct?

Wait, but the first reaction's reagent A: if I pick A as H3O+, then looking at options A and B. If the second reaction's B is HCl as in options A and C, then for option A, the first reagent is H3O+ and second is HCl. Let me check if that makes sense.

So first reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + H3O+ → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Yes, because H3O+ provides the H+ needed for the acid catalysis of the cyanide addition. So that's correct.

Second reaction: the nitrile is hydrolyzed in the presence of HCl (B) and H2O. So HCl would provide the acidic conditions for the hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

So for the second reaction, B is HCl.

Looking at the options, option A has A=H3O+ and B=HCl. So that would fit.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, when you have a hydroxyl group adjacent to the nitrile, maybe the conditions are different. But in this case, the product is a hydroxy acid, which suggests the nitrile is hydrolyzed to a COOH group. So the conditions should be acidic, so HCl is the right choice.

So the correct option would be A: A is H3O+, B is HCl.

Wait, but wait, another possibility. What if the second reaction uses a different condition? For example, sometimes nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids using a strong acid like H2SO4 with heat and water. So in that case, B would be HCl (if that's the acid catalyst), but if it's using a different acid, maybe that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe the reagents are different. Let me think about the first reaction again. Could reagent A be NaHSO3 instead?

Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. I know that bisulfite is used in the hydrolysis of certain groups, like in the production of ketones from aldehydes, but I'm not sure about its role in cyanohydrin formation. Wait, no, the cyanohydrin reaction is typically acid-catalyzed. So maybe A is H3O+.

Looking at the options, option C and D have A as NaHSO3, which is a source of H+ (since HSO3^- is a weak acid). So NaHSO3 in aqueous solution would provide H+ and HSO3^- ions. But I'm not sure if that's necessary. The standard cyanohydrin formation uses an acid catalyst like HCl or H3O+. So perhaps option A is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer would be option A: A is H3O+, B is HCl.


To determine the suitable reagents for the given reactions, we analyze each step and the options provided:

### Reaction 1:
**Reagents:** Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile  
This reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin, which typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl group, making it more electrophilic for nucleophilic attack by the cyanide ion. Among the options, both **H₃O⁺** (a strong acid) and **NaHSO₃** (a source of H⁺) can act as acid catalysts. However, **H₃O⁺** is the more common and direct choice for such reactions.

### Reaction 2:
**Reagents:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid  
This reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically requires acidic or basic conditions. Since the product is a carboxylic acid, the reaction likely occurs under acidic conditions. Among the options, **HCl** (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent for this transformation, as it provides the necessary acidic environment for the hydrolysis.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A:** A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  - H₃O⁺ is suitable for the cyanohydrin formation in Reaction 1.  
  - HCl is suitable for the hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid in Reaction 2.  
  - This option is consistent with both reactions.

- **Option B:** A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  - H₃O⁺ is suitable for Reaction 1.  
  - CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid and less effective for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids compared to HCl.  
  - This option is less favorable.

- **Option C:** A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  - NaHSO₃ can act as an acid catalyst, but it is less commonly used for cyanohydrin formation compared to H₃O⁺.  
  - HCl is suitable for Reaction 2.  
  - This option is less favorable than Option A.

- **Option D:** A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  - NaHSO₃ is less suitable for Reaction 1 compared to H₃O⁺.  
  - CH₃COOH is less suitable for Reaction 2 compared to HCl.  
  - This option is not favorable.

### Conclusion:
The most suitable reagents are **H₃O⁺** for Reaction 1 and **HCl** for Reaction 2, making **Option A** the correct choice.

**Answer: A**
