Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to work through it. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem describes a setup with a spherical conductor. The conductor itself is uncharged, which means it starts with no net charge. But there's a small spherical cavity inside it. The cavity's center is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. Oh wait, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R, the radius of the conductor. So the cavity is entirely within the conductor, right?

Then, they place a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is about the electric field at a point P, which is outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l is greater than R. Also, there's an angle theta between l and s. So I think that forms a triangle or something.

I remember that in conductors, charges redistribute in certain ways. Since the conductor is uncharged, but we've placed a charge inside the cavity... Wait, I think that the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge. Oh right, when you have a charge inside a conductor's cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced charge of equal magnitude but opposite sign. Because the conductor was initially neutral.

Wait, no, wait. The conductor's total charge is zero, but the charge inside the cavity is +q. So the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced charge of -q. But since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance that. Because the total conductor charge is zero: inner surface is -q, so outer must be +q.

But wait, the conductor is initially uncharged. So when you put +q in the cavity, the inner conductor wall (the cavity's surface) must have -q. But then the outer conductor must have +q, so overall conductor's charge is zero. Because the conductor started neutral, so any induced charges must balance out.

Now, the electric field outside the conductor. For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside depends only on the total charge enclosed, right? Because of the shell theorem. So the conductor's outer surface has +q, and the point P is outside. So the field should be as if
