Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's take it step by step.

First, the question involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The product goes through several steps, and we need to find the coupling pattern of a specific hydrogen in the final product's NMR spectrum.

Let me break down the reactions:

1. Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1, a light yellow solid. The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O). The NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is probably an OCH₂ group. The other signals (2.41-2.23 for 10H and 1.94 for 2H) are likely from adamantane's structure, which is a diamondoid hydrocarbon. So, the initial reaction is probably an elimination, forming a ketone. Since it's dibromo, and KOH is a strong base, it's likely a double E2 elimination, forming an epoxide? Wait, no, wait. Wait, elimination of two Br atoms would give a diene if they're adjacent, but in adamantane, the positions are 1 and 3. Hmm. Or maybe it's a vicinal dihalide and elimination forms an alkene. But wait, the product after KOH is a ketone. Oh, wait, no, because dibromide elimination with a strong base would form a double bond, not a ketone. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps it's an example of the Corey-Fuchs reaction or another type of elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but that usually involves amine groups. Oh wait, another possibility: when vicinal dihalides are treated with a strong base like KOH, they can eliminate to form alkenes. But if the dihalide is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which is a bridged structure, elimination would form a bridgehead double bond. Wait, but bridgehead double bonds aren't usually allowed due to Bredt's rule. Oh, but adamantane has a rigid structure, maybe the double bond forms elsewhere.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone. How would that happen? Oh, perhaps the KOH is causing a dehydrohalogenation, but with two Br atoms adjacent, leading to a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction, but substitution would not give a ketone. Wait, another approach: 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon elimination could form a ketone via a double elimination, perhaps forming a bridgehead carbonyl. Wait, maybe it's forming an epoxide first? No, because an epoxide is an ether, not a ketone.

Wait, the IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl. The NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a region where OCH₂ groups appear. So maybe it's an ether. But OCH₂ is typically around 3.3-4 ppm, depending on neighboring groups. Wait, 4.79 is higher, which suggests maybe a carbonyl adjacent, like an ester or ketone.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide? No, because epoxide protons are usually around 3-4 ppm as a triplet or quartet, depending on the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane eliminating two HBr molecules would give a structure with two carbonyl groups. But that's unlikely because the elimination would require two adjacent Br atoms, but in adamantane, the 1 and 3 positions are on the same face but not adjacent in a way that would allow E2 elimination to form a double bond. Hmm, maybe the elimination forms a bridgehead carbonyl.

Wait, let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid hydrocarbon with a structure of four cyclohexane rings fused together. The 1,3-dibromo would be two bromines on adjacent carbons in a way that when eliminated, perhaps a bridgehead is formed. Alternatively, maybe when KOH is used, it deprotonates and the bromides leave, forming a carbonyl group. Wait, perhaps it's a substitution reaction where each Br is replaced by an -OH group. But that would give a diol, which doesn't have a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the diol is oxidized, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the IR peak at 1720 is a strong, sharp peak, which suggests a ketone. The NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 for 2H. Maybe it's an O-C-O group, but that's more of an ester or ether. Alternatively, if it's a ketone, the adjacent protons might be split into a certain multiplet.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination (two E2 reactions) leading to a conjugated diene, but that doesn't form a ketone. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the dibromide is undergoing a nucleophilic substitution, but with KOH, that might form a hydroxyl group. But how to get a ketone?

Wait, perhaps it's a case of the formation of an epoxide, but that would require an alkene. Hmm, maybe there's a rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing a dehydrohalogenation followed by a cyclization.

Wait, another approach: The product after KOH is a ketone. Let's think about how a ketone would form from a dihalide. One possibility is that each Br is replaced by an oxygen-containing group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, forming a bridgehead carbonyl. For example, in some cases, elimination can form a carbonyl group if the structure allows. Maybe each Br is removed, and the adjacent carbons form a carbonyl.

Wait, adamantane's structure is such that 1 and 3 positions are on the same face, but perhaps when the two Brs leave, the two adjacent carbons form a double bond, but that would be a bridgehead double bond, which is not allowed. So perhaps it's a different elimination. Maybe the reaction forms a cyclopropane or another structure, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an ester. Wait, but the IR would have a carbonyl, but I don't see an ester functionality in the NMR. The 4.79 ppm is more like an OCH2 group, maybe in an epoxide or an ether.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. But I'm not certain. Let me think about the NMR.

The 1H NMR of product 1: 4.79 (2H, singlet), 2.41-2.23 (10H, probably adamantane's CH groups), and 1.94 (2H, maybe a CH2 group adjacent to something). The singlet at 4.79 suggests equivalent protons, possibly on an oxygen-bearing group. So maybe it's an OCH2 group attached to a carbonyl. For example, an ester group, like OCH2CO-. But wait, an ester would have more splitting. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone with an oxygen nearby, like a geminal diol, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the product is a ketone where the adjacent carbons have each lost a Br, forming a carbonyl. For example, if 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon elimination forms a cyclopropane? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide. But the NMR doesn't align with that.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a substitution, but that would not form a ketone. Maybe the bromides are replaced by hydroxyl groups, but that would give a diol, which doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the initial product is an alkene. Because dibromide elimination can form alkenes. But the IR shows a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the KOH is causing the formation of a geminal diol, which is then oxidized to a ketone? But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, maybe the diol is formed, but in the presence of heat, it undergoes some elimination to form a carbonyl. For example, the geminal diol could lose water to form a ketone. But for that, the diol would need to be on adjacent carbons, which they are since they started as 1,3-dibromide.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromide would have Br on adjacent carbons in adamantane's structure. So when KOH is added, perhaps each Br is replaced by an -OH, forming a diol. Then, with heat, the diol could undergo elimination, losing two water molecules and forming a double bond. But wait, that would give an alkene, not a ketone. Alternatively, maybe the diol decomposes further.

Wait, maybe the diol is dehydrated to form a ketone. But I'm not sure how that would happen. Usually, dehydration of a diol forms an alkene, but maybe under certain conditions, a carbonyl could form. Alternatively, perhaps the diol is oxidized, but again, KOH isn't an oxidizing agent.

Hmm, I'm stuck on the first step. Let me try to look for similar reactions. Oh, wait, I've heard of the formation of ketones from vicinal dihalides using a strong base. For example, in the presence of a strong base like KOH and heat, vicinal dihalides can undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes, but if the base is in a specific condition, maybe a different pathway is taken. Alternatively, maybe in this case, the elimination leads to a carbonyl group, perhaps through a cyclic transition state.

Wait, another thought: If the dihalide is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and KOH is used, perhaps each Br is eliminated as Br⁻, and the adjacent carbons form a double bond. But since it's a bridgehead, that's not allowed, so maybe the elimination occurs in a way that forms a ketone. Hmm, but how?

Wait, maybe each Br is replaced by an oxygen, but that would form an ether. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to the elimination of two Br atoms and forming a carbonyl group. Oh, wait! I think I remember something about the formation of ketones from vicinal dihalides using a strong base. Maybe it's a double elimination where each X is removed, and the two carbons form a double bond, but since that's not possible (due to bridgehead), the structure rearranges to form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case of the formation of an epoxide, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should move on and see if the next steps can give me any clues.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1 is a ketone. Wait, but if product 1 is a ketone, heating with Al isopropoxide might lead to some kind of acylation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester, which could undergo some reaction. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility is that product 1 is an epoxide. Then, heating with Al isopropoxide (which is a strong Lewis acid) might cause ring-opening. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, maybe Al isopropoxide is used in a Claisen or aldol condensation. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the next step is ozonolysis. Ozonolysis is used to cleave alkenes into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond. Because after ozonolysis, product 3 is formed, which has new carbonyl groups.

So, putting this together:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (a ketone?), which has some OCH2 group.

2. Product 1 is heated with Al isopropoxide → product 2, which has a double bond (since ozonolysis is done on product 2).

Wait, but product 1 is a ketone. How does a ketone form a double bond when treated with Al isopropoxide? Oh, maybe product 1 is an ester, and Al isopropoxide is used to form an enol ether or something else. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, which upon acid catalysis forms a diol, but that wouldn't form a double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an ether. Let me think: If product 1 is an epoxide, then treating with Al isopropoxide might not do much. Alternatively, if product 1 is an ester, maybe it undergoes some elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of product 2. Ozonolysis is done on product 2. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, so product 2 must have a double bond.

So, product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide to form product 2 with a double bond.

If product 1 is an ester, perhaps the Al isopropoxide helps in eliminating to form an alkene via an E2 mechanism. Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it undergoes some elimination to form an alkene. But then why would Al isopropoxide be used? Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in alkylation or acylation reactions.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider what each step is doing.

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (heated with KOH). Product 1 is a ketone, as per IR and NMR.

But wait, if the product is a ketone, how does that form from a dihalide? Maybe it's a case of two dehydrohalogenation steps, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by an OH, forming a diol. But then, how does a diol become a ketone? Maybe under heat, the diol loses water to form a ketone. Wait, a diol losing two water molecules to form a carbonyl group. That's called a dehydrogenation, but I'm not sure about the specifics.

Wait, perhaps the diol is 1,3-diol. So, if the diol is 1,3-diol, then heating with KOH could cause it to lose two water molecules and form a double bond. But then the product would be an alkene, not a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the diol is 1,2-diol, which could form a carbonyl group upon elimination. But in 1,3-dibromide, the diol would be 1,3-diol, not 1,2.

Hmm, perhaps I should accept that product 1 is a ketone and move forward.

So, product 1 is a ketone. Then, when heated with Al isopropoxide, which is a strong Lewis acid, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of elimination to form an alkene. For example, if product 1 is a cyclic ketone, heating with Lewis acid could cause it to form an enol ether, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe product 1 is an ester. Because the NMR shows OCH₂, which could be part of an ester group. If product 1 is an ester, then Al isopropoxide could help in eliminating to form an alkene.

Wait, let's think about the ester scenario. Suppose product 1 is an ester with structure something like OCH₂COOR. Then, heating with Al isopropoxide could cause elimination, perhaps forming an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. That would introduce a double bond, making product 2 an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond.

Wait, but the IR of product 1 is a strong peak at 1720, which is typical for a ketone. So if product 1 is a ketone, then what's the OCH₂ group?

Maybe the structure is something like OCH₂C(O)R. So the OCH2 would be adjacent to the carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps it's an epoxide ring opened to form a diol, but again, not seeing the ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketal. But the IR doesn't show the broad peak for a ketal's oxygen.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the product 3. It's formed by ozonolysis of product 2, followed by workup with dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis of a diene would typically break the double bond and form carbonyl groups.

So, product 2 must have a double bond. Therefore, product 1 must have reacted to form product 2, which has a double bond.

So, the initial reaction (step 1) must lead to a structure that, upon treatment with Al isopropoxide, forms a double bond.

If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it undergoes an elimination reaction to form an enone (alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone). So, Al isopropoxide could act as a Lewis acid catalyst for such an elimination.

So, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's adjacent to an alcohol group, and with the Lewis acid, it loses water and forms a double bond next to the carbonyl, making an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone (enone). That would make sense.

So, product 2 is an enone.

Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond, breaking the enone into two carbonyl groups. But wait, ozonolysis of an enone (which is a conjugated dienone?) would break the double bond into two carbonyls. So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups.

But the question is about the NMR of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange with solvent.

So, let me reconstruct the structures:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane.

Heating with KOH gives product 1, which is a ketone. Let's imagine the structure is something like adamantane with a ketone group and an OCH₂ group. Maybe the structure is OCH₂-CO-adamantyl.

Then, product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide, leading to formation of product 2, which is an enone (alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone). So, the structure would have a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl group.

Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would cleave the double bond, adding O3, then breaking into two carbonyl groups upon workup. So, product 3 would have two new carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

But I'm not certain about the exact structure, but let's proceed.

In the ozonolysis step, the double bond is cleaved. If the double bond was part of an enone (something like R₂C=CH-CO-R'), the ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. For example, if it's R₂C=CH-CO-R', ozonolysis would give R₂C=O and another carbonyl group on the other side.

But wait, the exact structure matters for the NMR of product 3.

Wait, let me think about the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. The most deshielded would likely be near electronegative groups, such as carbonyls. So, perhaps it's a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group, like in an acetal or an alpha position to a ketone.

But considering the ozonolysis, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was. So, perhaps each end of the former double bond has a carbonyl.

In the case of an enone, the ozonolysis would break the double bond and form two carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would have two new carbonyl groups.

Wait, maybe product 2 is an enol ether, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an alkene formed via elimination from product 1.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 is a diol formed by acid-catalyzed ring-opening, but that doesn't fit with the IR data.

I think the key is to determine the structure of product 3, especially the environment of the most deshielded hydrogen.

Another angle: The initial product (product 1) has an OCH₂ group as a singlet. That suggests that the two protons are equivalent and not split by neighboring protons. So, perhaps it's part of a carbonyl group, like an ester (OCH₂COOR) or an ether (OCH₂-O-R), but again, the IR suggests a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: The OCH₂ could be part of an ester group, but the IR at 1720 would be the ester carbonyl. Then, the 1H NMR would have the OCH₂ as a triplet or something else. But in product 1, it's a singlet, which suggests no neighboring protons. So, if it's OCH₂ connected to a carbonyl, perhaps the next group is a quaternary carbon, so no splitting.

So, product 1: OCH₂-CO-R, where R is adamantane.

Then, product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide. Al isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, which could facilitate the formation of an enol by removing a proton alpha to the carbonyl. This would create a double bond between the carbonyl carbon and the adjacent carbon. So, product 2 would be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester or ketone.

Then, ozonolysis is performed on product 2. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, typically breaking them into carbonyl groups. For an enone (conjugated dienone), the ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls.

Wait, but ozonolysis of an enone might not cleave it in the same way as a simple alkene. Let me think: For an enone, R₂C=CH-CO-R', ozonolysis would break the C=C bond, and each fragment would form a carbonyl group. So, the product would have two carbonyl groups.

But then, in product 3, what would the structure be? Let's suppose product 2 is an enone like this: (CH₂)₂C=CH-CO-adamantane. Ozonolysis would cleave the C=C bond, and each part would form a carbonyl. So, from the (CH₂)₂C=CH part, ozonolysis would give (CH₂)₂CO and HCO, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps each fragment is oxidized to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the enone structure is such that ozonolysis yields two ketones. So, product 3 would have two ketone groups.

But the exact structure is a bit unclear, but I need to focus on the NMR of product 3.

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen (excluding those that exchange). The most deshielded would likely be near a carbonyl, perhaps an alpha hydrogen.

In a carbonyl group, the alpha hydrogens (on the adjacent carbon) are deshielded. So, for example, in acetone, the methyl group's protons are split into a septet due to coupling with two other methyl groups. But in this case, maybe the hydrogen is coupled to two different sets of protons.

Wait, let me think about the possible structure after ozonolysis. Suppose product 2 is an enone, and ozonolysis breaks it into two carbonyl groups. Then product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, perhaps in a symmetrical position.

Wait, perhaps the enone is in such a way that ozonolysis produces two identical carbonyl compounds. For example, if the enone is symmetric, ozonolysis would produce two identical ketones.

So, let's say product 3 has two ketone groups, each with a CH₂ group adjacent. Then, each CH₂ group's protons would be split based on their neighboring groups.

Wait, but the most deshielded hydrogen would be adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, in a structure like (O=C-R)CH₂CH₂(O=C-R'), the CH₂ groups adjacent to the carbonyls would have their protons deshielded.

But more likely, the structure would have CH₂ groups next to carbonyls. Let me think of a simple example: If the ozonolysis product is two ketones, each adjacent to a CH₂ group, such as (CH₂)₂C=O and (CH₂)₂C=O.

Wait, but ozonolysis of a single double bond would give two carbonyl groups. So, if the enone is, say, CH₂=CH-CO-R, ozonolysis would give formaldehyde and R-CO-CH₂-CHO. But that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, if the enone is part of a ring, the ozonolysis would break the ring and form two carbonyls.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a cyclohexene derivative. Ozonolysis would break the ring into two carbonyl groups.

But I'm not entirely certain about the structure, but perhaps I can proceed based on the NMR data.

In product 3's NMR, the most deshielded proton is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's imagine this hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl.

If the CH₂ is next to a carbonyl and perhaps another CH₂ group, the coupling would depend on the neighboring protons.

For example, if the hydrogen is on a CH₂ adjacent to a carbonyl, and the other CH₂ is adjacent to another group, it could couple with two different sets of protons.

Wait, but let's think about the splitting. Suppose the hydrogen is on a CH₂ adjacent to a carbonyl. The adjacent group (say, another CH₂) would have two protons, leading to a triplet. But if there's another neighboring group with two protons, it might split further.

Alternatively, if the CH₂ is between two carbonyl groups, each CH₂ would have two neighboring groups, each with two protons, leading to a more complex splitting.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded hydrogen is on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl, and this CH₂ is also next to another CH₂ group, which would cause coupling with two sets of protons.

So, the hydrogen would couple with two different J values, perhaps leading to a triplet of triplets or a doublet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the CH₂ has two neighboring groups, each with two protons, the splitting would be more complex.

Wait, let me think of a specific example. Suppose the structure is something like O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CO-O, but that's more like a diester.

Alternatively, maybe it's a diketone with a CH₂ group between two carbonyls: O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CO.

In this case, each CH₂ group would have neighboring groups. Let's take the central CH₂. The protons on this CH₂ would be adjacent to two other CH₂ groups, each with two protons.

Wait, no, in this structure, each end is a carbonyl. So the CH₂ adjacent to the carbonyl would have protons that are split by the neighboring CH₂.

If the structure is O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CO, then each CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂. The first CH₂ (adjacent to O=C) has two protons, and the next CH₂ (middle) has two protons.

So, the first CH₂ (adjacent to O=C) would see the two protons on the middle CH₂, leading to a triplet. Similarly, the middle CH₂ would see the two protons on either side, leading to a quartet on each side.

Wait, but the most deshielded protons would be the ones on the CH₂ adjacent to the carbonyl. Let's say each of these protons is split by the two protons on the adjacent CH₂. So, each proton on the first CH₂ would couple with two protons on the middle CH₂, resulting in a triplet.

But wait, each of the two protons on the first CH₂ would be equivalent, so the splitting would be a triplet.

Wait, but that's not considering any other couplings. If the middle CH₂ has two protons, each on the first CH₂ would couple with both, leading to a triplet. So, each of the two protons on the first CH₂ would be split into a triplet, but since they're equivalent, it would appear as a triplet in the NMR.

But the question is about the most deshielded hydrogen, which is probably on the CH₂ adjacent to the carbonyl.

So, the coupling would be a triplet, because each of its protons is coupled with the two protons on the adjacent CH₂.

But wait, in this scenario, the adjacent CH₂ has two protons, so the splitting would be a triplet.

Looking at the options, option A is triplet.

Wait, but I think I've missed something. The adjacent CH₂ might have more than two protons. Let me think again.

If the structure after ozonolysis is O=C-(CH₂)n-CO, where n is 1 or 2, the splitting would depend on n.

Suppose n is 2: O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CO.

Each CH₂ group has two protons.

The first CH₂ (adjacent to O=C) would have its protons split by the two protons on the middle CH₂. So each of the two protons on the first CH₂ would see two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet.

Similarly, the middle CH₂ would have each proton seeing two on either side, leading to a quartet.

But the most deshielded would be the first CH₂, so their protons would be triplets.

Alternatively, if the structure is O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CO, then the first CH₂ is adjacent to a CH₂ with two protons, leading to a triplet.

In any case, the coupling would be a triplet.

But wait, another possibility: If the CH₂ adjacent to the carbonyl is next to another CH₂ which is itself next to another group with more protons, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded hydrogen is part of a triplet of triplets.

Wait, another possibility: If the hydrogen is coupled with two different sets of protons, each with a different J value. For example, if it's adjacent to a CH with two protons and another CH with two protons, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogen is on a CH₂ next to another CH₂, which is next to another CH₂. So, the first CH₂ would couple with the middle CH₂ (two protons) and the middle CH₂ couples with the end CH₂ (two protons). So, the first CH₂'s protons would couple with two from the middle, and the middle's protons couple with two from the end. But this would create a more complex splitting pattern, perhaps a triplet of triplets.

Wait, in that case, each proton on the first CH₂ would couple with two protons on the middle CH₂, resulting in a triplet. Additionally, if the middle CH₂'s protons are also coupled with another set, but perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, if the hydrogen is coupled with two different groups, each with two protons, but with different coupling constants, it would lead to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Another angle: The options given are A) triplet, B) triplet of triplets, C) doublet of triplets, D) pentet.

If the most deshielded hydrogen is on a CH₂ adjacent to a carbonyl and also adjacent to another CH₂ group which is itself adjacent to another CH₂, the coupling could be more complex.

For example, considering a structure like O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CHO.

But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded hydrogen is on a CH₂ group that is next to a carbonyl and also next to a CH group with two protons. Then, each of these protons would couple with two from the CH₂ and two from the CH, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a diketone with a CH₂ group between two carbonyls. So, O=C-CH₂-CO.

Wait, but that can't be right because the carbons would be adjacent. So perhaps O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CO.

In this case, the two CH₂ groups are adjacent. The first CH₂ (adjacent to O=C) has two protons. These protons are next to the middle CH₂, which has two protons.

So, each proton on the first CH₂ would couple with the two protons on the middle CH₂, resulting in a triplet.

Thus, the NMR signal for the first CH₂ would be a triplet.

So, the most deshielded hydrogen would be the one on this CH₂, and its coupling pattern would be a triplet.

Looking at the options, option A is triplet.

But wait, another possibility: If the CH₂ is adjacent to a carbonyl and another CH₂ which is adjacent to another CH₂, the coupling might be more complex.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CHO.

In this case, the first CH₂ (adjacent to O=C) would have two protons. These protons are next to a CH₂ with two protons. So, each proton on the first CH₂ would see two on the adjacent CH₂, leading to a triplet. The adjacent CH₂ would have each proton seeing two on the first and two on the next (CHO group), leading to a quartet.

But in this case, the most deshielded would be the first CH₂, giving a triplet.

Alternatively, if the structure is O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CO, then each CH₂ is adjacent to another, leading to each CH₂'s protons being split into triplets.

Wait, but the most deshielded would be the first CH₂, which would be a triplet.

So, perhaps the correct answer is triplet, option A.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, leading to a final product (product 3) whose most deshielded hydrogen's coupling pattern is to be determined. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH**  
   - The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the formation of a carbonyl group (likely a ketone).  
   - The ¹H NMR spectrum shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H), suggesting an OCH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl.  
   - The overall structure of product 1 is likely a ketone with an OCH₂ group, such as OCH₂-CO-adamantane.

2. **Reaction 2: Heating product 1 with Al isopropoxide**  
   - Al isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, facilitates the formation of an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone (enone) via elimination.  
   - Product 2 is an enone with a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl group.

3. **Reaction 3: Ozonolysis of product 2**  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in the enone, forming two carbonyl groups.  
   - Product 3 is a diketone, where the most deshielded hydrogen is on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl.

4. **Analysis of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3**  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen is on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group.  
   - This CH₂ group is coupled with the two protons on the adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet splitting pattern.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.
