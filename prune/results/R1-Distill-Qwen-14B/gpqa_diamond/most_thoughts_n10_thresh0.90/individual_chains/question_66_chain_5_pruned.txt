Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with certain symmetries of the Standard Model.

Wait, what's the deal with each of these symmetries? Let's break them down.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I think SMEFT operators have to respect this because they're constructed in a way that's consistent with the Standard Model, which definitely has Lorentz symmetry. So operators should transform properly under Lorentz transformations.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Oh right, Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. I remember that effective theories often include Poincare, but wait—does SMEFT operators have to respect it? Because SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, and in such theories, you usually only require Lorentz symmetry, not necessarily Poincare. Because when you integrate out high-energy modes, you might break some of the symmetries that are only approximate. Or wait, no—SMEFT is a valid effective theory below the electroweak scale, but does it include translation symmetry?

Wait, translation symmetry is part of Poincare. But in an effective theory, you typically don't require operators that change particle number, but translation symmetry is more about shifting spacetime, which I think is still a symmetry because the effective theory is still valid in the same spacetime. Or maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, sometimes people think that Poincare includes diffeomorphisms, but no, Poincare is just the isometries of Minkowski space. So in SMEFT, operators should respect Poincare symmetry? But wait, I'm a bit confused because the SM respects Poincare, so the effective theory should too. Hmm, but do all the operators in SMEFT have to respect this?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure of the operators. SMEFT is built as a series of operators with increasing dimension. Each operator is constructed to be Lorentz invariant, which is a subset of Poincare invariance, since Poincare includes translations. So if an operator is Poincare invariant, it's also Lorentz invariant, but the converse isn't necessarily true. But in SMEFT, operators are built to be Lorentz scalars, but perhaps they don't necessarily respect translation invariance. Wait, but translation invariance is about the theory being invariant under adding a constant to spacetime coordinates, which would imply momentum conservation.

Wait, but when you write down operators, like for example, operators with derivatives, terms like ∂μ φ ∂^μ φ would be translation invariant. But higher-dimension operators, like (∂φ)^n, should still be translation invariant. So I think all operators in SMEFT are required to be translation invariant, which would mean they respect Poincare symmetry. But wait, I thought that sometimes in effective theories, you can have operators that are not Poincare invariant because you're integrating out some fields, but maybe that's not the case here
