Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. And they're asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are from A to D, each being a different power of r.

Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the angle subtended by a star at two points in space, usually Earth's orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that distance (d) is approximately 1 over the parallax in parsecs. So d ≈ 1/(plx), where plx is in arcseconds and d in parsecs.

Wait, so if plx is inversely proportional to distance, that means plx = 1/d. So plx ∝ 1/d. So if I can express d in terms of plx, maybe that would help.

The problem states that N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Let's write that as N = k * (1/(plx)^5) where k is some constant. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in gives N = k * (d^5). Because 1/( (1/d) )^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. 

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So maybe I need to think about the rate of change of N with respect to r, where r is the distance. That would be dN/dr. 

Let me model this more precisely. Let's write N as proportional to d^5. So N = C * d^5, where C is another constant. Then, the number of stars per unit distance would be the derivative of N with respect to d. So dN/dd = 5C d^4. But wait, the question asks how the number changes with distance per unit range, so that would be the change in N for a change in r (distance). So maybe we can think of it as the density of stars as a function of distance.

Wait, but another approach: the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr would be approximately N = (number density) * 4π d² dr. But in this case, the number density isn't uniform; it's varying with parallax. So perhaps I should express the number in terms of the parallax relation.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the number as a function of distance. Since N ∝ 1/(plx)^5 and plx = 1/d, substituting gives N ∝ d^5. So for a given distance d, the number of stars is proportional to d^5. But that's the number up to that distance, or the number in a shell?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question states that the number of stars in the region varies with parallax as 1/(plx)^5. So for a given region, as parallax decreases (which means distance increases), the number of stars increases as 1/(plx)^5.

But the question is about the change in the number of stars with distance. So perhaps it's the number of stars per unit volume as a function of distance. Let's think about how the number in a volume element depends on distance.

Alternatively, if we have a thin spherical shell at a distance d with thickness dr, the volume is 4π d² dr. The number of stars in this shell would depend on the number density at that shell, which depends on d.

Wait, but the given relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, this becomes N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars in a shell would be proportional to d^5, but the volume is proportional to d². So the number per unit volume (number density) would be (d^5) / (d²) ) = d^3. So the number density is proportional to d^3.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars in the region as a function of distance. So perhaps the number in a shell (per unit distance) is proportional to d^5 / (d^2 dr) ? Wait, no. Let's clarify.

Wait, the number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dr is N_shell = (number per unit volume) * (volume of shell). But number per unit volume (n) is the number density, which we think is proportional to d^3 because N ∝ d^5 and volume is 4π d² dr, but perhaps that's not the right approach.

Hmm, maybe I should model this as a differential. Let me think again: N = C / (plx)^5 = C d^5.

But wait, that would be the number of stars in a certain volume, perhaps a sphere of radius d? Or maybe it's the count per some unit. No, wait, maybe I'm confusing how the number depends on distance.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the number of stars in a region (like a column of the sky) per unit area. Because parallax is related to distance along the line of sight. So the number being a function of parallax would be along the line of sight. So imagine looking along a line of sight with distance d, the number of stars would vary as 1/(plx)^5, and plx is 1/d, so N ∝ d^5.

But how does the number change with distance? So perhaps the number of stars per unit area (since it's a column) as a function of distance is N = C * d^5.

But the question is, when you move a small distance dr, how does the number of stars in that region change? Or perhaps it's the density of stars as a function of distance.

Wait, the problem is a bit ambiguous, but perhaps the question is about the star density as a function of distance. So if N increases with d^5, then the number of stars per unit distance would be proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the options are ~r^3, r^5, r^4, r^2. So if the number of stars is proportional to d^5, then the change with distance r would be r^5. But that's just N, not the change per unit distance.

Wait, maybe the question is about the number of stars per unit volume, which would be the number density. How does the number density vary with r?

If N ∝ d^5, but the volume up to distance d is (4/3)π d^3. So number density n = N / Volume = (C d^5) / ( (4/3) π d^3 ) ) = (3C/(4π)) d^2. So n ∝ d^2.

Wait, but that would mean number density increases with d squared, so the number of stars per unit volume (like cubic parsecs) increases as the square of the distance. But the question is about the number of stars in the region as a function of distance, per unit range. Maybe the way the problem is phrased, it's the number of stars per unit distance, so the number per parsec in the direction of r.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars in a thin shell of thickness dr at distance r is the quantity we're after. So that would be dN/dr.

Given that N(r) = C r^5. So the derivative dN/dr = 5 C r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (i.e., the change in N with r) is proportional to r^4. So that would correspond to option C, which is ~ r^4.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about the number density, that was n = dN/(volume) = (dN/dr * 4π r² dr) / (4π r² dr) ), wait, maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait another approach: the number of stars in a thin shell at radius r with thickness dr is N_shell = number density * volume of shell. The volume is 4π r² dr. The number density is n = N / V_total, where V_total is the volume up to radius r, which is (4/3) π r^3. So n = N / ( (4/3 π r^3) ). But if N ∝ r^5, then n = (C r^5) / ( (4/3 π r^3) ) ) = C/(4/3 π) * r^2. So n ∝ r^2.

Then N_shell = n * 4 π r^2 dr = (C r^2) * 4 π r^2 dr = 4 π C r^4 dr. So the number of stars per unit distance (since dr is the unit) is proportional to r^4. So the change in number of stars with distance is r^4. So that would be option C.

Wait, but the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?"

So if the number in a shell (per unit distance) is proportional to r^4, then the correct answer is option C, which is ~r^4.

But wait, let me double-check. The initial relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/r, that's N ∝ r^5. So the total number up to radius r is r^5. Now, the number between r and r+dr is dN = 5 r^4 dr. So the number per unit distance is 5 r^4, which is ~ r^4. So the answer would be option C.

Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the number of stars per unit area per unit distance — that is, the surface density per distance. But in that case, the number would be proportional to r^4 as well, perhaps. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the number of stars in the direction of a particular line of sight. So for each line of sight, the number of stars as a function of distance (along the line) is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5 = r^5. So as you move along that line of sight, the number of stars increases as r^5. So the number of stars per unit distance along that line would be dN/dr = 5 r^4, so the change is r^4.

Therefore, the correct option is C: ~ r^4.


The problem states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \), where parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)) as \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \) into the given relation, the number of stars becomes \( N \propto r^5 \).

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range (\( r \)), we consider the number of stars in a thin shell at distance \( r \) with thickness \( dr \). The number of stars in this shell is proportional to the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which is \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). Since \( N \propto r^5 \), taking the derivative gives:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
