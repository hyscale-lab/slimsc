Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab observer. Oh wait, the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1, so I can use that as a reference.

Wait, so the glass is moving. So this is a scenario involving relative motion between the medium (glass) and the observer (lab frame). I remember that in special relativity, when you have different frames moving relative to each other, you have to use the velocity addition formulas. But wait, this is about light in a medium, not in a vacuum. Hmm, how does that affect things?

In a vacuum, the speed of light is always c, regardless of the source's motion. But when it's a medium, like glass, the situation is different. The index of refraction n is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed in the medium. So normally, the speed of light in the medium is c/n. But wait, that's in the rest frame of the medium, right? Because when the glass is stationary relative to the lab, the speed is c/n.

But here, the glass is moving. So how does the speed change? Do I just add the velocities? That is, in the lab frame, the glass is moving at v. So would the speed of light in the lab frame be (c/n + v), but wait, that would be if velocities just add, which is only true at non-relativistic speeds, right? But the options don't look like they're using a simple addition. So maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the medium's frame. In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at c/n. But the glass is moving at speed v relative to the lab. So to find the speed in the lab frame, I need to transform the velocity from the medium's frame to the lab's frame.

Wait, but in special relativity, the velocity addition formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²), but wait, that's when u is the velocity of the object in the medium's frame, and v is the medium's velocity relative to the lab. So applying that formula, the lab would see the light moving as (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²). But here, u is the speed of light in the medium, which is c/n. Because in the medium's frame, the speed is c/n.

Wait, wait, but in the medium's frame, the speed would be c/n. So substituting u = c/n into the velocity addition formula.

Let me write that down:

u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/(c²))

Since c is 1, that simplifies to (u + v)/(1 + u v).

But u is c/n, which is 1/n since c=1.

So u' = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n)*v )

Let me factor out 1/n in numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (1 + n v)/n

Denominator: (n + v)/n

So when I divide them, (1 + n v)/n divided by (n + v)/n equals (1 + n v)/(n + v).

Wait, that's the same as option A: (1 + n v)/(n + v)

But wait, looking at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v). That seems to match.

But wait, double-checking: the speed in the glass's frame is u = c/n = 1/n. So using the velocity addition formula, u' = (u + v)/(1 + u v). Plugging u =1/n, yes, it becomes (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n)v) = (1 + n v)/(n + v). That's correct.

So the speed in the lab frame is (1 + n v)/(n + v). So the answer should be option A.


To determine the speed of light in the moving glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The glass has an index of refraction \( n \), and its speed relative to the lab is \( v \). The speed of light in the glass, as measured in the glass's rest frame, is \( c/n \), where \( c = 1 \). Thus, in the glass's frame, the speed of light is \( u = 1/n \).

Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
\]

Since \( c = 1 \), this simplifies to:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + u v}
\]

Substituting \( u = 1/n \), we get:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

Simplifying the numerator and denominator by factoring out \( 1/n \):

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}} = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab is \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \), which corresponds to option A.
