Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about selecting the right reagents for two consecutive reactions. Let's take it step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide ions, it's a nucleophilic addition. The general reaction is ketone + CN- → cyanohydrin. So, the product would have an alcohol and a nitrile group, which matches the product given here.

Wait, so butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, which provides the CN- ion, it should form a cyanohydrin. The reaction usually requires an acid catalyst. Oh right, because the acid helps in generating the enol or activating the carbonyl for nucleophilic attack.

So what's reagent A here? The options for A are H3O+ or NaHSO3. H3O+ is a strong acid, like from HCl or H2SO4. NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. But wait, when I think about the cyanohydrin formation, I think it's done under acidic conditions. So H3O+ would make sense as the acid catalyst. So A should be H3O+.

Now the second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (in H2O) to form the corresponding butanoic acid. Let me think: the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid.

To convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, I remember that you can hydrolyze the nitrile. The usual reagents are either strong acid with heat, or perhaps a strong base, but wait, I think in H2O, maybe it's acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.

Wait, for nitrile to carboxylic acid, you typically have to go through the amide stage. Or wait, another method is hydrolysis under acidic conditions. Oh yes, the hydrolysis of nitriles can be done with strong acid and heat. Or maybe using a strong acid like HCl, and perhaps a peroxide if it's for a different reaction, like the Stephen reduction or something else. Wait, no, let's think again.

Wait, nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid usually requires a strong acid. The reaction is typically done under acidic conditions, maybe with H3O+ or HCl. Because, for example, when you have a nitrile, you can add H2O with HCl, and heat it, and it'll form the carboxylic acid. So reagent B would be HCl, which is a strong acid.

Looking at the options, for B, the options are HCl or CH3COOH. Since CH3COOH is a weak acid, I'm not sure if that's strong enough for this hydrolysis. I think the reaction would require a stronger acid, so B should be HCl.

Wait, but wait, the first part, reagent A: the options are H3O+ or NaHSO3. So in the first reaction, butanone plus NaCN and A. If A is H3O+, it's a strong acid, which is needed for the cyanohydrin formation.

So looking at the options, which pair has A=H3O+ and B=HCl. Let's see the options.

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl. That fits.

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH. So B is acetic acid, which is weaker. I don't think that would hydrolyze nitriles to acids.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl. NaHSO3 is a weaker acid than H3O+. Wait, NaHSO3 is a source of HSO3^- which is a weak acid, so maybe not the right catalyst for the cyanohydrin.

Wait, no: the cyanohydrin formation, the acid is used to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. So a strong acid is better. So A should be H3O+.

So in the first reaction, only options A and B have A=H3O+. So B is either HCl (option A) or acetic acid (option B). We need B to be HCl because the nitrile hydrolysis requires strong acid.

So the correct option is A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but wait another thing. In the first reaction, butanone plus NaCN in acidic conditions. So yes, H3O+ is correct.

So the answer would be option A.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl group more electrophilic for nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, H₃O⁺ is a strong acid and is suitable for this purpose, while NaHSO₃ (a weaker acid) is not ideal. Therefore, reagent A must be H₃O⁺.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. This process typically requires strong acidic conditions, such as those provided by HCl. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH), being a weak acid, is insufficient for this transformation. Thus, reagent B must be HCl.

From the options, only option A satisfies both conditions: A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
