Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that in crystallography, interplanar distances are calculated using some formula involving the lattice parameters. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, especially for rhombohedral systems. 

Rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal too. Oh right, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, which is a special case of a hexagonal crystal system? Or maybe it's a separate system. I think in the Bravais lattice, rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal or maybe a cubic system. Wait, no, cubic has 90-degree angles, rhombohedral has 60 or something else, like 30 degrees in this case.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Oh wait, wait. Wait, interatomic distance is the distance between atoms, which in a crystal structure is the edge length of the unit cell. So for a cubic system, a would be the edge length, but rhombohedral is a bit different. But wait, in a rhombohedral unit cell, the lattice parameters a, b, c are all equal, right? So a = b = c. So in this case, each edge is 10 Angstroms.

The angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. Oh right, in a rhombohedral system, all three angles are the same. So the unit cell is a rhombohedron with a = 10, and angles 30 degrees each.

Now, the question is about the (111) plane. The interplanar distance d is given by the formula d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) )) ). Wait, is that right? Or maybe I'm mixing up the formula.

Wait, another thought: For a cubic system (where angles are 90 degrees), the formula simplifies because cos terms become zero. So the formula would be d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²). But for rhombohedral, which has angles not 90 degrees, the formula must include the cosines of the angles.

Wait, maybe the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ )

But wait, in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are the same, α=β=γ. So in this case, all the cos terms are the same as cos(30 degrees).

So substituting the values, h=1, k=1, l=1, and all the cos terms are cos(30) which is sqrt(3)/2 or about 0.866.

Let's compute the denominator. Let's compute h² + k² + l² = 1+1+1=3.

Then 2hk cos α: 2*1*1 * 0.866 = 2 * 0.866 = 1.732.

Similarly, 2hl cos β is same, and 2kl cos γ is same. So each of those terms is 1.732, and there are three such terms. So 3 * 1.732 = 5.196.

So adding to the previous 3, the denominator becomes sqrt(3 +5.196) = sqrt(8.196).

Wait, 3 + 5.196 is 8.196. So sqrt(8.196) is approximately sqrt(8.196). Let me calculate that. Hmm, sqrt(9) is 3, sqrt(8.196) is around 2.86. Wait, 2.86 squared is 8.1796, which is close. So approximately 2.86.

So then d = a / 2.86.

But a is 10 Angstrom, so d = 10 / 2.86 ≈ 3.496 Angstrom? That can't be right, because the options are around 9 to 10. Wait, that's a problem because the interplanar distance can't be larger than the interatomic distance in some cases, but in others it can be. Wait, no, wait. Wait, interplanar distances are typically smaller than the a parameter, perhaps? Or maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe the formula is different. Oh wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Because all the angles are the same, α=β=γ. So the formula becomes:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, let's see. For instance, in a cubic system, cos α is zero, so it reduces to the standard formula.

So for (111), h=1, k=1, l=1.

So h² +k² +l² is 3.

2(hk + hl + kl) is 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) = 2*(3) =6.

So 6 * cos(30) is 6*(√3/2)=3√3≈
