Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, I think that means they're the standard basis states for spin-½ particles, like |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

The task is to calculate two things: the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator, and the average value of that operator. The operator's matrix representation is given as A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, that sounds a bit confusing. Let me parse that.

So the matrix A is a 2x2 matrix because the states are |up> and |down>, right? So the indices i and j go from 1 to 2. So A_ij is ħ/2 when i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. That would make the matrix look like this:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0] ]

Wait, but wait a second. Oh, no, actually, wait. Because when i≠j, A_ij is ħ/2. So the diagonal elements (where i=j) are 0. So yes, the matrix is 2x2 with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere.

So this operator A is a 2x2 matrix with elements (0, ħ/2; ħ/2, 0). Interesting. I think this is similar to the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A would be (ħ/2) * X.

Wait, but the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, right? So the eigenvalues of A would be (ħ/2)(1) and (ħ/2)(-1), which are ± ħ/2. But wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

The question asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator A. Oh wait, wait. The operator's eigenstates are probably the eigenstates of A. So I need to find the eigenstates of A, then express |alpha> in terms of
