Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period. Wait, Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star because the orbital period is shorter—Kepler's third law says that closer planets orbit faster.

The stars: the host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host, but both stars have the same radius. Oh, that's interesting. So even though the more massive star (Planet_1's) is probably bigger in radius, they're saying both have same radii. That might affect the transit probability.

I remember the formula for transit probability. It's something like the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius, but actually, the probability is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2 divided by (a (1 - e²))^ something... Wait, no, for circular orbits, the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1/(a(1-e^2)))? No, wait, the main formula I recall is that the probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a)), but wait, no, I think more accurately, the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a)), but considering the alignment— actually, I think the actual formula for the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a)), but wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the probability that a planet transits is the area of the star that the planet can block, divided by the area of the planet's orbital path around the star. Since the orbit is circular, the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance (a). Wait, that doesn't sound right. Maybe I should look up the formula in my notes.

Alternatively, from what I remember, the transit probability for a randomly aligned orbit is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively,
