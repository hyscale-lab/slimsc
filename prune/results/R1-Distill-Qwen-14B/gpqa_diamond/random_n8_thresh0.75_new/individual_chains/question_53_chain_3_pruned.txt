Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question carefully.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So that's either benzene with two substituents or a similar aromatic ring like naphthalene, but I think more likely benzene with two groups attached.

The FTIR shows an ester group. Ester groups have specific absorption bands. Ester carbonyls (C=O) are usually around 1730-1750 cm⁻¹. So that's a key point—so the compound has an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: six signals. Let me break down what each part means.

First, two signals for aromatic-H. Di-substituted aromatic rings can have different substitution patterns. If it's para, the aromatic protons would be equivalent and give one signal. But if it's ortho or meta, the protons might be different, but wait—wait, being di-substituted, in ortho substitution, the two substituents are adjacent, so the ring would have equivalent protons or not? Hmm. Alternatively, if the substituents are such that the aromatic protons split into two sets.

Wait, the NMR shows two signals for aromatic-H. So perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the ring has two types of aromatic protons. Maybe it's a para substitution but with substituents that cause two distinct sets. Or maybe it's an ortho substitution where the substituents are not the same. Wait, but if it's para, the ring's aromatic protons would be two sets each with two protons. But maybe the substituents are such that the ring is asymmetric. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are such that each substituent is on adjacent carbons (ortho), leading to two distinct aromatic proton environments. Or maybe one substituent is on one position and another on a para position relative to it—no, that would be para to each other, leading to two sets of equivalent protons.

Wait, benzene is symmetric, so if it's di-substituted with two identical groups in para positions, the aromatic H would have two sets: two Hs in one environment and two in another. For example, in para-dichlorobenzene, the two H adjacent to Cl are equivalent, and the other two H are equivalent, but wait, actually, in para substitution, the molecule is symmetric, so all the aromatic Hs are equivalent except for those in the positions between the substituents. Wait, no, for para substitution, the ring would have symmetry. So if the substituents are in para positions, there would be two types of aromatic H. For example, if substituents are in positions 1 and 3 (but that's meta, not para). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

In para substitution, substituents are at positions 1 and 4 (assuming a benzene ring with 6 positions). So the aromatic Hs at positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to substituents, and positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to substituents as well. Wait, no, wait. Let me imagine the benzene ring. Positions 1 and 4 have substituents. Then positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to
