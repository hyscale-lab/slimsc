Okay, so I have this physics problem here about scattering amplitudes and phase shifts. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question gives me phase shifts for different angular momenta, right? δ₀ is 90 degrees, δ₁ is 67, δ₂ is 55, δ₃ is 30, and δ₄ is 13 degrees. And we're told to ignore the rest. The electrons are 50 MeV, and we're to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using the partial waves. For each angular momentum l, there's a term involving the phase shift δ_l. 

The formula for the scattering amplitude is something like f(θ) = (1/k) Σ ( (2l + 1) [ e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l ] P_l(cosθ) ), where k is the wave number and the sum is over l. But wait, the question is about the imaginary part along the incident direction, which I think is when θ = 0 degrees. Because the incident beam is moving along a certain direction, and the scattered direction would be at some angle θ from that.

When θ is 0, cosθ is 1, so P_l(1) is 1 for each l. Because the Legendre polynomials P_l(1) are always 1. So the formula simplifies a lot in that case. So f(0) would be (1/k) Σ ( (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l ), because P_l(1)=1.

So the imaginary part of f(θ=0) would be the sum over l of (2l+1) times the imaginary part of e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l. Let me think about that. 

Wait, e^{iδ} = cosδ + i sinδ. So e^{iδ} sinδ = sinδ (cosδ + i sinδ) = sinδ cosδ + i sin²δ. So the imaginary part is sin²δ for each term. 

So, the imaginary part of f(0) would be (1/k) * sum over l of (2l+1) * sin²(δ_l). 

Ah, right. So I need to calculate each (2l+1)*sin²(δ_l) term, sum them up, multiply by 1/k, and that gives the imaginary part of the amplitude at θ=0.

Now, what's k? The wave number k is given by k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ. Wait, but E is the kinetic energy of the electron. Oh wait, but electrons have rest mass, so their total energy is E = K + m c², but for high energies, maybe relativistic effects are considered? Hmm, the problem states 50 MeV electrons. But wait, 50 MeV is a lot, so relativistic effects might matter. But wait, in scattering experiments, sometimes the non-relativistic formulas are used. Or perhaps they expect us to use the relativistic expression for the wave number.

Wait, the wave number in terms of energy and mass is given by E = ħ² k²/(2m), so k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ. But wait, for relativistic particles, the energy is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)^2, but perhaps for electrons at 50 MeV, which is much higher than their rest mass (about 0.511 MeV), the momentum p is significant. Hmmm, but I'm not sure if the problem expects me to use the relativistic expression for k or not.

Wait, but the question gives the energy as 50 MeV. Let's think about units. The options are in fm (femtometers), which is 1e-15 meters. The scattering amplitude is usually in units of length, since it's proportional to 1/k, which is inverse length.

So, let me find k. Let me think in terms of natural units where ħ = c = 1. But perhaps a better approach is to compute k in appropriate units.
