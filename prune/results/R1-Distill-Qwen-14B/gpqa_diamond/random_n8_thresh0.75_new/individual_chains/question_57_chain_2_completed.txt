Okay, so I've got this physics problem about elastic scattering of electrons, and I'm supposed to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with scattering, especially in nuclear physics, phase shifts are involved in partial waves. But I'm a bit rusty on the exact formulas, so I'll try to think this through step by step.

The problem gives me the measured phase shifts δ₀, δ₁, δ₂, δ₃, and δ₄ as 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, and 13°, respectively. Oh, and they said to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ₄, so I guess I don't have to worry about higher values. The incident electrons are 50 MeV, but I'm not sure if the energy directly factors into the calculation here, or if it's just provided for context.

Wait, the question mentions the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I recall that the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed in terms of partial waves, each involving the phase shifts. The general formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of partial waves is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ [ (2l+1) (e^{iδ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ) ], where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number, and k is the wave number.

But I'm specifically asked for the imaginary part along the incident direction, which would be θ=0°, I think. Along the beam direction, the scattering angle is zero, so I need to evaluate the imaginary part of f(0). 

Wait, but P_l(1) is the value of the Legendre polynomial at cosθ = 1. Because cos(0°) is 1. I remember that P_l(1) is just 1 for all l. Because Legendre polynomials have P_l(1)=1, right? So when θ=0, each P_l(cosθ) becomes 1.

So the formula simplifies to f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) (e^{i δ_l} - 1) * 1. 

But wait, the question is about the imaginary part of f. So I can write f(0) as a sum of real and imaginary parts. The imaginary part would come from the imaginary parts of each term in the sum.

Each term in the sum is (2l + 1) (e^{i δ_l} - 1). Let's expand e^{i δ_l} into cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. So e^{i δ_l} - 1 = (cos δ_l -1) + i sin δ_l. 

So each term becomes (2l+1) [ (cos δ_l -1) + i sin δ_l ]. 

The imaginary part of this term is (2l+1) * sin δ_l. Because when you take the imaginary part, you're only considering the coefficient of i. 

So the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/k) * Σ (2l +1) sin δ_l. 

So I need to calculate the sum for l from 0 to 4 (since δ_4 is given) of (2l +1) * sin δ_l. Then divide by k and that's the imaginary part.

But wait, what is k? Oh, right! k is the wave number, which is given by k = (2π / λ), where λ is the wavelength. But I don't have λ here. Alternatively, k is related to the momentum of the particle. For relativistic particles, the relation is k = sqrt(2mE), where m is the mass and E is the energy. Wait, but wait, the electrons are 50 MeV, which is a lot, so relativistic effects are important. But I'm not sure about the exact formula off the top of my head.

Wait, I remember that for an electron, the wave number k can be found from the momentum. The momentum p is related to the kinetic energy. Oh wait, but wait, the kinetic energy is 50 MeV. But electrons have rest mass, so I need to use the relativistic formula for energy.

The total energy E is given by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². But the kinetic energy K is E - m c². So K = 50 MeV, so E = K + m c². The rest mass energy of an electron is about 0.511 MeV. So E is 50 + 0.511 ≈ 50.511 MeV.

So p is sqrt( (E/c)^2 - (m c)^2 ) / c. Wait, let me think again. The relation is p = sqrt( (E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) ) / (c^2) ) * c? Hmm, perhaps I should express this in units where c=1 to avoid confusion. Alternatively, in natural units where c=1, E² = p² + m². So p = sqrt(E² - m²). But since E is in MeV and m is 0.511 MeV, E is much larger, so p ≈ E. But for the exact calculation, perhaps we should be precise.

So E = 50.511 MeV. Then p = sqrt( (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈ approximately 50.511 MeV/c, since (0.511)^2 is negligible compared to (50.511)^2. So p ≈50.511 MeV/c. So k is p/ħ. Planck's constant ħ is about 197.33 MeV·fm (since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm). So k = p/(ħ) = (50.511 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm) * c. Wait, units might complicate, but let me compute this.

Wait, let's compute k in units of 1/fm. Because since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm, so 1/(ħ c) ≈ 1/(197.33 MeV·fm) ) → but perhaps this is getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, since k = p/(ħ), and p is in MeV/c, then k would be (p [MeV/c]) / (ħ [MeV·fm]) ) * (fm) * c / c → Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of units.

Wait, ħ has units of J·s. But in particle physics, it's often expressed in MeV·fm. Because 1 fm is 1e-15 m, and 1 J = 1 kg·m²/s². But perhaps using natural units where ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm would be easier. So, since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm, then ħ = 197.33 MeV·fm / c. 

Wait, but k has units of 1/fm, because it's 2π/λ. So perhaps I can write k = p c / ħ c^2. Wait, p is in MeV/c, so p c would be MeV. So k = (p c) / ( ħ c^2 ) ) * c → Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the units here. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, the wave number k is given by k = (2 m E)^{1/2} / ħ. But that's for non-relativistic cases. But since E is much larger than m c², perhaps the relativistic approach is better. Alternatively, using the relation k = p / ħ, where p is the momentum.

So p = gamma m v. But for non-relativistic, E is (1/2) m v². But for relativistic speeds, E = gamma m c^2. So the momentum p = gamma m v. Hmm, but maybe it's easier to compute using E and m.

Wait, I think the relation is p = sqrt( (E c)^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c^2. Wait, no, that's not right. Oh, right, from E² = (pc c)^2 + (m c²)^2. So p c = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ). 

So p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c. 

Given E is 50.511 MeV, and m c² is about 0.511 MeV. So E² is about (50.511)^2 ≈ 2551.4 MeV². (m c²)^2 is about (0.511)^2 ≈ 0.261 MeV². So E² - (m c²)^2 ≈ 2551.4 MeV². So p c = sqrt(2551.4) ≈ 50.511 MeV. So p = 50.511 MeV / c.

So p = 50.511 MeV/c. Then, since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm, so ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm) / c. So k = p / ħ = (50.511 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm / c) ) = (50.511 / 197.33) fm^{-1}.

Calculating 50.511 / 197.33 ≈ 0.2562 fm^{-1}.

So k ≈ 0.2562 fm^{-1}.

Wait, but I might have made a mistake in the units. Let me check again. So p c is 50.511 MeV, ħ c is 197.33 MeV·fm. So p c / (ħ c) = (50.511) / (197.33) fm^{-1}.

Wait, p c = 50.511 MeV, ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm. So p = (50.511 MeV) / (c) → but when you compute k = p/(ħ), which is (MeV/c) / ( MeV·fm /c ) ), the c's cancel, and you get (MeV) / (MeV·fm) ) → 1/fm. So yeah, so k is 50.511 / 197.33 ≈ 0.2562 fm^{-1}.

So now, the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/k) * sum over l=0 to 4 of (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Let me compute each term:

For l=0: (2*0+1) = 1. δ0 is 90°, so sin(90°) = 1. So term is 1 * 1 =1.

l=1: (2*1+1)=3. δ1=67°, sin(67) ≈ 0.9205. So term is 3 * 0.9205 ≈ 2.7615.

l=2: (5) * sin(55). sin(55) ≈ 0.8192. 5 * 0.8192 ≈4.096.

l=3: (7) * sin(30). sin(30)=0.5. 7*0.5=3.5.

l=4: (9) * sin(13). sin(13) ≈0.22495. 9 * 0.22495 ≈ 2.02455.

Now sum all these terms:

1 + 2.7615 = 3.7615.

3.7615 +4.096 =7.8575.

7.8575 +3.5 =11.3575.

11.3575 +2.02455≈13.38205.

So the sum is approximately 13.38205.

Then, the imaginary part is (1/k) * 13.38205. We have k≈0.2562 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k ≈ 1/0.2562 ≈3.904 fm.

Multiply by 13.38205: 3.904 *13.38205 ≈ let's compute.

3 *13.38205=40.14615.

0.904 *13.38205 ≈ approximately 12.114 (since 0.9 *13.382≈12.0438, plus 0.004 *13.382≈0.0535 → total≈12.097).

So total is 40.146 +12.097≈52.243 fm.

Wait, but the options are in the hundreds. Hmm, that doesn't match any of the options. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum of the terms. Let me recompute each term more accurately.

l=0: (1) * sin(90) =1.

l=1: 3 * sin(67) → let me compute sin(67) exactly. Using calculator, sin(67°) ≈0.9205048534.

So 3 *0.9205048534≈2.76151456.

l=2: 5 * sin(55°). Sin(55)=0.8191520443. 5 *0.8191520443≈4.0957602215.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13°). Sin(13)=0.2249510543. 9 *0.2249510543≈2.0245594887.

Now sum these:

1 +2.76151456 =3.76151456.

3.76151456 +4.0957602215=7.8572747815.

7.8572747815 +3.5=11.3572747815.

11.3572747815 +2.0245594887=13.3818342702.

So sum S=13.3818342702.

Now, 1/k =1/(0.2562) ≈3.904 fm.

So Im(f(0))= (1/k) * S ≈3.904 *13.381834 ≈?

Let me compute 3.904 *13.381834:

Compute 3 * 13.381834=40.1455.

0.904 *13.381834 = ?

0.9 *13.381834=12.0436506.

0.004 *13.381834=0.053527336.

So 12.0436506 +0.053527336≈12.0971779.

Total Im(f)=40.1455 +12.0971779≈52.2426779 fm.

Hmm, but the options given are A) 87163.4 fm, B)355.351, C)177.675, D)251.271.

My calculation gives around 52.24 fm, which is not among the options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units for k. Let me double-check the calculation of k.

Earlier, I said E = 50 + 0.511 MeV =50.511 MeV.

Then, p c = sqrt( (E)^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) = sqrt( (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈50.511 MeV.

So p = (50.511 MeV) / c.

But when calculating k = p / ħ, and ħ is in MeV·fm, perhaps I should use the value ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm → so ħ = 197.33 MeV·fm / c.

Wait, p is in MeV/c, and ħ is in MeV·fm/c. So when you divide p by ħ, the units are (MeV/c) / (MeV·fm/c) )= 1/fm.

So p/(ħ) = (50.511 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm/c) ) = (50.511 / 197.33) * (1/(fm)).

So 50.511/197.33 ≈0.2562. So k=0.2562 fm^{-1}.

Wait, correct. So 1/k is approximately 3.904 fm.

So then, 3.904 *13.3818≈52.24 fm. But the options are in the hundreds or thousands.

Wait, maybe I forgot that the sum involves (1/k) times the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l. But perhaps I forgot a factor. Oh wait, the formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/k) * sum [(2l+1)(e^{i δ_l} -1) P_l( cosθ ) ].

But when taking the imaginary part, I had Im[f(0)] = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, that's correct. So 52.24 fm is the result.

But the options are much higher. So maybe I made a mistake in calculating k.

Wait, wait, maybe I didn't account for the fact that the phase shift formula is actually for the partial wave expansion. Let me think again about the definition of k.

Wait, the wave number k is given by (2π/λ), where λ is the wavelength. But for relativistic particles, the wavelength is given by λ = h/(p c), where h is Planck's constant, p is momentum.

Wait, but ħ = h/(2π), so h = 2π ħ. So λ = (2π ħ) / (p c) → 2π/(p c/ħ) ) → 2π/(k), since k = p/(ħ). So yes, k = 2π/λ.

But perhaps I should calculate k in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for k is k = sqrt(2mE)/(ħ), but wait, that's in the non-relativistic limit. Because in non-relativistic, E=(p²)/(2m). So k = p/(ħ) = sqrt(2mE)/(ħ) → but that's non-relativistic.

Wait, but since the electrons are 50 MeV, which is way above their rest mass (0.511 MeV), we can't use the non-relativistic formula. So using the relativistic approach is correct.

Wait, let me compute k again accurately.

E = 50.511 MeV.

m c² = 0.511 MeV.

So E² = (50.511)^2 = (50.511)^2 = 2551.4 MeV².

(m c²)^2 = (0.511)^2 ≈0.261 MeV².

So p c = sqrt(2551.4 -0.261) ≈sqrt(2551.14) ≈50.51 MeV.

So p =50.51 MeV / c.

But ħ c =197.33 MeV·fm.

So k = p/(ħ) = (50.51 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm/c) ) → the c in denominator and numerator cancels.

So 50.51 /197.33 =0.2562 fm^{-1}.

Thus, k=0.2562 fm^{-1}, as before.

Hmm, but then why the calculated Im(f(0)) is about 52.24 fm, which doesn't match any option? Let me look back at the problem statement.

Wait, the question says "along the incident beam direction," which is θ=0, so I think the approach is correct. But perhaps I missed a factor somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude includes a factor of 1/(2ik) for each term. Wait, let me recall the partial wave expansion.

The partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} [ e^{i δ_l} -1 ] P_l( cosθ )

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing different forms. Another source I recall says f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} - 1) P_l( cosθ ).

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is (1/k) times the sum. So the imaginary part would be the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l / k.

So my calculation seems correct, but the result doesn't match the options. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, let me recompute the sum:

Sum = 1 + 3*(sin67) +5*(sin55) +7*(sin30) +9*(sin13).

Compute each term precisely:

sin(90) = 1.0 → term 1.

sin(67) ≈0.9205048535 → 3 *0.9205048535=2.7615145605.

sin(55)=0.8191520443 →5 *0.8191520443=4.0957602215.

sin(30)=0.5 →7 *0.5=3.5.

sin(13)≈0.2249510543 →9 *0.2249510543=2.0245594887.

Now add them up:

1.0 → sum=1.0.

+2.7615145605 → sum=3.7615145605.

+4.0957602215 → sum=7.857274782.

+3.5 → sum=11.357274782.

+2.0245594887 → sum=13.3818342707.

So sum is ≈13.381834.

Then, multiply by 1/k=3.904:

3.904 *13.381834 = ?

Compute 3 *13.381834=40.145502.

0.904 *13.381834 = ?

Let me compute 0.9 *13.381834 =12.0436506.

0.004 *13.381834=0.053527336.

So 12.0436506 +0.053527336=12.097177936.

Adding to 40.145502 gives 40.145502 +12.097177936=52.24268 fm.

Hmm, so about 52.24 fm. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the imaginary part.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (2l+1) sin δ_l / (2k) instead of 1/k. Because sometimes the amplitude is written with a factor of (1/(2ik)).

Wait, let me double-check. Another source says that the scattering amplitude in partial waves is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ). Wait, perhaps the correct formula is (1/(2ik)) times the sum.

So the imaginary part of f(θ) would then be [ (1/(2k) ) * Sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ].

Wait, because e^{i δ} -1 = (cos δ -1) + i sin δ. So the imaginary part is (2l+1) sin δ.

Wait, but if f(θ) is (1/(2ik)) times the sum, then the imaginary part would involve (1/(2k)) multiplied by the sum of (2l+1) sin δ.

Wait, let's think about this. f(θ) would be (1/(2ik)) [ (2l+1) (e^{i δ} -1) P_l( cosθ ) ] summed over l.

Taking the imaginary part of each term, the e^{i δ} -1 has real part (cos δ -1) and imaginary part sin δ. So when multiplied by (1/(2ik)), which is (-i)/(2k), the imaginary part would come from the real part of (e^{i δ} -1), because (1/(2ik)) multiplied by real number would contribute to the imaginary part. Let me see:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * A, where A is the sum.

So, (1/(2ik)) * A = [A/(2ik)].

The imaginary part of this is Im( [A/(2ik)] )= [Re(A)]/(2k) ), because 1/(2ik) = (-i)/(2k). So when you multiply by A, which is [ (2l+1)(e^{i δ} -1) P_l], the imaginary part of (1/(2ik)) * A is (Re(A)) / (2k).

Wait, no. Let me compute: Let me write A as (2l+1)(e^{i δ} -1) P_l.

So A = (2l+1)(P_l) ( (cos δ -1) + i sin δ ).

Then, f = (1/(2ik)) * A.

So f = [ (2l+1) P_l ( (cos δ -1) + i sin δ ) ] / (2ik).

Now, expanding this: f = [ (2l+1) P_l ( (cos δ -1) ) ]/(2ik) ) + [ (2l+1) P_l ( sin δ ) ]/(2ik).

Each term can be considered. The first term is a real number multiplied by 1/(2ik), which is (1/(2i k)) * real. The second term is a real number multiplied by 1/(2ik).

Now, 1/(2ik) = ( -i )/( 2k ), because 1/i = -i.

So, the first term becomes [ (2l+1) P_l (cos δ -1) ] * ( -i ) / (2k ).

The second term is [ (2l+1) P_l sin δ ] * ( -i )/(2k ).

The imaginary part of f comes from the imaginary components of these terms.

Looking at each term:

- The first term is purely imaginary, since it's multiplied by -i. So the imaginary part is [ (2l+1) P_l (cos δ -1) ) * (-1) ] / (2k ).

- The second term is also purely imaginary, so its contribution is [ (2l+1) P_l sin δ ) * (-1) ] / (2k ).

Wait, but wait, the original expression is the sum over l, so when you take the imaginary part of f, it's the sum of the imaginary parts of each term.

So the imaginary part would be:

Im(f) = (1/(2k)) * [ Sum (2l+1) P_l (1 - cos δ_l ) ] - (1/(2k)) Sum (2l+1) P_l sin δ_l. 

Wait, but for θ=0, P_l(1)=1. So P_l=1 for all l, as before.

So Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) [ Sum (2l+1)(1 - cos δ_l) - Sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ].

Wait, this complicates things because now I have two sums. But earlier, I thought only the second term (the sin δ) contributed. But according to this, that's not the case. Oh, so I might have made a mistake earlier by only considering one term.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The initial approach was that f(0) = (1/k) Sum (2l+1) (e^{i δ} -1) P_l, and the imaginary part is (1/k) Sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

But according to this new approach, the correct expression is (1/(2k)) [ Sum (2l+1)(1 - cos δ_l) - Sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ].

But this is a different expression. So perhaps I've been using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps I should find a more reliable source or formula. Let me think: The partial wave expansion is f(θ,φ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ) e^{i (2l) φ}.

Wait, but when we're considering the amplitude along the incident direction, perhaps we can assume that the scattering is symmetric in φ, or perhaps we're only considering the leading term without angular dependence. Alternatively, considering that for elastic scattering, the dominant contribution comes from the first few phase shifts. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expressed in terms of the optical theorem, which relates the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude to the total cross-section. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I should be using is Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) * Sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

Wait, that doesn't seem familiar. Alternatively, I might have the wrong formula for the imaginary part.

Wait, let me think about the expression for f(θ=0):

f(0) = (1/k) Sum (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} -1) P_l(1) = (1/k) Sum (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} -1).

Since P_l(1)=1. So, expanding (e^{i δ} -1) = e^{i δ} -1.

So, f(0) = (1/k) Sum (2l+1) ( cos δ_l + i sin δ_l -1 )

= (1/k) Sum (2l+1) [ (cos δ_l -1) + i sin δ_l ]

So the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/k) Sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

But according to the previous detailed calculation, that gives me 52.24 fm, which doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, but perhaps the formula is Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) Sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Because I've seen some sources where f is written as (1/(2ik)) Sum ... leading to Im(f) being (1/(2k)) Sum ... sin δ_l.

Wait, let me think again. If f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Sum (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} -1) P_l( cosθ ), then for θ=0, the imaginary part would be:

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) Sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So that would give:

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) * 13.381834.

Which would be (1/(2 * 0.2562)) ) * 13.381834.

1/(0.5124) ≈1.9518 fm.

Multiply by 13.3818 → 1.9518 *13.3818 ≈26.16 fm.

Still, that doesn't match any of the options. So I'm getting more confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I completely missed a factor of 2. Let me see. If the sum is for l=0 to l=4, and each term is (2l+1) sin δ_l, then perhaps I have a mistake in the sum. Let me recompute the sum again.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in degrees and I need to convert them to radians before taking the sine. Oh! Oh, right, I forgot that! Oh no, that's a big mistake. Because in the formula, the phase shifts are in radians, but the problem gives them in degrees. So I need to convert each δ_l from degrees to radians before taking their sine.

Wait, yes! That's a crucial mistake I made. So for example, sin(90 degrees) is 1, which is correct. But for others:

Let me recompute each term with δ_l in radians.

First, convert each δ_l to radians:

δ0 =90 degrees → π/2 radians → approx 1.5708 rad.

δ1=67 degrees →67 * π/180 ≈1.16937 rad.

δ2=55 →55 * π/180≈0.95993 rad.

δ3=30 → π/6≈0.523599 rad.

δ4=13 →13 * π/180≈0.226893 rad.

Now, compute the sines:

sin(δ0)=sin(1.5708)=1.0.

sin(δ1)=sin(1.16937)≈0.916515.

Wait, earlier I used 0.9205 which was for degrees. So let's compute each correctly.

Compute each (2l+1)*sin(δ_l in radians):

l=0:

(1) * sin(90°)=1 → correct.

l=1:3 * sin(67° in radians)=3 * sin(1.16937) ≈3 *0.916515 ≈2.749545.

Wait, let me compute more accurately:

sin(67°) →67 degrees is 1.16937 radians.

Compute sin(1.16937):

I can compute with a calculator:

sin(1.16937) ≈0.916515.

So 3 *0.916515=2.749545.

l=2:5 * sin(55°)=5 * sin(0.95993) ≈5 *0.81915 → wait, 0.81915 is sin(55° in degrees), but in radians, which is what I should be using.

Wait, no, wait: wait, I thought I was converting to radians, but perhaps I'm getting confused. No, the point is that the formula uses radians, so the sine function in the formula is for radians. So when I compute sin(δ_l), I need to use the radian measure.

So for δ2=55 degrees = 0.95993 radians.

sin(0.95993) ≈0.81915 (wait, but that's the same as sin(55°), which I thought was correct. Wait, but in reality, sin(55 degrees)=sin(0.95993 radians)= approx 0.81915.

So 5 *0.81915=4.09575.

l=3:7 * sin(30 degrees)=7 * sin(0.523599) → sin(30)=0.5 →7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13 degrees)=9 * sin(0.226893) → sin(13 degrees)=0.224951→9 *0.224951≈2.02456.

So let me recompute the sum with these corrected sine values for radians:

Sum = 1 (l=0) 

+2.749545 (l=1)
=3.749545.

+4.09575 (l=2)
=7.845295.

+3.5 (l=3)
=11.345295.

+2.02456 (l=4)
=13.369855.

So the sum is approximately 13.369855.

Now, compute Im(f(0)) = (1/k) * sum → 3.904 *13.369855 ≈ ?

3.904 *13.369855.

Compute 3 *13.369855=40.109565.

0.904 *13.369855.

0.9 *13.369855=12.032870.

0.004 *13.369855=0.053479.

So 12.032870 +0.053479=12.086349.

Total:40.109565 +12.086349=52.195914 fm.

Still about 52.19 fm, which doesn't match any of the options. So I'm still confused.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the phase shifts are given as the scattering phase shifts, and I'm supposed to sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, but with the assumption that each δ_l is in degrees, and the calculation uses degrees. But earlier I thought they should be in radians for the sine function, but perhaps the problem assumes that the formula uses degrees, which would be incorrect. But let me see what happens if I compute the sines using degrees.

Wait, that's what I did before, which gave me a sum of approximately 13.3818, leading to about 52.24 fm. So that's the same situation.

But perhaps the approach is entirely different. Let me think again. The problem asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam, which implies θ=0. The imaginary part of the amplitude in that direction is related to the total cross-section via the optical theorem. Wait, the optical theorem states that the total cross-section is (4π/k²) Im(f(0)).

So σ_total = (4π/k²) Im(f(0)).

But I don't know if that helps me here, because I'm given phase shifts and need to compute Im(f(0)), not the cross-section.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is different. Maybe the formula is f(θ) = (1/k) Sum (2l+1) [ sin δ_l ] P_l( cosθ ), but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the formula includes the phase shift in a different way. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, then multiply by (1/k). But in that case, with the sum being 13.369855 and k=0.2562, 13.369855 /0.2562 ≈52.19 fm.

But the options are much larger, so perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k using the relativistic energy correctly. Let me see: E² = (pc )² + (m c² )².

So p c = sqrt(E² - (m c^2)^2 ).

E is 50.511 MeV, m c^2 is 0.511 MeV.

p c = sqrt( (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈50.511 MeV.

So p =50.511 MeV / c.

Now, k = p / ħ = (50.511 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm/c) ) → 50.511 /197.33 ≈0.2562 fm^{-1}.

So that's correct.

Another thought: perhaps the phase shifts are given in terms of radians, but when I compute the sine, I should have used the actual radian measure. But I did that, and it didn't change the sum much.

Wait, the problem gives phase shifts as δ0=90°, δ1=67°, etc. So when I compute sin δ_l, I should use the value in radians.

Wait, but when I did that, the sum went from 13.3818 to 13.3698, which is a small change. So it's about the same.

Hmm. Maybe the calculation is correct and the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the relativistic Breit-Wigner formula or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the differential cross-section, but the question specifically asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, not the cross-section.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in the forward direction is (1/(2k)) Sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Then, Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) * 13.369855.

Which would give (1/(2 *0.2562 )) *13.369855 → 1/(0.5124) ≈1.9518 fm^{-1}.

Multiply by 13.369855 →1.9518 *13.369855≈26.15 fm.

Still doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (1/k) times the sum of (2l+1) sin (2δ_l). Let's see:

Sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l):

For l=0: sin(180°)=0.

l=1: sin(134°)=sin(180-46)=sin46≈0.7193 →3 *0.7193=2.1579.

l=2: sin(110°)=sin(70)=0.9397 →5 *0.9397=4.6985.

l=3: sin(60°)=√3/2≈0.8660 →7 *0.8660≈6.062.

l=4: sin(26°)=0.4384 →9*0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum:0 +2.1579=2.1579.

+4.6985=6.8564.

+6.062=12.9184.

+3.9456=16.864.

Im(f(0))= (1/k)*16.864≈3.904 *16.864≈65.7 fm.

Hmm, still not matching the options. So that's not it.

Another thought: perhaps the imaginary part is actually the sum multiplied by (1/(2k)).

So 13.369855 / (2*0.2562) )=13.369855/(0.5124)=26.11 fm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which gives 26.11 fm. Not matching options.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 177.675 fm, which is about 177.7 fm. That's approximately 3.4 times 52.24 fm. Hmm, but why would it be multiplied by 3.4?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the phase shift values. Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are in units of 100 degrees or something? That seems unlikely, but perhaps the phase shifts are given in degrees, but I should have used them as in δ in radians. But no, that's what I did, and the result didn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the real part, but that doesn't make sense because the question specifies the imaginary part.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me double-check that.

E = 50.511 MeV.

p c = sqrt( (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈50.511 MeV.

So p =50.511 MeV/c.

k = p / ħ.

But ħ c=197.33 MeV·fm → ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm) / c.

So k = (50.511 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm / c ) )= (50.511/197.33) fm^{-1} → 0.2562 fm^{-1}.

That seems correct.

Wait, but perhaps the wave number k is given by k = (sqrt(2mE)) / ħ. But that's the non-relativistic formula. Since E is 50 MeV, which is much larger than m c^2 (0.511 MeV), the non-relativistic approach would be highly inaccurate. But let me see what happens if I use it.

In non-relativistic case:

E = (p²)/(2m) → p = sqrt(2 m E).

k = p / ħ = sqrt(2 m E ) / ħ.

But m is the electron mass, which is 9.109e-31 kg. E is 50 MeV = 50e6 * 1.602e-13 J = 8.01e-6 J.

So 2mE = 2 *9.109e-31 kg *8.01e-6 J → but wait, J = kg m²/s². So 2mE = 2 *9.109e-31 *8.01e-6 → let's compute:

2 *9.109e-31 =1.8218e-30.

1.8218e-30 *8.01e-6 =1.46e-35 kg m²/s².

k = sqrt(1.46e-35) / ħ → sqrt(1.46e-35) ≈3.82e-18 m^{-1}.

But ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s → approximately 1e-34 J s.

So k = 3.82e-18 / 1.0545718e-34 → approx 3.62e16 m^{-1}.

But 1 fm =1e-15 m, so 1 fm^{-1} =1e15 m^{-1}.

So 3.62e16 m^{-1} =36.2 fm^{-1}.

So k≈36.2 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that's a very different value of k than the relativistic calculation. But again, this is for a non-relativistic case, which is not applicable here.

But using this k, the Im(f(0)) would be sum * 1/k →13.369855 /36.2 ≈0.369 fm.

Which is even smaller, not matching the options.

So perhaps I'm stuck. I think my initial approach was correct, but I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula for Im(f(0)) is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by (1/(2k)).

So Im(f(0))= (1/(2k)) * sum → (1/(2*0.2562)) *13.369855 → 1/(0.5124) =1.9518 → 1.9518 *13.369855 ≈26.15 fm.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm supposed to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ4. But I did that.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula uses (2l+1) times the cotangent of δ_l? No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem provides the phase shifts in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} [1 - e^{-i δ_l} ] P_l.

Which would be f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) [e^{i δ_l} -1] P_l.

So the imaginary part is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which brings us back to the same calculation: 52.24 fm.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the problem has a typo, or I'm using the wrong approach.

Wait, let me look at the options again. Option B is 355.351 fm, which is approximately 355 fm. If I multiply my result (52.24) by 6.8, I get around 355. So perhaps I missed a factor of 7 or something.

Wait, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l divided by (k/2), which would give sum/(k/2) = 2 sum /k.

So Im(f(0))= 2 sum /k → 2 *13.369855 /0.2562 ≈2 *52.24 =104.48 fm.

Still not matching. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the sum without dividing by k, which would give sum=13.369855, but that's way too small.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0)) = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (k/ (2π)).

But that would be sum/(k/(2π)) = sum * 2π/k → 13.369855 * 2π /0.2562 → approx 13.37 *6.283 /0.2562 →13.37 *24.53 → approx 327.7 fm. Still not matching.

I'm really stuck here. Let me think about the possible factors. Maybe I made a mistake in the value of ħ c. I used ħ c=197.33 MeV fm, which is correct. So k calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the scattering amplitude, but about the differential cross-section. The differential cross-section is given by |f(θ)|^2, but the question specifically asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude.

Another thought: perhaps the phase shifts are given in degrees, but the formula requires them in radians. So converting each δ_l to radians:

Wait, I did that earlier, which changed the sum from 13.38 to 13.3698. Not a big change.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me look up the partial wave expansion formula.

Upon checking (using my memory), the scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ).

The imaginary part of f(θ) is then (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so Im(f(0))= (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So, unless I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere, I think my calculation is correct, but it doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of inverse femtometers, but that's what I have. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the sum.

Let me recompute the sum with the phase shifts in radians:

δ0=90° →1.5708 rad → sin=1.0 → term=1.

δ1=67 →1.16937 rad → sin≈0.916515 → term=3 *0.916515=2.749545.

δ2=55 →0.95993 rad → sin≈0.81915 → term=5 *0.81915=4.09575.

δ3=30 →0.523599 rad → sin=0.5 → term=7 *0.5=3.5.

δ4=13 →0.226893 rad → sin≈0.22598 → term=9 *0.22598≈2.0338.

Sum =1 +2.749545=3.749545.

+4.09575=7.845295.

+3.5=11.345295.

+2.0338=13.379095.

So sum ≈13.3791.

Im(f(0))= (1/k) * sum →13.3791 /0.2562≈52.23 fm.

Hmm. So that's the same as before.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem expects the sum to include different terms or I have made a mistake in the phase shift values.

Wait, let me recheck the phase shift values:

δ0=90, δ1=67, δ2=55, δ3=30, δ4=13.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, maybe the problem is using a different value for ħ c. For example, ħ c=197.33 MeV·fm. But sometimes, it's approximated as 197 MeV·fm. Let me see what happens if I use ħ c=197 MeV·fm.

Then, k=50.511 /197≈0.2568 fm^{-1}.

1/k≈3.900 fm.

So Im(f)=3.900 *13.379≈52.20 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses E=50 MeV as the kinetic energy, and not the total energy. Wait, but the problem states "elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons", which typically refers to kinetic energy.

But if E_kinetic=50 MeV, then the total energy E =50 +0.511=50.511 MeV, as I used earlier. So that's correct.

Another possibility: perhaps I should have used the reduced mass of the system. But since the target is a nucleus, and electrons are much lighter, the reduced mass μ ≈m_e *M/(m_e + M) ≈m_e, because M (nuclear mass) is much larger than m_e. So this would not change the calculation significantly.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the reduced mass in the calculation of k. Let me try that.

The reduced mass μ = (m_e * M)/(m_e + M) ≈ m_e (1 - m_e/M), where M is the nuclear mass. But since M is much larger than m_e, μ ≈m_e. So for practical purposes, using m_e is fine. But let me compute it more accurately.

Assume M is the mass of a proton, about 938 MeV/c². So m_e is 0.511 MeV/c².

μ = (m_e * M) / (m_e + M ) = (0.511 *938) / (0.511 +938) ≈ (480.278) / (938.511) ≈0.511 MeV/c², since denominator is ≈938. So μ ≈0.511 MeV/c².

So the calculation of E and p would be the same, as E is the kinetic energy plus rest energy.

Hmm, so it makes no significant difference.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities and can't find a match. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but given the options, the closest I can get is around 52.2 fm, which isn't listed. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the real part instead of the imaginary part. Let me compute that quickly.

The real part would be (1/k) Sum (2l+1)(cos δ_l -1).

Compute each term:

l=0:1*(cos90-1)=0-1= -1.

l=1:3*(cos67 -1) → cos67≈0.3907 →0.3907-1= -0.6093 →3*(-0.6093)= -1.8279.

l=2:5*(cos55-1) →cos55≈0.5736 →0.5736-1= -0.4264 →5*(-0.4264)= -2.132.

l=3:7*(cos30-1) →cos30≈0.8660 →0.8660-1= -0.134 →7*(-0.134)= -0.938.

l=4:9*(cos13-1) →cos13≈0.9744 →0.9744-1= -0.0256 →9*(-0.0256)= -0.2304.

Sum these:

-1 -1.8279= -2.8279.

-2.132 → -4.9599.

-0.938 →-5.8979.

-0.2304 →-6.1283.

So Re(f(0))= (1/k)* (-6.1283) → 3.904 * (-6.1283) ≈-23.91 fm.

But the question is about the imaginary part, so this isn't relevant.

Hmm. I'm at a loss. Given that, I think the correct answer based on my calculations is approximately 52.24 fm, but since that's not an option, I must have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given in terms of their supplementary angles or something, but I don't see how that would align with the options.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) 87163.4 fm → way too large.

B)355.351 fm.

C)177.675 fm.

D)251.271 fm.

Wait, 355 is approximately 7 times 50.7. Hmm. 52.24 *7=365.68, which is close to option B. But I don't see where the factor of 7 would come from.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum should be (2l+1) sin δ_l, but each δ is in degrees, and I should have converted them to radians. But I did that, so it's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the phase shifts in a different way, like in the denominator.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is using the formula Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l).

But earlier, with that approach, I got about 65.7 fm, which is closer to option D (251) but not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l) / (k) → which is what I did, but perhaps the sum is actually (2l+1) multiplied by something else.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the sum of (2l+1) multiplied by tan δ_l, but that would complicate things.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is using the formula:

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^L (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l).

But I have no basis for this, but let me try:

Compute 2 δ_l for each l:

δ0=90 →180 → sin=0.

δ1=67 →134 → sin≈0.7193 →3 *0.7193=2.1579.

δ2=55 →110 → sin≈0.9397 →5 *0.9397=4.6985.

δ3=30 →60 → sin≈0.8660 →7 *0.8660≈6.062.

δ4=13 →26 →sin≈0.4384 →9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum: 0 +2.1579=2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564 +6.062=12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

Im(f(0))= (1/(2k)) * 16.864 →(1/(2 *0.2562 )) *16.864 →(1/0.5124)*16.864 ≈32.9 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but given my calculation, I think the closest is option B, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me check that again.

Wait, another thought: I calculated k as p/(ħ) → p=50.511 MeV/c. But perhaps I should have used E instead of p. No, that's not correct because k is p/(ħ), not E/(ħ).

Wait, perhaps the correct value of k is (E/(ħ c)) * (1/c). Let me think:

Wait, E=pc →p=E/c.

So p= E/c.

Then, k = p/ħ = (E/c) / ħ → E in MeV, ħ c=197.33 MeV·fm.

So E/c in units of MeV/(c) → but with units, perhaps E in MeV, ħ in MeV·fm, so:

k = E/(c ħ) ) → E in MeV, c in units where c=197.33 MeV fm^{-1}.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mess with units. Let me approach it differently.

Given that ħ c =197.33 MeV·fm, then c = ħ/(197.33 MeV fm^{-1}).

So, E/c = E * (197.33 MeV fm^{-1}) ) / ħ.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Another approach: perhaps k = (E) / (ħ c^2) * (1/c) → no, not helpful.

Hmm. I think I've tried all possible avenues and can't find a path to any of the given options. Based on my calculations, the correct answer should be approximately 52.24 fm, which isn't listed. However, since none of the options match, I'm probably missing something crucial. Maybe the formula should be multiplied by something else. Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given in another way or the question has a typo.

Given the options, the only one close to my calculation when considering possible factors is option C (177.675 fm), which is about 3.4 times larger than my result. If I multiply 52.24 by 3.36, I get approximately 175, which is option C. But I don't know where that factor would come from.

Another possibility: perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by (1/k), but with k in units of inverse meters instead of inverse femtometers. That would make the result much larger.

Wait, wait! Oh my god, I think I see the mistake. I was using k in units of inverse femtometers, but perhaps I should have used inverse meters. That would change everything.

Wait, let's recompute k in inverse meters.

Wait, 1 fm =1e-15 meters. So 1 fm^{-1}=1e15 m^{-1}.

I have k=0.2562 fm^{-1}.

Convert to m^{-1}: 0.2562 *1e15 m^{-1} =2.562e14 m^{-1}.

But that's a huge number. Not likely. Alternatively, perhaps I should have kept k in fm^{-1} but used a different scaling.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for k is in terms of 1/(fm), but I have to multiply by a conversion factor.

Wait, no, I think I'm stuck. I think the correct answer based on calculations is approximately 52.24 fm, but since that's not an option, I must have made a mistake somewhere. But given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option C) 177.675 fm. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I missed a factor of 3.4 somewhere. But without knowing where, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of the sum is wrong. Let me recompute the sum using degrees for the sine function.

For l=0: sin(90)=1 →1*1=1.

l=1: sin(67)=0.9205 →3*0.9205=2.7615.

l=2: sin(55)=0.8192 →5*0.8192=4.096.

l=3: sin(30)=0.5 →7*0.5=3.5.

l=4: sin(13)=0.22495 →9*0.22495=2.02455.

Sum=1+2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.02455=13.38205.

Im(f(0))= (1/k)*sum →13.38205 /0.2562≈52.24 fm.

Still the same result. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but if I have to choose based on the options, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses (2l+1) sin δ_l without dividing by k. So Im(f)=13.38205 fm.

But that's not an option either.

Hmm. I think I'm at an impasse. Based on the calculations, the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps the intended answer is option C) 177.675 fm, which is approximately 3.4 times my result. But I can't see how that factor arises.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the sum as (2l+1) multiplied by the tangent of δ_l. Let me see:

Compute each term as (2l+1) tan δ_l.

But tan δ_l would be a different approach. Let's compute:

l=0:1 * tan(90) →infinite. So this approach isn't feasible.

So that's not it.

Another thought: perhaps the phase shifts are given in terms of the scattering angle, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))=(1/k) * sum ( (2l+1) ) * ( sin δ_l ) / (1 + cos δ_l ), but I'm making this up and have no basis for it.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= (1/k) * sum (2l+1) (1 - cos δ_l ), but that would give a negative contribution, which isn't the case.

I think I've tried everything and can't find a way to match the options. So, perhaps the correct answer is option B)355.351 fm, which is the only one in the same ballpark if I multiply my result by about 6.8, but without a clear reason. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to not divide by k, leading to sum=13.38205, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k. Let me try to compute k using E in keV instead of MeV. No, that would be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used E=50 MeV as the total energy, not the kinetic. Let's see:

If E=50 MeV (total), then m c² =0.511 MeV. So p c= sqrt(50^2 -0.511^2 )=49.999 MeV → p=49.999 MeV/c.

Then, k=49.999 /197.33≈0.2537 fm^{-1}.

Sum is 13.38205.

Im(f)=13.38205 /0.2537≈52.75 fm.

Still doesn't match.

I think I've spent too much time on this and need to make a choice. Based on my calculations, the correct answer isn't listed, but the closest option is C)177.675 fm, which is roughly 3.4 times my result. But without a valid reason for this factor, I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D)251.271 fm, which is approximately 4.8 times my result.

But given that, I think I'll go with option C)177.675 fm, but I'm not certain.


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction for elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. The phase shifts provided are $\delta_0 = 90^\circ$, $\delta_1 = 67^\circ$, $\delta_2 = 55^\circ$, $\delta_3 = 30^\circ$, and $\delta_4 = 13^\circ$. The scattering amplitude is expressed in terms of partial waves, and the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude ($\theta = 0^\circ$) is given by:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(\delta_l),
\]

where $k$ is the wave number, calculated using the relativistic energy relation. The total energy $E$ is approximately $50.511$ MeV, and the wave number $k$ is determined as:

\[
k = \frac{p}{\hbar}, \quad p = \frac{\sqrt{E^2 - (m c^2)^2}}{c}, \quad \text{and} \quad \hbar c = 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm}.
\]

From the calculations, $k \approx 0.2562 \, \text{fm}^{-1}$. The sum $\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(\delta_l)$ is computed by converting the phase shifts from degrees to radians and calculating the sine of each:

- For $l=0$: $(2l+1)\sin(90^\circ) = 1$.
- For $l=1$: $(2l+1)\sin(67^\circ) \approx 3 \cdot 0.9165 = 2.7495$.
- For $l=2$: $(2l+1)\sin(55^\circ) \approx 5 \cdot 0.8192 = 4.096$.
- For $l=3$: $(2l+1)\sin(30^\circ) = 7 \cdot 0.5 = 3.5$.
- For $l=4$: $(2l+1)\sin(13^\circ) \approx 9 \cdot 0.22495 = 2.0246$.

Summing these terms gives:

\[
\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1)\sin(\delta_l) \approx 1 + 2.7495 + 4.096 + 3.5 + 2.0246 = 13.3791.
\]

The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is then:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{k} \cdot \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1)\sin(\delta_l) = \frac{13.3791}{0.2562} \approx 52.24 \, \text{fm}.
\]

This result does not match any of the provided options. The closest option is **C) 177.675 fm**, which is approximately 3.4 times larger than the calculated value. While the factor of 3.4 is unexplained, it may arise from an implicit assumption or missing factor in the problem setup. Given the options, the most reasonable choice is:
