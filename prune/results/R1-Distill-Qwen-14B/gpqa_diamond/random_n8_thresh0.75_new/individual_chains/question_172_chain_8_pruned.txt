Okay, so I've got this question about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me think. So the problem says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2 for a specific energy level. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. We need to find the correct equation relating their effective temperatures T1 and T2, assuming LTE.

Wait, LTE means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, right? So the stars' photospheres are in thermal equilibrium, so I can probably use the Boltzmann distribution here. The Boltzmann factor tells us about the population of energy levels in such conditions.

The Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(kT) ), where g is the statistical weight, E the energy, k the Boltzmann constant, and T the temperature.

In this case, the energy difference is given as delta E = 1.38e-23 J. Let me note that E2 is higher than E1? Or wait, the problem says the energy difference between the considered levels is known. So maybe E2 - E1 = 1.38e-23 J.

But wait, the question says star_1 has iron atoms twice as excited in a specific energy level. So the excited state is higher than the ground state, perhaps? Or wait, maybe it's about the excitation relative to another level? Hmm, maybe I should think of the two energy levels as E1 and E2, where E2 is higher than E1. The excitation is the energy difference between them.

So the ratio of the populations is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(kT) )

But wait, in the problem, it's stated that the excitation is twice as much. Oh wait, wait. They say the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So perhaps the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2 for the same energy level? Or maybe the excitation potential is twice as high? No, no, the energy difference between the levels is fixed as given.

Wait, the problem states that the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J for both stars. So for each star, the same E difference exists between their respective levels. So for star 1 and 2, the same delta E.

But the excitation level (number of atoms in the upper energy level) is different. Specifically, in star 1, the population is twice that of star 2.

Wait, the problem says: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2."

Oh, so perhaps the number of excited atoms (n_upper) in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So for each star, considering their respective temperatures, we can write the ratio n_upper/n_lower.

Let me denote n1_upper as the population in star_1's upper level, n1_lower as the lower. Similarly for star_2: n2_upper and n2_lower.

So according to the problem, n1_upper = 2 * n2_upper.

But wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe it
