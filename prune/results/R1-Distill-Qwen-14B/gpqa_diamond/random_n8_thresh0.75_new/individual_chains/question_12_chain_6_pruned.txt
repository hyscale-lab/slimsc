Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain decay process. Let me read it again.

The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Here, the pion is stationary. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. We're asked to find the kinetic energy of the products, and we have four options to choose from.

Hmm, okay. I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays into two or more particles, conservation of energy and momentum must hold. Since the pion is at rest initially, the total momentum after decay must be zero. So the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky. They have very little mass, right? I think the muon neutrino's mass is negligible compared to the muon's, so maybe we can approximate it as massless. That should simplify things.

So, let's denote the muon as mu(+) and the neutrino as nu. Let me denote the rest masses as m_pi, m_mu, and m_nu. Since m_nu is negligible, maybe we can treat it as zero.

The pion's rest mass is m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV, and the muon's is m_mu c² = 105.7 MeV. The neutrino's mass is m_nu c² ≈ 0.

The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion: E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The energy of each particle is the sum of their rest energy and kinetic energy. But the neutrino's rest energy is zero, so its energy is just kinetic energy, E_nu = K_nu.

So, E_final = (E_mu + K_mu) + E_nu. But E_mu is its rest energy plus kinetic energy, right? Wait, no, E_mu is the total energy, which is gamma * m_mu c². Oh wait, but K_mu = (gamma -1) m_mu c².

Hmm, but maybe I can approach this using conservation of energy and momentum.

Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay must be zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal and opposite. Let's denote the muon's momentum as p, then the neutrino's momentum is -p. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

But since the neutrino is massless, its energy is just |p_nu| c. So E_nu = |p_nu| c = |p_mu| c.

Now, the muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ). So E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

The neutrino's energy is E_nu = p c.

The total energy after decay is E_mu + E_n
