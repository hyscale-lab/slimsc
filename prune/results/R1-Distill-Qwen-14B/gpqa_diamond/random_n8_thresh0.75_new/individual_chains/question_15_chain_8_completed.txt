Okay, I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about which planet is more likely to transit, so the researchers should observe that one. Let me think through what I know about transits and the factors that influence the probability of a planet transiting its star.

So, the question says we have two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both were detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits. The host stars have the same radii but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's star.

The question is about the probability of a transit. I remember that the transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the inclination of the orbit. But wait, RV method gives us the mass, but it doesn't tell us the exact inclination because it's most sensitive to the velocity along our line of sight. However, since both planets have the same minimum mass, the RV method can't determine their true masses unless we know the inclination. But in this case, since they're observed via RV, the planets' orbits are likely edge-on or close to it for a higher transit probability, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, the probability of a transit is mainly a function of the planet's orbital inclination relative to our line of sight. For a planet to transit, its orbit must be nearly aligned with our line of sight, which is a probability based on the star's size and the planet's orbital distance.

The formula I recall for the probability of a transit is approximately (R_p / a)^2, but wait, maybe it's more precise to say it's proportional to (R_p / a), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star's disk to the area of the orbit, but that might be a simplification.

Alternatively, I think the probability of a transit is given by (R_star / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))), where e is the orbital eccentricity. But in this case, both orbits are circular, so e=0, and the probability simplifies to R_star / a. But wait, that would be if the orbital period is a function of a. Hmm, no, because a is the semi-major axis, which for a circular orbit is just the radius.

Wait, no, the formula I remember is that the probability P is roughly (R*/a), where R* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, that might not be entirely correct. Let me think again. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is close to edge-on, such that it passes in front of the star from our perspective. The probability depends on how likely the planet's orbital plane is aligned that way.

The probability can be approximated as (R* / a). Because the maximum angle we can observe a transit is when the planet's orbit is aligned such that its orbital plane is edge-on. The formula for the probability is (R*/a) divided by the sine of the inclination, but I might be mixing up some concepts here.

Alternatively, the transit probability is (R_p + R_star)/(a) but R_p is much smaller than R_star, so you can approximate it as (R_star)/(a). But wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: the probability of a planet transiting is given by (R*/a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))) ), but since both planets have circular orbits, e is zero, so it's just R*/a. But wait, this can't be right because higher a (larger orbit) would make the probability lower. So, a planet with a smaller semi-major axis would have a higher probability of transiting.

But wait, the semi-major axis a depends on the orbital period via Kepler's third law. Kepler's law states that (a^3)/(T^2) is proportional to (M_star + M_planet) / (M_sun). But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star, we can approximate a^3 proportional to (M_star) * T^2.

Wait, wait: the exact formula from Kepler's third law is a^3 = [G(M_star + M_planet) * T^2 ] / (4π²). Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M_planet << M_star, so a^3 ≈ G M_star T^2 / (4π²). So a is proportional to (M_star * T^2)^(1/3).

So, let me calculate a for both planets.

Given:

- Planet_1: P1 = P. Planet_2: P2 = 3P.

Wait, no, the question says Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 has P_1 = P, Planet_2 has P_2 = 3P.

Wait, no, the question says "the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2." So if Planet_2's period is T, Planet_1's is T/3.

Wait, yes. So for Planet_1, P1 = (1/3) * P2.

So let's denote:

- P1 = T, so P2 = 3T.

Wait, maybe it's easier to just assign numbers. Let me think of P1 as P, so P2 is 3P.

The masses of the stars: M1 = 2*M2, where M1 is the host of Planet_1, M2 is the host of Planet_2.

So M1 = 2*M2.

So for each planet:

a1 is the semi-major axis for Planet_1: a1^3 = (G * M1 * P1^2 )/(4π²)

Similarly, a2^3 = (G * M2 * P2^2 )/(4π²)

So taking the ratio a1^3 / a2^3 = (M1 * P1^2) / (M2 * P2^2 )

But M1 = 2*M2, and P1 = (P2)/3, since P1 is shorter. So:

a1^3 / a2^3 = [2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 ] / [ M2 * P2^2 ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

M2 cancels out. P2^2 in numerator is (P2^2)/(9), denominator is P2^2.

So:

[2 * (P2²)/(9) ] / [P2^2] = 2/(9) * (P2^2)/(P2^2) ) = 2/9.

So a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Wait, 2/9 is approximately 0.222, cube root is about 0.6. Let me compute (2/9)^(1/3). Let me factor 2/9 as 2/(3^2). So (2)^(1/3) / (3)^(2/3) ) ≈ 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.607. So a1 ≈ 0.607 * a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2 is to its.

Now, the transit probability is proportional to R* / a, because the formula is (R*/a) * (something else, but for circular, it's R*/a).

Wait, no, I think the correct probability is (R*/a), but I'm not entirely certain. Let me think again.

The transit probability P is the fraction of the time when the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. The probability is given by:

P = (R* / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))) )

But since e=0 for both, that term is 1. So P = (R* / a).

But wait, both stars have the same radius, R* is same for both.

Wait, the question says: "both host stars have the same radii." So R1 = R2.

So for Planet_1: P1 = R* / a1.

For Planet_2: P2 = R* / a2.

So the ratio P1/P2 = (R*/a1) / (R*/a2) ) = a2/a1.

From earlier, a1 ≈ 0.607 a2 → a2 = a1 / 0.607 ≈ 1.646 a1.

So a2/a1 ≈ 1.646. So P1 = 1.646 * P2.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the transit probability is P = (R*/a). So for Planet_1, P1 = R*/a1. For Planet_2, P2 = R*/a2. So the ratio of their probabilities is (R*/a1) / (R*/a2) ) = a2/a1.

Because a1 is smaller than a2, a2/a1 is greater than 1, so P1 is higher?

Wait, no. Let me compute the ratio more accurately.

We have a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2.

Wait, wait, earlier calculation was a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

So a2 = a1 / (2/9)^(1/3) = a1 * (9/2)^(1/3).

So (9/2) is 4.5, so cube root is about 1.65.

So a2 = a1 * 1.65 → a2/a1 = 1.65.

So P1 = R*/a1.

P2 = R*/a2 = R*/(a1 * 1.65 ) → R/(a1 * 1.65 ) = (R/a1) * 1/1.65 = P1 * (1/1.65).

So P1 is larger than P2, because 1/1.65 is about 0.606.

Alternatively, P1 is (a2/a1) times P2.

Wait, no, the ratio of P1/P2 is (R*/a1) / (R*/a2) ) = a2/a1 =1.65.

So P1 is about 1.65 times higher than P2.

Wait, so that would mean Planet_1 has a higher probability to transit than Planet_2.

But wait, I thought the transit probability increases when the semi-major axis is smaller, since R*/a is larger. Because a is smaller, R*/a is larger. So if a1 is smaller than a2, P1 is larger.

So in this case, since a1 is smaller, P1 is larger, so Planet_1 has higher transit probability.

Wait, but the options are about which planet is preferred. The researchers prefer the one with higher probability. So if Planet_1 has higher P, they should choose Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability.

Hmm. So according to my calculation, a2/a1 is about 1.65, so P1 is 1.65 times P2. So Planet_1 has higher probability.

So the correct option would be C or D.

Wait, but wait, maybe I messed up the ratio.

Let me re-examine.

We have:

a1^3 = (G M1 P1^2) / (4π²)

a2^3 = (G M2 P2^2 ) / (4π²)

Given M1 = 2 M2, P1 = P2 /3.

So,

a1^3 = G * 2 M2 * (P2^2 /9) / (4π²)

a2^3 = G * M2 * ( (3 P2)^2 ) / (4π² )

= G M2 * 9 P2^2 / (4 π² )

So,

a1^3 = (2 M2 G P2^2) / (9 * 4 π² )

a2^3 = (9 M2 G P2^2 )/(4 π² )

So taking the ratio a1^3 / a2^3 = [ (2 * P2^2 )/(9 * 4 ) ) ] / [ (9 P2^2 )/(4) ) ]

Wait, wait, perhaps an alternative approach without G etc.

Alternatively, since P is proportional to a^(1/3) * (M_star)^(-1/3), from Kepler's law.

Wait, from Kepler's third law: a^3 = (G(M_star) T^2)/(4 π² )

So a is proportional to T^(2/3) * (M_star)^(-1/3).

So a1 = k * T1^(2/3) * (M1)^(-1/3)

a2 = k * T2^(2/3) * (M2)^(-1/3 )

So the ratio a1/a2 = [ T1^(2/3) / T2^(2/3) ] * [ (M1 / M2 )^(-1/3) ]

Given T1 = T /3, T2 = T.

M1 = 2 M2 → M1/M2=2.

So,

a1/a2 = ( (T/3) / T )^(2/3) * ( (2)^(-1) )^(1/3 )

= (1/3)^(2/3) * (1/2)^(1/3 )

= [ (1/3)^2 * (1/2) ]^(1/3 )

= (1/(9 * 2))^(1/3 )

= (1/18)^(1/3 )

≈ 0.38.

So a1 = 0.38 a2.

Which matches the earlier calculation because (2/9)^(1/3) is about 0.607? Wait, wait. Wait, 2/9 is about 0.222, cube root is about 0.6.

Wait, but in this approach, a1/a2 = (1/3)^(2/3) * (1/2)^(1/3 )

Which is the same as (1/3^2 * 1/2 )^(1/3 )

So 1/(9*2) = 1/18 → cube root of 1/18 is about 0.38. So a1 is about 0.38 a2.

So a2 is 1/0.38 ≈ 2.63 a1.

Wait, no, a1 = 0.38 a2 → a2 = a1 / 0.38 ≈ 2.63 a1.

So a2 is larger than a1.

So transit probability is R*/a.

R* is same.

So for P1: R*/a1.

For P2: R*/a2.

So P1 = R*/a1.

P2 = R*/ (2.63 a1 ) → P2 = P1 / 2.63.

So P1 is 2.63 times higher than P2.

Wait, that's different from the earlier calculation. So which approach is correct?

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck.

In this approach, a1/a2 = (1/3)^(2/3) * (1/2)^(1/3 )

Which equals (1^(2/3) )/(3^(2/3)) ) * (1^(1/3) )/(2^(1/3) )

= 1 / (3^(2/3) * 2^(1/3) )

3^(2/3) is cube root of 9, which is about 2.08.

2^(1/3) is about 1.26.

Multiply them: 2.08 * 1.26 ≈ 2.63.

So 1/2.63 ≈ 0.38.

So a1 = 0.38 a2 → a2 = a1 / 0.38 ≈ 2.63 a1.

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is R*/a1, which is (R*/a2) * a2/a1. Since a2 = 2.63 a1, a2/a1 is 2.63.

Wait, no. Because P1 = R*/a1, and P2 = R*/a2.

So P1 = (R*/a1) = (R*/a2) * (a2/a1) = P2 * (a2/a1).

Since a2/a1 is 2.63, so P1 = 2.63 * P2.

So Planet_1's probability is 2.63 times higher than Planet_2's.

So which option is that?

Looking back at the options:

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~2.25 times higher probability.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~1.5 times higher probability.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability.

So in my calculation, P1 is about 2.63 times P2, which is close to option D's 2.7 times. So the researchers would prefer Planet_1 with a higher probability.

But wait, why did the earlier approach give a different result? Let me check that.

Earlier approach when I directly calculated the cube of a1 and a2, I found a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3 )≈ a2 * 0.607 → a1 = 0.607 a2 → a2 = 1.646 a1.

Wait, that's conflicting with the previous approach. So which is correct?

Ah, I think I messed up the first approach. Let me recalculate.

Wait, let's compute a1 and a2 using Kepler's law.

a^3 = [ G (M_star + M_planet) (P/ (2π))^2 ].

But M_planet << M_star, so a^3 ≈ [ G M_star P^2 ] / (4 π² )

So the ratio a1^3 / a2^3 = (M1 P1^2 ) / (M2 P2^2 )

Given M1 = 2 M2, P1 = P2 /3.

So:

a1^3 / a2^3 = [ 2 M2 ( (P2/3)^2 ) ] / [ M2 (P2)^2 ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

M2 cancels.

( (P2^2) / 9 ) / ( P2^2 ) = (1/9) / 1 → 1/9.

So a1^3 = (1/9) a2^3 → a1 = a2 * (1/9)^(1/3 ) → a2 = a1 * 9^(1/3 )

9^(1/3 ) is cube root of 9, which is about 2.08.

So a2 = a1 * 2.08 → a1 = a2 / 2.08 → a1 ≈ 0.48 a2.

So a1 is 0.48 times a2. So a2 is about 2.08 a1.

Wait, but earlier when I used the proportionality a^3 ∝ M P^2, I got a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3 ) ≈ 0.607 a2.

Wait, so which is correct? Hmm. There's a mistake in the approach.

Wait, let me recalculate with the correct M and P.

Wait, a^3 = [ G M_star * P^2 ]/(4 pi^2 )

So a1^3 = ( G * (2 M2) * (P1)^2 )/(4 pi^2 )

a2^3 = ( G * (M2) * (P2)^2 )/(4 pi^2 )

But P1 is (1/3) P2.

So a1^3 = (2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 ) * G/(4 pi² )

a2^3 = (M2 * P2^2 ) * G/(4 pi² )

So, a1^3 / a2^3 = [2 M2 (P2^2)/(9) ] / [ M2 P2^2 ] = (2/9) M2 P2^2 / ( M2 P2^2 ) ) = 2/9.

So a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3 )

So (2/9) is about 0.222. Cube root is approximately 0.607. So a1 is about 0.607 a2 → a2 is about 1.646 a1.

So a2 is larger than a1.

Transit probability P = R*/a. So P1 = R/(a1), P2 = R/(a2) = R/( 1.646 a1 ) = (R/a1) * (1/1.646 ) = P1 * 0.607.

So P1 is higher by a factor of 1/0.607 ≈ 1.646, meaning Planet_1's probability is about 1.65 times that of Planet_2.

Wait, now this is different from the previous approach. So what did I do wrong earlier?

Ah, I think I confused the ratio when I did the proportionality approach. Let me re-express:

Now, according to this calculation, a1 = 0.607 a2 → a2 = a1 / 0.607 ≈ 1.646 a1.

So transit probability for Planet_1 is R*/a1, for Planet_2 it's R*/a2 = R*/(1.646 a1) → (R*/a1) * (1/1.646) → P2 = P1 * (1/1.646).

So P1 = 1.646 * P2 → about 1.65 times higher.

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is about 1.65 times higher than Planet_2.

So the researchers should choose Planet_1 since it's more likely to transit.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. So that's the correct answer.

But wait, why did the earlier approach using a proportionality give a different result?

Because I think I made a mistake in the proportionality approach. Let me see.

In the proportionality approach, I considered a1/a2 = (T1^(2/3)) / (T2^(2/3)) * ( M2^(1/3) ) / ( M1^(1/3) )

Because a is proportional to (M_star)^(-1/3) * T^(2/3).

So M1 = 2 M2, T1 = (1/3) T2.

So,

a1/a2 = [ ( (1/3 T2 )^(2/3) ) ] * [ ( M2 )^(1/3) ) / ( (2 M2 )^(1/3) ) )

= ( (1/3)^(2/3) * T2^(2/3) ) * (1/(2^(1/3)) )

= (1/3^(2/3) ) * (1/2^(1/3) ) ) * (T2^(2/3) )

But since a2 is proportional to T2^(2/3) * M2^(-1/3), and a1 is T1^(2/3) * M1^(-1/3 ), which is (1/3 T2 )^(2/3) * (2 M2 )^(-1/3 )

= (1/3)^(2/3) * T2^(2/3) ) * (1/(2^(1/3) M2^(1/3) )) )

And a2 would be T2^(2/3) * M2^(-1/3 )

So a1/a2 = (1/3^(2/3) ) * (1/2^(1/3) )

Which is the same as (1/(3^2 * 2 ))^(1/3 ) = (1/18 )^(1/3 ) ≈ 0.38.

So a1 is about 0.38 a2 → a2 = a1 /0.38 ≈ 2.63 a1.

Wait, but this contradicts the earlier calculation where a1 = 0.607 a2.

So which is correct?

Ah, I think I see the mistake. The initial approach using Kepler's law ratio was correct, because I substituted the actual values into the equation. The proportionality approach must have made a mistake.

Wait, no, perhaps the proportionality approach using a = k T^(2/3) M^(-1/3) is correct, but I need to use this correctly.

Wait, let's redo the proportionality approach.

a = k * (M_star)^(-1/3) * (P)^{2/3}.

So a1 = k * (2 M2)^(-1/3) * (P1)^{2/3}.

a2 = k * (M2)^(-1/3) * (P2)^{2/3}.

Given P1 = P2 /3 → P1 = (1/3) P2.

So,

a1 = k * (2 M2)^(-1/3) * ( (P2)/3 )^{2/3 }

= k * (2)^(-1/3) * M2^(-1/3) * (P2^{2/3} ) * (1/3)^{2/3}.

a2 = k * (M2^(-1/3)) * (P2^{2/3} )

So a1/a2 = [ (2^(-1/3) ) * (1/3^{2/3} ) ) ].

Which is same as (2^(-1/3) ) * (3^{-2/3} )

= [ 2^{-1} * 3^{-2} ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ 1/(2 * 9) ) ]^(1/3 ) = (1/18 )^(1/3 ) ≈ 0.38.

So a1 = 0.38 a2 → a2 = 2.63 a1.

Wait, but this contradicts the direct substitution.

Wait, let me compute using numbers. Let me choose M2 = 1 solar mass, P2 = 3 years.

Then,

M1 = 2 solar masses.

P1 = 1 year.

Compute a1 and a2.

For a2:

a2^3 = (G * M2 * P2^2 )/(4 pi^2 )

Assuming G and constants are same, let's compute in terms of AU and years, where G, 4 pi² etc. are accounted for.

Wait, Kepler's third law in AU, years, solar masses is:

a^3 = ( M_star + M_planet ) * (P/(2 pi))^2.

But M_planet << M_star, so a^3 ≈ M_star * (P/(2 pi))^2.

Wait, no, the correct formula is a^3 = (M_star) * (P)^2 / (4 pi^2) ?

Wait, no, the more accurate version is that in units where G=4 pi², a^3 = M_star * P^2.

Wait, perhaps easier to use the version where a^3 (in AU^3) = (M_star in solar masses) * (P in years)^2.

Yes, that's correct.

So a^3 = M_star * P^2.

So for a2, M2 = 1, P2 =3 → a2^3 = 1 * 3^2 =9 → a2 = cube root of 9 ≈ 2.08 AU.

For a1, M1=2, P1=1 → a1^3 = 2 * 1^2 =2 → a1 = cube root of 2 ≈ 1.26 AU.

Wait, that's different from earlier. So a1 is 1.26, a2 is 2.08.

So a1 = 1.26, a2=2.08.

So a1 = 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.604 a2.

Which aligns with the initial calculation.

Wait, this suggests that a1 is 0.604 a2, so a2 = 1.65 a1.

So transit probability for Planet_1 is R*/a1, for Planet_2 R*/a2.

So P1 = R*/a1.

P2 = R*/(1.65 a1 ) → P2 = P1 /1.65.

So P1 is 1.65 times P2.

Which matches the initial calculation.

So this must be correct.

So why did the proportionality approach give a different result? Oh, because I made a mistake in the proportionality approach.

Wait, let me redo the proportionality approach with the correct formula.

The correct formula is a^3 = M * P^2 → a = (M * P^2 )^(1/3 )

So a1 = (2 * (1)^2 )^(1/3 ) = 2^(1/3 ) ≈ 1.26.

a2 = (1 * (3)^2 )^(1/3 ) = (9)^(1/3 ) ≈ 2.08.

So a1 = 1.26, a2=2.08.

Thus, a2 = (2.08 / 1.26 ) a1 → a2 ≈ 1.65 a1.

So transit probabilities:

P1 = R*/a1.

P2 = R*/a2 = R*/(1.65 a1) → P2 = P1 /1.65.

So P1 = 1.65 P2.

Thus, Planet_1 has 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

So the correct option is C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Wait, but earlier when I did the proportionality approach, I thought a1 was 0.38 a2. But that must have been an error.

Ah, I think I used the wrong proportionality in the initial approach. Probably, I miscalculated the ratio.

So in conclusion, the correct answer is option C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \). A smaller \( a \) results in a higher transit probability.

### Key Information:
1. **Orbital Periods**: Planet_1 has an orbital period \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \), meaning its orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's.
2. **Star Masses**: The host star of Planet_1 has a mass \( M_1 = 2M_2 \), where \( M_2 \) is the mass of Planet_2's host star.
3. **Star Radii**: Both stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)).

### Step 1: Relationship Between Semi-Major Axis and Orbital Period
From Kepler's Third Law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) and the mass of the host star \( M_* \) by:
\[
a^3 \propto M_* \cdot P^2
\]
For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_1 \cdot P_1^2}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2}
\]
Substituting \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) and \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \):
\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{2M_2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}
\]
Taking the cube root:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.607
\]
Thus:
\[
a_1 \approx 0.607 \cdot a_2 \quad \text{or} \quad a_2 \approx 1.65 \cdot a_1
\]

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \). Since both stars have the same radius:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_*}{a_1}}{\frac{R_*}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}
\]
From Step 1, \( a_2 \approx 1.65 \cdot a_1 \), so:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = 1.65
\]
This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Since Planet_1 has a higher transit probability, the researchers should prefer observing Planet_1. The correct option is:

**C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**
