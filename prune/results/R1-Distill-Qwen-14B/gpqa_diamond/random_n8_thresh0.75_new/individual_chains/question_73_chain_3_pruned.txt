Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through this step by step. 

The question says two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

First, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract the speeds like you would in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). But wait, which astronaut's speed are we taking as v1 and which as v2? Since they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference, but using the correct order.

Let me assign astronaut 1 as the one with mass 2m moving at 0.6c, and astronaut 2 as the one with mass 3m moving at 0.5c. So from astronaut 1's frame, astronaut 2 is moving at (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v2*v1)/(c²))? Wait no, I think the formula is (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v2*v1)/(c²)) if v1 and v2 are the speeds of two objects from the lab frame. Wait, wait, no. Let me get this right. 

The formula for relative velocity u' when you have two velocities u and v in the same direction is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think. If the first object is moving at velocity u and the second at velocity v, from the perspective of the first, the second is moving at (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Because if u is the speed of the first (the rest frame of the second), then the second's speed relative to the first would be (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So in this case, astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut 2 is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So the relative speed from astronaut 1's perspective is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c *0.6c)/c² ). 

Calculating numerator: 0.5c -0.6c = -0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1-0.3=0.7. So the relative speed u' is (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates direction, so the magnitude is 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c, but looking at the options, some have 0.14c as an option.

Wait, but let me think again. Since both are moving in the positive direction, if you're in the first astronaut's frame (moving at 0.6c), the second is moving at a lower speed. So the second would appear to be moving slower, perhaps even to the left? Wait, the relative speed comes out as negative, which would mean it's in the opposite direction. Hmm, but wait, both are moving in the same direction in the lab frame. So from astronaut 1's perspective, astronaut 2 is moving in the same direction, but slower. So why is the relative speed negative? That suggests the direction is negative, which would imply that astronaut 2 is moving in the opposite direction in astronaut 1's frame. That can't be right because 0.5c is less than 0.6c, so in astronaut 1's frame, astronaut 2 should be moving backward, which would make sense. So wait, in the lab frame, both are moving forward, but in astronaut 1's frame, astronaut 2 is moving at v' = (0.5c -0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c*0.6c)/c²) )= (-0.
