Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and see what I can do.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's interesting. The NMR data is given, and then it's reacted with a series of reagents. I need to figure out what the final product is from the options provided.

First, let's look at the NMR data. The peaks are as follows:

- 9.72 ppm: a triplet (t), 1H. That's a pretty high chemical shift. I'm thinking maybe an aldehyde proton since those typically show up around 9-10 ppm. But wait, sometimes aromatic protons can be that high too, but more likely aldehyde here.

- 6.98 ppm: a doublet (d), 2H. Those could be aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted aromatic rings because two protons as a doublet often suggests coupling with another set of equivalent protons.

- 6.51 ppm: another doublet (d), 2H. Again, aromatic. If the previous peak is 2H as a d, and this is another 2H as d, maybe it's a para-substituted ring where these are in the ortho positions relative to substituents.

- 6.27 ppm: a broad singlet (bs), 2H. Broad singlet suggests maybe protons on an aromatic ring that's attached to an electron-withdrawing group, like an oxygen. Like maybe a phenol group? But wait, phenol protons are usually broader and can be around 5-7 ppm. Or maybe these are protons on an enol or something similar.

- 3.66 ppm: a doublet (d), 2H. That's in the range for protons adjacent to an oxygen, like maybe a CH2O group. For example, a methylene next to an oxygen, like in an ether or an ester, or maybe an aldehyde or ketone, but wait, 3.66 is more likely adjacent to an oxygen, maybe CH2-O.

Putting this together, maybe the structure has an aldehyde group (from the 9.72 peak), a para-substituted benzene ring, another substituent maybe with an oxygen, and a CH2 group attached to something.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Each degree is a ring or a double bond. For C8H9NO:

Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, formula is DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2. Let me compute that: (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. So that could be a benzene ring (3 double bonds + 1 ring =4 DoU), then another double bond or ring. Let's see: 5 DoU. Benzene (3 double bonds, 1 ring) gives 4, so one more, maybe a double bond or another ring.

Looking at the NMR, the aldehyde would account for a double bond (the aldehyde group is RCHO, which is a double bond). So that's one. The benzene ring is another three, and one more double bond. Oh wait, the peak at 6.27 is a broad singlet of 2H, which could be an enol proton. So maybe there's an enone system or an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a benzaldehyde group attached to another aromatic ring via a chain, maybe with a substituent.

Wait, let me think about the reaction steps. The reagents are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl: this is typically used for diazotization. So a primary amine would react to form a diazonium salt. But wait, the molecular formula has an N. So perhaps the compound has an amine group, maybe an aromatic amine.

Wait, but the formula is C8H9NO. If there's an amine, perhaps it's a secondary or primary amine, but in the structure, maybe it's part of a benzylamine or aniline derivative.

But wait, in the NMR data, I don't see any peaks that would correspond to NH protons. Unless they're exchanged and not showing up, but that's possible. Alternatively, the NH could be in a position where it's broad and not resolved, but in the given NMR, the 6.27 is a broad singlet of 2H. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the N is in a ring, like a pyrrole or something, but that seems less likely here.

Wait, let me think about the reaction steps again. The first step is NaNO2 and HCl. That's for diazotization, which requires a primary aromatic amine. So the starting material must have an aromatic amine group. So perhaps it's an aniline derivative.

Then, step 2 is H2O. So after diazotization, it's treated with water. Wait, that could be a hydrolysis step, but usually, diazonium salts are hydrolyzed under different conditions. For example, diazonium salts can undergo hydrolysis to phenols (if they're aryl diazonium salts) or to amines if it's aliphatic. But in the presence of heat and perhaps a base, like in the third step.

Wait, the third reagent is aqueous KOH and heat. That sounds like a typical condition for elimination reactions, like the formation of a carbonyl group from a diazonium salt.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound is a benzylamine or an aniline derivative. Let me think about this.

So, if the starting material is an aniline derivative (with an NH2 group attached to a benzene ring), then treatment with NaNO2 and HCl would form a diazonium chloride. Then, when treated with water, perhaps it undergoes hydrolysis to form a phenol.

Wait, but the second reagent is H2O. So maybe the first step is diazotization, and the second is hydrolysis to form a phenol? Then, the third step is aq. KOH and heat. What would that do?

Alternatively, perhaps the diazonium salt is treated with water under basic conditions. Wait, but the second step is just H2O. So maybe the diazonium salt is first formed, then hydrolyzed in acidic conditions to form a phenol.

Wait, but after that, the third step is aq. KOH and heat, which is basic conditions. Maybe that's an elimination reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound is a benzylamine with a substituent that can undergo elimination upon treatment with base.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound is a benzaldehyde attached to a chain that has an NH2 group, and upon diazotization, it becomes a diazonium salt, then undergoes hydrolysis, and then elimination.

Wait, perhaps I should draw the possible structure based on the NMR.

The NMR has an aldehyde proton (9.72, t, 1H). That's a triplet, which is coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, a triplet suggests two neighboring protons? Or maybe it's coupling with two different sets of protons each with one neighbor.

Wait, an aldehyde proton is usually a singlet because it's at the end. So a triplet suggests it's adjacent to two protons. But wait, if the aldehyde is at the end, how does that happen? Unless it's part of a conjugated system where the aldehyde is adjacent to a CH2 group.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like benzaldehyde attached to a CH2 group, which in turn is attached to something else. Let's think.

Alternatively, perhaps the 9.72 ppm is not an aldehyde. Could it be an aromatic proton in a highly deshielded environment? Like para to an electron-withdrawing group. For example, an aromatic ring with two substituents that deshield the protons, causing them to be upfield or downfield. But generally, aromatic protons para to strong EWG can be around 8.5 ppm or higher.

Hmm. Maybe the 9.72 is an aldehyde.

So, considering that, perhaps the structure is a diphenyl compound with an aldehyde group. Let me think about the NMR.

Looking at the aromatic protons: 6.98 and 6.51, each doublets. So maybe two aromatic rings, each para substituted.

Wait, let's suppose the molecule has a central chain with an aldehyde group, and two benzene rings attached. The 6.98 and 6.51 could be protons from two different benzene rings, each in a para-substituted position.

Wait, the 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. Maybe that's a pair of protons adjacent to an oxygen, such as in an enol form. So perhaps the compound has a conjugated system where there's an -O-CH2-CHO group or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diphenylbut-3-enal. Let me see.

Wait, the options given are:

A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal

B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal

C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal

D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal

Wait, but the starting compound is reacted with NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, then KOH and heat.

So, first step: diazotization. So the starting compound probably has an amino group. Let's think: if the starting compound is an aniline derivative, after diazotization, it would form a diazonium salt.

Then, step 2: H2O. Maybe hydrolysis of the diazonium salt. If it's an aniline, the diazonium would hydrolyze to a phenol. So, the NH2 becomes OH.

Then step 3: KOH and heat, which is a basic condition. That might induce an elimination reaction, perhaps forming a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the diazonium salt is treated with H2O in step 2, yielding a phenol. Then, in step 3, under basic conditions, elimination occurs, forming a carbonyl group.

Wait, so if the starting material has an NH2 group attached to a benzene ring, and another substituent that allows for elimination upon treatment with base, perhaps that's what's happening.

Let me try to reconstruct the structure based on NMR.

The NMR has:

- 9.72 ppm: triplet, 1H → possibly aldehyde (CHO)
- 6.98 and 6.51: both doublets, 2H each → maybe two para-substituted benzene rings
- 6.27: broad singlet, 2H → maybe enol protons
- 3.66: doublet, 2H → perhaps a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is something like a benzaldehyde attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to another benzene ring that's para-substituted with an -OH group (given the 6.27 ppm signals, which could be the enol Hs).

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count the carbons:

Suppose it's benzaldehyde (C7H6O) but that's 7 carbons. Wait, but the formula is C8H9NO.

Wait, maybe the structure is but-3-enal with two phenyl groups attached. Let's see:

But-3-enal is CH2=CHCH2CHO. So that's four carbons in the chain, with the aldehyde at the end and a double bond between C2 and C3. If two phenyl groups are attached to this, perhaps at C2 and C4.

Wait, option A is 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal. Structure would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but with a double bond. Wait, but but-3-enal is CH2CH2CH2CHO with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, but but-3-enal would be CH2CH2CH2CHO but with a double bond at 3-4? No, that's not possible because but-3-enal would be CH2=CHCH2CHO, right? So the double bond is between C1 and C2, wait no, wait, aldehyde is at the end.

Wait, but but-3-enal would have the structure: CH2CH2CH2-CHO, but that can't be. Wait, but-3-enal would be CH2=CHCH2CHO, where the double bond is between C1 and C2, with the aldehyde at C4. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, but-3-enal is CH2CH2-CH2-CHO with the double bond between C3 and C4, but that's not possible because but has four carbons. So perhaps it's CH2=CHCH2CHO, where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the aldehyde is at C4. Wait, but that's but-2-enal, not but-3-enal. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has two phenyl groups attached to a four-carbon chain with an aldehyde and a double bond.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count:

Each benzene ring is C6H5. But the formula is C8H9NO, which is less than two benzene rings (which would be C12). So perhaps it's a diphenyl compound, but with a smaller chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is diphenylbutanal. Let's see:

Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-CHO → that's five carbons in the chain. But that would be a longer chain. Wait, but the formula is C8H9NO.

Wait, let me think again. If the compound has two phenyl groups, that's 12 carbons. But the formula is only 8, so that's impossible. So perhaps it's a benzyl group attached to a shorter chain.

Wait, maybe the structure is a benzaldehyde with another substituent. Let's see. Another possibility is that the molecule has a side chain with an aldehyde group and an oxygen.

Wait, perhaps it's a cinnamaldehyde derivative. Cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH2-CH=CHO. But that's 8 carbons: benzene (6), then three more (CH2, CH, CHO). So molecular formula would be C9H8O. But our compound is C8H9NO, which is different.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a carbonyl group connected to a chain with an NH2 group.

Wait, the molecular formula includes an N. Oh, perhaps the starting material has an amino group, which is then converted in the reaction steps.

So, perhaps the starting compound is a benzylamine derivative with an aldehyde group somewhere. Let's think about how the NMR would look.

Wait, another approach: Let's analyze the options and see which one fits.

Option A: 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal. Structure would have two phenyl groups attached to a four-carbon chain, with the double bond at position 3 and the aldehyde at the end.

So, the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CH=CHO? Wait, no. But-3-enal would have the double bond between C3 and C4, but but only has four carbons, so that's possible. Wait, but but-3-enal would be CH2CH2CH2CHO with the double bond between C3 and C4? No, that's not possible because but has four carbons. Let me think again.

Alternatively, but-3-enal would be CH2=CHCH2CHO. Wait, that's but-2-enal. So but-3-enal would be CH2CH2CH2CHO with a double bond at C3? No, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, maybe the structure is (Ph)CH2-CH2-CHO with a double bond elsewhere. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the reagents and their impact on the structure.

First, the starting material has an NH2 group because it reacts with NaNO2 and HCl (diazotization). So the structure must have an NH2 somewhere.

After forming the diazonium salt, the next step is H2O. That would hydrolyze the diazonium salt to a phenol. So, the NH2 group becomes an OH group.

Then, the third step is aq. KOH and heat. That's probably a base-catalyzed elimination reaction, perhaps forming a carbonyl group. So maybe the diazonium salt's position allows for elimination upon heating with base, leading to an aldehyde or ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound is a benzylamine with a substituent that can be oxidized or undergo elimination to form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde with an amino group attached elsewhere, which gets converted into a hydroxyl group and then undergoes elimination.

Wait, perhaps it's a diphenylamine with some substituents. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the NMR again. The triplet at 9.72 ppm, 1H. If that's an aldehyde, it's adjacent to two protons. So maybe the aldehyde is at the end of a CH2 group. For example, CH2-CHO would have the aldehyde proton as a triplet because it's adjacent to two CH2 protons. But wait, in that case, the CH2 protons would be a quartet. But in the NMR, there's a peak at 3.66 ppm, a doublet (d) of 2H. So perhaps that's a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like O-CH2-CHO.

Wait, but that would mean the CH2 is between the O and the CHO. So the structure would be O-CH2-CHO, but I don't know where the benzene rings are.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O-CH2-CH2-CHO, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Wait, another thought: the triplet at 9.72 (1H) suggests two adjacent protons. So maybe it's a CH2 group next to the aldehyde. For example, CH2-CHO. Then, the CH2 would be a quartet because the two protons are each split by two adjacent protons, but that doesn't align with the 3.66 ppm doublet.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is part of a conjugated system, like an enone, where the aldehyde is at one end and the double bond is adjacent.

Wait, considering the options, let's look at option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal.

Structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH(OH)-PhCHO?

Wait, no, but wait, but-3-enal would have the double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CHO with a double bond at C3. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO with a double bond somewhere else.

Wait, maybe it's Ph-CH2-CH=CHO, which would be 4-(phenyl)but-3-enal. But the structure would have a double bond between C3 and C4, making it but-3-enal.

Wait, but the NMR shows an aldehyde proton as a triplet. So if the aldehyde is at the end, the adjacent CH2 would have two protons. So the aldehyde proton would be a triplet because it's next to two protons. And the CH2 group would be a quartet because each proton is next to two others.

Hmm, that matches with the 9.72 ppm as a triplet and the 3.66 as a doublet. Wait, but quartet would have four peaks, but in the NMR, 3.66 is a doublet. So maybe the CH2 is adjacent to only one other set of protons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O-CH2-CHO, where the O is part of an ether or something. So the CH2 would be next to O and CHO. Then, the CH2 protons would be split by the adjacent CHO's proton? But the aldehyde proton is a triplet, which would require coupling with two protons on each side. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde with another substituent that allows for an NH2 group to be present.

Wait, going back to the reaction steps. After diazotization and hydrolysis, the NH2 becomes OH. Then, under basic conditions, perhaps elimination occurs, forming a carbonyl group.

So, the starting compound could have an NH2 and a CH2OH group, which upon elimination would form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the starting structure is something like Ph-CH2-CH(NH2)-CHO. Then, upon treatment with NaNO2 and HCl, the NH2 is converted to a diazonium salt, which upon hydrolysis would become OH. Then, under basic conditions, the CH2-OH and CHO could undergo elimination, forming a double bond and a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is Ph-CH2-CH2-CH(NH2)-OH. Then, upon treatment with NaNO2, the NH2 becomes a diazonium, then hydrolysis gives OH, and elimination forms a carbonyl.

Wait, but the NMR has an aldehyde signal, which suggests that the starting material has an aldehyde group. So perhaps the starting structure has an aldehyde and an amino group attached to a benzene ring.

So, after the reactions, the amino group is replaced by an OH group, and perhaps the structure is modified to form a new carbonyl.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to think about each option and see which one makes sense after the reactions.

Option A: 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal.

Structure would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but that's but-3-enal. So the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO but with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, that can't be because the chain is only four carbons. Wait, perhaps it's (Ph)CH2-CH2-CH=CHO. That would make sense for but-3-enal. So the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CH=CHO, which is but-3-enal with two phenyl groups at positions 2 and 4.

Wait, but the starting compound would need to have an amino group. So perhaps the starting material is 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal with an amino group attached somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enamine. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the reaction steps. After the diazotization and hydrolysis, the amino group becomes a hydroxyl group. So if the starting material is 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enamine, it would become 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal, which is option A. But wait, the third step is KOH and heat. Would that do anything?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enylamine. Then, treatment with NaNO2 and HCl would form the diazonium, which upon hydrolysis becomes a phenol. Then, under basic conditions, perhaps elimination occurs.

Wait, but the option A is 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal. So perhaps the product is that.

Alternatively, let's consider option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal.

Structure would be CH2=CH-CH(OH)-PhCHO? No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, but-3-enal would have the double bond between C3 and C4. So structure would be CH2-CH2-CHO with a double bond between C3 and C4. But but has four carbons, so perhaps it's CH2=CH-CH2-CHO, which is but-2-enal.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. But-3-enal would actually be CH2CH2CHO, which doesn't make sense because but is four carbons. Maybe the correct structure for but-3-enal is CH2=CHCH2CHO. Wait, that's but-2-enal, because the double bond is between C1 and C2. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the numbering.

Alternatively, perhaps the product after the reaction steps is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. So, the structure would be Ph-CHO attached to a but-3-enal chain.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is Ph-CH2-CH2-CH(NH2)-CHO, which upon treatment with NaNO2 and HCl forms the diazonium salt, and then hydrolysis replaces NH2 with OH. Then, under basic conditions, elimination occurs, removing H2O and forming a double bond, leading to an aldehyde.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about the NMR again.

The 6.27 ppm broad singlet of 2H suggests perhaps a conjugated dienol or something like that. If the compound has an enol structure, that could explain the broad signals.

Wait, another possibility: the starting compound is a secondary amine attached to a benzene ring, with a side chain containing an aldehyde and an oxygen.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about each step's outcome.

Step 1: diazotization converts an aromatic amine to a diazonium salt.

Step 2: hydrolysis of the diazonium salt under acidic or neutral conditions. For anilines, this typically yields a phenol.

Step 3: treatment with aqueous KOH and heat. This is likely a base-catalyzed reaction, possibly an elimination.

So, if the starting material has an NH2 group attached to a benzene ring and another part of the molecule that can undergo elimination, perhaps forming a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a benzylamine with a side chain that has a CH2OH group. So, structure like Ph-CH2-CH2-NH2. Then, upon diazotization, it becomes Ph-CH2-CH2-N2+ Cl-. Then, hydrolysis would replace NH2 with OH, giving Ph-CH2-CH2-OH. Then, under basic conditions, perhaps elimination occurs, but that would require adjacent protons. Wait, Ph-CH2-CH2-OH would eliminate to form Ph-CH2-CHO under basic conditions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is Ph-CH2-CH(NH2)-CHO. Upon diazotization and hydrolysis, the NH2 becomes OH. Then, under basic conditions, elimination could occur, removing H2O and forming a double bond, leading to Ph-CH2-CH=CHO, which is but-3-enal.

But I'm not certain about the exact structure.

Looking back at the options, option D is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. So the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-PhCHO, but with the hydroxyl group on the benzene ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 4-(aminophenyl)but-3-enal. Then, after the reactions, the amine is replaced by OH, becoming 4-(hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal, which is option D.

Wait, but the starting material's NMR has an aldehyde proton, so after the reaction steps, the aldehyde remains. So the product would have the aldehyde group and the hydroxyl group on the benzene ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzylamine derivative with an aldehyde group, which upon reaction becomes the product with the OH group.

Hmm. Considering all this, I think option D is the most plausible.


The compound has the molecular formula **C₈H₉NO**, and the NMR data provides the following key insights:

- **9.72 ppm (t, 1H)**: Likely an aldehyde proton, as it is highly deshielded and appears as a triplet due to coupling with two adjacent protons.
- **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)**: These doublets suggest two sets of aromatic protons, likely from a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet, possibly due to protons on an enol or a conjugated system.
- **3.66 ppm (d, 2H)**: A doublet indicative of a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen atom.

The molecular formula **C₈H₉NO** corresponds to **5 degrees of unsaturation**, which can be attributed to a benzene ring (4 degrees) and an additional double bond or ring. The aldehyde proton and the aromatic protons suggest the presence of an aldehyde group and a benzene ring. The CH₂ group adjacent to oxygen indicates a functional group such as an ether or an aldehyde.

### Reaction Analysis:
1. **NaNO₂ + HCl**: This reagent is used for diazotization, which typically converts an aromatic amine (-NH₂) into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺).
2. **H₂O**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt replaces the diazonium group (-N₂⁺) with a hydroxyl group (-OH), forming a phenol.
3. **Aqueous KOH, Heat**: These conditions promote elimination reactions, potentially forming a carbonyl group (aldehyde or ketone).

### Option Analysis:
- **Option A (2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal)**: This structure includes two phenyl groups and an aldehyde with a double bond at position 3. However, the reaction sequence does not clearly lead to this structure, as it lacks a diazonium intermediate or elimination step.
- **Option B (2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal)**: This structure includes two phenol groups and an aldehyde with a double bond at position 2. However, the reaction sequence does not support the formation of two hydroxyl groups on the benzene rings.
- **Option C (3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal)**: This structure includes two phenol groups and a hydroxyl group on the chain. The reaction sequence does not support the formation of this structure, as it would require multiple hydroxylations.
- **Option D (4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal)**: This structure includes a single phenol group and an aldehyde with a double bond at position 3. The reaction sequence aligns well with this structure: the starting material likely has an aromatic amine, which is diazotized, hydrolyzed to a phenol, and then undergoes elimination to form the aldehyde.

### Conclusion:
The reaction sequence and NMR data are consistent with **Option D (4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal)**, as it accounts for the aldehyde group, the aromatic protons, and the hydroxyl group formed during the reaction steps.

**Answer: D**
