Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this electron microscopy question. Let me read it again carefully.

Mike is working with a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 1000 kV. He connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum, which is less than 10^-9 Torr. The goal was to minimize gas molecules for better imaging because fewer gas particles mean less scattering of electrons.

But even with that, some gas particles are still present, as detected by a mass spectrometer. Mike found the mean free path of these gas molecules is λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. I remember that the mean free path depends on pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules. The formula I think is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d^2 * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the molecule, and P is pressure. 

Then, when Mike starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes to λ2. The question is, why is λ2 different from λ1? The temperature remains the same, so T isn't a factor here. 

Wait, what causes the mean free path to change? Well, in an electron microscope, the electron beam interacts with the gas molecules. When the electrons hit the gas molecules, they can cause scattering. But how does that affect the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves?

Hmm. The mean free path of the gas molecules is about how often they collide with each other, right? If the electron beam adds some additional scattering, does that affect the gas molecules' motion? Or maybe the presence of the electrons changes the effective pressure.

Alternatively, maybe when the electron beam is on, it heats the gas molecules. Oh, but the problem states that the temperature remains the same, so that's not it.

Wait, another angle. The mean free path of the gas molecules is λ1 in the absence of the electron beam. But when the beam is on, perhaps the electrons cause the gas molecules to ionize or charge, making them interact more with the electron beam or each other. But wait, wait—no, the mean free path of the gas is about how often they collide, not about the electrons. Or does the electron beam cause the gas molecules to lose electrons, creating ions, which might have different behavior?

Wait, but the mean free path for the gas molecules is determined by their mutual collisions. The electron beam might cause more scattering of the electrons
