Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the transgenic mouse model. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The researcher is using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells to transfect a plasmid. They introduced a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of the GADD45G coding sequence. The plasmid was transfected using Lipofectamine, and they selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed. They looked at the plus strand sequence and found something wrong.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, I need to figure out what's wrong. The main question is about why the protein isn't being expressed properly. Let's think about possible issues in the construct.

First, the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the sequence should start with the HA coding sequence followed by the GADD45G coding sequence. The provided sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon, so the HA should be right after that.

Wait, let me look at the beginning: The sequence starts with 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... So the ATG is the start codon. The next codon is TAC, which is Tyrosine. Then CCA (Pro), TAC ( Tyr), GAT (Asp), GTT (Val), etc.

But wait, the HA tag is a specific sequence. I think the HA tag is usually something like YPYDVPDYA or similar. The HA epitope is encoded by a short DNA sequence. Let me recall: The HA tag is typically added as a short peptide, so the coding sequence would be something like ATG TAC TAC TAC TAC... but that's probably an oversimplification.

Wait, no. Let me think. The HA tag is derived from the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus. Its amino acid sequence is: YPYDVPDYA. So the coding sequence for this would be:

Y is Tyr (TAC)
P is Pro (CCG or CCA)
Y is Tyr (TAC)
D is Asp (GAT)
V is Val (GTT)
P is Pro (CCG or CCA)
Y is Tyr (TAC)
D is Asp (GAT)
A is Ala (GCT)
So the coding sequence would be: TAC TAC TAC GAT GTT CCG GAT TAC GCT.

Wait, but in the given sequence, after the start codon ATG, the next codons are TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GCT (Ala), etc. Let me see the start of the provided sequence:

After ATG, it's TAC CCA TAC GAT GCT CTC TGG AAG AAA GCT GCC GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CCG GAA AGC... Wait, the initial sequence is:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GCT CTC TGG AAG AAA GCT GCC GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CCG GAA AGC ...

So the first few codons after ATG are:

ATG -> Met
TAC -> Tyr
CCA -> Pro
TAC -> Tyr
GAT -> Asp
GCT -> Ala
CTC -> Leu
TGG -> Trp
AAG -> Lys
AAA -> Lys
GCT -> Ala
GCC -> Ala
GCC -> Ala
AGG -> Arg
... etc.

Wait, the HA tag is usually a short peptide, so perhaps the construct was supposed to have the HA coding sequence right after ATG. But looking at the sequence, the first amino acids are Met, Tyr, Pro, Tyr, Asp, Ala, etc., which doesn't look like the HA sequence. So perhaps the HA tag isn't correctly inserted.

Wait, maybe the HA tag was not correctly inserted. Let me think. The problem says the construct includes a
