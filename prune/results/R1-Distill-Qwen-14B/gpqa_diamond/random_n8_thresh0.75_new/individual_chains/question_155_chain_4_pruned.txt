Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z for a system that's in an eigenstate of the operator P_x with a specific eigenvalue. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so that should be important for calculating the expectation values needed for the uncertainty.

So, the setup is that we have an operator P, which has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each has a given matrix form. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x corresponding to the eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2).

Wait, the uncertainty in P_z is what we're after. The formula for uncertainty is ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared in the given state.

But wait, the state is given in the eigenbasis of P_z. Because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. Oh, right, so that simplifies things because if the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, then the expectation value of P_z is just the eigenvalue corresponding to that state.

Wait, but wait again. The state is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So can I directly say that the state is in the eigenbasis of P_z? Hmm, maybe not. Because the eigenbases of P_x and P_z are different. Wait, but the problem states that the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the state given is expressed in the P_z eigenbasis. So in that basis, the components are just the projections onto each eigenstate of P_z.

Wait, but if the state is |ψ⟩ = a|z=+ħ⟩ + b|z=0⟩ + c|z=-ħ⟩, then the expectation value of P_z is (a* * a) * ħ + (c* * c) * (-ħ) because the middle term has zero eigenvalue. Wait, but let me think again.

Wait, the P_z matrix is given as:

[ ħ   0    0 ]
[ 0   0    0 ]
[ 0   0  -ħ ]

So the eigenstates of P_z are the basis vectors. So the state is given as a column vector in this basis. So each component corresponds to the amplitude in each eigenstate of P_z.

So the state is a vector with components (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Wait, but these must be normalized because it's a quantum state. Let's check the normalization.

The sum of the squares of the absolute values should be 1.

(-1/2)^2 is 1/4, (1/sqrt(2))² is 1/2, and (-1/2)^2 is another 1/4. So 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4 = 1. So yes, it's normalized.

So the state
