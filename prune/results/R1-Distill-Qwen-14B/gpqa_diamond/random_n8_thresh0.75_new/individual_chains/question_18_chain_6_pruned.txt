Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. The question gives some elemental abundance ratios determined using the EW method under LTE. The given values are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. The photospheric composition of the Sun is provided: for iron, it's 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5, and for magnesium, 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7.

The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, I need to find [Si/Star_1] divided by [Si/Star_2], or perhaps [Si/Star_1] multiplied by [Star_2/Si]? Wait, no, the ratio is [Si_1]/[Si_2], I think. Because the question states "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So it's Si_1 over Si_2.

Hmm, but first, I need to find the abundances of Si in each star. Let me think about how to get that.

The [X/Y] notation is logarithmic, right? It's the logarithm (base 10) of the ratio of the number densities of X to Y, relative to the Sun. So, [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun.

Wait, no, more accurately, the notation [X/Y] is defined as log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Or sometimes, it's the logarithm of (n_X / n_Y) / (n_X_sun / n_Y_sun). So [X/Y] = log10 ( (n_X /n_Y) / (n_X_sun/n_Y_sun) ) ), which is equivalent to log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X_sun/n_Y_sun).

Wait, maybe I should write the formula correctly. The standard definition is [X/Y] = log10( (n_X / n_Y)_star ) - log10( (n_X / n_Y)_sun ). So, [X/Y]_star = log10( (n_X /n_Y)_star / (n_X /n_Y)_sun ).

So, when [X/Y] is positive, it means more X than Y relative to the Sun, right?

Given that, let's tackle each star.

Starting with Star_1:

We're given [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. And [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So, their [Fe/H] is zero, meaning their iron abundance is the same as the Sun's. Because [Fe/H] is log10(nFe/nH) - log10(nFe/nH)_sun. If that's zero, then nFe/nH for Star_1 is the same as the Sun's.

Wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So, log10(nFe/nH)_sun =7.5 -12 = -4.5. So, nFe/nH_sun = 10^(-4.5).

But for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 =0, so log10( (nFe_1 /nH_1) / (nFe_sun /nH_sun) ) )=0. So, (nFe_1 /nH_1) ) equals (nFe_sun /nH_sun) ).

So, nFe_1 /nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun.

But what about nH_1? Hmm. Wait, since the stars have different masses, does
