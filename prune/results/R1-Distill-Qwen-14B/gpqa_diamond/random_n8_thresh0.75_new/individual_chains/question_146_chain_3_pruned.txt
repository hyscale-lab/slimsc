Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read it again carefully. The question is about the reaction between 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene and maleic anhydride. I need to figure out what the major product is from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that when dienes react with maleic anhydride, it's usually a Diels-Alder reaction. Diels-Alder is a [4+2] cycloaddition between a diene and a dienophile. Maleic anhydride is a good dienophile, so that makes sense here.

So the diene in this case is 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene. Let me draw that structure. Cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. Wait, no, cyclopenta-1,3-diene would have two double bonds? Wait, no, that's not possible. Oh wait, wait, no, cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with one double bond, right? So 1,3-diene would have double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4 positions, making it conjugated. Oh wait, that would make it a cyclopentadiene system. But wait, no, a cyclopentadiene would have one double bond, but if it's 1,3-diene, then maybe it's a cumulative diene, like 1,3-cyclopentadiene? Or maybe not. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Wait, no, in
