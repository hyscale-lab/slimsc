Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is asking me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, elastic scattering... I remember that involves electrons bouncing off a target without losing energy, right?

The given data is the phase shifts δ₀, δ₁, δ₂, δ₃, and δ₄, with values 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, and 13° respectively. Oh wait, the question says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so I guess we're only considering up to δ₄ here.

I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident direction. I recall that the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using partial waves. The formula, I think, involves a sum over all the partial waves, each contributing a term based on the Legendre polynomials and the phase shifts.

So the general formula for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = ∑ [ (2l + 1) e^{2iδ_l} P_l(cosθ) ]

Where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number, P_l is the Legendre polynomial, and δ_l is the phase shift for that l.

But wait, the question specifically asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. The incident beam is along θ = 0°, right? So cosθ = 1, because cos(0) is 1.

Hmm, what do the Legendre polynomials evaluate to at cosθ=1? I think that P_l(1) is 1 for all l. Because Legendre polynomials at 1 are 1, since they're defined such that P_l(1)=1. So P_l(1)=1 for any l.

So then, the formula simplifies to:

f(θ=0) = ∑ [ (2l +1) e^{2iδ_l} * 1 ]

Which is just the sum of (2l+1) multiplied by e^{2iδ_l}.

But I'm only interested in the imaginary part of this sum.

So the imaginary part of f(θ=0) would be the sum over l of (2l+1) multiplied by the imaginary part of e^{2iδ_l}.

Wait, e^{iθ} has an imaginary part of sinθ. So e^{2iδ_l} = cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l). So the imaginary part is sin(2δ_l).

Putting it together, Im[f(θ=0)] = ∑ (2l +1) * sin(2δ_l), where the sum is over all l for which δ_l is given.

But wait, what are the l values corresponding to each δ? Oh right, δ₀ is for l=0, δ₁ for l=1, etc. So the sum here goes from l=0 to l=4, since we have δ₀ to δ₄.

So let's compute each term:

For l=0: (2*0 +1) * sin(2*90°) = 1 * sin(180°). Sin 180 is 0, so this term is 0.

l=1: (2*1 +1) =3; sin(2*67) = sin(13
