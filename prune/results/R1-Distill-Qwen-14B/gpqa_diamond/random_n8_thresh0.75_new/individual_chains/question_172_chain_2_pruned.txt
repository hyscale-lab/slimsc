Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with such questions, the Boltzmann distribution comes into play. Boltzmann distribution deals with the distribution of particles in different energy states, right?

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, the excitation here refers to the population of a higher energy state relative to a lower one. I think the ratio of populations is given by the Boltzmann factor. 

The energy difference between the two levels is given as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. Wait, 1.38 is close to Boltzmann's constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, interesting. So ΔE equals k*T, where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature. Wait, no, that's for thermal energy. Let me think again.

The Boltzmann distribution formula is n_i / n_j = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(kT) ). Since we're considering excitation, higher energy state is E_i and lower is E_j. So E_i is higher than E_j, which makes the exponent negative. So, the ratio n_i/n_j = exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where ΔE is E_i - E_j.

In the problem, the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So for star_1, the population of the excited state relative to the ground state is higher. Let me denote for star_1, the ratio is 2, and for star_2, it's 1, because it's twice as excited. So for star_1, n1_i/n1_j = 2. For star_2, n2_i/n2_j = 1.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So, maybe the ratio is 2 for star_1 and 1 for star_2. Or perhaps the ratio is 2 for star_1 compared to star_2. I need to clarify that.

Wait, the problem states that "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, the ratio of the excited level in star_1 to
