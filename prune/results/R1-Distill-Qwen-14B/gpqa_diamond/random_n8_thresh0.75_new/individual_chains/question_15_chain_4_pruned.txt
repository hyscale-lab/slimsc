Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their probability of transiting. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The question is about which planet has a higher chance of transiting, so the researchers can choose which one to observe.

The question says both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1 orbits much closer to its star. Also, both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies things a bit.

The host stars are interesting. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. Wait, same radius but different masses—so maybe Planet_1's star is more massive but not larger. That might affect the size ratio when calculating transit probability.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting is related to the size of its orbit relative to the star. The formula I vaguely recall is something like (R_star + R_planet) / a, but I'm not sure. Oh wait, the transit probability is approximately (R_star / a), assuming the planet's size is much smaller than the star. But wait, actually, the exact formula is (2R_star / a) * (1/(1 - e²))^(½), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so it simplifies to (2R_star / a). But wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me think again.

Another approach: the transit probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter. Because the planet needs to pass directly in front of the star as seen from Earth. So the probability is roughly (2R_star)/(2a), but wait, no, maybe it's (R_star / a) * something. Alternatively, I think it's (R_star / a) multiplied by a geometrical factor, which is (1 / (1 - (R_star/a)^2))^(½), but that gets complicated. Wait, but in the case where R_star is much smaller than a, which is usually the case, the probability simplifies to (R_star / a) * (something else).

Wait no, another source I recall: the transit probability is the area of the star divided by the area of the planet's orbit. Because the planet has to pass directly in front. So it's (π R_star²) / (π
