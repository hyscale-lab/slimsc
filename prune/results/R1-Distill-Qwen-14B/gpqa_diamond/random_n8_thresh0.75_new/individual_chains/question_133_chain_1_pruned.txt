Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with phosphate buffer solutions and all the Ka values. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) and contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperatures are at 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are given: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

First, I remember that orthophosphate ion is PO4^3-. So I need to calculate [PO4^3-] in the solution.

Wait, wait, but the compounds given are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me think about their dissociations.

KH2PO4 (also called potassium dihydrogen phosphate) dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So the H2PO4^- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion.

Na2HPO4·2H2O (sodium hydrogen phosphate) would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So that's the hydrogen phosphate ion.

But orthophosphate is PO4^3-, which is the fully deprotonated form. However, in solution, especially buffered solutions, these species can interconvert based on pH.

So the solution is a buffer solution containing H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-? Because we're mixing the two salts. Wait, but how?

Wait, wait, let me think again. KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- and K+; Na2HPO4·2H2O is Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So when you mix them, you have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution. These two can act as a buffer. But where does PO4^3- come into play?

Orthophosphate is PO4^3- which is the deprotonated form. The HPO4^2- can lose another proton to become PO4^3-.

But under what conditions? Well, the pH of the solution will determine the predominant species. Since H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present, the solution is likely in a region where both can exist.

But wait, the question is about PO4^3- concentration. So how much of it is present?

Hmm, I think I might need to consider the equilibrium among the phosphate species. The relevant reaction here is the deprotonation of HPO4^2- to form PO4^3- and H+.

The relevant Ka here is Ka3, which is the third dissociation constant. Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12.

But wait, so if I can find the ratio of [PO4^3-] to [HPO4^2-], I can determine the concentration.

Wait, but the solution contains both H2PO
