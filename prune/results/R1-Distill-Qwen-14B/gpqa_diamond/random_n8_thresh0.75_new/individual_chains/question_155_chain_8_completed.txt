Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, it's about uncertainty in the P_z operator. Let's see what I've got here.

The question says that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty in P_z, ΔP_z.

Wait, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the expectation values. The formula is ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

But wait, the state is given, so let me write that down. The state |ψ> is a column vector [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Since it's an eigenvector of P_x, when P_x acts on it, it gives -ħ times the vector.

Now, the operators P_x, P_y, P_z are given as matrices. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the basis states are |z=+ħ>, |z=0>, |z=-ħ> or something like that. So the state |ψ> is expressed in this basis.

To compute ⟨P_z⟩, I think I just need to take the inner product of |ψ> with P_z acting on |ψ>, which is ψ† P_z ψ. Wait, more accurately, ⟨P_z⟩ = ψ† P_z ψ.

Similarly, ⟨P_z²⟩ is ψ† P_z² ψ.

So let's compute ⟨P_z⟩ first.

The matrix P_z is given as:
First row: (ħ, 0, 0)
Second row: (0, 0, 0)
Third row: (0, 0, -ħ)

So, let's compute P_z |ψ>. Let me write |ψ> as a column vector:

ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

So P_z ψ is:

First component: ħ*(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + 0*(-1/2) = -ħ/2.

Second component: 0*(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + 0*(-1/2) = 0.

Third component: 0*(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + (-ħ)*(-1/2) = ħ/2.

So P_z ψ = [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]^T.

Now, the inner product ⟨ψ | P_z | ψ⟩ is ψ† (P_z ψ) = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ] * [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ].

So that's (-1/2)(-ħ/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(ħ/2).

Calculating each term:

First term: (1/2)(ħ/2) = ħ/4.

Second term: 0.

Third term: (-1/2)(ħ/2) = -ħ/4.

Adding them: ħ/4 + 0 - ħ/4 = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Hmm, interesting. Now, let's compute ⟨P_z²⟩.

P_z squared is P_z multiplied by itself. Let's compute that matrix.

P_z matrix:
Row 1: [ ħ, 0, 0 ]
Row 2: [ 0, 0, 0 ]
Row 3: [ 0, 0, -ħ ]

So, P_z squared = P_z * P_z.

Let me compute each element:

Element (1,1): ħ* ħ + 0 + 0 = ħ².

Elements (1,2) and (1,3) are zero because after multiplication, only the diagonal terms would be non-zero. Similarly, rows 2 and 3:

Row 2 of P_z is all zero, so when multiplied, row 2 of P_z squared is zero.

Row 3, column 1: 0, row3, col2:0, row3, col3: (-ħ)*(-ħ) = ħ².

So the P_z squared matrix is:

[ ħ², 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, 0 ]
[ 0,0, ħ² ]

So when we apply P_z squared to |ψ>, it's the same as applying P_z twice. So P_z^2 |ψ> is same as (P_z |ψ> ) with P_z acting again.

But since P_z |ψ> is [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]^T, applying P_z again would give:

First component: ħ*(-ħ/2) = - ħ²/2.

Second component: 0.

Third component: (-ħ)*( ħ/2 ) = - ħ²/2.

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, P_z squared is a diagonal matrix with elements ħ², 0, ħ². So when you multiply P_z^2 with |ψ>, each component is multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element.

So ψ is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

So P_z^2 ψ = [ ħ²*(-1/2), 0*(1/√2), ħ²*(-1/2) ].

So [ - ħ²/2, 0, - ħ²/2 ].

Wait, no, wait. Because P_z^2 is diagonal, so each component is multiplied. So each component is (P_z^2)_{i,i} * ψ_i.

So:

Component 1: ħ² * (-1/2) = - ħ²/2.

Component 2: 0 * (1/sqrt(2)) = 0.

Component3: (-ħ)^2 * (-1/2 ) → wait, no, P_z^2 is diagonal, so for row 3, it's (-ħ)^2 = ħ². So component3 is ħ² * (-1/2 )= - ħ²/2.

So P_z^2 |ψ> is [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ].

Now, the inner product ψ† P_z^2 ψ is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ] multiplied by [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ].

So:

(-1/2)(-ħ²/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(-ħ²/2).

Each term:

First term: (1/2)(ħ²/2) → ħ²/(4).

Third term: (1/2)(ħ²/2) → ħ²/(4).

Adding: ħ²/4 + 0 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2.

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is ħ²/2.

Wait, but ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, so the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩ )^2 ) = sqrt( ħ²/2 - 0 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which would match this result.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Calculating ⟨P_z⟩:

ψ† P_z ψ = (-1/2)(-ħ/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(ħ/2) → (ħ/4) +0 - ħ/4 = 0. That's correct.

⟨P_z²⟩:

Each component of P_z^2 |ψ> is [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ].

So when you take the inner product with ψ:

(-1/2)(-ħ²/2) → ħ²/4,

Second term: 0,

Third term: (-1/2)(-ħ²/2) → ħ²/4.

Total: ħ²/4 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2.

So yes, that's right.

So uncertainty is sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ/sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, option B is that.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix representation of $P_z$ is:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To compute $\langle P_z \rangle$, we calculate $\langle \psi | P_z | \psi \rangle$:

\[
P_z |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar}{2} \\ 0 \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, take the inner product:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar}{2} \\ 0 \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Compute each term:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Simplify:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{4} + 0 - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix representation of $P_z^2$ is:

\[
P_z^2 = P_z \cdot P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$, we calculate $\langle \psi | P_z^2 | \psi \rangle$:

\[
P_z^2 |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \\ 0 \\ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, take the inner product:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z^2 | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \\ 0 \\ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Compute each term:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\right).
\]

Simplify:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

**Answer: B**
