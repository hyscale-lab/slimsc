Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says it's a 1-dimensional system, so that should simplify things. The mass is m, maximum amplitude is A, and it's obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. We need to find the maximum speed, v_max.

Wait, in a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed occurs when the potential energy is zero, which is at the equilibrium position, right? But wait, in the classical case, the maximum speed is given by something involving the angular frequency and amplitude. Let me recall: for a classical harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed v_max is ωA, where ω is sqrt(k/m). But wait, this is a relativistic case, so maybe things change.

Relativistic effects come into play when speeds are significant compared to the speed of light. So the mass's kinetic energy can't be treated with the classical (1/2)mv² formula. Instead, we should use the relativistic kinetic energy, which is (γ-1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but the problem is about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Oh, right, in the relativistic version, the potential energy isn't just (1/2)kx². I think the potential for a relativistic oscillator is different. Or wait, no, maybe the potential is the same, but the kinetic energy is relativistic.

Wait, maybe I should model it using the Lagrangian approach. The Lagrang
