Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: We have an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. We need to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator whose matrix representation is given by Aij. The Aij elements are hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. Also, we have to find the average value of that operator.

The options are A to D, each giving two probabilities and an average value.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.

First, I think I need to figure out what the operator A is. Because the matrix elements are given, maybe it's a 2x2 matrix since we're dealing with two states (up and down). So for a 2x2 matrix, A would look like this:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, no, wait. Because when i≠j, Aij is hbar/2. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but wait again. The matrix representation is given as A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, else 0. So for a two-level system, the matrix should be:

A = [[0, hbar/2],
     [hbar/2, 0]]

But wait, that's a matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. So this operator A is a 2x2 matrix with zero diagonal and hbar/2 off-diagonal elements.

Now, the eigenstates of this operator A are what we're supposed to find the probabilities for. So the state |alpha> is expressed in the z-basis (|up> and |down>), and we need to find the probability that a measurement of operator A yields each of its eigenvalues.

Wait, but wait again. Because the question says, "the eigenstates of the operator whose matrix representation is given by Aij". So the operator A has some eigenstates, and we need to find the probability of measuring the particle in each of those eigenstates.

So, step one is to find the eigenvalues and eigenstates of matrix A.

Let me write down matrix A:

A = [[0, hbar/2],
     [hbar/2, 0]]

To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve det(A - λ I) = 0.

The determinant equation is:

| -λ        hbar/2        |
| hbar/2     -λ        | = 0

So expanding this: λ^2 - (hbar^2/4) = 0

Thus, λ^2 = (hbar^2)/4 → λ = ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

The corresponding eigenvectors can be found.

For λ = hbar/2:

(A - λ I) v = 0 → [[-hbar/2, hbar/2],
                   [hbar/2, -hbar/2]] * [v1, v2]^T = 0.

So equations:

(-hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 =0 → v1 = v2.

So the eigenvector can be proportional to [1, 1]^T. So the eigenstate is |+x> or something, since this matrix A looks like the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Oh wait, because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A = (hbar/2) X.

So the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of X, which are |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, and the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2, respectively.

Now, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. But we need to normalize it first, because right now it's just proportional; the actual state would have a normalization factor.

Wait, so let me compute the normalization factor. The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>.

The norm is |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2.

Compute |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Compute |2 - i|^2: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the total norm is 2 +5=7.
