Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I need to find out how many possible organic products there are.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure I understand the structure of the starting material. 1-bromobenzene-2-d must be a benzene ring with a bromine substituent at position 1 and a deuterium (d) at position 2. Oh wait, or is it bromine in position 2 and deuterium in position 1? Wait, no. The numbering is 1 and 2. So bromine is at position 1, and deuterium is at position 2. So the structure is like bromobenzene with a deuterium on the adjacent carbon.

But wait, benzene is a ring, so position 1 and 2 are adjacent. So the bromine is on carbon 1, and carbon 2 has a deuterium. Hmm. So the molecule is o-bromobenzene but with a deuterium on the adjacent carbon to the bromine.

Now, the reagent is NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. But in aromatic substitution, maybe it's acting as a base for elimination or perhaps as a deprotonating agent.

Wait, but in what context? Oh right, when you have a benzene ring with a leaving group like bromine and a hydrogen that can be abstracted, the base might induce elimination, leading to the formation of a
