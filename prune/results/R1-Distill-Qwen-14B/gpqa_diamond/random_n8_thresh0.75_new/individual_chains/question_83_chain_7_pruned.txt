Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point when acetic acid is diluted and then titrated with NaOH. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, the problem says we're starting with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Oh right, dilution affects the concentration. So I remember the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. Since both volumes are equal, the concentration should be halved. So M2 would be 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid solution is 0.025 M.

Next, we're titrating this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. Titration means neutralization, right? So the acetic acid will react with NaOH. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

Wait, the stoichiometry here is 1:1. So the moles of NaOH needed will equal the moles of acetic acid present initially.

Let me calculate the initial moles of acetic acid before titration. The volume is 20.00 cm³, which is 0.02 L. So moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Wait, no, wait, the diluted solution is 0.025 M, but wait, the volume after dilution is 40 cm³ (since 20 + 20). So initial moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution would be 0.025 M × 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Yeah.

Wait, no. Wait: wait, wait. Let me double-check. The initial acetic acid is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. So moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. When we add 20 cm³ of water, total volume is 40 cm³. So the concentration becomes 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025
