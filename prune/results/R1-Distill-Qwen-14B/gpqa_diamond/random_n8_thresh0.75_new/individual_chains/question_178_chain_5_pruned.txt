Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, where σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that in QFT, the mass dimension of the coupling constants is really important for determining renormalizability. The general idea is that a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have positive mass dimensions, up to some power. Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. The mass dimension of the coupling tells us about the superficial degree of divergence. If the coupling has positive mass dimension, then the interaction term is renormalizable because the divergences can be absorbed into the existing terms.

But wait, the Lagrangian terms in general have to have mass dimension d=4 in four spacetime dimensions because the action is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. Let me confirm that. The Lagrangian density has dimensions of mass^4 in four dimensions because the action is dimensionless (it's integrated over four dimensions of spacetime, each with mass dimension 1). So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

So for the given Lagrangian term, L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, I need to find the mass dimension of κ.

Breaking it down: ψ is a spinor field. In four dimensions, each spinor field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because for a Dirac field, the kinetic term is ψ̄ i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ which is mass dimension 4. Each ψ contributes 3/2, so ψ̄ and ψ together make 3. The derivative ∂_μ has mass dimension 1. So 3 + 1 =4, which makes sense.

Now, σ_{μν} is made from the gamma matrices. σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which is an antisymmetric tensor. But in terms of mass dimension, each γ is dimensionless because they're just matrices. So σ_{μν} doesn't contribute any mass dimension.

Next, F^{μν} is the field strength tensor of electromagnetism, I think. F^{μν} is ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ. So each F^{μν} has the same dimension as ∂, which is 1. Because A^ν is a gauge field, which has mass dimension 1. Because the kinetic term for A is like ∂A ∂ A, each derivative is dimension 1, so each ∂A has dimension 2, and the term is dimension 4, so A has dimension 1.

So F^{μν} is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. Each term is ∂ (dim 1) * A (dim 1), so F has mass dimension 2.

Wait, wait. Because F^{μν} is a field strength, which comes from the derivative of A. So each F is [∂][A], which is (mass)^1 * (mass)^1 = mass^2. So F has mass dimension 2.

Putting all these together into the term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F.

So the dimensions are:

κ: let's call its dimension [κ].

ψ̄ σ ψ: ψ̄ has 3/2, ψ has 3/2. σ is dimensionless. So together, 3/2 + 3/2 =3.

Multiply by F, which is 2. So 3 + 2 =5.

So the entire term is [κ] * 5. Since the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, [κ] * 5 =4 → [κ] =4/5? Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 4/5 is not an integer, and the options given are all integers.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the dimensions somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of σ_{μν}. Let me think again. σ_{mu nu} is made from commutators of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. So σ is dimensionless. So the term ψ̄ σ ψ is dimension (3/2 + 3/2) =3.

F^{mu nu} has dimension 2, so the product (ψ̄ σ ψ) F is 3+2=5.

So the term is κ multiplied by 5. Since the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4, then [kappa] *5 =4 → [kappa]=4/5? That's 0.8, which is not an integer. But none of the options have 4/5.

Wait, that can't be right.
