Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR spectroscopy isn't my strongest subject. But I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that compound X (with the formula C11H12O) reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given, and I need to figure out what X was from the options provided.

Hmm, okay. I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a catalyst used in the Sharpless epoxidation, which forms epoxides from epoxide precursors, maybe dienes or something. Wait, no, wait—epoxidation usually involves forming an epoxide from a double bond. So if we're reacting compound X with this catalyst, perhaps X is an alkene that becomes an epoxide after the reaction.

But wait, the product's NMR is given. So the product's structure is what we're seeing in the NMR, and we need to find the starting material X. So I need to figure out what the product is, and then backtrack to find X.

Looking at the options, all of them have "oxirane" in their names, which is another name for an epoxide. So the product is an epoxide. Because the reaction is epoxidation, which adds an epoxide group.

Wait, so the product is an epoxide. Now, let's look at the NMR data of the product to figure out its structure.

Let's first look at the 1H NMR.

1H NMR signals:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s): Singlet, probably a methyl group attached to something deshielded. Maybe a carbonyl or an aromatic ring. But wait, in an epoxide, the methyl groups might be adjacent to oxygen or not.
- δ 2.31 (3H, s): Another singlet. Two singlets for methyl groups. Maybe two methyl groups in similar environments, like both attached to an aromatic ring or something else.
- δ 6.75 (1H, d): A doublet. Could be part of an aromatic ring, maybe a coupling with another proton.
- δ 7.08 (2H, d): Two
