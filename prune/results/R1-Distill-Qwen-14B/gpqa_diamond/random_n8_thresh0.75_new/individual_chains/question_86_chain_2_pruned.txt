Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read through it carefully. Hmm, the question is about determining the correct starting materials A and B for two reactions that produce the same product but with different configurations.

The product in both cases is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, but wait, looking again, no, wait. Oh, no, wait the products are (R) and (S) respectively. Let me check the question again. Oh, no, the first reaction uses LiBH4 and H+ with A to give (R)-4-ethyl... and the second uses BH3 and H+ with B to give (S)-4-ethyl... So the product configurations are different based on the reagents and starting materials.

So the product is a ketone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. I think this is a cyclic ether structure. Pyran is a six-membered ring with an oxygen, like a cyclic ether. The substituents are 4-ethyl and a ketone group at position 2.

The starting materials A and B are being treated with different reducing agents. LiBH4 and BH3. Wait, but I remember that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually for carbonyl groups like ketones and aldehydes. BH3 is typically used for the same, but maybe in different conditions. Oh wait, waitâ€”no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Wait, BH3 is usually used with THF as a catalyst for hydroboration reactions. Oh, wait, no, perhaps for the oxidation of ketones or aldehydes. No, wait, more accurately, BH3 is used in the formation of alcohols from alkenes via hydroboration-oxidation. Hmm, but in this context, perhaps the reactions are different. Wait, maybe these are reductions of ketones or something else.

Wait, wait, the product is a ketone. So if A and B are being treated with different reducing agents to get this, that doesn't make sense because reducing agents typically reduce things. Unless the starting materials have a higher oxidation state. Wait, perhaps the starting materials are ketones being transformed into something else. Or maybe the starting materials are esters or something else.

Wait, wait, the product is a cyclic ketone. Let me think about how that would form. Oh, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic esters, like
