Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to take it step by step.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on two non-adjacent carbons. Heating it with excess KOH at 240°C... Oh right, that's probably an elimination reaction because KOH is a strong base. When vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalides) react with bases, they usually eliminate to form alkenes. But wait, this is 1,3-dibromo, so it's not vicinal. Hmm, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but not leading to a double bond? Or perhaps it's a different kind of elimination.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid, and the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe the product is a ketone. How does that happen from 1,3-dibromoadamantane? Oh, wait, I think that when two bromines are on adjacent carbons in a structure, like a geminal dihalide, they can eliminate to form a carbonyl group. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't geminal. Oh, wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh, perhaps it's a Hof
