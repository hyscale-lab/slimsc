Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles when a Pi(+) pion at rest decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino. 

Wait, I remember from my studies that when a particle decays, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Oh right, because in the rest frame of the decaying particle, the initial momentum is zero. So after the decay, the momenta of the products must cancel each other out. 

The pion Pi(+) is at rest, so its momentum is zero. The muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. But wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very tiny (almost zero) mass. So maybe I can treat the neutrino as massless? Or not? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. 

Given data:
- Rest mass of Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV/c².
- Rest mass of mu(+) is 105.7 MeV/c².

Wait, the neutrino's rest mass is considered negligible in most cases, right? So for the purpose of calculation, we might assume the neutrino is massless. 

So the decay equation is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. 

Since the pion is at rest, the total initial energy is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. 

After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. But since the pion is at rest, the total momentum of the products must be zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. 

Let me denote:
- m_pi = 139.6 MeV/c²
- m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c²
- m_nu ≈ 0 (approximated as zero)

Let me denote the energies as E_mu and E_nu. The momenta will be p_mu and p_nu. 

Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So after decay:
p_mu + p_nu = 0 → p_nu = -p_mu.

But for the neutrino, since m_nu ≈ 0, its energy E_nu is equal to |p_nu|c. Because for massless particles, E = |p|c.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the neutrino has energy E_nu = |p_nu|c, since its rest mass is zero.

But since p_nu = -p_mu, the magnitudes are equal: |p_nu| = |p_mu|.

So E_nu = |p_nu| c = p_mu c. 

The muon's energy E_mu is related to its momentum by the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E_mu² = (p_mu c)² (m_mu c²)². 

So E_mu² = (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2. 

But since in the pion rest frame, the total energy is m_pi c², which is 139.6 MeV.

So total energy after decay: E
