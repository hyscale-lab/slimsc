Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let's break it down step by step. 

The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And from the measurements, we know that when the position of the particles is measured, they're all found between x=1 and x=3. So that means the wave function must be non-zero (or have a significant probability) only in that region. 

Wait, no, not exactly. The wave function itself doesn't directly give the probability. The probability is the square of the absolute value of the wave function. So for the wave function to be zero outside x=1 and x=3, the probability should be zero there. So the wave function must be zero at x=1 and x=3.

Hmm, but wait, looking at the wave function: (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So for x=1: the denominator becomes sqrt(2), so the real part is a/sqrt(2). The imaginary part is -0.5i. So the wave function at x=1 would be (a/sqrt(2)) -0.5i. 

Wait a minute, wait. The wave function is a function of x, right? So for the particle to be found only between x=1 and x=3, the wave function must be zero outside of that interval. That's what I thought earlier. But looking at the wave function given, it's a function that has a real part and an imaginary part. So for the wave function to be zero at x=1 and x=3, both the real and imaginary parts must be zero there.

But wait, the imaginary part is -0.5i. That's a constant, not dependent on x. So at x=1, the wave function's imaginary part is -0.5i. So the entire wave function is (a/sqrt(2)) -0.5i. For this to be zero, both the real and imaginary parts must be zero. But the imaginary part is fixed at -0.5i, which can't be zero. So that suggests that the wave function as given can't be zero at x=1 or x=3. Hmm, that's confusing. 

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Oh, wait, maybe the wave function is normalized. Because the particle is found only between x=1 and x=3, the wave function must be zero outside this region. But wait, the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So perhaps the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. So maybe the wave function is zero outside, but the given form is only valid within that interval. But the question says that each particle's wave function is described as that in the part of space where it can exist. So the wave function is zero elsewhere.

But then, the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So perhaps this is the expression within x from 1 to 3, and zero outside. Wait, but how can that be? Because the expression (a / sqrt(1+x)) would be valid for x >= -1, but since x is between 1 and 3, that's okay. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5.

Wait, but for the wave function to be zero at x=1, let's plug in x=1 into the real part: a / sqrt(2). So for the real part to be zero, a must be zero. But that can't be right because then the entire wave function would be -0.5i, which is constant, but that's not zero. So I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is normalized such that the integral of |ψ|^2 from x=1 to x=3 is 1. Because in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be normalized, meaning the integral of the probability density (|ψ|^2) over all space is 1.

So the probability density is |ψ|^2 = [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i ] * [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i ] = (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.25) because (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 is a²/(1+x), and the cross terms are imaginary and cancel out when multiplied by the conjugate.

Wait, no. Wait, when you multiply (a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i) by its complex conjugate (a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i), you get (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2. Because (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. So the probability density is a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but that can't be right because when you multiply (p + qi)(p - qi) = p² + q². So here, p is a/sqrt(1+x), q is -0.5. So the result is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but if the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3, then the wave function outside that region is zero. So the integral of |ψ|^2 from x=1 to x=3 must be 1.

So the integral is ∫ (from 1 to3) [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me compute this integral.

First, the integral of a²/(1+x) dx is a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3.

The integral of 0.25 dx is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So the entire integral becomes a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] + 0.5.

Because ln(1+3) is ln(4), and ln(1+1) is ln(2). So ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the integral becomes a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's the value of ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213. Then a is sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer would be B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we analyze the given wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \). The wave function is non-zero only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), as particles are found exclusively in this region. This implies that the probability density \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) must integrate to 1 over this interval, as the wave function is normalized.

The probability density is given by:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} \right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 \left( \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \right) dx = 1
\]

This can be split into two parts:

1. \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \ln(1+x) \Big|_1^3 = a^2 [\ln(4) - \ln(2)] = a^2 \ln(2) \)
2. \( \int_1^3 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5 \)

Adding these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
