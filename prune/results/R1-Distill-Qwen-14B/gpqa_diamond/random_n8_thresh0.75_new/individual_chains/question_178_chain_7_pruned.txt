Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my QFT, but let me try to think this through.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which makes it an antisymmetric tensor because it's the commutator of the gamma matrices divided by 2i. So that's clear.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should figure out the dimensions of each part of the Lagrangian and see how they balance.

In quantum field theory, the Lagrangian has mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless, and the integral over d^4x has dimension -4 (since each d is dimension -1, and 4d integral makes it -4). So the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4.

So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. In this case, the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ, ψ, and F^{μν}.

Let me recall the mass dimensions of the fields. The fermion field ψ has mass dimension 3/2 because ψ is a spinor and each spinor field in 4D spacetime has dimension (4-1)/2 = 3/2. So ψ̄, being the adjoint, also has 3/2.

The field strength tensor F^{μν} comes from electromagnetism or similar gauge theories. I think F has dimension 2 because it's derivatives of the gauge field A, which is dimension 1. So F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so each derivative adds one dimension, so F is dimension 2.

Now, the sigma term σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless (they're matrices, not operators like derivatives). So σ has the same dimension as the commutator, which is [γ matrices] squared, so dimensionless.

Putting each term together: ψ̄ σ ψ F.

Each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ σ ψ would have dimension 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. Then multiply by F^μν, which is dimension 2. So that term would have dimension 3 + 2 =5. 

The Lagrangian term is κ times this, so the total dimension is [κ] + 5 = 4 (because each term in L must have dim 4). So solving for [κ], we have [κ] = 4 -5 = -1. So the mass dimension of κ is -1. Hmm, that would correspond to options A or C.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable? For a theory to be renormalizable, the coupling constants must have positive or zero mass dimensions. Because in terms of renormalizability, the interaction terms must have dimension ≤4. Wait, but wait, the dimension of the coupling constant is determined by the term it's in. So in the interaction Lagrangian term, the term has dimension 4, so the coupling's dimension is 4 minus the sum of the field dimensions. 

Wait, but for renormalizability, the coupling's mass dimension must be ≥0. Because in the Feynman diagrams, the coupling's dimension determines the superficial degree of divergence. If the coupling has a negative dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable because the coupling becomes stronger at lower energies (since dimension is negative, which would imply the coupling has units of [mass]^(-n), so higher mass scales would have weaker couplings? Or wait, maybe I'm getting this backwards.

Wait, the superficial degree of divergence D is given by D = 4 - (sum of the dimensions of each field in the term, each with their own exponents) * n, where n is the number of vertices for that term. Oh, wait, but for each term in the
