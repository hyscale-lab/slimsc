Okay, so I've got this pretty detailed question here about a scientific experiment gone wrong, and I'm supposed to figure out why there's no green signal under the microscope. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The researcher is trying to study their developmental fate. The setup involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. I remember that bicistronic vectors mean they have two coding regions in one construct, so here, the ligand and receptor each are expressed from this vector.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. The receptor is at the 3' end with an IRES element upstream. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so the receptor might be expressed as a separate protein, possibly in a different cell type or under different conditions than the ligand.

Looking at the vector structure: The ligand's ORF is at 5', fused to mCherry, but there's a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP) between the ligand and mCherry. Similarly, the receptor is at 3', with eGFP fused, but a lox2272 stop cassette is between them. Oh wait, I think loxP and lox2272 are different sites recognized by Cre. So when Cre is present, it can excise the stop cassettes.

So, when Cre is introduced, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed. But wait, how? Because the vector is bicistronic, the ligand and receptor are in the same transcript but are separated by the IRES. Or wait, no: the ligand is first, then the stop, then the IRES, then the receptor? Hmm, maybe I should think about the structure.

The vector is bicistronic, so it's a single transcript with two ORFs. The ligand is at 5', and the receptor at 3', with the IRES in between. So the first ORF is ligand, then after the IRES, the receptor. But then there are stop cassettes in between each ORF and the fluorescent proteins.

Wait, the ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. But there's a stop cassette between ligand ORF and mCherry. Similarly, the receptor ORF is at 3', fused to eGFP, with a stop cassette between them. So, without Cre, the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry, and the receptor as a fusion with eGFP? Or maybe not, because the stop cassettes are in between. Hmm, perhaps that's not how it works. Wait, the stop cassette is after the ORF. So, for the ligand, it's ORF followed by stop, then mCherry? No, the ligand ORF is fused to mCherry, but the stop is in between. Maybe the ligand is expressed as a single protein with mCherry, but only after the stop is excised. Or perhaps the stop cassette is meant to prevent expression unless Cre is present.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again: the vector is bicistronic, meaning a single mRNA produces two proteins, probably by using an IRES for the second ORF. So the 5' end has the ligand's ORF, which is followed by a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP), then the IRES, then the receptor's ORF, followed by another stop cassette (lox2272-stop-lox2272), and then eGFP.

Wait, no. The question says the ligand is at 5', fused to mCherry, with the stop cassette between the ligand ORF and mCherry. Then, there's the IRES upstream of the receptor, and the receptor is at 3', fused to eGFP, with a stop cassette between them.

Ah, okay. So the vector is set up so that when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing the ligand to be expressed as a
