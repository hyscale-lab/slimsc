Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit puzzled but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves a series of reactions and asks about the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. I remember that these are symmetry point groups, which determine the symmetry of a molecule based on its shape and structure.

First, I'll try to map out the reactions given.

The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red. Hmm, bright red product—could that be something like sulfur? Or maybe a transition metal compound? Not sure yet.

Next, product C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. So E is dangerous. Maybe something like a gas like chlorine or a toxic compound like hydrogen sulfide? Or perhaps a strong acid?

Then, C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Strong acids include HCl, H2SO4, etc., and weak ones like CH3COOH or something less reactive. So when C is hydrolyzed, it breaks down into A, F, and G.

The last point is that D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, acetone, etc. Also, the reaction of D and B is 1:1. Let me think about possible gases B and D that react 1:1 to form a common solvent.

Putting this together, I think gas B might be Cl2, which is a common gas used in reactions. Gas D could be H2O or another gas. Wait, but H is a solvent. If D and B react 1:1 to form H, which is a solvent. Suppose B is Cl2 and D is water? Wait, but Cl2 plus H2O would form HClO and HCl, not a solvent. Hmm, maybe that's not right.

Alternative approach: Let me think about the hydrolysis reaction. C + H2O → A + F + G. So C is a compound that upon hydrolysis gives A, a strong acid F, and a weak acid G. If C is a chlorinated compound, perhaps a chloroalkane or something else.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps A is a metal, and B is a halogen. For example, solid A could be aluminum (Al), gas B is Cl2. Reaction of Al with Cl2 forms AlCl3. So C is AlCl3? But AlCl3 is a Lewis acid, but does it react with 8 equivalents of Cl2? Wait, no—AlCl3 is formed when Al reacts with Cl2, but maybe in a different stoichiometry.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal like sodium (Na), B is Cl2. Sodium reacts with Cl2 in combustion to form NaCl. But that's 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. So 2 equivalents of B (Cl2) per A (Na). But in the question, it's 8 equivalents of B per A. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe A is something else. Let me think about C reacting with D to form E. If E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's something like phosgene (but that's a gas), or maybe sarin gas, but that's more of a nerve agent. Alternatively, maybe E is something like hydrogen cyanide, but that's a gas. Wait, another possibility: E could be a highly toxic gas like HCN, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: looking at the H production. H is a solvent formed by D and B in 1:1 ratio. Let's think about possible solvents. Water is a solvent, but B and D would have to react to form H as water. So if H is H2O, then B and D must react to form water. For that, B and D would need to be something like H2 and O2, but reacting in a 1:1 ratio would produce H2O. But that's an option, but then B would be O2 and D H2, but I'm not sure if that fits the other reactions.

Alternatively, maybe H is something else. Another common solvent is ethanol. If H is ethanol (C2H5OH), then B and D could be something that reacts to form ethanol. But that seems less likely, as ethanol is usually produced by fermentation or other methods.

Wait, maybe H is CH3CH2OH (ethanol). Then, what could B and D be? Suppose B is H2O and D is something else. Or maybe B is O2 and D is CH3CH2OH, but that doesn't fit a 1:1 ratio. Alternatively, maybe B is H2 and D is CO, but I'm not sure.

Wait another thought: Maybe B is Cl2 and D is H2O. But when they react, Cl2 + H2O produces HCl and HOCl. But that's not a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2 and D is Cl2. Then, 1:1 ratio would make HCl, but HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps H is HCl? No, that's a gas. Alternatively, H could be something like methanol (CH3OH), which is a solvent. So to form methanol, perhaps B is CO and D is something else. Maybe B is CO and D is H2. In a 1:1 ratio, they can form CH3OH under certain conditions. But I'm not sure if that's a common reaction.

Alternatively, maybe B is H2O and D is something else. Let's think of other possibilities.

Wait, perhaps B is H2, and D is O2. Then, in a 1:1 ratio, they form H2O. So H would be H2O, a solvent. That makes sense. So B is H2 (gas), D is O2 (gas), reacting in 1:1 to form H2O (liquid), a common solvent.

But then, looking back at reaction 1: solid A reacts with 8 eq of B (H2) to form C. So A + 8 H2 → C. What solid A reacts with H2 in such a way? Perhaps a transition metal, like iron? Well, for example, Fe reacts with H2 in presence of a catalyst to form FeH2, but that's not a common reaction. Alternatively, maybe A is something else.

Alternatively, maybe B is not H2. Let's think differently.

Wait, going back to the hydrolysis of C: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is strong acid, G is weak acid. So perhaps C is a chloro compound that upon hydrolysis produces a metal, HCl (strong acid), and another weak acid.

Wait, another possibility: C could be something like CCl4. But when CCl4 reacts with water, it doesn't hydrolyze to form a metal. So that's probably not it.

Wait, maybe C is a metal chloride. For example, let's say A is Al. Then, A (Al) reacts with B (Cl2) to form AlCl3 (C). So Al + Cl2 → AlCl3. But the stoichiometry is 2 Al + 3 Cl2 → 2 AlCl3. So that's 1.5 equivalents of Cl2 per Al. But the problem says 8 equivalents. That doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps A is magnesium (Mg). Mg reacts with Cl2 to form MgCl2. Reaction: 2 Mg + Cl2 → 2 MgCl2. So 1 equivalent of Cl2 per 2 Mg. Not 8 equivalents. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reaction is not between a metal and Cl2, but perhaps another type of reaction. Maybe A is a non-metal. For example, sulfur (S). Sulfur reacts with Cl2 when heated to form SO2 or SCl2. Wait, S + Cl2 upon reaction could form SCl2, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, maybe A is carbon. Reaction of carbon with Cl2 would form CCl2, but that's not stable. Alternatively, maybe CCl4, but I don't think that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I'm looking at this the wrong way. Let me try to think about the product E.

E is formed when C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D. And E is extremely hazardous, which suggests it's a toxic gas. So possible candidates for E could be phosgene (but that's (CO)Cl2), sarin, or something like hydrogen cyanide (HCN), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if E is a gas like SO2, but that's not extremely hazardous in small amounts but can be harmful. Or maybe it's a nerve agent like VX, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, but perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like Cl2O7 (dichlorine heptoxide), but I'm not too certain.

Another possibility: if C is something like SO3, and D is H2O, but that's not a gas. Wait, D is a gas, so D must be a gas. So, if D is H2O (gas?), but that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps C is a chloro compound, and D is something else. For example, if C is CHCl3, and D is something that reacts with it. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a chloroalkane. Let's think about C being CCl4. But then, when CCl4 reacts with D (a gas) to form E. But I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, maybe C is a nitro compound. Let me think: what if C is something like Cu(NO3)2, and D is H2S? Then, Cu(NO3)2 + H2S → CuS↓ + 2 HNO3. But that would produce HNO3, which is a strong acid. Hmm, but the problem states that C reacts with water to form F and G, which are two different acids. So perhaps in that case, if C is a nitrate salt, hydrolysis would produce a strong acid and another acid. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: Let's think about D. D reacts with B in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If H is H2O, then D and B must be H2 and O2. Because 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. But the stoichiometry is 2:1 for H2 and O2, which is not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps H is something else. Let's say H is CH3OH (methanol), a common solvent. Then, how to form CH3OH from B and D in 1:1 ratio. Maybe B is CO and D is H2, with a catalyst. For example, in the Fischer-Tropsch process, but that usually produces longer hydrocarbons, not alcohols. Alternatively, maybe it's the reverse. Wait, the reaction for methanol production is CO + 2 H2 → CH3OH. So that's a 1:2 ratio. But the question says 1:1 ratio between B and D.

Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach. Let me think about E.

E is produced when C reacts with D. If E is a highly toxic gas, perhaps it's phosgene (O=CCl2). Phosgene is a toxic gas, but I'm not sure about its formation.

Wait, phosgene is produced by the reaction of chlorinated compounds, but perhaps when C is something like POCl3 and D is CO2? Not sure.

Alternatively, E could be hydrogen cyanide (HCN), but HCN is produced from reactions involving cyanide salts and strong acids. Not sure if that fits here.

Wait, thinking about the hydrolysis: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So C must be a salt that, when hydrolyzed, gives two different acids. For example, if C is a salt of a diacid, like sodium hydrogen sulfate (NaHSO4). But that's a specific case.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a salt like Na2SO3 (sodium sulfite), which upon hydrolysis would give H2SO3 (weak acid, H2SO3 is unstable and forms H2S and SO3^2-?), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Let's think about the acids. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So the hydrolysis of C produces both. One possibility is that C is a nitro compound. For example, if C is something like (CH3)2NNO2 (nitro compounds). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is ammonium hydrogen sulfate ((NH4)HSO4), then upon hydrolysis, it would release H+ (strong acid) and HSO4^- which can further dissociate into H+ and SO4^2- (but that's a weak acid). Wait, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe C is a chloro compound. Let's say C is CCl4. But when CCl4 reacts with water, it doesn't hydrolyze into acids. So that's probably not the case.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the first reaction.

A reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form C. If A is a metal and B is a halogen, but the stoichiometry is 8 equivalents. That seems high. For example, for sodium (Na), 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. So 1 equivalent of Cl2 per 2 Na. Not 8. Alternatively, perhaps A is a transition metal with a higher valency. For example, if A is iron (Fe) and B is Cl2, Fe + Cl2 → FeCl3. The reaction is 2 Fe + 3 Cl2 → 2 FeCl3. So 1.5 equivalents. Not 8. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is something else, not a metal. Maybe a non-metal like sulfur. Sulfur reacts with Cl2 when heated to form SCl2 or S2Cl2. But the stoichiometry would vary. Let me think: S + Cl2 → SCl2. For each S atom, 2 Cl atoms are consumed. So 1:2 ratio. But the problem has 8 equivalents of B. So 8 moles of B per mole of A.

Wait, if A is a compound that requires multiple B molecules. For example, if A is CH4, and B is Cl2, then CH4 + 8 Cl2 → C which might be CCl8 (if possible), but that's not a known compound. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps A is a polymer or something that reacts extensively. Hmm, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal hydride. For example, magnesium hydride (MgH2). But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe A is a transition metal oxide. For instance, if A is FeO, reacting with Cl2 to form FeCl3. Again, stoichiometry would be different.

Alternatively, maybe B is not Cl2. Let's think of other gases. Maybe B is O2.

Wait, if B is O2, then 8 equivalents per A. Suppose A is carbon. Then, carbon reacts with O2 to form CO2. The reaction is C + O2 → CO2, which is 1:1. Not 8. Alternatively, if A is something like NH3, but that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps this line of thought isn't working. Let me look for another approach.

The key point is the symmetry group of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v. These are all point groups.

Point groups are determined by the symmetry elements present in the molecule. For example:

- C2: has a two-fold rotation axis.
- D4h: has a four-fold rotation axis, mirror planes, and inversion. This is the symmetry group of square planar molecules like XeF4.
- D∞h: this is for linear molecules with infinite symmetry, like CO2 or HCN.
- C2v: has a two-fold rotation axis and two mirror planes perpendicular to the axis.

So, to find the symmetry group of E, I need to figure out what E is.

If E is a molecule with a linear structure, like CO2 or HCN, it would have D∞h symmetry. If it's a molecule like SO2, which is bent, it would have C2v symmetry. If it's a square planar molecule, D4h. Alternatively, a molecule with a center of inversion and a mirror plane could be C2v.

But given that E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's something like phosgene (O=CCl2), which has a planar structure. Wait, phosgene has the structure O=CCl2. Let's think about its symmetry.

Phosgene (O=CCl2) has a central carbon atom double-bonded to oxygen and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. The molecule is planar, with the central C being the center. So the molecule has a mirror plane along the C-O axis and another mirror plane along the C-Cl axis? Or maybe it's has a C2 axis? No, because the structure is trigonal planar, but with two identical substituents (Cl) on one side and an O on the other.

Wait, the structure is O=C(Cl)2. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the C=O axis, passing through the C atom. It also has a two-fold rotation axis perpendicular to the C=O bond. So the point group would be D∞h because it has an infinite symmetry element, but wait, isn't D∞h for linear molecules? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a linear molecule like HCN. HCN has a linear structure (H-C≡N), so its symmetry is D∞h, which has a center of inversion and mirror planes.

Wait, but phosgene is O=C(Cl)2, which is trigonal planar. So what's its point group? Let me think. The molecule has a C=O double bond. The two Cl atoms are on the same side of the C=O bond. So it's similar to CHCl2, which is tetrahedral but with three identical substituents. Wait, no—CHCl2 is trigonal pyramidal, but O=C(Cl)2 is trigonal planar.

For O=C(Cl)2, the molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the angle between the two Cl atoms and the C=O. So that's a mirror plane. It also has a two-fold rotation axis perpendicular to the C=O bond. So, perhaps it's in the C2v point group. Because C2v has a two-fold axis and two mirror planes.

Wait, the C2v point group has a two-fold rotation axis and two mirror planes. For phosgene, the two mirror planes would be the one containing the C=O and one of the C-Cl bonds, and another plane perpendicular to that. Alternatively, maybe it's D3h, but that's for trigonal planar molecules with three substituents.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me recall: 

- D∞h is the point group for linear molecules like CO2, HCN, etc.
- D3h is for trigonal planar molecules like BF3, but with certain symmetry.
- C2v is for molecules like SO2, which is bent with a central atom having two different substituents.

So, if E is phosgene (O=C(Cl)2), which is trigonal planar with two Cl atoms and one O, the symmetry would be C2v. Because the molecule has a two-fold rotation axis (perpendicular to the C=O bond), and two mirror planes: one through the C-O bond and the other through the C-Cl bonds. Wait, but with two Cl atoms, the molecule has certain symmetry.

Alternatively, if E is a linear molecule like HCN, then symmetry is D∞h.

Given that E is extremely hazardous, maybe it's phosgene, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another angle: E is formed when C reacts with D. If D is a diatomic gas, perhaps like H2O (but it's a gas?), but that's a stretch. Or perhaps D is a halogen.

Wait, back to the reaction where D and B form H. If H is a solvent, maybe H is H2O. But then, B and D would have to react to form H2O in a 1:1 ratio. So perhaps B is H2 and D is O2. 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. The molar ratio is 2:1, which doesn't fit the 1:1 ratio. So that can't be.

Alternative, perhaps H is another solvent. Let me think of B and D as H2 and O2; but as I said, their ratio isn't 1:1. Maybe B is O2 and D is H2O. But H2O is a liquid, not a gas. So D can't be H2O if it's a gas.

Wait, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is H2O. Then, Cl2 + H2O → HCl + HOCl. But that's not a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps H is NH3, but how? That would require B and D to be N2 and H2. 3 H2 + N2 → 2 NH3. But that's a 3:1 ratio, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: D could be CO2. If B is H2O, then D is CO2. But in what reaction would H2O and CO2 form a solvent in a 1:1 ratio? Not sure.

Alternatively, if B is CO and D is H2O. Then, CO + H2O → 2 H2O → no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I've been overcomplicating this. Let's start from the beginning and try to deduce what each substance is.

Reactions:

1. A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red solid)
2. C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous)
3. C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
4. B (gas) + D (gas) → H (solvent), 1:1 ratio.

From reaction 4: B + D → H (solvent), 1:1.

H is a solvent, which is a liquid, so the product of B and D must be a liquid. So B and D reacting in 1:1 ratio gives a liquid.

Let me think of some gas + gas → liquid reactions. One possibility is HCl gas + NH3 gas → NH4Cl (solid), but that's a solid. Another is CO2 + 2 NaOH → 2 NaHCO3 (solid). Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, another reaction: H2O (gas) + something. But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, another common reaction: O2 (B) and H2 (D) → H2O (liquid), but the stoichiometry is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So 2:1 ratio, which doesn't fit the 1:1.

Wait, perhaps B is O2 and D is CH4. They don't react. Hmm.

Alternatively, B is CO and D is H2O. They don't react, but in the presence of catalysts, perhaps. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps H is ethanol. To make ethanol from two gases in 1:1 ratio. Maybe CO (B) and H2 (D). In the presence of a catalyst, CO + 2 H2 → CH3OH. But that's a 1:2 ratio, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if H is CH3CH2OH, then perhaps B is C2H5Cl and D is NaOH. That's not a gas reacting, though.

Wait, perhaps B is NH3 (a gas) and D is HCl (a gas). They react to form NH4Cl (solid), but that's a solid, not a solvent.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck on reaction 4. Let's try to think about it differently. What if H is a common solvent like ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and the reaction involves gases that produce ethanol. For example, if B is CO and D is H2, then in the presence of a catalyst, they can form ethanol. But as I thought earlier, the stoichiometry is 1 CO : 2 H2 → 1 CH3CH2OH. So that's not 1:1.

Alternatively, perhaps H is methanol (CH3OH), produced from CO and H2 in a 1:2 ratio. Again, not 1:1.

Wait, if B is O2 and D is H2O (but that's a liquid), perhaps. No.

Alternatively, could H be something like H2SO4? No, that's a liquid but not a solvent. It's more of an acid.

Wait, another approach: Let me assume that H is H2O. Then, B and D would have to react to form H2O in a 1:1 ratio. So possible, B is H2O and D is O2. But O2 and H2O don't react. Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2. But their reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So 2:1 ratio, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps B is H2O and D is O2. But in that case, they don't react. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps H is another solvent like acetone (propanone). To make acetone from two gases, maybe B is (CH3)2CO and D is something else. But that's not a gas.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck on reaction 4. Let me try to proceed with other reactions and see if that helps.

Looking at reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is strong acid, G is weak acid.

So, C must be a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces two different acids. One strong and one weak.

A possible example is a salt of a diacid where one acid is strong and the other is weak. For instance, consider sodium hydrogen sulfate (NaHSO4). When it hydrolyzes, HSO4^- can act as an acid (since it's a strong acid's conjugate base?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a metal nitrate and another acid.

Wait, another example: if C is ammonium hydrogen sulfate ( (NH4)HSO4 ), then hydrolysis would give NH4OH (which is NH3 + H2O, but that's weak) and H2SO4 (strong acid). So F could be H2SO4, G could be H2SO4 as well, but they must be different. Hmm, that's not working.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a salt like NaHCO3. NaHCO3 + H2O → NaOH + CO2↑ + H2O. Wait, but NaOH is a strong base, not an acid. So that's not fitting.

Another possibility: If C is a sulfite salt, like Na2SO3. Na2SO3 + H2O → 2 NaOH + H2SO3. But H2SO3 is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So that's not matching F and G being acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitro compound. For example, if C is ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3). Hydrolysis would produce HNO3 (strong acid) and NH4OH (which is weak). So F is HNO3, G is NH4OH. That fits.

So, in this case, when C is NH4NO3, hydrolysis gives NH4OH (weak acid) and HNO3 (strong acid), plus A, which would be NH4NO3 → NH4OH and HNO3. Wait, no, the reaction would be:

NH4NO3 (s) + H2O → NH4OH (aq) + HNO3 (aq)

So, in this case, A is NH4NO3, which is the same as C. But in the question, C is the product of A and B, so that can't be. So perhaps this isn't the right path.

Wait, another example: C could be a mixture of two salts. No, perhaps not. Let me think differently.

Perhaps C is a metal chloride, like AlCl3. AlCl3 is a Lewis acid. When it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes to form HCl (strong acid) and Al(OH)3. Al(OH)3 is amphoteric, but in this case, perhaps it's acting as an acid. Wait, no. Al(OH)3 is more of a base. So the reaction would be:

AlCl3 + 3 H2O → Al(OH)3 + 3 HCl.

So F is HCl (strong acid), G is Al(OH)3, but Al(OH)3 is a base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Let's try another angle.

If F and G are acids, then C must be a salt that, upon hydrolysis, gives two acids. One strong and one weak.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester. For example, if C is something like CH3SO3H (methane sulfonic acid). But that's a strong acid itself, not a salt.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed anhydride. For example, if C is an anhydride of a strong acid and a weak acid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a carbonate. For example, Na2CO3. When it hydrolyzes, it produces NaOH (strong base) and CO2 (which can form H2CO3, a weak acid). But in that case, F would be H2CO3 (weak acid), and G would be NaOH, which is a base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a phosphate salt. For example, NaH2PO4. It can hydrolyze to H3PO4 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). Again, G would be a base, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm looking at the wrong type of salt. What about a salt of a weak acid and a weak base? For example, KHS (potassium hydrogen sulfide). When KHS is hydrolyzed, it produces H2S (weak acid) and KOH (strong base). So again, that's a base, not matching the problem.

Wait, perhaps C is a salt where both the cation and anion are conjugate bases of weak acids. So, for example, something like NH4Cl. Then, when NH4Cl is hydrolyzed, it produces NH4OH (weak base) and HCl (strong acid). So F is HCl, G is NH4OH. But NH4OH is a weak acid (since NH4+ is the conjugate acid of NH3, a weak base). So F is strong acid, G is weak acid. That fits!

So, if C is NH4Cl, then hydrolysis gives NH4OH (weak acid) and HCl (strong acid), plus A which would be NH4Cl. But wait, the reaction is C + H2O → A + F + G. So A would have to be another compound. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrolysis of C produces A, F, and G. So C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, releases A as a metal, and F and G as acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a complex salt. For example, let's say C is NaAlH4. When it hydrolyzes, it could form NaOH (strong base) and Al(OH)3 (weak base). But that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is something like KCN. KCN hydrolyzes to form HCN (weak acid) and KOH (strong base). So F is KOH (strong base, which doesn't fit as F is a strong acid), so that's not correct.

Another thought: perhaps C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. When hydrolyzed, it forms NaOH and H2SO3 (which is unstable and forms H2S and H2O). But then, H2SO3 is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So F and G would be a base and an acid, but the problem states F and G are both acids. So this doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the hydrolysis produces a metal oxide and two acids. Let's say C is a metal carbonate, like CaCO3. CaCO3 + H2O → Ca(OH)2 + CO2. CO2 can form H2CO3 (weak acid), and Ca(OH)2 is a strong base. So F is H2CO3 (weak), G is Ca(OH)2 (base). Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal nitrate, like Al(NO3)3. Hydrolysis would produce Al(OH)3 (base) and HNO3 (strong acid). So again, one acid, one base. Not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I need to think of a salt that upon hydrolysis produces two different acids. Let me think: perhaps a salt of a weak acid and a weak base. For example, sodium hydrogen sulfate (NaHSO4). But when it hydrolyzes, the HSO4^- ion can act as an acid (since it's a strong acid's conjugate base, H2SO4 is strong). So NaHSO4 + H2O → NaOH + H2SO4. So F could be H2SO4 (strong acid), G is NaOH (base). Doesn't fit.

Wait, but in some cases, HSO4^- can act as an acid or a base. However, in this case, when it's in solution, it's more likely to function as an acid.

Alternatively, maybe C is a salt that produces two acids. For example, perhaps a salt like (NH4)2SO4. When it hydrolyzes, it can produce NH4OH (weak acid) and H2SO4 (strong acid). So F is H2SO4, G is NH4OH. So that fits.

So, C could be (NH4)2SO4. Then, reaction 3 is:

(NH4)2SO4 + H2O → 2 NH4OH + H2SO4.

Wait, but that's not correct. The actual hydrolysis of (NH4)2SO4 is:

(NH4)2SO4 (s) + 2 H2O → 2 NH4OH (aq) + H2SO4 (aq).

Yes, so F is H2SO4 (strong acid), G is NH4OH (weak acid). So that fits the problem statement.

So from this, C is (NH4)2SO4.

Now, looking back to reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 eq of B (gas) → C (bright red solid).

If C is (NH4)2SO4, what could A be? Let's see, (NH4)2SO4 can be formed by the reaction of NH4Cl with H2SO4:

NH4Cl + H2SO4 → (NH4)2SO4 + HCl↑.

But that's a solid plus a liquid; not sure if it's relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that reacts with a gas to form (NH4)2SO4. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Wait, another angle. (NH4)2SO4 is formed via the reaction of sulfuric acid with ammonium chloride. But I'm not sure if that's relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal sulfide. For example, reacting with H2SO4 to form (NH4)2SO4. But that again involves acid.

Wait, perhaps B is H2SO4. If B is H2SO4, then reaction 1 would be A + 8 H2SO4 → (NH4)2SO4.

But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps B is SO3.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps C is FeSO4. Then, reaction 3 would be FeSO4 + H2O → Fe(OH)SO4 + H2SO4. But that's not matching F and G as acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is something else.

Wait, going back, I thought C is (NH4)2SO4, but I'm not sure. Let me think about reaction 1.

A + 8 B → C.

If B is a diatomic gas like Cl2, then 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of A. So A must be something that reacts with 8 equivalents of Cl2. Maybe a metal with a +1 oxidation state. For example, if A is Ag, then 8 Cl2 would produce AgCl2 (but that's not a known compound). Alternatively, perhaps A is a compound that can accept 8 Cl atoms.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A is a metal in a lower oxidation state, and B is Cl2. So, for example, if A is Fe(0), Fe reacts with Cl2 to form FeCl3. The reaction is Fe + Cl2 → FeCl3. For every Fe atom, 3 Cl2 molecules are used. So 3 equivalents. But the problem states 8 equivalents, which is much higher.

Hmm, perhaps A is a compound that can react with multiple Cl2 molecules. For example, perhaps A is CH4. Then, CH4 reacts with Cl2 in the presence of UV light to form CCl4, CH2Cl2, etc. But the stoichiometry here isn't straightforward.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps A is C (carbon). Then, C reacts with Cl2 to form CCl2, but that's not stable. Or perhaps it forms a chlorinated compound. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is not Cl2, but another gas. Let me think, if B is O2, then 8 O2 per mole of A. What reacts with O2 in large quantities? Maybe a metal that forms a high oxidation state. For example, Os can form OsO4, but that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal that forms a complex with B. For example, W (tungsten) reacts with Cl2 to form WCl6. The reaction is W + 6 Cl2 → WCl6. So 6 equivalents. But in the question, it's 8. Close but not matching.

Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't working. Let me think about E again.

E is formed when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. If E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's a nerve agent or a highly toxic gas. But without knowing E, it's hard to proceed.

Wait, going back to H: H is formed from B and D in 1:1 ratio, and is a solvent. If H is CH3OH, then B and D must be CO and H2, but their ratio is 1:2. Doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps H is another solvent like ether (diethyl ether). To make ether, you need an alcohol and another alcohol, but that's not a gas. So that's not applicable.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck and need to make some assumptions.

Let me make an assumption that H is H2O. Then, B and D must react in a 1:1 ratio to form H2O. So possible reactions: H2 + O2 → H2O (but 2:1 ratio). Or CO + H2O → CO2 + H2 (but that's shift reaction, not forming H2O). Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps H is another liquid, like ethanol. But how to form ethanol from two gases in 1:1 ratio.

Another possible solvent is dimethylformamide (DMF), but I don't think it's formed from gases.

Wait, perhaps H is something like HCl, but that's a gas. No, H is a solvent, which is a liquid.

Another thought: perhaps H is a solution, like brine (salt water), but that's not a pure solvent.

Wait, maybe H is a solution of something. But the question says H is a solvent, which I think implies a pure substance.

Hmm. Maybe I'm stuck on this, but perhaps I should move forward and see if any of the options make sense.

The options for E's symmetry are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

If E is a linear molecule, like HCN, it would have D∞h symmetry. If E is a trigonal planar molecule like phosgene, it would have C2v symmetry. If E is a square planar molecule like XeF4, it's D4h.

But considering E is extremely hazardous, I think it's more likely to be a linear molecule like phosgene or sarin.

Phosgene is O=CCl2, which is trigonal planar. Its symmetry group is C2v because it has a two-fold rotation axis perpendicular to the C=O bond and two mirror planes. Wait, no, phosgene has a center of inversion and a mirror plane. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, sarin is a chiral molecule, so it doesn't have high symmetry. Probably not one of the options.

Wait, another possibility: E is a tetrahedral molecule, like CH4, which has Td symmetry. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, E could be something like ClF3, which has a trigonal pyramidal structure and C3v symmetry. Not one of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the reactions again.

If A reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form C, which is bright red. Bright red solids include things like mercury(II) oxide (HgO), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another bright red solid is lead(II,IV) oxide (Pb3O4), but that's more of a brick red.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is a dark green solid, but not bright red.

Wait, another bright red solid is sodium chromate, but that's a yellow solid.

Hmm, I'm not making progress on this. Let me think about the hydrolysis again.

If C is (NH4)2SO4, then reaction 3 is:

(NH4)2SO4 + H2O → 2 NH4OH + H2SO4.

So, F is H2SO4 (strong acid), G is NH4OH (weak acid).

Now, reaction 4: B + D → H (solvent), 1:1. Let's say H is ethanol. Then, B and D would have to be something that reacts to form ethanol. But I don't know what that would be.

Wait, if H is H2O, and B and D react to form H2O in 1:1 ratio. So maybe B is H2O and D is O2. But they don't react to form H2O.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2. Then, 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So 2:1 ratio, not 1:1.

Hmm, maybe this approach isn't working. Let me think again.

An alternative approach: perhaps A is a metal, B is Cl2, so reaction 1 is A + 8 Cl2 → C.

If A is Fe, then perhaps Fe + 8 Cl2 → FeCl4? But FeCl4 is not stable; it tends to form FeCl3.

Alternatively, A could be a transition metal that forms a high chlorination state. For example, Mo can form MoCl6. The reaction would be Mo + 6 Cl2 → MoCl6. So 6 equivalents. Close to 8, but not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal like Pd. Pd reacts with Cl2 to form PdCl2. But that's 1:1 ratio.

Hmm. I'm not making progress here. Let me think about the options again.

The options for E's symmetry are:

A) C2
B) D4h
C) D∞h
D) C2v

If E is a linear molecule, the symmetry is D∞h (option C). If it's a trigonal planar molecule with a two-fold axis and mirror planes, it's C2v (option D).

If E is something like phosgene (O=C(Cl)2), which is trigonal planar, then its symmetry is C2v (option D).

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, if E is a molecule like SO2, which is bent with a central S, its symmetry is C2v.

But wait, SO2 is a bent molecule with a V shape. It has a C2 axis (through the S atom and the midpoint of the O-O bond?), and two mirror planes. So its point group is C2v.

If E is SO2, which is a gas, but is it extremely hazardous? Well, SO2 is toxic but not extremely so. It's more of an irritant.

Alternatively, E could be something like phosgene, which is more dangerous.

In any case, if E has a linear structure, it's D∞h. If it's planar with a central atom and two identical substituents, perhaps C2v.

Since I'm stuck, perhaps I should choose based on the information I have.

From reaction 3, C is probably (NH4)2SO4. Then, reaction 2: C + 2 D → E.

If D is something like H2SO4, then E could be something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since D reacts with B to form H, which is a solvent. If H is H2O, then perhaps B and D are H2O and O2, but their reaction doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps H is another solvent. Let me think of a different approach.

If I can't find the exact compounds, perhaps I can proceed by elimination. The options for E's symmetry are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

If E is a linear molecule, it's D∞h. If a trigonal planar, C2v. If square planar, D4h. If a two-fold axis without mirror planes, C2.

Given that E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's a linear molecule like phosgene, which would have D∞h symmetry. But earlier I thought phosgene is trigonal planar, so C2v.

Wait, no. Phosgene has the structure O=C(Cl)2, which is trigonal planar. So its symmetry is C2v.

Wait, another thought: maybe E is HCN, which is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. HCN is a highly toxic gas, which fits the description.

If E is HCN, then its structure is linear, so D∞h symmetry (option C).

But how would E form from C reacting with D?

If C is (NH4)2SO4, then D must be something that reacts with (NH4)2SO4 to form HCN. But I don't think that's possible, as (NH4)2SO4 is a neutral salt and HCN is a weak acid.

Alternatively, perhaps C is something else.

Alternatively, if E is phosgene, then how would it form from C and D?

Phosgene is produced by the reaction of chlorinated compounds, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is COCl2, and D is something else. Then, COCl2 + D → E.

But I'm getting stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps C is something like Cl2O, which can react with D (H2O) to form HClO and other products. But not sure.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Given the options and the information, I think the most plausible symmetry group for E is D∞h (option C), if E is a linear molecule like HCN. But I'm not entirely confident.


The question involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E, based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The stoichiometry suggests A reacts extensively with B, possibly forming a compound with high coordination or multiple bonds. However, the exact identity of A and B remains unclear.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. This suggests E is a highly toxic compound, possibly a gas or volatile liquid. Examples include phosgene (O=CCl₂), sarin, or HCN.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A, producing two acids: F (strong acid) and G (weak acid). This indicates C is likely a salt that hydrolyzes to yield acids. A plausible candidate for C is ammonium sulfate ((NH₄)₂SO₄), which hydrolyzes to form H₂SO₄ (strong acid) and NH₄OH (weak acid).

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. This suggests D and B combine to produce a liquid solvent, such as water (H₂O), ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH), or methanol (CH₃OH). However, the exact identity of H remains uncertain.

### Symmetry Analysis of E:
- If E is a **linear molecule** like HCN, it would have **D∞h symmetry**, as it has an infinite axis of rotation and mirror planes.
- If E is a **trigonal planar molecule** like phosgene (O=CCl₂), it would have **C2v symmetry**, as it has a two-fold rotation axis and two mirror planes.
- If E is a **square planar molecule**, it would have **D4h symmetry**. However, no such molecule fits the description of E being extremely hazardous.
- If E has only a **two-fold rotation axis**, it would have **C2 symmetry**, but this is less likely given the hazardous nature of E.

### Conclusion:
Given the options and the analysis, the most plausible symmetry group for E depends on its structure. If E is a linear molecule like HCN, the symmetry group is **D∞h**. If E is a trigonal planar molecule like phosgene, the symmetry group is **C2v**. Based on the description of E as extremely hazardous and likely linear, **D∞h** is the most reasonable answer.

Answer: C
