Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me see... I remember something about complexes and dissociation. So, the question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent that forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+.

The concentration given is 0.02 M, which I think is the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex. Since it's a 1:1 complex (probably), the formula would be something like CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA part. But wait, I'm not sure about the charge here. Oh, right, EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, and when it binds to Ca²+, it forms a complex with a charge that depends on the pH. But the problem states the pH is ideal, so I guess the complex is fully deprotonated? Or maybe not, but I think for the purpose of this problem, I can assume that the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much except as per the given K value.

The K for the complex is given as 5x10^10. Oh wait, K usually refers to the formation constant, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ⇌ CaEDTA²−, and the K would be [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]).

Wait, but wait. The problem says the concentration is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, that's the concentration, and the complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. So the problem is about finding the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in solution.

So, the formation constant, K, is given as 5e10, which is a very large number, meaning the complex is very stable. That implies that the dissociation isn't much, so the concentration of free Ca²+ would be very low.

Let me set up the equation. Let's denote the concentration of the complex as C = 0.02 M. The complex dissociates as:

CaEDTA²− ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−

Let’s let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. So, the equilibrium concentrations would be:

[CaEDTA²−] =
