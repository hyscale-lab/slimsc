Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with titrations and pH calculations. But let's take it step by step. 

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

First, I need to figure out what's happening here. So, acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When you titrate them, they react to form the acetate ion and water. 

Let me outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. Calculate the concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution.
2. Determine the volume of NaOH needed to reach 25% titration and the equivalence point.
3. Find the pH at 25% titration, which is before the equivalence point.
4. Find the pH at the equivalence point.

Starting with step 1: Diluting acetic acid. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. We add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. 

The molarity after dilution can be found using the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So, M2 = (0.05 M * 20) / 40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, no wait. Oh right, because when you mix equal volumes, the concentration halves. 20 mL into 40 mL, so 0.05 becomes 0.025. Got it.

Next, the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

At equivalence point, moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid initially.

Wait, but wait: after dilution, the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution are needed.

So, the diluted solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid. Moles = M * V (in liters). So 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles.

So, at equivalence point, moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume V = moles / conc = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence point volume would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. Because 25% of 10
