Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change, or ΔH, is usually measured in kilojoules per mole. Wait, but the options here have both kcal and kJ, which I need to pay attention to.

The question says that 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl is mixed with 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4 and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I need to find the enthalpy of neutralization. Oh wait, wait. Wait a second. Wait, how do these reactants interact?

So, HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is another strong acid but it's diprotic, meaning it can donate two protons. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So when these are mixed, the H+ ions from the acids will react with OH- ions from the base to form water.

But wait, how do the moles come into play here? Because the neutralization reaction depends on the moles of H+ and OH- available.

Let me think. Each HCl molecule gives one H+ ion. Each H2SO4 molecule can give two H+ ions because it's a diprotic acid. And Ba(OH)2 provides two OH- ions per formula unit, right? So for each Ba(OH)2, you get 2 OH-.

So first, I should calculate the moles of H+ from HCl and H2SO4 and the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Let's break it down step by step.

First, calculating moles of HCl: Molarity is moles per liter. So 500 mL is 0.5 L. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles of HCl. Since each HCl gives one H+, that's 0.1 moles H+.

Next, H2SO4. It's 300 mL, which is 0.3 L. Molarity is 0.3 M. So moles H2SO4 = 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. But since each H2SO4 can donate two H+ ions, the total H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles.

Adding those together, total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now for the base, Ba(OH)2. It's 200 mL, 0.2 L. Molarity is 0.5 M. So moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions, so OH- moles = 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but in neutralization, H+ reacts with OH- in a 1:1 ratio. So, the H+ is 0.28 moles and OH- is 0.2 moles. So the OH- is the limiting reagent here. So all the OH- will react, and there will be some H+ left over.

The reaction equation would be H+ + OH- → H2O. Each mole of H+ and OH- produces one mole of water, releasing heat. But wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is usually per mole of H+ reacting.

So, the amount of H+ that actually reacts is 0.2 moles. Because OH- is 0.2 moles. So only 0.2 moles of H+ will react with 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4. So, in total, 0.28 moles of H+ are available. The OH- is
