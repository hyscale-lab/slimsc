Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I remember from my studies that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, I need to use special relativity principles, especially the velocity addition formula and relativistic energy equations.

The problem states that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, so I'll need to calculate both quantities correctly.

First, let's tackle the relative speed. Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as classical mechanics. In classical physics, if object A is moving at v and object B at u, then the relative speed of A with respect to B would be v - u. But in relativity, it's more complicated because of the velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula for the relative velocity v_rel is (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)). But wait, wait! Wait, no, that's the formula when you have two frames moving at velocities v and u relative to the same frame. So if both are moving in the same direction, then the relative velocity is (v - u)/(1 + (v u)/(c²)) )? Or wait, is it (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)) )? Oh wait, no, because if you have two objects moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be (v - u)/(1 + (vu)/c²). Or maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again. The Lorentz transformation for velocities.

The formula is v_rel = (v - u) / (1 - (v u)/(c²)). Wait, no, that can't be right because if both are moving in the same direction, the denominator would have (v u)/c² being positive, so 1 minus a positive. Let's see, I think the correct formula is: if you have frame S, and frame S' is moving at u relative to S, then the velocity of an object in S' is (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)). So yes, that's correct. So for relative velocity, if object A is moving at 0.6c and object B at 0.5c in the same direction, then from B's frame
