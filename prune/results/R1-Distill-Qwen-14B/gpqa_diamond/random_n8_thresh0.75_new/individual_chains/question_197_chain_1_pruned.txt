Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that Compound X undergoes a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. I need to figure out what the product is based on the IR and NMR data provided.

First, I should probably analyze the IR and NMR data to determine what Compound X is. Once I know that, I can figure out what reaction it undergoes with red phosphorus and HI.

Starting with the IR data: the peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which suggests there's an O-H stretch or maybe an N-H. But the other peaks are more telling. At 1720 cm-1, that's a strong peak, likely a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or ester or something like that. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 could be aromatic C=C stretching. So maybe there's a benzene ring involved.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm. That's probably an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Wait, but a broad peak could also be an -OH, like in a carboxylic acid. Hmm. Or maybe an acidic proton like in a phenol? But I'm not so sure about that. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton could be split into a singlet if it's isolated, but I'm not certain.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This looks like two protons in an aromatic ring, maybe para-substituted. The doublet suggests coupling with two equivalent protons, so perhaps a para-substituted benzene.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, perhaps the other two protons in the aromatic ring, so maybe a substituent in the para position. So maybe it's 4-substituted benzene with something else.

Then we have some other protons:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, possibly a CH group adjacent to something else, maybe near an oxygen or a carbonyl. Like maybe a CH2 or CH3 group attached to something.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Two protons, perhaps part of a chain, maybe a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom or a carbonyl.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of three protons, maybe a CH3 group attached to a CH, like in an isopropyl group. Wait, no, a doublet (d) usually implies two neighbors, so maybe it's a CH2 group or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl group attached to something that has one neighboring CH group, so maybe a -CH(CH3)2 structure? Hmm.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, likely a methyl group at the end of a chain, like CH2CH2CH3. So maybe a propyl or butyl group.

Putting this together: The aromatic protons at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm suggest a para-substituted benzene. So the substituent is in the para position. Now, the 10.5 ppm peak is a bit tricky. Let me think. If it's a carboxylic acid, the -OH would be around 10-12 ppm, and it's a broad peak. But in the NMR, the 10.5 peak is a singlet, which for an -OH would make sense if it's exchanging, but maybe it's an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's an enol proton, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1. That could be a carbonyl. If the compound is a benzaldehyde, the aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm, but 10.5 is a bit high. Alternatively, if it's a ketone, maybe the carbonyl is at 1720. Wait, no, aldehydes have higher carbonyl frequencies, around 1720 might be an ester or ketone. Wait, no, actually, aldehydes are higher, around 1720 is more like a ketone. Wait, maybe I'm a bit confused. Let me think: Aldehydes have carbonyl around 1720? Or maybe higher? I think aldehydes are around 2800 for the C-H stretch and 1720 for the carbonyl. Wait, no, I'm mixing things up. The carbonyl for aldehydes is about 1720 cm-1, same as ketones. So that might not be enough to tell.

But the IR also has peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are typical for aromatic C=C stretching. So there's an aromatic ring in the compound.

Now, the NMR has a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 3H, that's a methyl group at the end of a chain, so maybe a propyl group, perhaps something like CH2CH2CH3. Or a longer chain. Hmm.

Looking at the other protons: 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 group next to another CH2 or maybe a carbonyl group. 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group connected to something, maybe adjacent to a carbonyl.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is something like an aromatic ring with a substituent that's a ketone or an ester, and a side chain attached. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde with a branched chain.

Wait, another thought. If we have a para-substituted benzene ring and a substituent that's a carbonyl group, like a benzaldehyde or a ketone. But the 10.5 ppm peak is a bit higher for an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's a phenol, but then the IR would have a broad peak around 3400. Wait, the IR says 3400–2500, which is a wide range, suggesting maybe an -OH or an alkyne C-H stretch. But if it's an -OH, then the NMR would show a broad peak, which the 10.5 ppm is, but that would be more typical of a carboxylic acid than a phenol, which usually have their protons around 5 ppm. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a benzaldehyde with a substituent and an -OH group somewhere else. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzoic acid. The IR would show a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3000, which is present. The carbonyl at 1720 would fit a carboxylic acid, but wait, carboxylic acids typically have a carbonyl around 1700, and an O-H stretch around 2500-3300, which is broader. So maybe that's it. But then the NMR would have a broad peak around 10.5, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid than an aldehyde.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 10.5 peak is a singlet. If it's a carboxylic acid, the -OH would usually be a broad peak, but sometimes they can appear as a singlet, especially if there's only one proton. So maybe that's it.

So, perhaps the structure is something like 4-(something)benzoic acid.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR. If it's a benzoic acid, the ring should be substituted. The NMR shows two doublets for the aromatic protons: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H).
