Okay, I need to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the Chinese hamster ovary cells. Let's go through the problem step by step.

So, the researcher is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. They modified the gene to include a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They used Lipofectamine to transfect the plasmid into CHO cells and are selecting for antibiotic resistance. But the protein isn't being expressed as expected.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, I should check for any issues that might prevent proper translation. Let's start by breaking down the sequence.

The given sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon, so that's good. The next few codons are TAC, which is tyrosine, then CC... wait, let me parse it correctly. The first part is:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT C... 

Wait, let me translate this into protein to see if there's a stop codon or any issues.

ATG is Methionine (start). Then TAC is Tyr, CCA is Pro, TAC is Tyr, GAT is Asp, GTA is Val, TCC is Ser, AGA is Arg (but wait, in mRNA, AGA is Arg, but in DNA, it's complementary to UCU, which is Ser—no, wait, wait. I might be getting confused. Let me think.

Wait, the DNA is given as the plus strand, so the coding strand. So the mRNA would be complementary to this, except for T replaced by U. So each codon is built from the mRNA, which is the complement of the DNA's coding strand.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to read the DNA as the coding (sense) strand, so the mRNA would be the same as the DNA except T to U. So the DNA sequence will directly translate to the mRNA, which then translates to the protein.

So the first part: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT C...

So the first codon is Met. Next is TAC (Tyr), then CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GTA (Val), TCC (Ser), AGA (Arg), TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), CAA (Gln), ATG (Met)—wait, that's a start codon again.

Oh, wait! After the initial Met, there's another Met codon (ATG) after 11 codons. So the sequence is Met followed by several amino acids, then another Met. Hmm, that's a problem because the ribosome could terminate translation prematurely.

Wait, let me list all the codons in order:

1. ATG - Met
2. TAC - Tyr
3. CCA - Pro
4. TAC - Tyr
5. GAT - Asp
6. GTA - Val
7. TCC - Ser
8. AGA - Arg
9. TTA - Leu
10. CGC - Arg
11. CAA - Gln
12. ATG - Met

So the 12th codon is another Met. That's a start codon. That's a problem because the ribosome stops at the first stop codon. So if another Met is encountered, the ribosome might have already read a few codons and then, upon encountering another start codon, perhaps terminate early. But wait, the ribosome moves along the mRNA, and if it finds another start codon, it might not necessarily terminate unless there's a stop codon between the two Met's.

Wait, but in the provided sequence, after the initial Met, there's another Met at position 12. So the initial Met is position 1, then after 11 codons, another Met. So between them, there's 11 codons. Let's see: from Met (1), then 11 more codons, then another Met.

So the mRNA would be something like:

Met Tyr Pro Tyr Asp Val Ser Arg Leu Arg Gln Met ... (and so on).

Now, the second Met is another start codon, but in the same reading frame. So the ribosome would have started at the first Met, read through, and perhaps when it reaches the second Met, it might re-initiate translation, but that's not the issue here. The problem is that the ribosome might not translate beyond the second Met because the first Met is the start, and the second Met could be part of the ORF, but in this case, maybe the second Met is causing the ribosome to terminate early.

Wait, but why would it terminate? Let me think about the context. The first Met is at the beginning. The second Met is at position 12. The ribosome reads the mRNA in triplets, so positions 1-3, 4-6, etc. So the sequence is:

1-3: ATG (Met)
4-6: TAC (Tyr)
7-9: CCA (Pro)
10-12: TAC (Tyr)
13-15: GAT (Asp)
16-18: GTA (Val)
19-21: TCC (Ser)
22-24: AGA (Arg)
25-27: TTA (Leu)
28-30: CGC (Arg)
31-33: CAA (Gln)
34-36: ATG (Met)

So after the initial Met, the next codons are as above. The second Met is at position 34-36 (codon 12). So the ribosome would have read 12 codons, then hit another Met. But Met is not a stop codon. So why would translation stop?

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the second Met is followed by a stop codon. Let's look further. After the second Met (position 34-36), the next codon is ACT (Thr), then CAG (Gln), etc. There's no stop codon right after. So the ribosome would continue translating. Hmm. So maybe that's not the issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the second Met is introducing a frame shift. No, because the entire sequence is in the same frame—each codon is three bases, so no frame shift.

Wait, another possibility: the presence of two start codons might lead to an internal ribosome entry site or cause the ribosome to terminate early. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the second Met is in a different reading frame, but no, the construct is designed as a single ORF.

Wait, but the construct is supposed to have a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. So let me think about the design. The coding sequence starts with the HA tag, then GADD45G. So perhaps the HA tag is being correctly expressed, but the GADD45G isn't. Let's see, the given sequence starts with ATG, which is the start for the HA tag. So the HA tag is added before GADD45G.

Wait, but in the given sequence, the initial coding after the start is the HA tag. Wait, the question says that the sequence introduced is the HA tag at the N-terminus, so the coding sequence starts with HA followed by GADD45G. So perhaps the HA tag's sequence is causing an issue.

Wait, let's look at the HA tag. The HA tag is a small peptide derived from the influenza hemagglutinin. Its sequence is usually YPYDHHQWL. But in the DNA, it's encoded as TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA (maybe), but wait, let's translate the first few codons:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG...

So Met Tyr Pro Tyr Asp Val Ser Arg Leu Arg Gln Met ...

Wait, that doesn't seem to match the HA tag. Hmm, perhaps the HA sequence is correctly introduced. But in the given sequence, the initial part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG..., which doesn't have a stop codon until... let me look further down.

Wait, looking further into the sequence, after the second ATG (Met), does a stop codon appear before the end of the HA tag? Let me check. Let me count how many codons are in the HA tag. The HA tag is about 11 amino acids. So the HA sequence would be 11 codons, which is 33 bases.

Wait, the initial sequence is:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT C... 

Wait, each codon is three letters. So:

1-3: ATG → Met
4-6: TAC → Tyr
7-9: CCA → Pro
10-12: TAC → Tyr
13-15: GAT → Asp
16-18: GTA → Val
19-21: TCC → Ser
22-24: AGA → Arg
25-27: TTA → Leu
28-30: CGC → Arg
31-33: CAA → Gln
34-36: ATG → Met
37-39: ACT → Thr
40-42: CTG → Leu (Wait, the sequence after ATG is ACT C..., so positions 34-36: ATG, 37-39: ACT, 40-42: CAG (Gln?), etc.)

Wait, so the HA tag should be 11 amino acids, which is 33 nucleotides. So the initial 33 nucleotides would be from position 1-33. Let me see: the first 33 is:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA → which is 11 codons (33 bases). That would be the HA tag.

So the HA tag ends at codon 11 (CAA), which is Gln. Then comes ATG again (codon 12: Met). So the GADD45G coding starts here.

So from codon 12 onwards, it's the GADD45G gene.

Now, the issue is that the protein isn't being overexpressed. Let's think about possible reasons.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. So the HA tag might have a mutation, leading to incorrect folding or recognition. But the problem is that the protein isn't being expressed at all, not that it's not binding. But the problem says the researchers couldn't overexpress the protein, so maybe the HA tag is causing a problem like incorrect folding leading to aggregation or improper processing. Alternatively, a mutation might cause a premature stop codon in the HA tag.

Wait, let me check the HA tag's sequence. The HA tag is YPYDHHQWL. Let me translate the first 11 codons.

1: ATG → Met
2: TAC → Tyr
3: CCA → Pro
4: TAC → Tyr
5: GAT → Asp
6: GTA → Val
7: TCC → Ser
8: AGA → Arg
9: TTA → Leu
10: CGC → Arg
11: CAA → Gln

Wait, that doesn't make sense. The HA tag should be a specific sequence. Let me compare.

The HA tag's amino acid sequence is YPYDHHQWL. Let me get the DNA sequence for that.

YPYDHHQWL → each amino acid is encoded by a codon.

Y is TAC or TAA (but TAA is stop, so TAC)
P is CCA or CCG
Y is TAC
D is GAT or GAC
H is CAT (but wait, H is histidine, which is CAT or CAC)
Wait, no, the HA tag is YPYDHHQWL.

Breaking it down:

Amino acids: Y (Tyr), P (Pro), Y (Tyr), D (Asp), H (His), H (His), Q (Gln), W (Trp), L (Leu).

So each of these corresponds to a codon.

Y → TAC or TAA. Since TAA is a stop, it's TAC.
P → CCA or CCG.
Y → TAC
D → GAT or GAC.
H → CAT or CAC (His)
H → CAT or CAC
Q → CAG or CGN (but CAG is Gln)
W → TGG (Trp)
L → TTA or TTG.

So the HA tag's DNA sequence would be:

TAC CCA TAC GAT CAT CAT CAG TGG TTA

Wait, let me line this up:

Y → TAC
P → CCA
Y → TAC
D → GAT
H → CAT
H → CAT
Q → CAG
W → TGG
L → TTA

So the HA tag's DNA sequence is TAC CCA TAC GAT CAT CAT CAG TGG TTA.

But wait, the HA tag is about 11 amino acids, so 33 nucleotides. Let me count: TAC (3) + CCA (3) + TAC (3) + GAT (3) + CAT (3) + CAT (3) + CAG (3) + TGG (3) + TTA (3) → that's 9 codons, 27 nucleotides. Wait, that's only 9 amino acids. But HA is 11. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing some.

Wait, the HA tag is actually 11 amino acids: YPYDHHQWL. Let me recount:

YP Y D H H Q W L → that's 9 letters? Wait, no, YPYDHHQWL is Y P Y D H H Q W L → that's 9, but I thought it's 11. Maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is longer.

Wait, the standard HA tag is indeed 11 amino acids: YPYDHHQWL, which is 11. Let me break it down into codons:

YP Y D H H Q W L.

Wait, that's 9, unless I'm missing two more. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the HA tag wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag starts with ATG, which is the start codon, and then the HA sequence.

But looking at the given DNA sequence, the first 33 bases (11 codons) is ATG followed by 10 more codons. So the HA tag is 11 amino acids, but the given sequence starts with ATG, which would make the first amino acid Met. But the HA tag doesn't start with Met. So that's a problem.

Ah! Because the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus, but the construct starts with ATG (Met), which is a start codon. So the Met would be the first amino acid, followed by the HA tag. But the HA tag doesn't have a Met. So the HA tag's DNA sequence should start with the TAC (Tyr), not ATG (Met). So the problem is that the HA tag is preceded by an extra Met.

Wait, so the construct's sequence starts with ATG (Met), then the HA tag. But the HA tag itself should not have a start codon. Instead, the Met should be the start of the entire protein, and the HA tag is the first part.

Wait, but the HA tag's amino acid sequence is YPYDHHQWL. So the DNA for the HA tag starts with TAC (Tyr), not ATG. So the construct as given starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT...

So the first codon is ATG (Met), then the HA tag starts with TAC (Tyr), which is correct. But wait, the HA tag is intended to be at the N-terminus, so the Met is the first amino acid, followed by the HA tag. However, in the given construct, after the HA tag (11 codons), there's another ATG (Met) at position 12.

So the sequence after the HA tag is:

... CAA ATG ACT CAG ...

So, the HA tag ends at CAA (Gln), then comes ATG (Met), ACT (Thr), etc.

So the problem is that after the HA tag, there's another ATG (Met) codon. That is, the GADD45G coding sequence starts with Met again.

But wait, the GADD45G gene's own start codon is probably not needed because the construct starts with the HA tag, followed by GADD45G in frame. So the initial ATG is the start, then the HA tag, then the GADD45G without its own start codon. But in the given construct, after the HA tag, there's another ATG (Met) codon. So the GADD45G sequence starts with Met again.

Wait, that's a problem. Because the initial Met is the start, and the next Met is within the ORF. But why is that a problem?

Wait, the presence of another Met after the HA tag might not cause a problem, unless it's causing the ribosome to terminate early. Let me think: the ribosome starts at the first Met, translates through the HA tag, then the GADD45G. The second Met is part of the coding sequence.

But in the provided DNA sequence, after the HA tag (position 33), comes ATG (Met) again. So the ribosome would have read 11 codons (HA tag) and then another Met. So, after the HA tag, the next codon is ATG. So the ribosome is now at the end of the HA tag, and the next codon is Met.

Wait, but the ribosome doesn't stop at Met; it's a start codon. So the ribosome continues reading. Unless there's a stop codon before that.

Wait, but in the given sequence, after the HA tag, there is another Met, but no stop codon in between. So the ribosome would proceed beyond the second Met.

Hmm, perhaps the issue is that the second Met is causing the ribosome to terminate early because the ribosome might have read through the HA tag, hit the second Met, and then stop, thinking it's the end of the ORF? But that doesn't make sense because Met is a start, not a stop.

Alternatively, perhaps the second Met is causing a frameshift, but no, the sequence is in the same frame.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the second Met is the start codon for an internal ribosome entry site, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the presence of two Met codons in a row is causing a problem in expression.

Wait, but the main issue is that the protein isn't being expressed. So perhaps the ribosome is terminating early because it encounters a stop codon somewhere.

Wait, let's look for any stop codons in the HA tag sequence. The HA tag is the first 11 codons after the initial ATG.

The first 11 codons after ATG are:

1: TAC (Tyr)
2: CCA (Pro)
3: TAC (Tyr)
4: GAT (Asp)
5: GTA (Val)
6: TCC (Ser)
7: AGA (Arg)
8: TTA (Leu)
9: CGC (Arg)
10: CAA (Gln)
11: ATG (Met)

Wait, the 11th codon is ATG (Met). That's a start codon. So the HA tag is supposed to be 11 amino acids, but the 11th codon is another Met. That can't be right because the HA tag should end before that.

Ah, here's the problem. The HA tag is designed to have 11 amino acids, but the provided sequence includes an extra Met at the end of the HA tag, making it 12 codons (including the initial ATG). Wait, no, the initial ATG is position 1, then the HA tag is 11 codons (positions 2-12). But the 12th codon is ATG (Met), which is the start codon for the GADD45G gene.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me clarify: the initial ATG is the start, then the HA tag is the next 11 codons (positions 2-12). The 12th codon is ATG, which is another start codon. So the HA tag is 11 amino acids, but the last codon is Met, which is the start of the next gene. So the mRNA after the HA tag is ATG ACT CAG..., meaning that the ribosome would read Met (start), then Thr, Gln, etc., which would be the GADD45G gene.

But why would this cause the GADD45G not to be expressed?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the HA tag's last codon is Met, which is a start codon. But the HA tag is supposed to be a short peptide, and the GADD45G gene should follow in frame. But the presence of two ATG codons in a row (the last codon of HA tag and the first of GADD45G) might cause issues. Alternatively, perhaps the ribosome stops after the first Met because it's a start codon, but that doesn't make sense because Met is not a stop.

Alternatively, maybe the HA tag's sequence is incorrect, leading to a frameshift or introducing a stop codon. Wait, but the HA tag's sequence in the given DNA is TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG. So the last codon is ATG (Met), which is a start codon, not a stop. So the HA tag ends with Met, which is not part of the HA sequence.

Wait, the HA tag's amino acids should be YPYDHHQWL, which are 11 amino acids. Let me translate the first 11 codons after the initial ATG:

1. TAC → Tyr
2. CCA → Pro
3. TAC → Tyr
4. GAT → Asp
5. GTA → Val
6. TCC → Ser
7. AGA → Arg
8. TTA → Leu
9. CGC → Arg
10. CAA → Gln
11. ATG → Met

Wait, that's 11 codons after the initial ATG. So the HA tag is 11 codons, which is 33 bases, ending with ATG (Met). But the HA tag should not include a Met at the end. The HA tag is YPYDHHQWL, which is 11 amino acids. Let me count the codons:

YP Y D H H Q W L → that's 9 letters, but perhaps I'm missing two more. Alternatively, maybe the HA tag is longer. Let me look it up. The HA tag is commonly 11 amino acids: YPYDHHQWL. Wait, that's 9 letters. Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is 10 amino acids. Let me check.

Looking it up, the HA tag is indeed 11 amino acids: YPYDHHQWL. Wait, that's 10 letters. Or maybe I'm recounting. Let me write it out:

Positions: 1 Y, 2 P, 3 Y, 4 D, 5 H, 6 H, 7 Q, 8 W, 9 L. So that's 9 amino acids. Wait, that doesn't add up. Maybe the HA tag is longer. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is 11 amino acids, including the initial Met. No, because the HA tag is added after the start codon.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag's DNA sequence in the construct ends with ATG (Met), which is a start codon. But the HA tag should end with a different codon. So the last codon of the HA tag is ATG (Met), which is incorrect. It should end with a different amino acid, say, Leu (TTA or TTG) or something else.

So the problem is that the HA tag's DNA sequence ends with ATG (Met), which is a start codon, causing the ribosome to terminate early. Wait, no, because the ribosome doesn't stop at Met. It starts at Met, but doesn't stop until a stop codon is encountered.

Wait, but if the HA tag ends with a Met, that's the 11th codon, and the next codon is ACT (Thr), which is part of GADD45G. So the ribosome would read through.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the HA tag's sequence is incorrect, leading to a frameshift or a premature stop codon elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's sequence includes a stop codon, causing the ribosome to terminate early.

Looking at the first 11 codons after ATG:

TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG

Wait, let's look for any stop codons in these. Stop codons are TAA, TAG, and TGA.

Looking at the codons:

TAC → Tyr
CCA → Pro
TAC → Tyr
GAT → Asp
GTA → Val
TCC → Ser
AGA → Arg
TTA → Leu
CGC → Arg
CAA → Gln
ATG → Met

None of these are stop codons. So the HA tag doesn't introduce a stop.

Wait, but the GADD45G sequence starts after the HA tag. Let's look into the GADD45G part.

After the HA tag, the sequence is:

ATG ACT CAG GCT GCT GTC GCC GCA GCG TCG GCG CAG CGT CAG GGC TGC TCA CTC GGC GCG TCT ACG AGT CAG CCG AAA GCT GAA GGC CTG GAA GGA GGC GAG GAC GAG GCG GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTA CGC TCA GAG AAC GAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC GTG GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC CGC GAG GAG GCG GGC GCG CC GGC GAC CTC GCA TGC TCG CTT GCA CGC CCG GAG TGA

Wait, the last codon is TGA, which is a stop codon.

Wait, the entire sequence ends with TGA. So the GADD45G coding sequence includes a stop codon at the end. So the full construct is: start codon, HA tag (11 codons), GADD45G coding sequence, ending with TGA.

So the mRNA would have the HA tag followed by GADD45G, ending with TGA. So the ribosome would translate the entire sequence, including the HA tag and GADD45G, until it hits the stop codon.

But in the provided DNA sequence, the last codon is TGA (stop). So the issue isn't a stop codon in the HA tag, but perhaps in the GADD45G sequence.

Wait, but the problem is that the protein isn't being expressed. So maybe the stop codon is in the wrong place.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct has a premature stop codon in the GADD45G sequence, causing the protein to be truncated and perhaps leading to degradation.

But looking at the DNA sequence, the last codon is TGA, which is a stop. So the entire ORF is correct, and the stop is at the end. So why isn't the protein expressed?

Wait, another possibility: the GADD45G coding sequence includes a stop codon earlier, causing the ribosome to terminate early. Let me scan the GADD45G part for any TAA, TAG, or TGA codons.

Looking through the GADD45G part:

...ATG ACT CAG GCT GCT GTC GCC GCA GCG TCG GCG CAG CGT CAG GGC TGC TCA CTC GGC GCG TCT ACG AGT CAG CCG AAA GCT GAA GGC CTG GAA GGA GGC GAG GAC GAG GCG GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTA CGC TCA GAG AAC GAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC GTG GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC CGC GAG GAG GCG GGC GCG CC GGC GAC CTC GCA TGC TCG CTT GCA CGC CCG GAG TGA...

Looking for TGA, TAG, or TAA:

- TGA appears at the end (last codon).
- Any others? Let's see:

Looking for TGA: occurs only at the end.

So no premature stop codons in GADD45G.

Hmm, perhaps the issue is with the presence of the HA tag. Maybe the HA tag is causing the protein to misfold or be targeted for degradation. But the problem is that the protein isn't being expressed, not that it's not functional.

Wait, another possibility: the presence of the HA tag introduces a stop codon in the mRNA. Let me check the DNA sequence for any in-frame stop codons in the HA tag.

The HA tag's codons are:

1. TAC (Tyr)
2. CCA (Pro)
3. TAC (Tyr)
4. GAT (Asp)
5. GTA (Val)
6. TCC (Ser)
7. AGA (Arg)
8. TTA (Leu)
9. CGC (Arg)
10. CAA (Gln)
11. ATG (Met)

None of these are stop codons. So the HA tag doesn't introduce a stop.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's sequence is incorrect, leading to a frameshift. But the given sequence seems in frame.

Another possibility: the presence of the HA tag and the subsequent GADD45G in the same ORF is causing a problem. Perhaps the ribosome is terminating early because of a rare codon or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct lacks a Kozak sequence, which is important for efficient initiation of translation in eukaryotic cells. The Kozak sequence is typically around the start codon and includes a consensus sequence like 'CCACCAUGG' or similar. Without this, the ribosome may not efficiently initiate translation, leading to low expression.

Looking at the start of the sequence: the initial ATG is preceded by TAC (Tyr), which is not ideal for a Kozak sequence. The Kozak sequence typically has a purine (A or G) at -3 position relative to the start codon. Here, the sequence is:

... TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ...

The start codon is ATG. The nucleotide before ATG is C (from CGC CAA ATG → the ATG is preceded by A). So the -3 position is A, which is good. The Kozak sequence is generally 'gccRCCaugG', where R is a purine. So the sequence before ATG is ... CAA ATG. The nucleotide before ATG is A (from CAA), which is a purine. So the Kozak sequence is present. So that's probably not the issue.

Hmm, perhaps the plasmid lacks a poly-A tail or other necessary elements for proper mRNA stability and translation. But the question states that the plasmid was transfected into CHO cells, and the issue is in the construct's sequence.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.

If the ribosome is terminating early, perhaps there's a stop codon in the HA tag or GADD45G sequence. But we saw that the HA tag doesn't have a stop codon, and the GADD45G ends correctly with TGA.

Option C: The lack of a linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain.

A linker sequence is usually between the tag and the target protein to avoid proteolytic cleavage. If the HA tag is directly fused without a linker, perhaps the proteasome or other proteases are cleaving the nascent chain, leading to degradation. But that would lead to lower levels of the protein, not necessarily inability to express.

Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse.

Wait, the construct is in CHO cells, not mouse cells. CHO cells are from Chinese hamster ovary, not mouse. So the tRNA issue would pertain to the host cells. The sequence has a TGA stop codon at the end. In mammalian cells, TGA is a stop codon. So if the host (CHO) cells have the tRNA for TGA, which they do, because all three stop codons are recognized by the same release factors.

Wait, but the option says 'mouse', which is irrelevant because the construct is in CHO cells. So D is probably not the issue.

So, back to the options. Let's think again.

Option A: The HA tag has a missense mutation.

If the HA tag's sequence is incorrect, it could lead to improper folding or aggregation, but the issue is that the protein isn't overexpressed. Maybe the mutation causes a stop codon? But earlier analysis shows no stop codons in the HA tag.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's DNA sequence has a mutation that introduces a stop codon in the mRNA. Let me re-examine the HA tag DNA sequence.

The provided HA tag DNA is: TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG.

Translating this to mRNA (replacing T with U): AUC CCA UAC GAA GUA UCC AGA UUA CGC CAU AUA G.

Wait, wait, no. Let me correct that. The DNA is the coding (sense) strand, so mRNA is complementary to the template strand. So each DNA base is matched as follows:

DNA strand (coding): 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG 3'

mRNA would be: 5' AUC UAC CCA UAC GAA GUA UCC AGA UUA CGC CAU AUA 3' ?

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me clarify: the DNA is given as the plus (coding) strand, so the mRNA is synthesized as the complementary strand. So each T in the DNA becomes U in the mRNA.

So the DNA sequence from 5' to 3' is:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ...

The mRNA would be complementary, but in the same 5' to 3' direction. So the mRNA is:

AUC UAC CCA UAC GAA GUA UCC AGA UUA CGC CAU AUA ...

Wait, that's confusing. Let me write it step by step.

The DNA coding strand is:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ... 3'

The template (non-coding) strand is complementary and antiparallel:

3' TAC AAC GGT ATT CAT CAC ATT GGA AAC GCG TTG GTT ... 5'

The mRNA is synthesized from the template strand, so it would be the same as the coding strand but with U instead of T:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ... 3' → no, wait, no. Wait, the mRNA is made from the template strand, which is the complementary of the coding strand. So the mRNA will be:

5' AUC UAC CCA UAC GAA GUA UCC AGA UUA CGC CAU AUA ... 3'

Wait, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to just look for any TAA, TAG, or TGA codons in the HA tag's mRNA.

Looking at the HA tag DNA sequence:

TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG.

Translating to mRNA (replace T with U):

AUC CCA UAC GAA GUA UCC AGA UUA CGC CAU AUG.

Wait, no, the mRNA is built from the template strand. Alternatively, perhaps I should just translate the DNA sequence as if it's the mRNA.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because the DNA is the coding strand, so the mRNA is the same as the coding DNA but with U instead of T.

So the HA tag mRNA would be:

AUC CCA UAC GAA GUA UCC AGA UUA CGC CAU AUA G.

Wait, but looking for stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA) in the HA tag's mRNA:

Looking at each triplet:

AUC → Met (start)
CCA → Pro
UAC → Tyr
GAA → Glu
GUA → Val
UCC → Ser
AGA → Arg
UUA → Leu
CGC → Arg
CAU → His
AUG → Met

Wait, the last codon of the HA tag is AUG (Met), which is a start codon. So in the mRNA, the HA tag ends with AUG, which is a start codon, not a stop. So no stop codons in the HA tag.

Hmm. If none of the options seem to fit, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Another angle: the presence of multiple Met codons in the HA tag and GADD45G might cause issues with translation efficiency. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the original problem states that the sequence starts with ATG, which is correct. The issue could be that the HA tag's coding sequence includes a frame that introduces a stop codon earlier. But earlier analysis shows no stop codons in the HA tag.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's DNA sequence is in the wrong reading frame. No, because the construct was designed to be in frame.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag's DNA sequence includes a stop codon when read in the wrong frame. But since the construct is designed correctly, that shouldn't be the case.

Another possibility: the HA tag's DNA sequence has a mutation that causes a stop codon in the mRNA. For example, suppose a base change in the DNA leads to a stop codon in the mRNA.

Looking at the HA tag's DNA sequence:

TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG.

If any of these codons have a mutation leading to a stop codon, that would cause the issue. For example, if one of the codons becomes UAA, UAG, or UGA.

Let me check each codon:

1. TAC → Tyr (no)
2. CCA → Pro (no)
3. TAC → Tyr (no)
4. GAT → Asp (no)
5. GTA → Val (no)
6. TCC → Ser (no)
7. AGA → Arg (no)
8. TTA → Leu (no)
9. CGC → Arg (no)
10. CAA → Gln (no)
11. ATG → Met (no)

So no stop codons in HA tag mRNA.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option B says the ribosome terminated early. If the ribosome is terminating early, perhaps there's a stop codon in the HA tag or GADD45G that I missed.

Wait, in the GADD45G part, let me check for any TGA codons before the end.

Looking through the GADD45G mRNA:

... ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTA CGC TCA GAG AAC GAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC GTG GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC CGC GAG GAG GCG GGC GCG CC GGC GAC CTC GCA TGC TCG CTT GCA CGC CCG GAG TGA ...

Looking for TGA, TAG, TAA:

The last codon is TGA. Are there any others?

Looking for TGA in the middle:

... CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC CGC GAG GAG GCG GGC GCG CC GGC GAC CTC GCA TGC TCG CTT GCA CGC CCG GAG TGA.

No, only the last codon is TGA.

So the only stop codon is at the end. So the ribosome should read through the entire construct.

Wait, but the issue is that the protein isn't expressed. So perhaps the construct is not being properly transcribed or translated.

Wait, perhaps the promoter used is not compatible with CHO cells. But the question states that the plasmid was transfected into CHO cells, and the issue is in the construct's sequence.

Another angle: the presence of the HA tag and the way it's cloned might introduce a frame shift or a cryptic promoter, but I don't see evidence of that.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's sequence includes a stop codon when read in the reverse complement, but that's irrelevant because the mRNA is read in the correct direction.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Let me try to think differently.

The problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed. The possible options are A to D.

Option C says the lack of a linker is causing proteolysis. If the HA tag is directly fused without a linker, perhaps the proteasome is degrading the protein. But that would lead to lower levels, not no expression.

Option B says the ribosome terminated early. If the ribosome stops early, the protein isn't made. But why would it stop early? Because of a stop codon. But the HA tag and GADD45G don't have any stop codons except at the end.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's sequence is longer than intended, causing a stop codon earlier.

Wait, the HA tag is 11 amino acids, but in the construct, the HA tag has 11 codons, including the last Met. So the HA tag ends with Met, which is the start codon for GADD45G. So the entire coding sequence is:

HA tag (11 codons) + GADD45G (from Met onwards).

But the HA tag ends with Met, which is a start codon, but the ribosome doesn't stop at Met. So why would that cause a problem?

Wait, perhaps the ribosome reads the Met as a start codon and initiates a new translation, leading to the HA tag and GADD45G being translated separately. But that's not likely because the ribosome is in the same frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of two Met codons in a row (the last codon of HA tag and the first of GADD45G) causes the ribosome to stall or terminate.

Wait, but Met is just another amino acid in the sequence. It's only a start codon when it's the first codon. Once the ribosome has started, subsequent Met codons are just part of the sequence.

Hmm. Maybe the issue is that the HA tag's sequence introduces a frame shift, but that would require an insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. The given sequence seems correct.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag's DNA sequence is in the wrong reading frame, leading to a premature stop codon. But I don't see any indication of that.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's sequence is incorrect, leading to the ribosome terminating early. But without a stop codon, that can't happen.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's DNA sequence is in the wrong orientation. For example, the HA tag is added in the reverse complement, causing the mRNA to have a stop codon. Let me check.

If the HA tag's DNA was inserted in the reverse direction, the mRNA would have the complementary sequence, which might introduce a stop codon. But the given sequence starts with ATG, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's DNA sequence includes a stop codon when read in the reverse direction. For example, if the DNA was inserted backwards, the mRNA would have a stop codon. But since the sequence starts with ATG, the HA tag is in the correct orientation.

I'm really stuck here. Let me think about each option again.

Option A: HA tag has a missense mutation. This would change the amino acid sequence, but not necessarily prevent expression. It would affect function, but the question is about expression.

Option B: Ribosome terminated early. If there's a stop codon before the end, but I can't find any.

Option C: Lack of linker causes proteolysis. Unlikely to prevent expression entirely.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA in mouse. But the construct is in CHO cells, which do have the tRNA for stop codons.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag's sequence includes a stop codon in the DNA, but in the mRNA, it's a stop. Let me look again.

The HA tag's DNA is TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG.

Translating to mRNA (same as DNA but T→U):

AUC CCA UAC GAA GUA UCC AGA UUA CGC CAU AUA.

Looking for stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA):

- UAA: not present.
- UAG: not present.
- UGA: present as part of CGA UGA? Wait, let's look:

The mRNA is AUC CCA UAC GAA GUA UCC AGA UUA CGC CAU AUA.

Looking for triplets:

AUC → Met
CCA → Pro
UAC → Tyr
GAA → Glu
GUA → Val
UCC → Ser
AGA → Arg
UUA → Leu
CGC → Arg
CAU → His
AUA → Met.

No stop codons. So option A is not the issue.

Hmm. Maybe the issue is that the HA tag's DNA sequence is missing a codon, leading to a frameshift. But the given sequence seems correct.

Wait, another thought: the HA tag is added at the N-terminus, but the construct might have a termination codon within the HA tag due to a mutation. But as we saw, there are no stop codons.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's DNA sequence has a mutation that causes a stop codon in the mRNA. For example, a T to A mutation in the DNA could change a codon to a stop. Let me check each codon:

1. TAC → Tyr (no)
2. CCA → Pro (no)
3. TAC → Tyr (no)
4. GAT → Asp (no)
5. GTA → Val (no)
6. TCC → Ser (no)
7. AGA → Arg (no)
8. TTA → Leu (no)
9. CGC → Arg (no)
10. CAA → Gln (no)
11. ATG → Met (no)

No stop codons.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag's DNA sequence is in the wrong reading frame, leading to a stop codon in the GADD45G sequence. But that seems unlikely.

Another angle: the presence of the HA tag introduces a cryptic polyadenylation signal, causing the mRNA to be prematurely polyadenylated and degraded. But that's more about mRNA stability, not translation.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's sequence includes a sequence that is recognized as a signal for degradation, but that's more about the protein being unstable, not not expressed.

Wait, the initial problem states that the sequence reads as provided. The user notices the reason. So the issue must be in the sequence.

Looking again, the HA tag's DNA ends with ATG (Met), which is a start codon. But the HA tag should end before that. So perhaps the HA tag's DNA sequence is one codon too long, including an extra Met at the end. This extra Met could cause the ribosome to terminate early if the HA tag's mRNA includes a stop codon.

Wait, no. The HA tag's mRNA ends with AUG (Met), which is a start codon, not a stop. So the ribosome doesn't stop there.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's sequence includes a stop codon when read in the opposite direction. But that's irrelevant because the mRNA is read in the correct direction.

I'm really not making progress. Let me think about the options again.

Option C: Lack of linker causing proteolysis. If the HA tag is directly attached to GADD45G without a linker, perhaps the proteasome degrades the protein because it's recognized as a fusion protein. But that would lead to lower levels, not no expression.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag's sequence includes a stop codon in the DNA, but that's unlikely because the DNA is the coding strand.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's DNA sequence includes a stop codon due to a mutation. For example, if one of the codons mutated into a stop codon. Let me check again.

No, as before, none of the codons are stop codons.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag's DNA is in the wrong orientation, leading to a reverse complement that includes a stop codon. Let me see.

If the HA tag's DNA was inserted in reverse, the mRNA would be complementary. So the DNA sequence would be the reverse complement, leading to a stop codon.

But the given sequence starts with ATG, so it's correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me consider the options again. The only option that makes sense is option C: lack of a linker causing proteolysis. But that's not about expression. Alternatively, option B: ribosome terminated early because of a stop codon. But I can't find any.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag's DNA sequence is incorrect, leading to a frameshift. For example, an extra base pair could shift the reading frame, introducing a stop codon. Let me count the number of bases in the HA tag.

The HA tag should be 11 codons ×3 =33 bases. The given HA tag sequence is:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG → that's 11 codons ×3=33 bases. So no frameshift.

Wait, another thought: the presence of the HA tag's sequence might include a stop codon in the DNA, but that's unlikely because the DNA is the coding strand.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's sequence includes a TGA stop codon in the DNA. Let me check.

Looking at the HA tag DNA:

TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG.

Looking for TGA in the DNA: the 10th codon is CAA (Gln), and the 11th is ATG (Met). No TGA in the HA tag.

Hmm. I'm really not finding the issue. Maybe I should conclude that the correct answer is option C: the lack of a linker is causing proteolysis.

But wait, the question says that the protein isn't being overexpressed. If the protein is being made but rapidly degraded, you'd see low levels, not none. But the problem states that the researchers couldn't overexpress the protein, implying it's not made at all.

So perhaps the issue is that the HA tag's DNA sequence is incorrect, leading to a stop codon in the HA tag's mRNA. Wait, but earlier analysis shows no stop codons.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's DNA sequence is missing a codon, leading to a frameshift and an early stop codon in GADD45G. Let me check.

The HA tag's DNA is 33 bases. If it's missing a base, the reading frame would shift, causing GADD45G to have a stop codon. But the given sequence seems complete.

Another thought: perhaps the HA tag's DNA sequence includes a stop codon when read in the wrong frame. For example, in the +1 or +2 frames. But the construct is designed in the correct frame, so that shouldn't matter.

I'm stuck. I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the options, the most likely issue is that the HA tag's sequence has a mutation leading to a stop codon. But in the given sequence, I can't find any.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's DNA sequence has a mutation that changes a codon to a stop. For example, the DNA sequence might have a T to A mutation in a codon, changing it to a stop.

Looking at the HA tag's DNA again:

1. TAC → Tyr
2. CCA → Pro
3. TAC → Tyr
4. GAT → Asp
5. GTA → Val
6. TCC → Ser
7. AGA → Arg
8. TTA → Leu
9. CGC → Arg
10. CAA → Gln
11. ATG → Met

If any of these codons have a mutation leading to a stop codon, that would be the issue. For example, if the 7th codon (AGA) mutated to TAG, that would be a stop codon.

But in the given sequence, it's AGA (Arg), not TAG. So no.

Alternatively, if the 10th codon (CAA) mutated to UAA, which is a stop. But in the DNA, it's CAA → mRNA is CAA → Gln. So no.

Hmm. I'm really not finding the issue. I'll have to go with the option that makes the most sense. The only option that fits is option A: the HA tag has a missense mutation. But I can't find any stop codon.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's sequence is correct, but the GADD45G sequence has a stop codon early on. Let me look again.

Looking at the GADD45G part:

After the HA tag, the sequence is:

ATG ACT CAG GCT GCT GTC GCC GCA GCG TCG GCG CAG CGT CAG GGC TGC TCA CTC GGC GCG TCT ACG AGT CAG CCG AAA GCT GAA GGC CTG GAA GGA GGC GAG GAC GAG GCG GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTA CGC TCA GAG AAC GAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC GTG GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC CGC GAG GAG GCG GGC GCG CC GGC GAC CTC GCA TGC TCG CTT GCA CGC CCG GAG TGA.

Looking for TGA, TAG, TAA:

Only the last codon is TGA. So no early stop.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the GADD45G sequence includes a stop codon before the end due to a mutation. But I don't see any.

Another thought: perhaps the HA tag's DNA sequence has a mutation that causes a stop codon in the mRNA. For example, if the DNA has a T to C mutation in a codon, changing it to a stop codon.

Looking at each codon:

1. TAC → Tyr (no)
2. CCA → Pro (no)
3. TAC → Tyr (no)
4. GAT → Asp (no)
5. GTA → Val (no)
6. TCC → Ser (no)
7. AGA → Arg (no)
8. TTA → Leu (no)
9. CGC → Arg (no)
10. CAA → Gln (no)
11. ATG → Met (no)

No mutations leading to stop codons.

I'm really stuck. I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is option C: the lack of a linker is triggering proteolysis. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag's DNA sequence includes a stop codon in the mRNA when read in the reverse direction. But that's not the case.

Wait, another thought: the HA tag's DNA sequence includes an in-frame stop codon due to a mutation. For example, a T to A mutation in the 7th codon (AGA → AGA is still Arg), so no.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's DNA sequence is correct, but the GADD45G's start codon is missing, causing the ribosome to terminate early. But the GADD45G starts with ATG, so that's present.

I think I have to give up and choose the option that best fits. Based on the given sequence, the issue is that the HA tag's sequence includes another start codon, which might cause the ribosome to terminate early. But that's not the case because Met is not a stop codon.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag's sequence doesn't include a stop codon, but the GADD45G does. But the GADD45G ends with TGA.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. The most plausible answer seems to be option C: the lack of a linker is causing proteolysis. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, option B: the ribosome terminated early due to a stop codon, but I can't find any.

Wait, another angle: the presence of the HA tag and the start codon after it might cause the ribosome to terminate because the ribosome can't read through two start codons. But that's not a known mechanism.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag's DNA sequence includes a stop codon when read in the reverse direction, but that's irrelevant.

I think I'm stuck. I'll have to make a guess. The correct answer is likely option C: the lack of a linker is causing proteolysis. But I'm not entirely sure.


The question involves identifying why the GADD45G protein is not being overexpressed in a transgenic mouse model. The construct includes a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of the GADD45G coding sequence. The provided DNA sequence starts with the ATG start codon, followed by the HA tag (11 codons), and then the GADD45G coding sequence, which ends with the stop codon TGA. The issue lies in the construct's sequence, and the possible causes are analyzed based on the options provided.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation**  
   The HA tag's DNA sequence was examined for any mutations that might alter its amino acid sequence. None of the codons in the HA tag correspond to stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA), and the sequence appears intact. A missense mutation would not prevent protein expression but could affect its function. Since the issue is lack of expression, this option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early**  
   The ribosome translates mRNA until it encounters a stop codon. The HA tag and GADD45G coding sequence were scanned for premature stop codons. The HA tag does not contain any stop codons, and the only stop codon in the construct is the final TGA at the end of the GADD45G sequence. Without an early stop codon, this option does not explain the lack of expression.

3. **Option C: The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain**  
   A linker sequence between the HA tag and GADD45G could prevent proteolytic cleavage. If the protein is being degraded due to a lack of a linker, it would result in lower levels of the protein rather than a complete absence of expression. While proteolysis could reduce protein levels, it does not fully explain the inability to overexpress the protein.

4. **Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse**  
   This option is irrelevant because the construct is being expressed in CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells, not mouse cells. CHO cells recognize all standard stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA), so this is not the cause of the issue.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible explanation is **Option C**, as the lack of a linker sequence could lead to proteolysis, reducing the stability of the nascent protein. However, this would typically result in lower levels of protein rather than a complete lack of expression. Despite this limitation, none of the other options better explain the observed issue.

Answer: C
