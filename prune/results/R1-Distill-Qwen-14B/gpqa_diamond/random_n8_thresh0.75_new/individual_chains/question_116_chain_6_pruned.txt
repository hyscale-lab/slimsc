Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's take it step by step. The question is about a series of reactions leading to the identification of a compound D. 

First, I need to figure out what compound A is based on the NMR data. The proton NMR shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells me about neighboring protons. A triplet usually means each proton is next to two others (n+1 where n=2). The quartet would mean each proton is next to three others (n=3).

Looking at the integration, 6H and 4H. That suggests groups of equivalent protons. The triplet at 0.9 ppm is likely from a CH2CH3 group, like in an ethyl group, but wait, wait. 6H would mean three CH2 groups? Or maybe two CH2CH3 groups? Because each CH2CH3 has 3H in the triplet. If there are two of them, that's 6H. So maybe the structure is something like (CH2CH3)2, like maybe a diethyl group attached to something.

Wait, but wait. If each triplet is 3H, and there are 6H, that would be two CH2CH3 groups. But the quartet is 4H, which is maybe a CH2CH2 group adjacent to another CH2. Wait, no. Let me think. The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4Hâ€”so that's 4H in a quartet. A quartet suggests each of these protons is adjacent to three equivalent protons. So maybe a CH2 next to a CH3? No, because a CH2 next to a CH3 would be a triplet. Hmm. Wait, maybe it's a CH2 connected to another CH2, which is connected to a CH3. So like a CH2CH2CH3 structure. But wait, how does that fit with the quartet?

Alternatively, maybe the quartet is from a CH2 that's adjacent to a CH3 and another CH2. Let me think of an ethyl group. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) would be two ethyl groups (each CH2CH3 gives a triplet, and two of them make 6H). The quartet (4H) at 1.3 ppm would be the CH2 groups
