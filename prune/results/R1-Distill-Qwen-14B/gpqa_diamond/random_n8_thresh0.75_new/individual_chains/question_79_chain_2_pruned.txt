Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its reaction and the resulting NMR spectra. Let's see.

First, the problem says that compound X, which is C11H12O, reacts with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given, and I need to figure out which option (A-D) is correct.

Wait, what's 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane? Oh right, that's a base, I think. It's often used in epoxide ring-opening reactions. So, probably, compound X is an epoxide because this base might open it, but wait, the product's NMR is given. Hmm, maybe the reaction is ring-opening, or maybe it's some other reaction. Alternatively, if X is an epoxide, reacting with a base might cause some rearrangement, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination or something else. Hmm.

So, the product's NMR data is given. Let me look at the 1H NMR first.

1H NMR:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s)
- δ 2.31 (3H, s)
- δ 6.75 (1H, d)
- δ 7.08 (2H, d)
- δ 7.68 (1H, d)
- δ 7.71 (2H, d)

Wait, so there are two singlets integrating to 3H each. That suggests two methyl groups. The downfield shifts are in the aromatic region, so maybe substituted benzene rings. The doublets and so on suggest coupling between different protons.

Looking at the 13C NMR:

- 21.3 (1C, s) → probably a methyl group attached to something electronegative, maybe an oxygen?
Wait, wait, no. Wait, another thought: the 21.3 and 28.4 are both single carbons as singlets. 21.3 is a low chemical shift for a carbon, so maybe a methyl attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen. Or maybe a carbonyl group? No, because carbonyl carbons are higher, like around 170-220 maybe. Wait, 21.3 is more like a regular CH3. Wait, maybe in an epoxide or a ring structure. Hmm. 28.4 is another single carbon. Maybe a CH2 group or another methyl?

Wait, let me think about the 13C data. There are 9 signals, which suggests 9 distinct carbons. Let's see:

Looking at the 13C NMR data:

- 21.3 (s) → maybe a CH3 connected to an electronegative atom, like an epoxide oxygen.

Wait, but in epoxides, the carbons are usually around 40-50 ppm. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the structure more.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an epoxide that has opened up, but I'm not sure. Wait, the reaction is between X and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. That's a strong, bulky base. Epoxides, when treated with such bases, typically undergo ring-opening reactions, especially under basic conditions. So maybe compound X is an epoxide, and the reaction opens it. But in the product, perhaps it's a diol or something else.

But wait, the product's NMR doesn't show any OH protons, which would be broad signals around 1-5 ppm. So perhaps the ring didn't open, or it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is not a ring-opening but something else, like a rearrangement. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction could be an elimination, perhaps forming a double bond. But without knowing the structure of X, it's hard to say.

But perhaps I should focus on the NMR data of the product. Let me try to interpret the product's structure from the NMR.

So, the 1H NMR:
- Two singlets at around 2.28 and 2.31 ppm, each integrating to 3H. That's two methyl groups, probably both as singlets, so they're each attached to a non-protonated carbon. Maybe each is attached to a carbonyl or an aromatic ring with no adjacent protons.

Looking at aromatic protons: There are signals at 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). Hmm.

Wait, let me try to see if this fits a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para-substituted rings, the protons are usually as two doublets. Let me think: for a para-substituted benzene, the protons are typically split into two doublets, each integrating to 2H. For example, in a para-substituted styrene, the aromatic protons would be two doublets. But in this case, the 1H NMR shows four signals in the aromatic region: 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). That seems a bit more complex.

Wait, perhaps it's a para-disubstituted benzene with more substituents. Alternatively, maybe it's a triplet of doublets or something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there are two different substituents on the benzene ring.

Wait
