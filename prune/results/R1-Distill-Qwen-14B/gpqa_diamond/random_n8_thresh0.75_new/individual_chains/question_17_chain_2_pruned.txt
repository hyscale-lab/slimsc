Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The given data is 0.02 M concentration of the complex, the temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Alright, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant (K) tells us how stable the complex is. Since K is so large (5e10), that means the complex is very stable, so most of the EDTA and Ca²+ should be tied up in the complex.

Wait, the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution. So that means the ratio of Ca²+ to EDTA is 1:1, right? Because the formula for the complex would be something like CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA^4−. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So [CaY²−] is 0.02 M.

But we need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions. Because in solution, not all of the CaY²− dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA. But given the high K, very little dissociation should happen.

So the dissociation reaction would be: CaY²− ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4−. 

The formation constant K is given, which for the formation reaction Ca²+ + Y^4− ↔ CaY²− is K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]). 

Wait, but in this solution, we have the complex at 0.02 M. We can assume that the free Ca²+ and free Y^4− concentrations are equal, because each complex releases one Ca²+ and one Y^4−. So [Ca²+] = [Y^4−] = x.

So the expression for K is K = [CaY²−]/( [Ca²+][Y^4−] ) = 0.02 / (x^2). Because [CaY²−] is 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [Y^4−] are both x.

So K = 5e10 = (0.02) / (x²). Solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 2e-3 / 5e10? Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So x² = (2e-2) / (5e10) = 2/(5e12) → 0.4e-12. So x = sqrt(0.4e-12) → sqrt(4e-13) because 0.4 is 4e-1. Hmm.

Wait, let's compute that. 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12. So x squared is 0.4e-12, so x is sqrt(0.4e-12) = sqrt(4e-13) → 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is (2e-6.5)^2. Hmm, maybe I should compute it numerically.

Alternatively, 0.4e-12 is 4e-13. The square root of 4e-13 is 2e-6.5. Wait, 2e-6.5 is the same as 2 * 1e-6.5. 1e-6 is 1e-6, and 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. So 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about
