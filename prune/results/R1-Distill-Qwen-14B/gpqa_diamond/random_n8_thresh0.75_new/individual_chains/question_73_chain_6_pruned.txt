Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, their relativistic effects become significant. So, I'll need to use some formulas from special relativity to solve this.

The problem states: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, the question has two parts: relative speed and total energy. So, I should probably tackle each part separately.

First, the relative speed. Oh right, in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. I remember the formula for relative velocity. The formula for the relative speed of two objects moving at velocities u and v relative to a third frame is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). But wait, maybe I should check the exact formula. Oh, right, when you have two objects moving in the same direction, say u and v, where u is the speed of one object relative to the other, I think it's (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)).

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. The correct formula for the relative velocity between two objects moving at speeds u and v in the same frame is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). But wait, I think I got it wrong. Let me visualize. Suppose object A is moving at u, and object B at v, both in the same direction. So from the perspective of A, what is B's speed? It should be (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), but wait, that doesn't make sense dimensionally. No, wait, the formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/(c²)) when they approach each other, but when moving in the same direction, it's (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), but I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think I should look up the correct formula. Oh wait, I can't look it up, but I'll try to derive it. The formula for adding velocities in special relativity is such that if you have two velocities u and v in the same direction, the relative velocity is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c^2)).

Wait, but wait, I think it's the other way around. Suppose astronaut A is moving at u
