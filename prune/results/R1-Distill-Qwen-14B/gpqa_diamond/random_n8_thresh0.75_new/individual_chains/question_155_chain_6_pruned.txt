Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty in the Pz operator, ΔPz, given that the system is in an eigenstate of Px with a specific eigenvalue. The operator matrices for Px, Py, and Pz are given, and the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz.

Wait, so the state of the system is a column vector given as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty of an observable is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(<A²> - <A>²), where A is the operator. So I need to compute the expectation values of Pz and Pz squared for this state.

First, let's note down the matrix form of Pz. From the problem:

Pz matrix is:
[ ℏ   0    0  ]
[ 0   0    0  ]
[ 0   0  -ℏ ]

Wait, no, wait. Let me check the given description again. The third row is (0,0,-ℏ), so the matrix is diagonal with elements ℏ, 0, -ℏ. So Pz has eigenvalues ℏ, 0, -ℏ for the respective basis vectors.

The state vector is given as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2) as a column. Let me make sure to represent this correctly. So, in vector form, it's:

ψ = [ -1/2 ]
      [ 1/√2 ]
      [ -1/2 ]

Now, since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz, the state is already expressed in the eigenbasis of Pz. Wait, that's an important point. Because if the state is written in the eigenbasis of Pz, then the expectation value of Pz is just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the state is in the basis of Pz's eigenvectors, so each component of ψ corresponds to an eigenstate of Pz. So, the components squared give the probabilities of measuring the corresponding eigenvalue.

But wait, no, wait. Let me clarify: The basis is the eigenbasis of Pz, so each basis vector |k> corresponds to an eigenvalue Pz_k
