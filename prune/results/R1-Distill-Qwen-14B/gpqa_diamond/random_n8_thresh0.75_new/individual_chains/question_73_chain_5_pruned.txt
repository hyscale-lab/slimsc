Okay, so I have this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to work through it.

Alright, the problem says the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. So, I guess I need to find two things: the relative speed (v_rel) and the total energy (E).

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction because of the velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula for adding velocities in special relativity is (u + v)/(1 + uv/c²). But wait, actually, in this case, since both are moving in the same direction, the relative velocity would be (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), right? Or wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me think: if object A is moving at u and object B is moving at v in the same direction, the relative speed of A from B's frame is (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²). Because from B's perspective, A is moving at (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

So here, astronaut A is 2m moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is 3m moving at 0.5c. So the relative speed of A with respect to B would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c)(0.5
