Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this science question. Let me read through it again and break it down step by step.

So, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. Someone created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector to study their interaction. The vector has the ligand's ORF at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor's ORF at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor has an IRES upstream. There are stop cassettes in between each ORF and fluorescent tag.

They transfected this into primary astrocyte cultures and used antibodies against the proteins for Western blot. The blot shows signals proportional to actin, meaning the loading control is working. Then they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background and crossed it with SOX10-Cre mice. After the offspring were born, they looked for green fluorescence under a confocal but didn't see any.

So the question is why there's no green signal. The options are A to D.

Hmm. Let me think about the vector setup. The vector is bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs in one transcript. The first ORF (ligand) is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. Then, the ligand is fused to mCherry. The second ORF (receptor) is after an IRES, which allows internal ribosome entry, so the receptor can be translated from the same mRNA. The receptor is fused to eGFP, but it's under a separate start site due to the IRES.

Wait, but the stop cassettes are between ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP. The ligand side has a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and the receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272. So in the vector, the ligand is first, then the stop, but if Cre is present, it would excise the stop cassette, allowing the receptor to be expressed.

Wait, but how does the Cre work here? The vector is probably a loxP and lox2272 sites flanking the stops. Cre would recognize these specific sites. But wait, I think loxP and lox2272 are different recognition sites. loxP is recognized by Cre, while lox2272 is recognized by another recombinase, maybe different Cre variants or another enzyme.

Wait, no, I think lox2272 is a variant of the loxP site that is only recognized by certain Cre variants, perhaps with higher specificity. So the idea is that in the vector, the ligand ORF is followed by a loxP-stop, and the receptor ORF is preceded by a lox2272-stop.

So when Cre is present, it would recombine the lox sites. But wait, for the ligand, if the Cre can recognize loxP, then in the presence of Cre, the stop cassette would be excised. Similarly, for the receptor, the lox2272 is a different site, perhaps requiring a different Cre variant or additional conditions.

Wait, but in the mouse model, they have the construct in the genome. Then
