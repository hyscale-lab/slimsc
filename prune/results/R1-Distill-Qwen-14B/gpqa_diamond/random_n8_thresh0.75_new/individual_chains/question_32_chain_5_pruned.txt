Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, let's see. The nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is Lithium. So, Lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6, right? Because protons plus neutrons equal the isotope number. So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So the mass number A is 6. Now, I need to find the energy of the collider. Since it's a heavy ion collider, the ions are moving at relativistic speeds, so I think I should use the relativistic energy equations. 

The speed v is given as 0.96c. So I need to calculate the total energy of the nucleus, which is gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, right? Gamma equals 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared).

Wait, let me get that right. So v is 0.96c. Plugging that into gamma: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). Let me calculate that. 

First, compute (0.96)^2. 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28
