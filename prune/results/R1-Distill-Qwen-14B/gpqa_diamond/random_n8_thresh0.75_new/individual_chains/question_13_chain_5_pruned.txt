Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the problem starts with a methanol solution of (R)-(+)-Limonene. Limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, right? I remember that limonene has a structure with a bicyclic system, maybe a cyclohexene ring. Wait, no, limonene is actually a cyclic monoterpene with a specific configuration. (R)-(+)-Limonene is the more common form, found in citrus peels.

The first step is that this solution is stirred with Pd/C under hydrogen. Oh, right! That's a hydrogenation reaction. So, Pd/C is a catalyst for hydrogenation. Since it's a hydrogen atmosphere, the reaction is probably adding hydrogen across a double bond. Limonene has a double bond in its structure, so this reaction would hydrogenate that double bond.

But wait, how many equivalents of hydrogen are used? The question says one equivalent is consumed. So, the reaction stops after adding one H2 molecule. Let me think about limonene's structure. Limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene, I think. Its structure is something like a cyclohexene ring with a methyl group and another substituent. Wait, no, limonene is actually a bicyclic monoterpene with a structure that includes a cyclohexene ring and a methyl group attached. Specifically, I think it's a five-membered ring fused to a six-membered ring with a double bond in the six-membered ring.

So when you hydrogenate it, the double bond would be saturated. So, the product after hydrogenation (product 1) would be the fully hydrogenated version of limonene. So limonene has a structure like (R)-configuration, and after hydrogenating the double bond, it becomes a cyclohexane derivative.

Wait, but I should confirm limonene's structure. Limonene is (R)-(+)-5-methyl-2-(1-methylethenyl)bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene. Or wait, maybe it's (R)-5-methyl-2-(prop-1-en-2-yl)bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. Hmm, I might be mixing up the exact structure, but the key point is that hydrogenation will add hydrogen across the double bond, turning it into a single bond.

So product 1 is the hydrogenated limonene, which would be bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane with some substituents. Wait, that's not a cyclohexane but a norbornane structure. Oh right, because limonene is a norbornene derivative. So, product 1 would be norbornane with methyl groups and other substituents.

Wait, the initial limonene molecule is (R)-configuration. When you hydrogenate the double bond, the stereochemistry might change. But since the hydrogenation adds two hydrogens across the double bond, the configuration at that carbon might influence the product. Hmm, but wait, in the case of hydrogenation using H2 and Pd/C, it's a catalytic hydrogenation, which typically adds hydrogen in a syn fashion. So if the double bond was in a certain configuration, the resulting single bond would have the hydrogens added on the same face.
