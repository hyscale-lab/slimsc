Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question again.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. The problem gives me some elemental abundances using the EW method, assuming LTE. The given values are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. 

I also have the Sun's photospheric composition: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Oh, right, the notation is that the value is 12 plus the log of the ratio. So for the Sun, [Fe/H] would be the log of (nFe/nH) equals 7.5 -12? Wait no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the notation is [X/H] = log10(nX/nH) - log10(nX/nH)_sun. Or is it the other way around? Hmm, I think I need to clarify that.

Wait, the standard notation is that [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So [X/Y] = log(nX/nY in star) - log(nX/nY in sun). So if [Fe/H]_1 is 0, that means the ratio of Fe to H in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. Same for [Mg/H]_2 =0.

Wait, the problem says [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. So that means the abundance of Fe relative to H in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. Because when [Fe/H] is zero, it's solar. Same for [Mg/H]_2 =0; so in Star_2, the Mg/H ratio is solar.

But what about [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3? That means the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times higher than in the Sun. Similarly, [Mg/Si]_2 =
