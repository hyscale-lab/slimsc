Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. So the question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue.

First, let me understand the setup. The operators P_x, P_y, and P_z are given in matrix form. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So, the system is in a state that's an eigenstate of P_x, specifically the one with eigenvalue -ℏ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2).

Hmm, the uncertainty in P_z, ΔP_z, is calculated using the standard formula from quantum mechanics: ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

Wait, but the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. So does that mean that ⟨P_z⟩ is zero? Because in eigenstates of one operator, the expectation of another (non-commuting) operator can be tricky. But wait, no, not necessarily zero, but it depends on the state.

Wait, no, the state is given, so maybe I should just compute the expectation values directly.

So the state is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

First, let's compute ⟨P_z⟩. That's ψ† P_z ψ.

The matrix P_z is given as:
[ ℏ   0   0 ]
[ 0   0   0 ]
[ 0   0  -ℏ ]

So to compute ⟨P_z⟩, I'll multiply the state vector (as a row) with P_z and then with the conjugate of the state vector.

Wait, the state vector given is real, so the conjugate is the same. So ψ is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

So let's do the matrix multiplication step by step.

Compute P_z ψ:

First row of P_z times ψ: ℏ*(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + 0*(-1/2) = -ℏ/2.

Second row: 0*(each component) → 0
