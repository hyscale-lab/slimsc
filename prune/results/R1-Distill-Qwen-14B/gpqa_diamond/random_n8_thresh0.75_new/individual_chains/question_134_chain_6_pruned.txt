Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions are exothermic, so the enthalpy should be negative. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details, so let me think this through.

The problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I need to figure out how they react when mixed. Oh right, when you mix acids and bases, they neutralize each other to form water and a salt. But I need to consider the stoichiometry here.

First, I should probably write down the reactions. Let's see, HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but wait, sulfuric acid is diprotic. Does that mean each mole releases two H+ ions? Or does it depend on the reaction? Oh wait, in neutralization, the first dissociation is complete, but the second might not be. Wait, no, in a strong acid, both H+ ions are released. So H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions. So when these solutions are mixed, the H+ ions from the acids will react with OH- ions from the base.

The next step is to calculate the moles of H+ and OH- ions. Because the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, and the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ reacting. But wait, the problem might be asking for the total enthalpy change for the reaction, not per mole. So I'll need to find which of the H+ or OH- is the limiting reagent.

Let me calculate the moles for each solution.

Starting with HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is a monoprotic acid, each mole gives one H+ ion. So HCl contributes 0.1 mol H+.

Next, H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. Molarity is 0.3 M. Moles = 0
