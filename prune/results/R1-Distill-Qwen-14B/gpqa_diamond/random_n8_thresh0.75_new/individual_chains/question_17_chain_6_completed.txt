Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts yet. But I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex? The pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds to metal ions like calcium. The Ca-EDTA complex is a stable complex, which is why it has a high formation constant (K). I think K is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex.

So, the reaction I'm picturing is something like: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The K for this reaction should be given by K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). 

But wait, in the solution, I have a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But when this complex dissociates, it should release Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions into the solution, right?

Wait, but if the complex is already formed, maybe it's more about the dissociation. The question is asking for [Ca²+], so I need to find how much of the complex dissociates.

Let me think of the dissociation equilibrium. The complex dissociates as: CaEDTA^2- ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-. The formation constant K is [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). 

But wait, when the complex dissociates, the reverse of the formation reaction occurs. So, the K for the dissociation (Kd) would be 1/K_formation. So, Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. 

Wait, yes, because K for formation is Kf = [complex]/([M][L]), so Kd = 1/Kf. So if the formation K is 5e10, the dissociation K is 2e-11.

Now, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote the change as x. So, when the complex dissociates, it produces x concentration of Ca²+ and x concentration of EDTA^4-.

So the equilibrium concentrations would be:
[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since Kd is small, x is very small compared to 0.02)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x

Putting this into the dissociation expression:
Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA]/[CaEDTA] = (x)(x)/(0.02) = x² / 0.02

So, Kd = 2e-11 = x² / 0.02 → x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5, wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, no. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) → 2 * (1e-6.5) → 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7 (since 1e-7 is 0.0000001, 1e-6 is 0.000001, so 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7). So 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7. 

So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That matches.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I set up the equation correctly? The Kd is 2e-11, yes. So x^2/(0.02) = 2e-11 → x^2 = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13 → sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is 6.32e-7. Yes. 

So the concentration of Ca²+ is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, we start by considering the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_f \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f}
\]

Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

Let the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex be 0.02 M. At equilibrium, the dissociation of the complex produces \( x \) M of both \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \). The equilibrium concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 - x \approx 0.02 \quad \text{(since \( K_d \) is small, \( x \) is negligible compared to 0.02)}
\]
\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x
\]

Substituting these into the dissociation expression:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

\[
2 \times 10^{-11} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = 0.02 \times 2 \times 10^{-11} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which matches option C.

Answer: C
