Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says a chemist did two reactions with two different reducing agents on two unknown compounds. The products are both (4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one) but one is R configuration and the other is S. The question is about finding the correct starting materials A and B from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that when you reduce a ketone, you get an alcohol. But wait, in this case, the product is a tetrahydropyranone. Oh, wait, tetrahydropyran is like a cyclic ether, right? So maybe the starting material is an ester or some kind of protected carbonyl compound.

Wait, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That structure would have a five-membered ring, I think. Let me draw this out. So the ring is six-membered because pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. Oh wait, no, pyran is a six-membered ring but in the hydrogenated form like tetrahydropyran, it has four single bonds and one oxygen. So the structure would be like an oxane ring (like a six-membered ring with one oxygen), with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4.

Wait, the product is 4-ethyl, so the substituent is at the fourth position of the ring. But how does that form from a starting material?

I think the product is formed via a reduction of a cyclic ketone. But wait, the starting materials must have been something like a cyclic ester or some kind of acetal. Oh wait, wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with an adjacent protecting group, maybe an acetal or something where the reducing agent would open it up.

Wait, another thought: maybe the starting materials are esters or acids with certain protecting groups. Because when using a reducing agent like LiBH4 or BH3, they might be acting on a carbonyl group.

Wait, the product has a ketone (since it's a pyranone). So maybe the starting material has a carbonyl group that, upon reduction, forms a secondary alcohol. But wait, no, the product is a ketone, so maybe the starting material was an ester or another group that upon reduction forms
