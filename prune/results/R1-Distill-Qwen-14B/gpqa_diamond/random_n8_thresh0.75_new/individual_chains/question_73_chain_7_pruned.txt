Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, let me read it again.

The problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Alright, I remember that when dealing with velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract them normally because of the relativistic effects. I think the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is needed here. Let me recall that formula. Oh right, if an object has velocity u in one frame and another object has velocity v in the same frame, then the relative velocity w from the first object's perspective is (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think the correct formula is (v - u)/(1 - (vu)/(c²)). Or wait, is it (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/(c²))? Because if u and v are both in the same direction, then the relative speed formula should account for how their speeds add up relativistically.

Wait, so if astronaut 1 is at speed u = 0.6c, and astronaut 2 is at speed v = 0.5c in the same direction, then from astronaut 1's perspective, the speed of astronaut 2 should be (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Wait, because astronaut 2 is moving slower than astronaut 1 from the stationary frame, so relative to astronaut 1, astronaut 2 is moving backward? No, wait. Wait, no, wait. If both are moving in the same direction, then from astronaut 1's frame, astronaut 2 is moving slower. So the relative speed would be (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Wait, no, wait, wait. Let me think. Let me think: the formula for the relative velocity from the perspective of the first object is (v - u)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). But I should make sure.

Alternatively, I think the formula is (u' = (v - u) / (1 - (uv)/(c²)) ), where u' is the velocity of the second object as seen from the first object's frame. So in this case, u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c. So u' would
