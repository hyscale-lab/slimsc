Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question says: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there, excluding ethene? The options are A) 4, B) 8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Olefin metathesis is a reaction where the catalyst breaks and reforms carbon-carbon double bonds. Grubbs is specifically a transition metal catalyst, typically used for ring-closing metathesis and other olefin metathesis reactions.

The starting material here is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. So the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)H-CH₂CH3? Or wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH2CH3? No, wait, wait. Let's draw it out. Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But wait, wait, the formula for 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH₂. Wait, no, pent has five carbons. So pent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH3? No, wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3? Wait, no, no, wait. Let me think again. The formula for pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But with a 3-methyl substituent. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH2? Wait, that's not possible because in pentene, the chain is five carbons. Let's number from the double bond. So 1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? Or wait, no. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm.

Wait, pent means five carbons. The structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, because that would be four carbons after the double bond. Wait, maybe I should count the carbons. Wait, the
