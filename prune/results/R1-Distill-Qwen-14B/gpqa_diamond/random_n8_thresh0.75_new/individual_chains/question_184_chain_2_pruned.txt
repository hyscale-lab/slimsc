Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound starting from benzene. The target compound is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, I need to understand the structure. The benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering them as 1, 2, 3 would be adjacent positions. Let me visualize the structure.

Position numbering: Let's say position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, actually, waitâ€”since benzene is a ring, the numbering could vary, but the substituents are in the order of 1, 2, 3. Oh wait, the actual numbering might be more about the relative positions. So the substituents are meta to each other or ortho?

Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So substituents are at positions 1, 2, 3 on the benzene ring. That's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. So they're all adjacent? So positions 1: ethoxy, 2: tert-butyl, 3: nitro.

Wait, but I think I might have gotten the substituents wrong. Let me think again. The name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the substituents are ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. So their positions are 1, 2, 3 around the ring. So that's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring, with substituents in adjacent positions.

So the plan is to attach ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups in the correct positions on the benzene ring. Now, the question is about the order of reactions.

I remember that when multiple substituents are added to benzene, the order in which they are introduced matters because directing effects come into play. Each substituent can direct incoming electrophiles to certain
