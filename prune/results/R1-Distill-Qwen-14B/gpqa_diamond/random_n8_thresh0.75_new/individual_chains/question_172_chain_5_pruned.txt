Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, so the excitation here refers to their energy levels. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Hmm, I remember that the excitation of electrons in atoms relates to their energy states, and this probably ties into the thermal energy of the stars.

Since the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), I think that means we can use the Boltzmann distribution to model the population of these energy levels. The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels to the temperature of the system.

The Boltzmann factor, as I recall, is something like the ratio of the number of particles in higher energy states to lower ones. The formula I remember is (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and E_i and E_j are the energies of the two states.

In this problem, the excited state must be the higher energy level. Let's denote the excited state as level i and the lower state as level j. So the ratio n_i/n_j would be proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels.

The problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. Wait, does that mean that for each atom, the excitation is higher, or that the number of excited atoms is higher? Since the question talks about the atoms being "twice as excited in a specific energy level," I think it refers to the population ratio. So, for star_1, the ratio of n_i to n_j is 2, and for star_2, it's 1. Wait, no. Wait, actually, the problem says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So perhaps the ratio for star_1 is higher than that of star_2. Let me clarify.

Wait, the question says that the excitation is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. So if star_2's ratio is R,
