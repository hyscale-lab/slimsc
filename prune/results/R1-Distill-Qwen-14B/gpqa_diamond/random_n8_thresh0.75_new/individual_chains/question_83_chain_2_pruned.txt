Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on titration calculations, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. First, I think I need to find the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Then, when we titrate, we'll have to consider the moles of NaOH added at 25% of the equivalence point and then at the equivalence point itself.

Wait, let's start. So, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution would be half of the original, right? Because volume doubles, concentration halves. So 0.05 M / 2 = 0.025 M acetic acid. Got that.

Okay, next, when we titrate with NaOH. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So the reaction would be:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na^+ + H2O

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid would have reacted with NaOH to form acetate ions. So the equivalence point would involve the solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so the solution should be basic. The pH at equivalence point would be determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.

But before that, let's find the pH at 25% titration. That means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH.

First, I think I should calculate the moles of acetic acid initially after dilution, and then find out how much is neutralized at 25%.

Molarity is moles per liter. Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters. So initial moles of acetic acid before dilution: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ of water, volume is 0.04 L, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M, which matches what I thought earlier.

Wait, but wait. Wait, when you dilute, the moles stay the same, right? Because dilution doesn't change the number of moles, just the concentration. So initial moles of CH3COOH is 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L), so the concentration is indeed 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate with 0.1 M NaOH, the moles of NaOH needed for equivalence would be equal to the moles of acetic acid. So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is 0.001 moles.

So the volume of NaOH needed at equivalence would be moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 liters, which is 10 cm³.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. Because when you titrate, the volume of NaOH is the volume that gives the equivalence point. The initial volume of the solution is 40 cm³. So to find the 25% titration point, that's 25% of the equivalence volume, which is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: the 25% titration refers to the percentage of the ac
