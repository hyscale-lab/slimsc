Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH, giving a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide, giving product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm. Let me tackle each step one by one.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH (excess) heated to 240°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) react with strong bases like KOH, they undergo elimination to form alkenes via an E2 mechanism. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—those are not adjacent bromines. Wait, adamantane has a structure with four fused cyclohexane rings. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. Because in adamantane, the positions are such that 1 and 3 are next to each other. So heating with KOH would likely cause elimination—so dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. When you have two bromines in vicinal positions, elimination forms an alkene. So product 1 is probably 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. Wait, no, because elimination would lose two HBr molecules. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Brs on adjacent carbons. So elimination would give an alkene between those two carbons, resulting in 1,3-diamantadiene? Or maybe it's a bridge structure, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an exo elimination. Wait, adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so maybe the product is an adamantene with a double bond.

Alternatively, I've heard that when vicinal dihalides are treated with KOH, especially in a strong base, they eliminate to form alkenes. So product 1 is likely 1,3-adamantadiene,
