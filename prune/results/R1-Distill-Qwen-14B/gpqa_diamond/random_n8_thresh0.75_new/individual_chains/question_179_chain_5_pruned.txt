Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this quantum mechanics question here. Hmm, the question involves some matrices and statements about them. I remember that in quantum mechanics, matrices often represent operators, and certain properties are important like whether they're Hermitian or unitary.

The question gives four matrices: W, X, Y, Z. And there are four options, A to D. I need to figure out which statement is correct.

Let me first recall what each option is saying.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Wait, the exponential of a matrix X, e^X. I remember that for the norm to remain the same after multiplication by e^X, e^X must be unitary. Because unitary matrices preserve the norm. So if e^X is not unitary, then there exists some vector where the norm changes. So I need to check whether e^X is unitary.

But how? Well, a matrix U is unitary if U† U = I, where † denotes the conjugate transpose. Alternatively, if X is skew-Hermitian, then e^X is unitary. Because skew-Hermitian matrices have the property that their exponential is unitary. So I should check if X is skew-Hermitian.

Skew-Hermitian means X† = -X. So let's compute X† and see.

X is given as:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

The conjugate transpose would swap rows and columns and take complex conjugates.

So X† would be:
Column 1: i*, 1*, (2i)* → which is -i, 1, -2i.
Column 2: (-1)*, 0*, (-1)* → 1, 0, -1.
Column 3: (2i)*, 1*, (-i)* → -2i, 1, i.

So X† is:
Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: 1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, -1, i

Now, is X† equal to -X?

X is:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0,
