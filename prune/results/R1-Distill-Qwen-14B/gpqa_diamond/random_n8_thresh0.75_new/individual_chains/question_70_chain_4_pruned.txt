Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

So, the question involves several reactions and properties. My goal is to find out the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. I remember that these are point groups in molecular symmetry, so I'll need to figure out what E's structure is to determine its symmetry.

Let me start by analyzing the reactions given.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. That's a lot of B reacting with A. I'm thinking maybe something like sulfur reacting with something, but wait, 8 equivalents is a big number. Oh, wait, another possibility: maybe A is sodium, which reacts with chlorine gas? No, sodium is a metal, but 8 equivalents? Alternatively, maybe it's something like a metal reacting with a diatomic gas. Wait, 8 equivalents of B—so perhaps B is Cl2, and A is something like Na? Wait, but if A is Na, reacting with Cl2 would form NaCl. But 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of Na? That doesn't seem right because the reaction is 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps A is sulfur (S8) and B is something else. Wait, but S8 is a solid and reacts with something? Not sure.

Wait, another thought: the product C is bright red. That makes me think of something like a transition metal compound. For example, maybe copper(II) sulfate is blue, but some other compounds are red. Oh! Wait, I think when sodium reacts with something else, but wait, maybe A is a metal oxide. Or perhaps the reaction is between a metal and a halogen.

Wait, another angle: The second reaction is C reacting with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Hmm, so C is reacting with gas D in a 1:2 ratio. If C is a salt, perhaps D is an acid or a base. The product E is dangerous—maybe a gas, or a toxic compound.

Then, C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Oh, this is a big clue. So when C is hydrolyzed, it breaks down into a metal (A), and two acids—strong and weak. So C must be a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, or vice versa.

Wait, if F is strong and G is weak, then perhaps C is the salt of a strong base and a weak acid. Because when you hydrolyze such a salt (like NaHCO3), you get a weak acid and a strong base. Wait, no, maybe the other way around. Let me think: If C is, say, a salt of a weak acid and strong base, like Na2CO3. When Na2CO3 reacts with water, it hydrolyzes to form NaOH (strong base) and CO2 (which is a weak acid). Wait, but in that case, when C reacts with water, you get back A (maybe Na?), but wait, Na2CO3 would produce NaOH when it hydrolyzes, but in the question, when C reacts with water, it reforms A plus two acids. So perhaps the hydrolysis breaks into a metal (A)
