Okay, I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one for solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference approximations and matrix exponentials. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with such equations, especially in higher dimensions, the matrix exponential comes into play because the solution often involves e^(At), where A is a matrix derived from the finite difference discretization.

The question mentions that the matrix exponential is approximated by a fractional approximation. I'm not exactly sure what fractional approximation means in this context, but I think it relates to using methods like Padé approximants or similar to approximate the exponential function. These approximations can make the computation more efficient, especially when parallelizing.

Now, the key factor for converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one. Let me think about what's involved in making an algorithm parallel. In sequential algorithms, processes are done step by step, but in parallel, tasks are split so they can run simultaneously. For matrix operations, this often involves decomposing the matrix into blocks or using some kind of splitting that allows different parts to be computed independently.

So, if we're approximating the matrix exponential, the way we split this approximation will determine how easily the algorithm can be parallelized. If the approximation can be broken down into parts that don't interfere with each other, then each part can be computed in parallel. 

Looking at the options:

A) Stability analysis: That's important for ensuring the numerical method doesn't blow up, but I'm not sure it's directly related to parallelism conversion.

B) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions: Nonlocal conditions might complicate the problem, but how does that tie into making an algorithm parallel? Not sure.

C) Complex roots of fractional approximation: Wait, if the approximation method uses a rational function (like a Padé approximant), the roots of the denominator might affect the stability or how the algorithm can be split. If the roots are complex, perhaps they allow for certain kinds of splitting or decomposition that are conducive to parallelism.

D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation: Partial fractions involve breaking a complex fraction into simpler parts. If the approximation can be expressed as a sum of simpler fractions, each part might correspond to a different term that can be computed in parallel. That sounds promising.

So, the question is about the key factor. If the approximation can be linearly partially fractioned, that would allow each term to be computed separately, which is perfect for parallel processing. Each term's exponential can be calculated independently, then summed up. That would make the algorithm parallel-friendly.

Alternatively, complex roots might relate more to the stability or the form of the approximation, but perhaps not directly the parallelism. Linear partial fractions (option D) seem more about the structure that allows decomposition into parallel tasks.

Wait, another thought: Matrix exponentials can sometimes be calculated by diagonalizing the matrix or using Kronecker products, but in higher dimensions, that's more complex. Fractional approximation methods try to approximate e^A by a rational function, say p(A)/q(A), where p and q are polynomials. Decomposing this into partial fractions could allow each term to be evaluated in parallel because each term corresponds to a different matrix inversion or operation that doesn't depend on others.

So, the key factor would be the ability to split the approximation into linear partial fractions, making it possible to compute each part in parallel. So the answer is D.
