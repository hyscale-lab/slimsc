Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because it's about buffer solutions and equilibrium, which I find a bit tricky. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has a volume of 200 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) and contains 1.00 g each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with two waters. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, so I don't think that affects anything here.

Hmm, I remember that orthophosphate is the HPO4^2- ion. So, we're looking for [HPO4^2-] in solution. The problem gives the Ka values for H3PO4 as Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, Ka3=1.8e-12. Wait, right, so H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. It dissociates in three steps:

1. H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)
2. H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)
3. HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)

But in the solution, we have KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me think about what these salts dissociate into. 

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When dissolved, it should dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. It should dissociate into 2 Na+ and one HPO4^2- ion. So, after dissociation, the solution will have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions, along with K+, Na+, and water molecules.

Wait a second, this setup sounds like a buffer solution. Buffers are made by mixing a weak acid with its conjugate base or a weak base with its conjugate acid. In this case, H2PO4^- is a weak acid (since it can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-), and HPO4^2- is its conjugate base. So the solution is a buffer involving the second dissociation step of phosphoric acid (Ka2).

Right, so the buffer equation (Henderson-Hasselbalch) should be applicable here. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). But wait, in this case, which is the acid and which is the base in the buffer?

H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2- (the base). So, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-. So, the equation will be pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

But wait, the question is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- ions. If I can find the pH of the solution, then I can solve for [HPO4^2-] using the Henderson equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of [HPO4^2-] to [H2PO4^-], and then calculate their concentrations based on the moles provided.

So, let me think about the moles of each component. We have 1.00 g of each salt.

Molar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. So moles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007341 moles. Since KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-, the moles of H2PO4^- is 0.007341.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O has a molar mass of 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005610 moles. This salt dissociates into 2 Na+ and one HPO4^2- ion. So moles of HPO4^2- is 0.005610.

Wait, but wait. No, HPO4^2- is the conjugate base here. So in the buffer equation, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

So, the ratio [base]/[acid] is (moles HPO4^2-)/(moles H2PO4^-) = (0.005610)/(0.007341) ≈ 0.7636.

Taking the log of that ratio: log(0.7636) ≈ -0.116.

So, pH = pKa2 + (-0.116). What's pKa2? Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is log(1/(6.2e-8)) = log(6.2e-8)^-1.

Wait, wait, pKa is the negative log of Ka. So, pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.207.

So pH = 7.207 + (-0.116) ≈ 7.091.

But wait, do I need the pH? Because the question is about the concentration of H
