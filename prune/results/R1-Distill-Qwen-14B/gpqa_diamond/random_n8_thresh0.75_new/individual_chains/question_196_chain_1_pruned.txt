Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember from my studies that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a particle experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. The classic example is a mass on a spring. But wait, this is a relativistic version, so I need to consider the effects of Einstein's theory of relativity.

The question is asking for the maximum speed, v_max, of the mass. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct. Let's break this down step by step.

First, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator can be found using energy conservation. The potential energy at maximum displacement (amplitude A) is (1/2)kA², and this converts into kinetic energy at the equilibrium point (x=0). So the maximum speed v would be sqrt(kA²/m). But wait, that's the non-relativistic case, right? So that would be option C. But the question says it's a relativistic oscillator, so option C might not be the right answer here because relativistic effects come into play.

In relativity, as an object's speed approaches the speed of light c, the relativistic effects become significant. The total energy of the object isn't just kinetic plus potential; we have to consider the rest mass energy as well. The total energy E is given by gamma times mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor: 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, in this relativistic case, the total energy at the maximum displacement (x=A) would be the sum of the potential energy and the rest energy. The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is still (1/2)kA², but wait, in relativity, how do forces and potentials work? I think Hooke's law is still F = -kx, but when considering energy, the potential energy would be (1/2)kx², but I should probably double-check that.

Wait, in the relativistic context, the potential energy can be treated similarly, but the kinetic energy changes because it's relativistic. So, the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy (mc²) and the kinetic energy (which is (gamma -1) mc²). Alternatively, since the problem states that it's obeying Hooke's law, perhaps treating the potential as (1/2)kA² and then setting the total energy as the sum of that and the rest energy. Wait, no, that's not correct
