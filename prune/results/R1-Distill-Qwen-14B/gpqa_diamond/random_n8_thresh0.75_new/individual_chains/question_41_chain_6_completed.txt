Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams and glass moving at a certain velocity. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think it through.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer in the laboratory. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are A to D.

Wait, wait. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. Hmm. So if the glass is moving towards me, and the light is going the same way (towards me), that's a bit confusing. Or wait, no—wait, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. Oh, the beam is going through the glass, which is moving in that direction towards the observer.

I remember that when you have a medium moving relative to an observer, you have to consider the effects of relative motion on the speed of light. But wait, in a vacuum, the speed of light is always c, but here, it's in a medium, glass. So the speed of light in glass is v_light = c/n, right? But wait, wait. What about the motion of the glass itself?

I think this is a situation where we might need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Wait, but glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is inside the glass. So the light's speed in the glass is c/n, but from the lab frame, what do we observe?

Wait, wait. Let me think in terms of reference frames. The glass is moving with velocity v relative to the lab frame. Inside the glass, the light is moving at speed u' = c/n, but in the glass's frame. So we need to transform this velocity to the lab frame.

But wait, the direction: the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed u' = c/n towards the observer. So in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass, the light's speed would be u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c²), but wait, wait—no, because in relativity, the velocity transformation is different.

Wait, no, wait. In the glass's frame, the light is moving at u' = c/n towards the observer. The lab frame is moving at velocity v relative to the glass. So from the lab's perspective, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass (since the glass is moving towards the lab?), or wait, if the glass is moving towards the observer, then the lab is moving in the opposite direction relative to the glass. Hmm, perhaps I should get the signs right.

Wait, let me get the coordinate systems straight. Let's say the lab frame is S, and the glass is moving at velocity v in the +x direction (towards the observer, I think). In the glass's frame, S', which is moving at velocity v relative to S, the light is moving at speed u' = c/n, because in the glass, speed is c/n. So I need to find u, the speed in the lab frame.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c²). But wait, wait—wait, if in S' (the glass frame), the light is moving at u'=c/n, and the glass is moving at v relative to the lab. So to get the speed in the lab frame, I need to apply the velocity addition formula.

So substituting u' = c/n into the formula:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c²)

But wait, wait, is the glass moving in the same direction as the light? The problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So the light is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer too. So, in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, and the light is also moving towards the observer, but through the moving glass.

Wait, but in the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n towards the observer. So when the glass is moving towards the observer, the lab sees the light moving at a higher speed, but not exceeding c, I suppose.

Let me substitute u' = c/n into the velocity addition formula.

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify the denominator:

Denominator = 1 + (v (c/n)) / c² = 1 + v/(n c)

So,

u = ( (c + n v) / n ) / ( 1 + v/(n c) ) )

Wait, let me calculate the denominator first. 1 + (v/(n c)) = (n c + v) / (n c)

So,

u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ]

Dividing these fractions:

u = [ (c + n v) * n c ] / [ n (n c + v) ) ]

Simplify:

The n's cancel out:

u = [ (c + n v) c ] / (n c + v )

So,

u = c (c + n v) / (n c + v )

Wait, but let me think about units. Wait, n is the refractive index. Let me check the dimensions. Wait, n is dimensionless. So the denominator is n c + v, but both terms have units of length per time. So that's okay.

Wait, but wait, the expression for the numerator is c (c + n v). Wait, but c is in m/s, and v is in m/s. So n v is in m^2/s^2? Hmm, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, let's go back. Let me re-express the velocity addition.

u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² )

u' is c/n, so substitution:

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify denominator:

( (c/n)*v ) / c² = (v c )/(n c²) ) = v/(n c )

So denominator is 1 + v/(n c )

So,

u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v )/(n c ) ]

Because 1 is (n c)/(n c ), and the other term is v/(n c ), so adding gives (n c + v) / (n c )

So now, the denominator is (n c + v )/(n c )

So,

u = [ (c + n v)/n ] * [ n c / (n c + v ) ]

The n in the numerator and denominator cancel:

u = (c + n v ) * c / (n c + v )

Hmm, but wait, that would be u = c (c + n v) / (n c + v )

Wait, but let's factor the numerator and denominator.

( c + n v ) = c (1 + (n v)/c )

And denominator: (n c + v ) = c (n + v/(c) )

So,

u = c * [ c (1 + (n v)/c ) ] / [ c (n + v/c ) ) ]

The c's cancel:

u = [ c (1 + (n v)/c ) ] / (n + v/c )

Simplify inside the numerator:

1 + (n v)/c = (c + n v)/c

So,

u = c * ( (c + n v)/c ) / (n + v/c )

So,

u = (c + n v) / (n + v/c )

Wait, but that's the same as:

Multiply numerator and denominator by c:

Denominator becomes n c + v.

Wait, but that brings us back to u = (c (c + n v )) / (n c + v )

Wait, but I'm not sure if I'm doing this correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I should make a substitution to simplify.

Let me try plugging in the numbers. Let’s say, for example, n = 1. Then the medium is vacuum, but wait, no, glass has n>1. Wait, perhaps let me take n=1 for a hypothetical case where glass is same as vacuum. So, if n=1, u' = c.

Then, the expression for u would become:

u = (c + v) / (1 + v/(c) )

Which simplifies to (c + v) * c/(c + v) )= c. So, u=c, which makes sense because in vacuum, moving at velocity v, the speed of light is still c. So that checks out.

Another check: If v is zero, then u should be c/n.

Plugging v=0 into the expression:

u = (c + 0)/(n c + 0 ) * c ?

Wait, no, let me go back to the expression after substitution.

Wait, when v=0, the expression u = (c + n*0)/ (n c + 0 ) * c?

Wait, no, earlier substitution I had:

u = [ (c + n v ) * c ] / (n c + v )

So when v=0, u = [c * c ] / (n c ) = c²/(n c ) = c/n. Which is correct, because in the glass's rest frame, the speed is c/n. So that's correct.

Another test: Suppose v approaches c. Hmm, but that would be a very high speed, but let's see. Let's take n=2 and v=0.8c.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's a useful test. Alternatively, perhaps if n is very large, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, none of them match my derived expression. Oh wait, let me see the options again.

Option A is (1 +n v )/(n + v )

Option B is 1.

Option C is (1 +n v )/(n - v )

Option D is (1 -n v )/(n + v )

Wait, my expression is u = [ c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Because all the options are in terms of 1 and n v, etc. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the velocity addition formula. Let me reconsider.

Wait, in the situation where the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, but through the glass, which is itself moving.

But wait, the light is inside the glass. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n towards the observer. So in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass (since the glass is moving towards the lab at v), the light's speed would be u = (u' + v) / (1 + u' v / c² )

Wait, but wait a second—no, wait. The lab frame is S, and the glass's frame is S' moving at velocity v in the +x direction relative to S.

In S', the light is moving at u' = c/n in the +x direction.

So, the velocity addition formula is:

u = [u' + v ] / [1 + (u' v) / c² ]

So, substituting u' = c/n:

u = [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ]

Simplify denominator:

( (c/n) v ) / c² = v/(n c )

So denominator becomes 1 + v/(n c )

So,

u = [ (c + n v ) / n ] / [ (n c + v )/(n c) ) ]

Which is:

u = [ (c + n v ) / n ] * [ n c / (n c + v ) ]

The n's cancel:

u = (c + n v ) * c / (n c + v )

Wait, but that expression can be written as:

u = c (c + n v ) / (n c + v )

Hmm, can I factor this differently? Let me factor out c from numerator and denominator.

Wait, let me write denominator as c (n + v/(c) )

Wait, so denominator: c (n + v/c )

Numerator: c (1 + (n v)/c )

So,

u = [ c (1 + (n v)/c ) ] / [ c (n + v/c ) ]

The c's cancel:

u = (1 + (n v)/c ) / (n + v/c )

Hmm, that's u = (1 + (n v)/c ) / (n + v/c )

Alternatively, multiply numerator and denominator by c:

u = (c + n v ) / (n c + v )

But looking at the options, none seem to match that.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the velocity. Because the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So in the lab frame, the light's velocity would be higher.

Wait, but perhaps another approach. Let me consider the speed of light in the glass as seen by the lab frame.

Wait, perhaps using the Doppler effect doesn't apply here, but the relativistic velocity addition does.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light inside the glass is moving at speed c/n relative to the glass. So, from the lab frame, the light's speed would be higher.

Wait, but the options don't have my derived expression. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is non-relativistic. Because if v is much smaller than c, then we can use the non-relativistic approximation. Let's see what that gives.

In non-relativistic case, the velocity addition is approximately u ≈ u' + v, but only if u' and v are much less than c.

So u = u' + v = (c/n) + v.

But looking at the options, option B is 1, which would be c in terms of units, but that's only if v is zero and n is 1, which is not the case here. So that's probably not the right approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is being considered in the frame where the glass is moving, and the light's speed is being measured in the lab frame. But I'm not getting any of the options to match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the velocity addition formula. Let me check that again. The formula is:

u = (u' + v ) / (1 + (u' v ) / c² )

Yes, that's correct.

So, substituting u' = c/n into this, we get:

u = [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) v ) / c² ]

= [ (c + n v ) / n ] / [ 1 + v/(n c) ]

So,

u = (c + n v ) / [ n ( 1 + v/(n c) ) ]

= (c + n v ) / [ n + v/(c) * n ]

Wait, that seems complicated. Let me compute it in another way.

Multiply numerator and denominator by c:

u = [ (c + n v ) * c ] / [ (n + v/c ) * c * n ]

Wait, maybe I'm complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider the speed of light in the moving medium without using relativistic effects, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. The speed of light in a moving medium can be found using the formula from the theory of relativity. When the medium is moving, the speed of light as observed in the lab frame depends on the direction.

In this case, light is moving in the same direction as the medium's motion. So, perhaps the formula is as follows: the speed of light in the lab frame is (c + v)/(n + v/c ), but I'm not certain.

Wait, but that doesn't match any of the options either.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the options again.

Option B is 1, which would mean the speed is c. But that's only true in a vacuum, and when the medium is moving, the speed inside the medium would be c/n. But if the medium is moving, the lab frame would see the light moving at a different speed, perhaps not c.

Wait, but if the medium is moving, the speed of light in the medium as observed in the lab frame might not be the same as c. Wait, but wait, in relativity, the speed of light in any inertial frame is c. So that's a key point. Oh wait, that's a crucial point!

Wait, if the glass is moving, but light is in the glass, which has a refractive index n. So in the glass's rest frame, the light speed is c/n. But from the lab frame, which sees the glass moving, the speed of light shouldn't exceed c. But according to relativity, any observer should measure the speed of light in a vacuum as c, but in a medium, perhaps it's different.

Wait, but wait, no, because the medium is moving. So the light's speed in the lab frame would still be c, but that's only in a vacuum. In a medium, it's different.

Wait, no, no. Relativity says that in any inertial frame, the speed of light in a vacuum is c. But if the light is in a medium with refractive index n, then the speed is c/n in the medium's rest frame. But when the medium is moving, the lab frame would measure a different speed.

But wait, according to the theory of relativity, the speed of light in a medium would not be the same as in a vacuum. Because the medium affects the light's speed. So in the lab frame, which is an inertial frame, the speed of the light inside the moving glass would be less than c.

So, going back, using the velocity addition formula, and substituting u' = c/n.

So,

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + (c v)/(n c^2) )

Simplify denominator:

1 + v/(n c )

So,

u = ( (c + n v)/n ) / ( (n c + v )/(n c) )

Which simplifies to:

u = [ (c + n v ) * c ] / (n c + v )

Hmm, but none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the light is moving opposite to the direction of the glass's motion. Because the question says the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is propagating in the same direction as the beam. So, the light is moving towards the observer, same as the glass.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the light is moving in the opposite direction relative to the glass's motion. Because the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is moving away? No, the question says the light is propagating through the glass in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. So I think the initial approach is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for another way. Let's think about the problem in terms of group velocity or phase velocity. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to test the concept that the speed of light in the medium, as observed in the lab frame, remains c/n, irrespective of the motion of the medium. But that's not correct, because in relativity, velocities add.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, the velocity of the light in the lab frame would be u = c/n + v. But that would only be valid if v is much less than c, and n is not too large. But none of the options match that either.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the speed of light in the glass, as observed in the lab frame, is still c/n. Because the glass's motion doesn't affect the speed of light in the medium. But that doesn't make sense, because the medium is moving relative to the observer.

Wait, another thought: If the glass is moving, but the light is inside it, perhaps the speed of light in the glass is still c/n relative to the glass, but as observed in the lab, it's different.

Wait, but according to the velocity addition formula, the lab would measure the speed as (c/n + v ) / (1 + (c v )/(n c^2) ) = ( (c + n v )/(n) ) / (1 + v/(n c) )

Which is what I had earlier.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory.

Wait, wait, so the beam is going through the glass, which is moving in the same direction as the beam. So, the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving towards the observer in the same direction as the glass's motion.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer at speed v. The light, in the glass's frame, is moving at c/n towards the observer. So, from the lab's perspective, the light's speed would be higher than c/n.

But according to the velocity addition formula, it's (c/n + v ) / ( 1 + (c v)/(n c^2) )

Wait, let me recheck that calculation:

u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c² )

u' = c/n.

So,

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n)*v ) / c² )

Simplify denominator:

( (c v)/(n c²) ) = v/(n c )

So denominator is 1 + v/(n c )

So,

u = [ (c + n v ) / n ] / [ (n c + v )/(n c) ]

So,

u = [ (c + n v ) * n c ] / [ n (n c + v ) ]

n cancels:

u = [ (c + n v ) c ] / (n c + v )

Hmm, but the options are:

A) (1 +n v)/(n +v )

B) 1

C) (1 +n v)/(n -v )

D) (1 -n v)/(n +v )

Wait, but if I factor out c from numerator and denominator:

u = c (c + n v ) / (n c + v )

= c (c + n v ) / [ c (n ) + v ]

Hmm, but that doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased such that the light is moving in the opposite direction to the glass's motion. For example, the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is moving away from the observer. But the question states the light is propagating through the glass in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. So that can't be it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is non-relativistic, so I can ignore the denominator and approximate u ≈ (c/n) + v.

But that would give u = (c + n v ) /n → which is (1 + (n v)/c ) * (c/n )

But that's not matching any of the options either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is being approached using the classical velocity addition without considering relativity. So if the speed in the glass is c/n, and the glass is moving at v, then the lab speed is u = c/n + v. But that's only if v is much smaller than c.

But the options don't have that either. So I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think differently. The speed of light in a medium is given by v = c/n, as per the medium's frame. But if the medium is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame, then the lab would measure the light's speed as v_light = (v_medium + v_light_medium) / (1 + (v_medium * v_light_medium)/c² )

So,

v_light = (v + c/n ) / (1 + (v (c/n) )/c² )

= (v + c/n ) / (1 + v/(n c) )

Which is what I had earlier.

But none of the options match this expression.

Wait, perhaps the options are written in terms of c=1, so let me substitute c=1.

Then,

u = (1 + n v ) / (n (1 + v/(n *1) ) )

Wait,

Denominator becomes n (1 + v/(n )) = n + v.

So,

u = (1 + n v ) / (n + v )

Which is option A.

Oh! Wait, because when c=1, the entire expression is u = (1 +n v )/(n + v ), which is option A.

Oh, I think I see now. Because when c=1, the numerator becomes (1 +n v ), and the denominator becomes (n + v ), so u = (1 +n v )/(n + v ), which is option A.

So the correct answer is option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic velocity addition. The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, which is propagating through the glass. The refractive index of the glass is \( n \), and the speed of light in a vacuum is \( c = 1 \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Speed of Light in the Glass (Rest Frame of the Glass):**  
   In the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is \( u' = \frac{c}{n} \).

2. **Relativistic Velocity Addition:**  
   To find the speed of light in the laboratory frame, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:  
   \[
   u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
   \]  
   Substituting \( u' = \frac{c}{n} \), we get:  
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\left(\frac{c}{n}\right) v}{c^2}}
   \]

3. **Simplifying the Denominator:**  
   The denominator simplifies as:  
   \[
   1 + \frac{\left(\frac{c}{n}\right) v}{c^2} = 1 + \frac{v}{n c}
   \]  
   Substituting \( c = 1 \), this becomes:  
   \[
   1 + \frac{v}{n}
   \]

4. **Final Expression for \( u \):**  
   Substituting the simplified denominator into the velocity addition formula:  
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
   \]  
   Multiply numerator and denominator by \( n \):  
   \[
   u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
   \]

5. **Matching with the Options:**  
   The derived expression \( u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \) matches **Option A**.

### Conclusion:
The speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is given by \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.

Answer: A
