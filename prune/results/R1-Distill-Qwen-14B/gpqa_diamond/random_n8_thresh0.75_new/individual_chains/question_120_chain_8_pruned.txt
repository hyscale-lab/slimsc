Okay, so I've got this question here about the distribution of stars and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, right? Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that distance (in parsecs) is 1 divided by the parallax (in arcseconds). So, distance d = 1/plx, where plx is the parallax.

Wait, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Does that mean their actual density is uniform in space, or just that they're spread out uniformly on the celestial sphere? I think it refers to uniform density in space. So, more distant regions would have more stars because as you look further out, the volume increases, but the number density is the same. Or wait, maybe the opposite—if their distribution is uniform in space, then the number density (stars per unit volume) is constant.

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, they're asking how the number of stars in a thin shell (like a spherical shell) at a certain distance relates to the parallax. Because parallax and distance are inversely related, a higher parallax means closer stars, lower parallax means further away.

Let me think in terms of volume. The number of stars in a volume is proportional to the volume itself, assuming uniform density. So for a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr, the volume would be 4πr² dr. But how does that relate to parallax?

Since d = 1/plx, plx is 1/d. So, if I express everything in terms of plx, let's say plx = p. Then d = 1/p. The volume of the shell at distance d is 4π d² dr. But dr is the change in distance, and since p =1/d, dp = - (1/d²) dd. So, dd = -d² dp. Wait, but I'm trying to express the volume in terms of p.

Wait, maybe it's easier to express dr in terms of dp. Since d = 1/p, dr = - (1/p²) dp. Because d = 1/p → p = 1/d → dp = - (1/d²) dd → dd = - d² dp. So, substituting d =1/p, d² =1/p². So, dd = - (1/p²) * dp → dr = -
