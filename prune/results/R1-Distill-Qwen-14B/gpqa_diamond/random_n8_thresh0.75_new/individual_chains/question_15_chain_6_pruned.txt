Okay, so I've got this question about transit probabilities of two Earth-like planets, and I'm supposed to figure out which one has a higher chance of transiting so the researchers should choose to observe that one. Hmm, let's break this down.

Alright, the question gives me a bunch of details. Both planets were detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, which tells us their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So, Planet_1 orbits faster, closer to its star maybe. Both have circular orbits, which is good because that simplifies things.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radii because the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved but they ended up with same radii. Interesting.

The question is about the probability of transiting. I remember that the transit probability depends on the orbital distance and the size of the star. Because a planet has a higher chance to transit if its orbit is more edge-on relative to us. But wait, the probability isn't just about the alignment; it's also about the size of the planet relative to the star.

Wait, no, wait. The probability of a transit depends on two main factors: the size of the planet relative to the star, and the orbital distance. Or more precisely, the probability is proportional to R_planet / (R_star * a), where a is the semi-major axis. Wait, no, that's not it. I think the transit probability is actually given by (R_planet + R_star) / a, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our perspective. The probability depends on the inclination of the orbit. But inclination is a factor we don't know, right? So for a random distribution of inclinations, the probability that the planet transits is given by the ratio of the star's radius plus the planet's radius to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

Wait, actually, the transit probability P is approximately (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's roughly R_star / a. Wait, no, wait, I think it's (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's
