Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through it again.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? They also mention that the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1.

The options are A to D, each with different expressions involving n and v. Hmm, okay, so I remember that when dealing with relative velocities, especially with light, special relativity might come into play. But wait, this is about the speed of light in a medium, which complicates things.

Wait, in a vacuum, the speed of light is always c, but in a medium like glass, it's slower. The refractive index n is given by n = c / v_glass, so v_glass = c/n. But here, the glass itself is moving. So the speed we're looking for is the speed of the light as observed in the lab frame.

But wait, the glass is moving toward the observer in the same direction as the light beam. Wait, no, the beam is moving through the glass, which is moving in the same direction as the beam. So the glass's motion is in the same direction as the light propagation, but it's moving toward the observer. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me think.

In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed v_glass = 1/n. Now, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. So I think I need to apply the velocity addition formula from special relativity here. Because velocities don't just add up classically when dealing with speeds close to c.

The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/cÂ²), where u is the velocity of the object in the original frame, and u' is the velocity in the new frame moving at velocity v relative to the original. Wait, but in this case, the light's speed in the glass frame is u = v_glass = 1/n. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab.

Wait, no, wait. The glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. So from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving towards the observer. Wait, no, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is toward the observer. So if the beam
