Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR problems can be tricky, especially when you're dealing with ring structures and epoxides. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about identifying Compound X, which after a reaction gives a product with specific NMR spectra. The reaction involves 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Wait, what's that reagent? Oh, right! I think that's a catalyst used in the epoxidation of alkenes. So, the reaction is probably an epoxidation, turning an alkene into an epoxide. So, Compound X likely has an alkene which is converted into an epoxide group.

Looking at the options, all of them are epoxides except maybe none. Let's check: option D is 2-styrylepoxide, which is an epoxide. So, the product must have come from an epoxide formation.

Now, the NMR data of the product. Let's look at the 1H NMR first.

1H NMR signals:
- δ 2.28 (3H, singlet)
- δ 2.31 (3H, singlet)
- δ 6.75 (1H, doublet)
- δ 7.08 (2H, doublet)
- δ 7.68 (1H, doublet)
- δ 7.71 (2H, doublet)

Hmm, so two singlets for 3H each. Those are likely to be methyl groups attached to something that doesn't cause splitting, maybe an electronegative atom or a ring. Since the product is an epoxide, maybe the methyl groups are on adjacent carbons or part of a substituent.

The aromatic region has multiple signals. Let's parse them:

- δ 7.08 (2H, d): probably two protons as part of a substituent on the ring, maybe para positions or adjacent.
- δ 7.68 (1H, d) and δ 7.71 (2H, d): perhaps a coupling pattern that suggests substitution on the benzene ring. Wait, maybe a styryl group, which is a vinyl benzene.

Wait, styryl is like a benzene ring attached to a double bond. So, if the epoxide is part of a styryl group, that could explain the aromatic signals.

Looking at the 13C NMR data:

- δ 21.3 (1C, s): maybe a methyl adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen in an epoxide.
- δ 28.4 (1C, s): another methyl, possibly not adjacent to anything that splits the signal.
- The rest are in the aromatic and carbonyl regions. Specifically, a carbonyl around 197.7 ppm (that's a ketone or an epoxide? Wait, no, epoxides are ethers, so their carbons are around 40-70 ppm. Wait, but 197 is way higher. Oh wait, no—wait, maybe it's an ester or a carbonyl group. Hmm, but the product is from epoxidation, so perhaps that's the carbonyl from elsewhere. Wait, no, epoxidation adds an oxygen but doesn't create a carbonyl. So maybe that's a carbonyl from an ester or ketone elsewhere. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misremembering. Let me think again: the epoxide carbons are typically around 40-60 ppm, but wait, in the product, I don't see any around there. Instead, the 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7—what could that be? Maybe a carbonyl group like a ketone or an ester. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aldehyde, but that would be lower. Wait, maybe it's a carbonyl from an acetal or something else. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me think about the structure.

Wait, the product is the epoxide. So, the starting material X had an alkene, which was epoxidized. So, in the product, there's an epoxide group. So, the 13C should show two epoxide carbons. But looking at the 13C data, I don't see any around 40-60 ppm. Instead, 197 is way higher, probably a carbonyl. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the product is a di-substituted epoxide? Let's think about the structure. The options are all epoxides attached to styryl groups, with varying substituents.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows two singlets for 3H each. So, maybe two methyl groups. Looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So, the styryl is at position 4 (so, para), and perhaps the oxirane (epoxide) is attached. So, the substituents could have a methyl group on the benzene ring. But wait, the oxirane would be a three-membered ring with oxygen, attached to the styryl group.

Wait, if the starting material is an alkene, which becomes an epoxide. So, the starting material X would be an alkene with substituents that, upon epoxidation, would give the product's structure.

Wait, looking at the options, all options are epoxides except maybe none. Wait, no, all are epoxides. So, perhaps the starting material X is an alkene, and the product is its epoxide. So, the product's structure must match the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps X is the alkene, and the product is the epoxide. Let me think: the reaction is epoxidation, so X is an alkene, and the product is the epoxide.

So, the product's structure must have an epoxide, and the substituents would correspond to the NMR.

Wait, the 1H NMR has two singlets for methyl groups. So, perhaps the epoxide is attached to a styryl group which has a methyl substituent.

Looking at the 13C NMR, the carbonyl at 197.7 is confusing. Maybe that's not a carbonyl. Wait, perhaps I misread it. Let me reread the 13C data:

13C NMR: 
- 21.3 (1C, s)
- 28.4 (1C, s)
- 126.9 (2C, s)
- 127.1 (1C, s)
- 129.1 (2C, s)
- 130.3 (1C, s)
- 141.5 (1C, s)
- 144.1 (1C, s)
- 197.7 (1C, s)

Wait, 197.7 is high, so likely a carbonyl. But in an epoxide, the carbons are not carbonyls. So, perhaps the product has both an epoxide and another carbonyl group. But that seems unlikely from an epoxidation reaction, unless the starting material had a carbonyl.

Wait, but the starting material is X (C11H12O). The product's formula isn't given, but let's calculate. If X is C11H12O, and the reaction adds an oxygen (since it's epoxidizing an alkene, which adds an O to make an epoxide), then the product would be C11H10O2? Because the starting material has one O, and epoxidation adds another O.

Wait, but the product's formula isn't given, so perhaps that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps X is an alkene without the epoxide, and the product adds the epoxide group.

But wait, the product in the question is the result after reaction with the reagent, so it's the epoxide.

Hmm, perhaps I should think more about the NMR data. Let's focus on the aromatic protons.

In the 1H NMR, the aromatic region has:

- 1H at 6.75 (d)
- 2H at 7.08 (d)
- 1H at 7.68 (d)
- 2H at 7.71 (d)

Wait, perhaps this is a para-substituted benzene. Let me think: a doublet for 2H at 7.71 and another doublet for 2H at 7.08. Wait, but that's four protons. Plus the 1H at 6.75 (d) and 1H at 7.68 (d), which is another two. So six protons in total, which makes sense for a benzene ring with substituents.

Wait, perhaps the aromatic ring has substituents that cause coupling. Maybe it's a vinyl group attached to the benzene. So, perhaps it's a styryl group.

Wait, let's imagine a structure where the benzene has a substituent at the para position, which is
