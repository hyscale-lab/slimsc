Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Wait, let me think about the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. So it's (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2. That's (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. So maybe a benzene ring (which is 3), a double bond (1), and an aldehyde group (which is another double bond, but wait, aldehyde is a carbonyl, which is a double bond, so that's another one). So maybe 3 from benzene, 2 from the aldehyde and a double bond, and then maybe an amide or something else? Or maybe it's a nitrile or an amine, but the O is in the formula too.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm (t, 1H). That's a high ppm, probably an aldehyde proton. The coupling (t) suggests maybe it's next to another proton, but in an aldehyde, the proton is usually a triplet when coupled with two adjacent protons, but wait, if it's an enal (like an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde), the aldehyde proton might be a triplet or a quartet. Wait, but in this case, it's a triplet, which would mean coupling with two equivalent protons. Hmm.

Then, 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). Those look like two doublets, each integrating to 2H. This might suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para-substituted, each proton is equivalent, and you get a doublet for each pair. Wait, but if the coupling is between the two adjacent protons, like in a di-substituted benzene. Alternatively, maybe it's a meta-substituted, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a coupling with another group.

Then 6.27 (bs, 2H). Broad singlet, maybe some exchange happening, like an enol or an alcohol. Or maybe it's an aldehyde adjacent to some protons, but I'm not sure. 

3.66 (d, 2H). A doublet integrating to 2H. This could be a methylene group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. So maybe a -O-CH2- group, or maybe a CH2 next to a carbonyl. But wait, if it's a doublet, perhaps it's next to another set of protons, maybe a CH2-CH2 group, but I'm not certain.

So putting this together. The high ppm at 9.72 suggests an aldehyde group. The aromatic protons suggest a para-substituted benzene ring, perhaps. Then we have some other groups. Let me think about the structure. Maybe it's a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So the benzene ring is 6 carbons, leaving 2 more. Oh wait, no, wait: C8H9NO. Benzene is C6, so the rest is C2H9NO. Hmm. So maybe the benzaldehyde part is connected to another group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diphenyl compound. Like two phenyl groups attached to a chain. So maybe the structure is something like (Ph)CH2CH2CHO? But that's C9H10O, which doesn't match. Wait, maybe it's a branched structure.

Wait, the NMR shows a triplet at 9.72. That's the aldehyde proton. So maybe the aldehyde is adjacent to a CH2 group. So something like CH2-CHO, but with some substituents.

Let me think about the aldehyde. The aldehyde proton is at 9.72, which is typical. The 3.66 ppm doublet could be a CH2 next to an oxygen. So maybe -O-CH2-CHO?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzaldehyde with another substituent.

Wait, let's consider the possible structure. The 6.98 and 6.51 are two doublets adding up to four protons. So maybe two sets of two equivalent protons, which suggests perhaps two substituents on a benzene ring, each substituent being in the para position. So maybe two substituents on a benzene ring, each being a methyl group or another substituent.

Wait, but the other signals: 6.27 (2H, broad singlet) and 3.66 (2H, d). Hmm. Let me think about the structure. Maybe it's a meta-substituted benzaldehyde with some substituents.

Alternatively, maybe it's
