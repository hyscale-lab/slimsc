Okay, so I have this question about a genetics experiment and why the overexpression isn't working. Hmm, let's read through it carefully.

The setup is that someone is creating a transgenic mouse model overexpressing the GADD45G protein, which is induced by IL-2 and might have a role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They introduced a coding sequence modification with an influenza hemagglutinin determinant at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary cells using Lipofectamine, selected the colonies, but can't overexpress the protein.

Looking at the construct's plus strand sequence provided, I'm supposed to figure out why the overexpression isn't happening. The options are A to D.

First, I think about what each option is suggesting.

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. So, they added the HA tag, but maybe it's incorrect, leading to a nonfunctional tag. But wait, the HA tag is for affinity purification, right? If it's wrong, the purification might fail. But the question is about overexpression, not purification. So maybe this isn't the main issue here.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That implies a premature stop codon. If the coding sequence has a stop codon (like UAA, UAG, UGA) inserted somewhere, the ribosome would stop translating early, making a truncated protein. But looking at the provided sequence, I need to check if there's a premature stop codon.

Option C: Lack of a linker causing proteolysis. A linker sequence is often added between the tag and the protein to prevent proteases from cleaving the tag. If the HA tag is right before the start codon without a linker, the protease might cut it off. But overexpression usually refers to the level of mRNA or protein being high. If the protein is being made but quickly degraded, you might see lower levels. But the problem is that the construct isn't being expressed at all? Or is it expressed but not detected?

Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon doesn't exist in the mouse. Wait, but UAA is a stop codon in most cases. Mammalian cells (including mice) should have tRNAs that recognize all standard stop codons. The ribosome doesn't need a tRNA for stop codons because it's a termination signal. So D seems unlikely because UAA is a stop, but the question is about the absence of a tRNA. Actually, no tRNA is needed for stop codons because they cause the release factors to act, not tRNA.

Now, looking back at the construct's sequence. Let me see. The HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the start codon should be after the HA. The HA is a peptide tag, so the coding sequence starts with ATG (which is the start codon, Methionine). Let me parse the beginning of the provided sequence.

The first part is 5' ATG TAC ... So ATG is the start codon. TAC is Tyrosine. So the HA tag would be encoded before this. Wait no, HA is a separate sequence. Oh, wait, the question says they introduced the HA sequence into the coding sequence. So HA's coding sequence would be added at the beginning.

Wait, the sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA... Hmm, that's the start. So the first ATG is the start codon. So perhaps the HA tag is part of this. But wait, the HA tag's coding sequence would be added before the ATG, right? For example, if HA is, say, YPYDVPDYA or something, its coding sequence would come before the ATG. But in the given sequence, the first codon is ATG, which is the start. Hmm, that seems confusing.

Wait, maybe the HA is part of the initial sequence. Let me think: HA is a small peptide, so its coding sequence would be a few codons, then comes the start of GADD45G. But in the given sequence, the first part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC A... Wait, so the first ATG is the start, and the following codons are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), etc. So that's the start of the HA tag and the GADD45G coding sequence.

Wait a minute, but HA is a specific sequence, like YPYDVPDYA, which in DNA would be something like TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA CCA... Wait, let me think. The HA tag's amino acid sequence is YPYDVPDYA, which is 10 amino acids. The DNA would be the coding strand,
