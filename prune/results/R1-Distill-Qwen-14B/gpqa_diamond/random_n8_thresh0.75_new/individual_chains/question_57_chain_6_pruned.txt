Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the scattering amplitude in electron scattering. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies. So the question gives phase shifts δ₀, δ₁, δ₂, δ₃, and δ₄ as 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, and 13° respectively. And we're told to ignore the rest, so I guess higher order terms are negligible. The incident electrons have 50 MeV energy, and we need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, I remember that the scattering amplitude f(θ) is related to the phase shifts. Oh right, the formula for f(θ) in terms of partial waves. The general expression is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (sin δ_l) / (1 - e^{-2iδ_l}) ) P_l(cosθ), where P_l are Legendre polynomials, k is the wave number, and the sum is over l.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, another approach: the scattering amplitude can be written as f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l / (1 - e^{-2iδ_l}) ) P_l(cosθ). Or maybe I'm mixing up the exact expression. Alternatively, maybe the formula is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) [sin δ_l / (1 - e^{-2iδ_l})] e^{iδ_l} P_l(cosθ). Hmm, not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the scattering amplitude's imaginary part is given by (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l e^{iδ_l} P_l(cosθ), but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/k) ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ sin δ_l e^{i δ_l} / (1 - e^{-2i δ_l}) ] P_l(cosθ). Oh wait, I think the denominator might be (1 - e^{-i δ_l}) something. Or maybe more accurately, the term is (sin δ_l) e^{i δ_l} / (1 - e^{-2iδ_l} ),
