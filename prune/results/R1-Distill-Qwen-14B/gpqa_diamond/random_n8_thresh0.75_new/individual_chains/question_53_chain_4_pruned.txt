Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So that's like a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O), which usually appears around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹. So that's a key point—there's an ester functional group present.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six signals. Let me break them down:

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Since the ring is di-substituted, the aromatic protons could be in a para or ortho arrangement. If in para, there would be two sets of equivalent protons (like two doublets if the substituents are in para positions). But wait, the substituents might be in such a way that each has different neighboring groups, leading to two distinct sets of aromatic protons. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester and the other is something else, causing different coupling.

2. Two signals for vinyl-H: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically those attached to a double bond, like in an ester group. For example, in an ester like OAc (acetyloxy), the adjacent CH3 would be split based on neighboring protons. Wait, or maybe it's part of a substituent that's not the ester? Let me think.

3. Two signals for –CH3 groups. Each as singlets? Or split? Since there are two signals, maybe the two methyl groups are in different environments. Like if one is part of an ester (like OAc) and another might be a different substituent, but wait, the compound is di-substituted. Hmm, maybe one methyl is from the ester and the other is from something else, but I thought the ring is di-substituted. Oh wait, wait, perhaps the substituents are an ester and another group that has a CH3, like maybe another ester or some other group.

Wait, the FTIR shows an ester group. So let's think about the structure. Common di-substituted benzenes with ester groups—could be something like two ester groups, or an ester and another substituent.

Wait, in an ester, the structure is R
