Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what compound D is. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the problem describes compound A, which has two signals in its proton NMR. A triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I'm trying to remember what kind of structures give those signals. The triplet and quartet are probably from adjacent groups of hydrogens, maybe like an ethyl group attached to something else.

Wait, so in NMR, splitting occurs due to neighboring protons. A triplet at 0.9 ppm—those are probably the terminal CH3 groups. Like, maybe two CH3 groups attached to a CH2. And the quartet at 1.3 ppm—could be a CH2 next to another CH2 group. So putting that together, maybe it's an ethyl group attached to something else. Like, maybe a cyclopropane? Or maybe it's part of a larger ring.

Alternatively, think about a structure where there are two sets of CH3 groups. Wait, 6H in triplet would be two CH3 groups each with 3H, so maybe a (CH2CH3)2 group. Oh wait, no, because if it's a triplet, the neighboring group must have two protons. So perhaps a structure like (CH3)2CHCH2CH2 something? Or maybe something like neopentyl? Wait, neopentyl is (CH3)C, so maybe not. Alternatively, think of a diethyl group attached to something.

Wait, 6H as a triplet. For example, two CH3 groups each attached to CH2, which are next to another CH2. Let me sketch this. Suppose the structure is (CH2CH3)2O. Wait, that's diethyl ether. No, because then the CH3 would be a triplet, but wait the CH2 would be a quartet. Wait, in diethyl ether, each CH3 is adjacent to a CH2, so the CH3 would be a triplet. The CH2 would be next to another CH2, so a quartet? Because for each ethyl group, the CH2 next to O would be a quartet. Hmm, but in diethyl ether, the structure is CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3. So the CH3 groups are each attached to a CH2 which is next to O. But in the NMR, the CH3 would be
