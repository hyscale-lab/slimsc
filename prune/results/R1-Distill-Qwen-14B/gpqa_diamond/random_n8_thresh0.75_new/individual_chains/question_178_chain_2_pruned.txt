Okay, so I've got this question about quantum field theory, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about. The question gives a Lagrangian for an interaction term, and asks about the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable.

The Lagrangian is given as L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Hmm. I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Right, that's the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. And F^{μν} is the field strength tensor, typically for electromagnetism or non-Abelian gauge fields. Wait, but in this case, since the question uses ψ, which is a spinor, and F^{μν}, maybe it's a fermion interacting with a gauge field.

But regardless, the question is about the dimension of κ and renormalizability. So to find the mass dimension of κ, I'll need to figure out the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions because the action is dimensionless, and the integral over four dimensions has dimension 4.

So, let's break down the Lagrangian term. The term is [κ] [ψ̄] [σ_{μν}] [ψ] [F^{μν}]. Each part's dimension contributes to the total.

First, ψ is a spinor field. In four dimensions, the spinor field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because for a Dirac field, the Lagrangian term iψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ has to have dimension 4. So ψ̄ and ψ each have dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ σ ψ would be (3/2) * (dimension of σ) * (3/2). Wait, wait. But σ_{μν} is built from gamma matrices, which are dimensionless, right? Because they're matrices, their dimension is zero. So σ_{μν} doesn't contribute to the mass dimension.

So the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ has dimension (3/2) + (3/2) = 3, because σ is dimensionless. Now, F^{μν} is the field strength tensor, which for a gauge field A_mu has F_{μν} = ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu. But A_mu has dimension 1 because the gauge field term in the Lagrangian is something like (∂ A)^2, which must have dimension 4. So each term in F has dimension 2 (since each derivative is dimension 1, and A has dimension 1, so ∂A has dimension 2). But F is a tensor, so F^{μν} is dimension 2.

Putting it all together: the entire term in the Lagrangian is κ multiplied by ψ̄ σ F. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimensions: (3) [from ψ̄ψ] + (2) [from F] = 5. Because σ is dimensionless, so ψ̄ σ ψ is dimension 3, times F (dimension 2) makes 5. But the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So the dimension of κ times 5 must be 4, because the Lagrangian term is κ*(other terms with dim 5). Wait, no. Wait, the term is κ multiplied by the product of ψ̄ σ ψ F. So each term inside should have dimension 4, as the Lagrangian is density with dimension 4.

Wait, wait, no. The Lagrangian is a scalar density, so each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. So the entire term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F must have dimension 4.

Each ψ is dimension 3/2, so ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. Then F is
