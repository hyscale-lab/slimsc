Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene, and I need to choose the correct reaction sequence from the options given. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, I need to figure out the substituents and their positions on the benzene ring. Let's draw this structure mentally. The benzene ring has three substituents:

1. A tert-butyl group at position 2.
2. An ethoxy group at position 1.
3. A nitro group at position 3.

Wait, positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent to each other. So, the substituents are in a meta arrangement relative to each other? Or maybe it's para for some? No, wait, position 1 is ortho to position 2, and position 3 is meta to position 1. Hmm, not sure, but maybe the order of substitution will affect the positions.

The synthesis starts with benzene, so we'll be adding substituents through electrophilic substitution reactions. The key is to figure out the order of adding these groups because the directing effects of each will determine where the next substituent goes.

Let's list the substituents:

- tert-butyl: This is a strong activating, ortho/para directing group because it's an alkyl group (alkyl groups are activating, as they donate electrons through sigma bonds).
- Ethoxy: Also an activating group, since it's an O-alkyl group. It's a strong activating, ortho/para director because the lone pairs on oxygen can donate electrons through resonance.
- Nitro: A strong deactivating, meta directing group. Since nitro is deactivating, it will deactivate the ring and direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position relative to itself.

So, the nitro group is a meta director, while the tert-butyl and ethoxy are ortho/para directors (activating). Now, the target molecule has the nitro group in position 3, tert-butyl in 2, and ethoxy in 1. Hmm, how do these positions relate?

Wait, numbering the benzene ring: if position 1 has the ethoxy, then position 2 is adjacent (ortho), and position 3 is meta to position 1. Or maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me imagine the ring as:

Positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 going around the ring. So, position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, position 3 is nitro. So, 1, 2, and 3 are consecutive, which is a meta arrangement for the nitro relative to ethoxy and tert-butyl. Or maybe it's para for some.

Wait, perhaps the order of substitution is important. Because each substitution will direct where the next one goes. So, the first substituent will influence where the second goes, which in turn influences where the third is added.

But the target has three substituents: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro. So let's think about the order in which they are added. Since the nitro group is deactivating, it would be better to add it after the activating groups, because once the ring is de
