Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me some phase shifts: δ0 is 90 degrees, δ1 is 67, δ2 is 55, δ3 is 30, and δ4 is 13 degrees. The rest are ignored. And the incident electrons are 50 MeV. The task is to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts. The general formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) is a sum over the angular momentum states. Oh right, it's given by:

f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ ( (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l) ) 

But wait, I think for the specific case when we're looking along the incident direction, which is θ=0. So sin(l*0 + δ_l) becomes sin(δ_l). Also, since we're along the beam, φ is 0, so the e^{iφ} factor is 1.

So putting it together for θ=0 and φ=0, the amplitude f(0,0) would be:

f(0,0) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ ( (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin(δ_l) )

Hmm, but wait, the question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So I need to compute Im[f(0,0)].

Let's break down each term. Each term in the sum is (2l+1) times e^{iδ_l} times sin(δ_l). Let's compute this for each l.

The phase shifts are given for l=0,1,2,3,4. So l goes from 0 to 4.

Wait, for each l, the term is (2l+1) * e^{iδ_l} * sin(δ_l). Let me compute this for each l.

But wait, e^{iδ_l} can be written as cosδ_l + i sinδ_l. So when we multiply by sinδ_l, each term becomes (2l+1) [ cosδ_l sinδ_l + i sin^2 δ_l ].

So the imaginary part of the entire sum would be the sum of
