Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let's break it down. The question is about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. 

The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. The pion is at rest, which probably means that the initial momentum is zero. I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total momentum of the decay products must be zero because of conservation of momentum. So the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass. I think the muon has a rest mass of about 105.7 MeV/c², and the pion is 139.6 MeV/c². So the mass of the neutrino is negligible here. 

I need to find the kinetic energies of each product. Let me think about energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy will be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

Each of these particles' total energy is their rest mass energy plus their kinetic energy. But since the neutrino is nearly massless, its rest mass energy is almost zero. So the muon's energy will be its rest mass plus kinetic energy, and the neutrino's energy will be just its kinetic energy.

But wait, how do I relate their momenta? Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum is zero. So the muon's momentum p must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the neutrino's momentum. But the neutrino's mass is so small that its momentum is approximately equal to its energy because E ≈ pc for massless particles. 

Wait, but the muon has mass, so its energy is sqrt(p²c^4 + m²c^4). Let me write down the equations.

Let me denote the muon's momentum as p, and the neutrino's as p. Wait, no, since they're opposite, their magnitudes are the same, p. So muon's momentum is p, neutrino's is -p.

The total energy from both should equal the pion's rest energy. So:

E_muon + E_neutrino = 139.6 MeV
