Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and figure out what's going on. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, okay, so I'll need to figure out what the starting compound X is first, and then determine the reaction outcome.

Let me start by looking at the spectral data. The IR has peaks at 3400-2500 cm-1, which usually suggests the presence of either an -OH group (like in an alcohol) or an amine (with N-H stretches). But in this case, the peak is in that range, but I also see a strong peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or ester or something like that. Then there's another peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those might be from aromatic rings, possibly indicating substituted benzene rings since those are common in such compounds.

Looking at the 1H NMR data. The peaks are as follows:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm. That's a strong indication of an -OH proton, maybe in a phenol or carboxylic acid. But wait, if it were a phenol, the -OH would be broad, but might not be that downfield. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid proton is usually around 10-12 ppm and broad. So that's a possibility.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This looks like aromatic protons. A doublet suggests perhaps a para-substituted ring with two equivalent protons. Like in para-substituted benzene, like p-xylene or something similar.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another set of aromatic protons. This might be from a substituent that's causing the coupling. If the aromatic region is showing two doublets, each integrating to 2H, it suggests a para-disubstituted ring with two substituents attached to adjacent carbons. Or maybe one substituent is in para and another is meta? Wait, no, if it's para, then the substituents are opposite each other. So maybe there's a substituent on the benzene ring, and the protons are split into two doublets because of the substituents. Hmm.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet in the 3 ppm region. This could be a CH group adjacent to an electronegative atom, maybe an oxygen. Or perhaps it's part of a CH2 group next to something else.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, lower chemical shift. Maybe this is a CH2 group in a longer chain, perhaps next to an oxygen or something else that deshields it a bit.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet possibly? No, it's a doublet. Wait, no, it's a doublet integrating for 3H. That suggests a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH2 group. Like a CH(CH2CH3) or something similar. Wait, actually, a doublet for 3H at 1.4 ppm could be a methyl group adjacent to a CH. Like in an isopropyl group, but that's usually a septet. Or maybe it's attached to a CH2 group. Wait, maybe it's a (CH2CH(CH3)) arrangement. Or perhaps a CH2 connected to something else.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating for 3H, this is likely a terminal methyl group, probably part of an ethyl chain. Like in an ethyl group, the CH2CH3 would give a triplet for the CH3 at the end because it's next to a CH2.

Putting this together: the aromatic protons suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. The substituents could be something like a methyl group and another substituent. But wait, the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl. So perhaps it's a substituted benzene with a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester or maybe an acid.

Wait, the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which as I thought earlier, could be a carboxylic acid -OH. But then, in the IR, the 1720 cm-1 would correspond to a carboxylic acid carbonyl. But wait, in a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is usually around 1700 cm-1, but it can be a bit higher. However, the 10.5 ppm proton fits a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, if it's an acid derivative, like an ester. For example, an ester's carbonyl is around 1720-1740 cm-1. So
