Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still learning about titrations and pH calculations. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ (which is 20 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D, each with two pH values.

Alright, so first step, I think I need to figure out what the diluted acetic acid concentration is. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes. Let me recall the dilution formula. M1V1 = M2V2, I believe. 

So initially, the volume is 20 mL and then we add 20 mL of water. So the total volume becomes 40 mL or 0.04 L. Wait, no, 20 mL each, so 40 mL in total. Right. The initial moles of acetic acid are Molarity × Volume. So M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 mL, which is 0.02 L. Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. 

After adding 20 mL water, the total volume is 40 mL (0.04 L), so the new concentration is moles / volume. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let's calculate the volume of NaOH needed for equivalence.

Moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol (from before). NaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M. So volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL. So the equivalence point is when 10 mL of NaOH is added.

Now, the first part asks for pH at 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence volume would be 2.5 mL of NaOH added.

Wait, wait, no. Wait. 25% titration refers to the amount of the acid that's been neutralized. So if the equivalence volume is 10 mL, 25% would mean 2.5 mL of NaOH added. So that's when 25% of the acid has been neutralized. Alternatively, maybe it's the volume of NaOH added is 25% of the equivalence volume. Both interpretations might be similar in this case.

Wait, no. Wait, in titration terms, 25% titration usually refers to the volume of titrant (NaOH) added being 25% of the equivalence point volume. So since equivalence
