Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Wait, waitâ€”1-bromobenzene-2-d. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Oh, wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylamino benzene? Or is the "d" something else? Oh wait, I think I remember that sometimes in notation, the "d" might stand for a substituent like a methyl group attached to a nitrogen. Like, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-(dimethylamino)benzene. Because I remember that "d" can sometimes be an abbreviation for dimethylamino. Or maybe it's a typo? Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with two substituents: a bromine on position 1 and a deuterium (d) on position 2? Wait, that doesn't seem right because deuterium is an isotope and usually doesn't affect the structure much. Or maybe the "d" is part of a substituent name. Oh, perhaps it's 1-bromobenzene with a substituent at position 2 which is a dimethylamino group. So, 2-dimethylaminobromobenzene? Or more accurately, the substituents are at positions 1 and 2: bromine at 1, and dimethylamino at 2.

Wait, the correct IUPAC name would be 2-dimethylamino
