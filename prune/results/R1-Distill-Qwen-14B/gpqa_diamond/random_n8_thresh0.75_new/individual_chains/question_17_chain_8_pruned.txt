Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium.

The problem states that the solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. I think K here is the formation constant for the complex, which indicates how stable the complex is. A higher K means a more stable complex, so less calcium ions should be in solution because most are tied up in the complex.

Wait, the formula for the formation constant. I think the complex is CaEDTA^2- or something like that. The reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. So the formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Oh right, that's correct.

But wait, in the problem, the concentration given is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So that's the concentration of the complex in solution. Because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, but that's probably not relevant here. 

So the initial setup is that the complex concentration is 0.02 M. Let me think about the dissociation. The complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. Since K is very large (5e10), the dissociation is not favored; most of the complex stays intact. So the concentration of free Ca²+ should be very low.

Let me denote [CaEDTA^2-] as 0.02 M. Let's let x be the concentration of free Ca²+ and EDTA^4- that comes from the dissociation. So according to the reaction, for every mole of complex that dissociates, one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4- are produced. But wait, the EDTA in solution comes from both the dissociation of the complex and any free EDTA present. Wait, but in this problem, is the solution only the complex, or is there free EDTA? Hmm, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So I think
