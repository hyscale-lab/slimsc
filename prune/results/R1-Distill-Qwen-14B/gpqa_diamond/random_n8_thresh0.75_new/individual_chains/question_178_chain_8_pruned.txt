Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian in quantum field theory. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think through it step by step. 

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that σ_{μν} is related to the generators of Lorentz transformations for spinors. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

The question is about the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Oh right, renormalizability depends on the dimensions of the coupling constants. If the coupling has a positive mass dimension, the theory is renormalizable because the interactions are "weaker" at high energies.

So, to find the mass dimension of κ, I need to look at the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 in 4 spacetime dimensions because the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ħ = c = 1).

Wait, in 4D, the Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4 because the integral over d^4x (dimension -4) gives a dimensionless action.

So, each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

Let's break down L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each ψ is a spinor field. Spinor fields in 4D have mass dimension 3/2. Because for a Dirac field, the Lagrangian term i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ has to have dimension 4. The derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1. So, ψ̄ and ψ each have dimension 3/2.

Now, σ_{μν} is a product of two gamma matrices. Gamma matrices are dimensionless (since they're just matrices), and σ_{μν} is a commutator of gammas, so also dimensionless.

F^{μν} is the electromagnetic field strength tensor. The Lagrangian term for Maxwell is F^2, so F must have dimension 2. Because Maxwell's term is (F_{μν})^2, each F has dimension 2. Wait, no, wait. The Maxwell term is F_{μν} F^{μν}, which is dimension 4. Since F_{μν} is a tensor, each F has dimension 2 because F squared gives 4. So F^{μν} has dimension 2.

So putting it all together: the term in the Lagrangian is κ multiplied by ψ̄ (3/2), σ_{mu nu} (0), ψ (3/2), and F^{mu nu} (2). So the product is:

κ * (3/2) * (3/2) * 2 

Wait, wait. Wait, let me think about each term's dimensions. So the term is the product of four terms: ψ̄, σ, ψ, F. But wait, no: ψ̄ is a Dirac spinor with dimension 3/2; σ is dimensionless; ψ is 3
