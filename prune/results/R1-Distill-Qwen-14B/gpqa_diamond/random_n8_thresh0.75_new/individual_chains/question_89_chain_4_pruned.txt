Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step and the products formed.

First reaction: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. The product is a light yellow solid (product 1). The 1H NMR spectrum shows signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). There's also an IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹.

Hmm, I think KOH is a strong base. When dibromides react with a strong base like KOH, elimination reactions can occur, especially E2 mechanisms. Since there are two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the base might abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of an alkene.

The IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group. Wait, but elimination would typically form an alkene, which has a C=C stretch around 1650 cm⁻¹. Oh, maybe it's not elimination but some kind of substitution. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide? Wait, no, epoxides would have different IR peaks. Alternatively, if the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, but that gives alkenes. Alternatively, it could be a di-elimination forming a carbonyl? Wait, no, that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, let me think again. The reaction is with KOH, which is a strong base. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a bicyclic compound. When two vicinal bromides (like Br on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base, they typically undergo elimination to form an alkene. But in this case, the product has a carbonyl, so maybe it's a different kind of reaction.

Wait, another possibility: the base could cause elimination to form an epoxide. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a di-substituted adamantane; perhaps the elimination leads to a ketone? No, elimination usually forms alkenes or ethers, not ketones. Wait, the IR is at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is
