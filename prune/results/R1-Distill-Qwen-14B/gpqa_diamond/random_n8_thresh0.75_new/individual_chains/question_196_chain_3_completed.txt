Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, okay, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator is a system where the restoring force is proportional to the displacement, like F = -kx. But this is relativistic, so I guess special relativity comes into play here.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of the mass in this oscillator. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me think about how to approach this.

In a regular harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², where A is the amplitude. So the maximum speed v_max in the classical case would be when (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA², which gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, this is a relativistic case, so I can't use the classical formula directly.

Right, so relativistic effects must be considered. In special relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. The total energy is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But for a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and the kinetic energy is (gamma -1)mc², maybe?

Wait, no. Wait, in a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is maximum when the oscillator is at the extremes (x = A), and the kinetic energy is maximum when it's at the equilibrium position (x=0). So, the total energy is the sum of the potential and kinetic energies. But in the relativistic case, I think the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv², so perhaps the energy expressions are different.

Wait, maybe another approach. In a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the energy isn't quantized in the same way as the quantum case, but here we're probably treating it classically. So the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy, the potential energy, and the kinetic energy. Wait, no, the total energy would be gamma mc², which includes the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy.

Wait, the potential energy in the harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². So perhaps at maximum displacement x=A, all the energy is potential. So the total energy E would be (1/2)kA² plus the rest energy mc²? Or wait, no. Because in the relativistic case, the total energy is related to the motion. Hmm, maybe I should think about how the potential energy and kinetic energy relate in special relativity.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider energy conservation. The total energy E of the oscillator at maximum displacement (x=A) is E = (1/2)kA² + mc² * gamma_0, where gamma_0 is when the mass is at rest. But wait, when the mass is at rest, gamma_0 is 1, so E = (1/2)kA² + mc². Then, when the mass is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic. So the total energy at x=0 would be the sum of the potential energy (which is zero here) and the kinetic energy, which is (gamma -1) mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor for the maximum speed. So E = (gamma -1) mc².

So equating the two energies: (1/2)kA² + mc² = (gamma -1) mc².

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because the potential energy at x=A is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy when x=A is zero (since the velocity is zero there). So the total energy would be (1/2)kA² + mc², because mc² is the rest energy. But when the mass is moving at maximum speed, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc².

So setting them equal:

(1/2)kA² + mc² = (gamma -1) mc².

Wait, that can't be right because when you have (gamma -1) mc², that's the kinetic energy. So the total energy at x=0 is (gamma) mc², since at maximum speed, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc², and the total energy is gamma mc².

So, at x=A, the total energy is (1/2)kA² + mc². At x=0, the total energy is gamma mc².

Setting them equal: (1/2)kA² + mc² = gamma mc².

So gamma = [ (1/2)kA² + mc² ] / (mc² ) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²).

Hmm, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, that's interesting because (k A²)/(2 m c²) could be a small quantity if the amplitude A isn't too large. But for maximum generality, I need to solve for v_max.

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some positive number, say, α. So gamma = 1 + alpha.

Since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), I can write 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha.

Then, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + alpha).

Squaring both sides: 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Rearranging: v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

So v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 ), where alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Putting alpha back in:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

Which can be rewritten as:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [ 1 / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ] )

Wait, looking at the options:

Option D is sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2mc^2))^2 ), so that's matching my expression.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option D: v_max = c*sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c²) ))^2 )

Yes, that's exactly what I have.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is written as sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2mc²))^2 ))? Wait no, no, the denominator is (1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2))^2. Because in the option, it's (1 + (kA²/(2mc^2))) squared.

Wait, the denominator in my expression is [1 + (kA²/(2 m c^2))] squared, so inside the square root, we have 1 - 1/(denominator squared).

So the option D is:

v_max = c*sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c^2)) )^2 )

Which is the same as my expression.

Wait, but wait, another approach. Let me think again about the energy.

Wait, another way: the potential energy at maximum displacement is (1/2) k A². The total energy is this plus the rest energy, but wait, no. Because in the relativistic case, the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) isn't just the rest energy plus the potential. Alternatively, the total energy is gamma mc², which includes the rest energy and the kinetic energy.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-derive.

At x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the particle is momentarily at rest, so kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy E is (1/2)kA² + mc² (the rest energy). Then, when the particle is at x=0, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc². So the total energy is (gamma) mc², because gamma mc² is the total energy (mc² rest plus KE). So equating the two:

(1/2)kA² + mc² = gamma mc².

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Which is the same as before.

So from this, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Then, square both sides: 1/(1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)]^2.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1/[1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)]^2.

Then, v²/c² = 1 - 1/[1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)]^2.

So v_max^2 = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 ]

So v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 )

Which matches option D. So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but let me check the other options to make sure.

Option C is the classical expression, so it's incorrect in the relativistic case.

Option A: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2/(2m))^2 ) )

That doesn't look correct because the denominator in the fraction is (1 - something), which might lead to a larger term, but my expression has (1 + something) squared.

Option B: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2/(2 m c^2)) ) )

That would be similar to the approach where (some denominator) is linear, but in our case, it's squared in denominator.

Option B's denominator is (1 - (kA^2/(2 m c^2)) ), which doesn't match our expression.

So yes, option D is the correct answer.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we consider relativistic energy conservation. The total energy of the system is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement \( x = A \), which is \( E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 + mc^2 \). At the equilibrium position \( x = 0 \), all the energy is kinetic, and the total energy is \( E = \gamma mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

Equating the total energy at \( x = A \) and \( x = 0 \), we have:

\[
\frac{1}{2}kA^2 + mc^2 = \gamma mc^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Let \( \alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \alpha.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = (1 + \alpha)^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}.
\]

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we find:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

Comparing with the options, this matches **Option D**.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect, as it includes a denominator \( 1 - \frac{kA^2}{2m} \), which does not match the relativistic energy conservation derivation.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it includes a denominator \( 1 - \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), which is not squared and does not match the derived expression.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as it represents the classical result, which does not account for relativistic effects.
- **Option D**: Correct, as it matches the derived expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \) in the relativistic case.

Answer: D
