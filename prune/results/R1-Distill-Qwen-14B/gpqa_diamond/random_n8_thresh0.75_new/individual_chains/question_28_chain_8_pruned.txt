Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question carefully.

The starting material is (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. So, that's a cyclohexenone ring with a hydroxyl group at position 4, and the configuration is S. I think the numbering must be such that the ketone is at position 1, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3 (since cyclohex-2-en-1-one would mean double bond between 2 and 3), and the hydroxyl is on carbon 4.

First step: treating this with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine. I remember that silylation reactions usually protect hydroxyl groups. TBS (tert-butyl dimethylsilyl) is a common protecting group. So, the hydroxyl on the cyclohexenone would be converted into a TBS ether. So product 1 would be the silyl ether of the starting material.

Next, product 1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide. Ph2CuLi is a Gilman reagent, which is used for conjugate additions, especially in cyclohexenones. Conjugate addition would add a nucleophile to the beta position. So, the silyl ether has a ketone at position 1 and a double bond between 2 and 3. The Gilman reagent would add a benzyl group perhaps. Wait, no, Ph2CuLi itself is a reagent that adds a benzyl group? Or does it add a cuprate that then reacts with an electrophile?

Wait, no. Gilman reagents (like Ph2CuLi) are used for 1,4-addition to alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. So, the cyclohex-2-en-1-one is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone. The Gilman reagent would add a benzyl group to the gamma position, which is the 4 position? Or wait, the numbering is 1 (ketone), 2 and 3 (double bond), so the gamma position is position 4. Since the starting material has a hydroxyl (now a TBS group) at position 4, maybe the addition would occur at position 3 or 4.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition where the Grignard or organocopper reagent adds to the beta carbon (position 3), and the ketone would be at position 1. The silyl ether is at position 4. So adding benzyl from Ph2CuLi would add to the beta position, position 3. But wait, in a cyclohexenone, the conjugate addition would add to the less substituted position. Alternatively, perhaps the addition is at the gamma position, but that doesn't make sense because the double bond is between 2 and 3.

Wait, maybe I should visualize the structure. The cyclohexenone would have the carbonyl at C1, then a double bond between C2 and C3, and a hydroxyl (now TBS) at C4. So the structure is a six-membered ring with C1 being a carbonyl, C2-C3 double bond, and TBS-O at C4.

When Ph2CuLi does a conjugate addition, it adds to the beta position, which is C3. So the benzyl group would add to C3. But wait, the reagent is Ph2CuLi, which provides a benzyl group? No, wait, Ph2CuLi is a cuprate reagent that can perform conjugate additions, but it's the benzyl bromide that's added later. Oh, wait, the sequence is first treated with Ph2CuLi, and then with benzyl bromide. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps Ph2CuLi is used to form a benzyl anion which can perform a conjugate addition. Alternatively, maybe the first step is metalation, and then the alkylation with benzyl bromide.

Wait
