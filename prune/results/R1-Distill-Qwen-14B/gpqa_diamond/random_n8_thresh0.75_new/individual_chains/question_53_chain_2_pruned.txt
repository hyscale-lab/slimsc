Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and jot down the key points.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So it's something like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR shows ester groups, which means there's an -O-CO-O- structure or maybe an ester group like R-O-CO-R'. Ester groups typically show a strong absorption around 1740 cm^-1, but I think the question just says there are absorption peaks indicating an ester, so that's a given.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: there are six signals. Let's break them down. Two aromatic H signals. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the aromatic protons would depend on the substituents' positions. If the substituents are para, then there would be two sets of equivalent H's, each giving a singlet. But if they're in the ortho or meta positions, the splitting would be different. Wait, but the NMR shows two signals for aromatic H's. Hmm. So maybe the substituents are para, leading to two sets each with two H's. Or perhaps one substituent is meta, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the substituents are such that the aromatic ring has two distinct sets of H's, maybe each substituent causes different splitting. I'll have to think more about this.

Then, two signals correspond to vinyl-H. One is a doublet and the other is a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically on double bonds, like in alkenes. So maybe there's an ester group with a vinyl group attached, or perhaps the substituents on the benzene include a vinyl group. For example, if one substituent is an ester with a vinyl group, like -CO-O-R where R has a double bond.

Wait, the ester group is present, so the structure likely has an ester substituent. Let's say the benzene ring has two substituents, one of which is an ester group. But what's the other substituent? Or maybe both substituents are ester groups? No, di-substituted, so two substituents in total.

Wait, another possibility: one substituent is an ester (like OCOOR), and the other substituent could be something else. But looking at the NMR, there are two signals for vinyl H's. So perhaps the other substituent is an alkene group, like a vinyl group. Alternatively, the ester group itself might have a vinyl group attached.

Wait, the ester group is typically R-O-CO-O-R', but that's not right. Wait, no, the structure of an ester is RCOOR', so for example, methyl acetate is CH3COOCH3. So the ester group is an acyl group attached to an oxygen, which is attached to an R group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is an ester group with a vinyl group nearby. Or perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like -O-CO-O-CH2CH2- something. No, maybe the substituent is an ester where the R group is a vinyl group, such as -COOCH2CH2- or something. Alternatively,
