Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about a wave function and finding the normalization constant 'a'. The setup is that we have a bunch of identical systems, each with a particle in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. And when they measured the particles' positions, none were found before x=1 or after x=3. So the particles are only between x=1 and x=3.

Wait, the wave function is a complex function, right? So it's ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1 + x)] - 0.5i. But for the purposes of normalization, I think the integral of the square of the absolute value of the wave function should be 1.

Normalization condition: Integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

So |ψ(x)|² is [ (a / sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2 ] because when you square a complex number, you get (Re)^2 + (Im)^2. So Re is a/sqrt(1+x), Im is -0.5. So the square is (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx equals 1.

Let me break this integral into two parts. The first part is a² times the integral of 1/(1+x) dx, and the second part is 0.25 times the integral of 1 dx from 1 to 3.

Calculating the first integral: ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x). So evaluating from 1 to 3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So first part becomes a² * ln(2).

Second integral: ∫1 dx from 1 to 3 is 2 (since 3-1=2). So 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

Adding both parts: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So solving for a²: a² = (1 - 0.5) / ln(2) = 0.5 / ln(2).

Wait, what's ln(2) approximately? I remember ln(2) is about 0.6931.

So 0.5 divided by 0.6931 is roughly 0.5 / 0.693 ≈ 0.7208. Then a is the square root of that, so sqrt(0.7208) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. That's option B.

Wait, but let me double-check. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. The normalization integral adds the real part squared and the imaginary part squared. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but are we sure about the limits? The wave function exists only between x=1 and x=3, so the integral is from 1 to 3. So my calculation is correct.

So a squared is (0.5)/(ln(2)) → a is sqrt(0.5 / 0.6931) → which is approximately 0.85. So option B is 0.85.


To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i,
\]

and the normalization condition is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

The absolute square of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

Substituting this into the normalization condition, we get:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) \, dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. \(\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx\),
2. \(\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx\).

For the first part, the integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating from \( x=1 \) to \( x=3 \):

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2).
\]

Thus, the first term becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2).
\]

For the second part, the integral of \( 0.25 \) over \( x \) from 1 to 3 is:

\[
0.25 \times (3-1) = 0.5.
\]

Adding both contributions, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{1 - 0.5}{\ln(2)} = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7208.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7208} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
