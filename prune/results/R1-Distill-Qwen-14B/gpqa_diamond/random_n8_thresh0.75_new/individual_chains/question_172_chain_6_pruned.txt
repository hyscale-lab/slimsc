Okay, I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Let me think through this step by step.

So the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Both photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which I remember means that the gas emits and absorbs radiation at the same rate, so the usual blackbody laws apply.

Hmm, I think this has to do with the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann factor explains the distribution of particles in different energy states. The formula is something like the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is equal to the exponential of -(ΔE)/(kT). Oh right, the formula is (n_upper / n_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, but in this case, the excitation is higher in star_1. So the population of the higher energy level in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around? Let me read the question again.

Oh, the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So for a specific energy level, the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2. So the ratio n1/n2 = 2, where n is the population of that energy level.

Using the Boltzmann equation, for each star, the ratio would be:

n1/n2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) / exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Wait no, wait. Wait, each star has its own temperature. So for star_1, the ratio of populations is n1_upper / n1_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

Similarly, for star_2, it's n2_upper / n2_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But the question says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So I think the actual ratio is (n_upper / n_lower) is higher in star_1 than in star_2. Wait, if the excitation is higher, that means more atoms are in the higher energy level relative to the lower one. So the ratio (n_upper / n_lower) is higher in star_1 than in star_2.

So for star_1, let's call that ratio R1. For star_2, R2. So R1 = 2 * R2, because star_1 is twice as excited. Or wait, the problem says the excitation is twice as much, which might mean R1 = 2 * R2.

Wait, the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So the excitation level is higher, meaning the population in the upper state is higher relative to the lower. So if (n_upper / n_lower) = R, then a higher R means more excitation.

So R1 = 2 R2.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is saying that n1_upper is twice n2_upper. No, that can't be right because that would depend on the total number of atoms, but the problem says the excitation is twice, which is the ratio in the same energy levels, so it's about the ratio within
