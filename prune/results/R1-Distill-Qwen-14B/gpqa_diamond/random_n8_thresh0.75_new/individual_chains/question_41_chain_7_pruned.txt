Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium relative to an observer in a lab. Hmm, right, I remember something about how the speed of light is constant in a vacuum, but what happens when it's in a medium that's moving?

Let me read the question again carefully. So, there's a light beam moving through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. Wait, the observer is in the lab, so the glass is moving towards them. And the question is, what's the speed of light in the glass as seen by the observer?

I remember that when a medium is moving, the speed of light in that medium might be different from the usual c/n. But wait, no, the speed of light in a medium is always less than c, given by c divided by the refractive index. But how does the motion of the medium affect this?

Wait, this is a relativity problem, right? Because the glass is moving, so we have to consider how different observers perceive the speed. But wait, the speed of light in a medium is c/n in the rest frame of the medium. But when the medium is moving, does that change the speed as measured by an external observer?

Wait, no, because in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, this is about light in a medium. Oh, right, because the medium's motion affects the refractive index or
