Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a chemist performing two reactions using different reducing agents on two unknown compounds, A and B. The products from both reactions are given, and I need to determine the correct starting materials A and B from the options provided.

First, the reactions given are:

Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one

Reaction 2: B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one

Wait, wait. Wait a minute. Wait, aren't LiBH4 and BH3 different reducing agents? I remember that BH3 is typically used in hydroboration reactions, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, often used for reducing carbonyl groups to alcohols. Oh, wait, no—wait, actually, BH3 is usually used in the form of BH3·THF (tetrahydrofuran), and it's used for hydroboration, which is anti-Markovnikov addition to alkenes. But LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than NaBH4 and is used to reduce things like ketones and aldehydes to secondary and primary alcohols, respectively. But wait, wait, in this case, the products are ketones. So that would imply that the starting material had a carbonyl group.

Wait, no. Wait, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let me think about that structure. Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is a cyclic ether, a six-membered ring with an oxygen. The 2-one means there's a ketone at position 2. And it's tetrahydro, so it's a fully saturated ring, making it a cyclic ether (like a pyran ring) but fully hydrogenated except for the oxygen. Wait, no, pyran is the six-membered oxygen ring, but tetrahydro would mean four hydrogenations—so the ring is fully saturated except for one double bond? Hmm, wait, no, I think tetrahydro-2H-pyran would have one double bond. Wait, maybe I should count the hydrogen. Alternatively, perhaps I should draw it.

Wait, the product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one
