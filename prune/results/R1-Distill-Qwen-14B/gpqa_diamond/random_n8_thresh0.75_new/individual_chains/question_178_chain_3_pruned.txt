Okay, so I'm faced with this Lagrangian problem, and I need to figure out the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about Lagrangians and renormalizability.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. So that's the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. And F^{μν} is the field strength tensor, likely from electromagnetism or another gauge theory.

I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of the coupling constants determines renormalizability. The idea is that a renormalizable theory has couplings with mass dimension less than or equal to 4 (in 4 spacetime dimensions). If the dimension is higher, the theory is nonrenormalizable and requires a cutoff.

So to find the mass dimension of κ, I need to compute the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian must be dimensionless because when you integrate it over spacetime (which has dimension 4), the action (which is dimensionless) is the integral of L d^4x. So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

Let me break down L_int. It's κ multiplied by ψ̄, then σ_{μν}, ψ, and F^{μν}. So each of these terms has their own dimensions.

First, what's the dimension of ψ? In four dimensions, a Dirac spinor ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because in the Dirac equation, the term i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ must have the same dimension as the mass term m ψ. So each ψ has dimension 3/2.

So ψ̄ has the same dimension as ψ, which is 3/2.

Now, σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices. Since each gamma matrix is dimensionless (they are just matrices), σ_{μν} is dimensionless.

Next, F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. The field strength for electromagnetism is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ, where A is a gauge field. The gauge field A has mass dimension 1, because the covariant derivative is ∂ - i e A, and ∂ has dimension 1. So A has dimension 1. Then, the derivatives in F bring each term to dimension 2 (since each ∂ is dimension 1), so F has dimension 2.

Putting it all together: ψ̄ has (3/2), σ is 0, ψ is (3/2), F is 2. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F is (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = 3/2 * 2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. Wait, that's 5? But the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. Because L has to have mass dimension 4 in 4D so that the action (integrated over 4D) is dimensionless.

Wait, that can't be right. Because each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So the entire term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F must have dimension 4.

So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimension 5. So κ must have dimension 4 - 5 = -1.

Because (κ) * 5 = 4 → κ has dimension (4 -5)= -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. So looking at the options, that would eliminate options B and D, which have dimension 1.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the coupling's mass dimension. In 4D, couplings with dimension ≤ 4 are renormalizable. Because the dimension is the number of factors of energy (or momentum) that appear in the amplitude.

Wait, wait. Another way: for a term in the Lagrangian with coupling κ, the dimension is [κ] = (4) - (sum of fields' dimensions). So for the term to be renormalizable, the dimension of κ must be ≥ 0. Because, in a renormalizable theory, all couplings have positive or zero mass dimension. If the dimension is negative, it's a nonrenormalizable interaction.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The mass dimension of a coupling constant determines the superficial degree of divergence. If a coupling has a positive mass dimension, that implies that the term becomes stronger at higher energies (since dimension is like [Energy]^n), which can lead to a Landau pole, making the theory nonrenormalizable. Wait, no: in 4D, a coupling with dimension [κ] = (4 - sum of fields). So for example, in φ^4 theory, [φ] is
