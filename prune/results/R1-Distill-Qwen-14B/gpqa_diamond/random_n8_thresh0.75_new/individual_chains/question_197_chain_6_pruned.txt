Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of IR and NMR spectroscopy. But let's take it step by step.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are usually involved in some kind of reaction, maybe a substitution or elimination. Wait, wait, more specifically, I think that when alkenes react with HI, they undergo a hydrohalogenation, adding HI across the double bond. But wait, red phosphorus is often used in the hydroboration reaction or maybe in the preparation of something else. Oh wait, no, another thought: red phosphorus and HI can also be used in the substitution of certain groups. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation or something else. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure, so maybe I should focus on figuring out what Compound X is first.

Let's look at the spectral data. The IR shows peaks at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which probably indicates an -OH group or maybe an alkyne. Oh, wait, but 3400 is broad, so maybe an -OH. Or maybe it's an alkyne C-H stretch, but the 2500 might be something else. Then, 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which usually corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be aromatic C=C stretches. So putting that together, the compound probably has an aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, and maybe an -OH group. Or maybe not an -OH, maybe an alkyne.

Looking at the NMR data: the 1H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet (bs, 1H). That's pretty high up, so maybe an aldehyde proton? Or an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the proton would be around 10-12 ppm and usually a broad peak because of hydrogen bonding. Alternatively, an aldehyde is around 9-10 ppm and also a singlet. Hmm, but 10.5 is a bit high for an aldehyde. Maybe it's a phenolic OH? But phenols are around 5-7 ppm, so that might not fit. Wait, another possibility: a conjug
