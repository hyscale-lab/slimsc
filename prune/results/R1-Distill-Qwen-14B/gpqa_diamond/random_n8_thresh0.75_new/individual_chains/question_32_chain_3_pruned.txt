Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons, so I think that's lithium-6 because Li has 3 protons and 3 neutrons makes it Li-6. 

Wait, actually, wait. Lithium typically has an atomic number of 3. So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, the mass number A would be 3 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 6. So the nucleus is Li-6. Got it.

The problem is asking for the energy of the RHIC. I remember that when dealing with relativistic particles, the energy isn't just kinetic; it's the total energy, which includes rest mass energy plus kinetic. But wait, sometimes in these problems, they just want the kinetic energy. Hmm, the question says "the energy of the RHIC", so I think it's the total energy, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the formulas.

The total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy. Rest mass energy is mc². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So to find E, I need gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy.

First, I need to calculate gamma. The speed v is 0.96c. So let's compute beta, which is v/c. Beta is 0.96. Then, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). Let me calculate that.
