Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let's try to think through it. I'm a bit rusty on my optics, but I'll take it step by step.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab?

Wait, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is toward the observer. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer as well. Both moving in the same direction. Interesting.

Wait, no, wait. The glass is moving toward the observer, but the beam is propagating through the glass. So the beam's direction is the same as the glass's movement. Because the glass is moving, and the beam is inside it.

I remember that the speed of light in a medium is c/n, where c is the vacuum speed and n is the refractive index. So in the rest frame of the glass, the speed would be 1/n, since c is 1 here.

But the glass itself is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So I think I need to apply a velocity addition formula here. Because the speed of the light in the lab frame will depend on the velocity of the medium (the glass) and the speed of light in that medium.

Wait, but in relativity, the velocity addition formula is (u + v)/(1 + uv), but that's for velocities close to the speed of
