Okay, so I have this astronomy question here. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, assuming stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The formula is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs, I think.

So, if stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number of stars in a given volume of space is constant. But since we're looking at parallax, which depends on distance, I need to think about how the number of stars in a certain range of parallax depends on that range.

Wait, parallax is in arcseconds, right? And it decreases as distance increases. So a star at a closer distance has a larger parallax, and a more distant star has a smaller parallax.

Now, if I consider a small range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, what's the number of stars in that range? Since the distribution is uniform in space, the number density (number per unit volume) is constant. But how does volume relate to parallax?

Oh, right! The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. Since plx is 1/d, where d is distance in parsecs, so d = 1/plx. Therefore, the volume at a certain distance is proportional to (1/plx)³. But wait, when considering a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd, the volume would be 4πd² dd. Oh, right! Because the volume
