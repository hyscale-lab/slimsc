Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Let's start by breaking down the reactions given and see what each part tells me.

The first reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents suggests a ratio of 1:8, so maybe A is something that combines with B in an 8:1 molar ratio. Bright red product... that makes me think of something like copper(II) sulfate, but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal compound that has a red color. Copper compounds can be blue or green, but maybe it's another metal. Oh wait, another bright red compound is mercury(I) nitrate, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction involving iron, but iron(III) compounds are usually yellow or brown. Maybe I should think about other possibilities. Another thought: perhaps it's a reaction forming a metal oxide. No, that's usually more of a solid. Wait, maybe the product C is a complex ion. Oh! Maybe it's a transition metal complex. For example, copper(II) reacts with ammonia to form a deep blue solution, but that's not red. Alternatively, something like cobalt complexes can be pink or blue. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitrate or sulfate with a high oxidation state.

Wait, the second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. So, 2 equivalents implies a 1:2 ratio. Gas D could be a halogen, like chlorine or something else. If D is Cl2, reacting with C would introduce Cl into E. But what's extremely hazardous? Maybe something like a sarin gas or another nerve agent? No, perhaps it's more likely to be a toxic gas. Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly reactive compound, like a cyanide or something else. Wait, but if C is a metal nitrate, then reacting with Cl2 could form a chloride. Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly oxidizing agent.

Wait, another clue: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is in water, it breaks down into A, F, and G. If F is strong and G weak, maybe F is HCl (strong) and G is HNO2 (weak), for example. Or maybe F is H2SO4 and G is something else. Wait, but G is a weak acid, so perhaps something like HNO2, HCN, or H2CO3. Alternatively, stronger acids like HClO4 are strong, but G is weak.

Wait, let me think about the products. If C is a metal nitrate, then when it reacts with water, it could hydrolyze. For example, suppose C is a nitrate of a transition metal. Let's say, for example, C is Cu(NO3)2·xH2O. When it reacts with water (maybe more water?), it would break down into Cu(OH)2 (which might precipitate, but perhaps the reaction is different) and nitric acid. But wait, if the reaction is C + H2O → A + F + G, then maybe A is the metal hydroxide or oxide, and F and G are acids. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces a strong acid and a
