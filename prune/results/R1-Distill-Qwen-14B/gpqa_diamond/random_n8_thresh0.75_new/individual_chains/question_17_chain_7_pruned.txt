Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me read it again carefully.

The question says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex? The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The given formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Wait, wait. I'm a bit rusty on EDTA complexes. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, meaning it binds metal ions. The Ca-EDTA complex is formed, and the formation constant tells us about the stability of that complex.

So, the formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA^4- combine to form the complex. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−. The K for this reaction is given as 5e10, which is a pretty large number. That suggests the complex is very stable because a large K means the products are favored.

The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. I'm assuming this is the concentration of the complex at equilibrium. So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and we need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in solution.

Wait, but wait a second. Since EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, it forms a 1:1 complex with Ca²+. So, the reaction should be Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA²−. The formation constant K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−}) = 5e10.

But in the solution, the total EDTA comes from both the free EDTA and the complex. Wait, but in this problem, I think we can make an assumption because K is so large. Because K is so big, the amount of free EDTA and free Ca²+ should be very small compared to the complex. So, the concentration of the complex is approximately equal to the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA. Wait, but wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, [CaEDTA²−] = 0.0
