Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst and figuring out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when the position of double bonds in alkenes are rearranged. Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal catalyst, right? It helps in breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's an equal mixture of enantiomers. So the molecule has a chiral center. Let me draw the structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond starts at carbon 1. So the structure is CH₂=CHCH(CH₂CH3)CH₂CH3? Wait no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But wait, 3-methyl would be a methyl branch on carbon 3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. So 3-methyl would be a methyl group attached to carbon 3, which is the third carbon. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, wait that can't be because the formula would be C6H12. Let me think again. 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent means five carbons, so positions 1 to 5. The double bond is between 1 and 2. Then, a methyl group is on carbon 3.

So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Or wait, wait. Let me write the structure correctly. Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. Adding a methyl group on the third carbon would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? But wait, that's 6 carbons. Wait no, wait, no. Wait, the base chain is five carbons, and the substituent is a methyl on the third. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Wait, that's five carbons in the main chain? Let me
