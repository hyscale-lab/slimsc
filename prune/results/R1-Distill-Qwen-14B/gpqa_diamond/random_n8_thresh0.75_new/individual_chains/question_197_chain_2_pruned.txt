Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically involved in the formation of an acid from an ester or maybe an alkylation reaction. Wait, no, another thought: I think when you have a hydroxyl group, like in an alcohol or a phenol, reacting with red phosphorus and HI can lead to the formation of an acid. Oh wait, maybe it's more about elimination or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction?

First, let me look at the spectral data given. The IR has peaks at 3400-2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, probably indicating an -OH stretch. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, so maybe a ketone or an ester. The peaks around 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are typical for aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound probably has an aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, and maybe an alcohol or phenol group.

Looking at the NMR data: there's a peak at 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet, which is a strong indication of an -OH proton, maybe in an aromatic ring (like a phenol) or a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids usually have broad peaks around 10-12 ppm. However, the IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is more like a ketone or ester, but not a carboxylic acid. Wait, carboxylic acids have a C=O around 1700 cm-1, but they also have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3000 cm-1. In the IR data, the 3400–2500 cm-1 region might include that. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but then the NMR has a 10.5 ppm peak, which would fit a carboxylic acid. But if it's a carboxylic acid, then the 1720 cm-1 might be a bit high. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. Because esters have C=O around 1720-1740 cm-1. So perhaps it's an ester group.

Let me think about the NMR again. The 1H NMR shows: 10.5 (bs, 1H), which could be a phenolic O-H or an aldehyde proton. But aldehyde would be around 9-10, and maybe a triplet or something else, but this is a broad singlet. Then 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)—this looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. So the aromatic protons are two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which suggests a 1,4-disubstituted benzene. So maybe a para-substituted ring.

Looking at the other peaks: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Let's see. The 0.9 triplet (3H) is probably a methyl group attached to something like a CH2. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is likely a methyl adjacent to a CH, maybe a CH(CH3) group. The 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) could be CH2 groups. The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) is a bit tricky—could be a CH group adjacent to something else.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with substituents. Let's think of the substituents. The IR suggests a carbonyl group. So maybe a benzene ring with a carbonyl group attached, like a ketone or an ester. But the NMR shows a 10.5 ppm proton, which isn't typical for a ketone. Wait, unless it's an α,β-unsaturated ketone or something else. Alternatively, maybe the 10.5 is from an aldehyde, but that would require a C=O around 1720, which aldehydes have. Wait, no, aldehydes have C=O around 1710 cm-1. So maybe it's an aldehyde.

But in that case, the aromatic ring would have substituents. Let's try to build the structure. Suppose the benzene ring has a substituent that's an aldehyde group (-CHO). But then the aldehyde proton would appear around 9-10 ppm as a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent CH2. Hmm, but in the NMR, the 1
