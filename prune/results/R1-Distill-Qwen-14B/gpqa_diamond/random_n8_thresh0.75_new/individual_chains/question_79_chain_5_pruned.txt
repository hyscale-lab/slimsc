Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. 

The question is about identifying a compound X after a reaction. The compound X has the formula C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, they provided the theoretical 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the product, and I need to identify Compound X from the given options.

Hmm, wait a second—1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Oh right! That's a common reagent used in the ring-opening of epoxides. It's a type of nucleophile, I think. Oh wait, no, wait. Actually, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, also known as DABCO, is used in the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of epoxides. But wait, in the presence of an acid or maybe under certain conditions, it can open epoxides. Alternatively, maybe it's a base? Hmm, no, I think DABCO is a catalyst in some reactions, but in the ring-opening of epoxides, especially in acid conditions, it could be acting as a nucleophile.

Wait, the reaction conditions are in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K, which is pretty high. So maybe it's an acid-catalyzed ring-opening. Let me think: epoxide ring-opening typically occurs under acidic or basic conditions. If it's using DABCO, which is a tertiary amine, perhaps it's acting as a base in a ring-opening. Or perhaps it's a catalyst for some other reaction.

Wait, no, I think DABCO is used in the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of epoxides to form the corresponding diol. Because DABCO is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So when an epoxide is treated with a nucleophile under acidic conditions, the ring opens. But wait, the reaction conditions here don't specify acid. The solvent is nonpolar, and the temperature is 403 K, which is about 130°C. Hmm, maybe it's an acid condition, but I'm not certain. But perhaps the product is a diol, but looking at the options, the starting material might be an epoxide.

Wait, the product's NMR is given. Let's look at the 1H NMR first. 

The 1H NMR shows:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s)
- δ 2.31 (3H, s)
- δ 6.75 (1H, d)
- δ 7.08 (2H, d)
- δ 7.68 (1H, d)
- δ 7.71 (2H, d)

So, first, the singlets at 2.28 and 2.31 ppm for 3H each. Those are probably methyl groups attached to something deshielded, like maybe carbonyl groups or attached to an aromatic ring. Wait, but in aromatic substitution, methyl groups next to the ring usually are around 2.3-2.5 ppm. So perhaps they're on a benzene ring adjacent to an oxygen, like in a styrene oxide or something.

Looking at the aromatic region: 6.75 (d, 1H), 7.08 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d, 1H), 7.71 (d, 2H). Hmm, that looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring with substituents leading to doublets and doublets of doublets. Wait, maybe it's a substituent pattern like a para-substituted benzene with another group, perhaps an oxygen or another substituent.

Wait, the aromatic signals are split into several peaks. Let's count the number of protons:

Total aromatic protons: 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6. Wait, that's 6 aromatic protons. So one
