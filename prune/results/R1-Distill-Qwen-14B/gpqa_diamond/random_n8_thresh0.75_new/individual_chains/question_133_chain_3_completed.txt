Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the steps, but let's try to work through it. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right?

Alright, the problem states that there's a solution with 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperatures are at 25°C, so that's room temperature, which is good because the Ka values are given for that temperature.

First, I think I need to find out how much each of these compounds dissociates in the solution and how they contribute to the phosphate species. The K's are given for H3PO4, which is a triprotic acid. So the dissociations are:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

Wait, but wait, the salts we have are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So when these salts dissolve in water, they'll dissociate into their ions. Let me think about the dissociation of each.

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.
Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (since the formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O, so when dissolved, it's Na2(HPO4)·2H2O → 2Na+ + HPO4^2- + 2 H2O).

So, the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Now, because these ions are conjugate acids and bases, they can undergo hydrolysis. H2PO4^- can donate a proton (acting as an acid) to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can donate a proton to become PO4^3-.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3- ions, which is the orthophosphate ion. So I need to find [PO4^3-] in the solution.

But how do these species (H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-) affect each other? I remember that when you have a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base, they can form a buffer solution. But in this case, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-; I think H2PO4^- is the acid form (since it can lose a H+ to become HPO4^2-) and HPO4^2- is the base form (it can gain a H+ to become H2PO4^-). So the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the problem is about PO4^3-, which is the next deprotonation step. So maybe I should think about the hydrolysis of HPO4^2- to form PO4^3-.

Alternatively, perhaps the system will reach an equilibrium where some PO4^3- is formed. Let me think about the steps.

First, I'll calculate the initial concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- from each salt.

Calculate moles of each salt:

Molar mass of KH2PO4 is given as 136.09 g/mol. So moles = mass / molar mass. 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007345 mol.

Similarly for Na2HPO4·2H2O: molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005612 mol.

So the solution has 0.007345 mol of H2PO4^- and 0.005612 mol of HPO4^2-.

The total volume is 0.2 L, so concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007345 / 0.2 = 0.036725 M

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005612 / 0.2 = 0.02806 M

Now, these two ions can interconvert via the second dissociation step of H3PO4 (since H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+). The Ka2 is 6.2e-8. Since H2PO4^- is the acid and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base, the reaction is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- with Ka2 = 6.2e-8.

But wait, in the solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- present. So this is a buffer solution, and the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 = log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.207 (since 6.2e-8 is 6.2 x 10^-8, so log(6.2) is about 0.79, so 7.207).

So pH = 7.207 + log(0.02806 / 0.036725) → let's calculate the ratio.

0.02806 / 0.036725 ≈ 0.764.

log(0.764) is about -0.117.

So pH ≈ 7.207 - 0.117 = 7.09.

Wait, but wait. pH is about 7.09. Now, considering the third dissociation, where HPO4^2- can lose another proton to become PO4^3-.

The reaction is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-, with Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

We can write the expression for Ka3: Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

We can solve for [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

But [H+] can be found from the pH. Since pH is 7.09, [H+] = 10^-7.09 ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

Wait, let me compute 10^-7.09 accurately. Let me compute 10^0.09 is roughly 1.23 (since log(1.23)=0.0899). So 10^-7.09 = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.09) ≈ (1e-7) * (0.123) ≈ 1.23e-8 M.

Wait, wait, wait. No: 10^-7 is 1e-7, but 10^-7.09 is 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.09). Wait, 10^(-0.09) is about 0.812. So [H+] is 1e-7 * 0.812 ≈ 8.12e-8 M.

Wait, let me compute 10^-7.09 more accurately. Let me think: pH is 7.09, so [H+] = 10^-7.09 = 10^(-7 -0.09) = 10^-7 * 10^-0.09.

What's 10^-0.09? Let me use logarithm tables or remember that log(2) is ~0.301, so 10^0.301=2. So 10^-0.09 is about 0.812.

So [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.812 ≈ 8.12e-8 M.

So [H+] is approximately 8.12e-8 M.

Now, we can plug into the Ka3 expression.

Ka3 = (8.12e-8) * [PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Which is [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / (8.12e-8)

Let me compute the numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02806 ≈ 5.05e-14.

Then divide by 8.12e-8: 5.05e-14 / 8.12e-8 ≈ 6.22e-7.

So [PO4^3-] ≈ 6.22e-7 M.

Wait, but let me check the calculation more accurately.

Wait, let me compute 1.8e-12 * 0.02806:

1.8 * 0.02806 = approx 0.050508. So 0.050508e-12 → 5.0508e-14.

Then 5.0508e-14 divided by 8.12e-8.

5.0508e-14 / 8.12e-8 = (5.0508 / 8.12) ) * 1e-6 →  approximately 0.6219 * 1e-6 → 6.219e-7.

So [PO4^3-] is about 6.22e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait. I think I might have made a mistake in the initial assumption. Because when both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present, the pH is determined by their ratio and Ka2. Then, using that pH, I compute the concentration of PO4^3-.

But wait, another approach: perhaps using the total phosphate species and considering all equilibria.

Alternatively, perhaps we should consider that the solution may also produce some PO4^3- via the HPO4^2- dissociation. But in this case, since we're in a buffer, maybe the PO4^3- is negligible unless the pH is very high.

Wait, but the pH here is about 7.09, which is slightly below the pKa2 of 7.207, so it's on the acid side of the H2PO4^-/HPO4^2- buffer. So the concentration of HPO4^2- is less than H2PO4^-, which is consistent with our earlier calculation.

Now, for the third dissociation, HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3-. So the concentration of PO4^3- depends on the [H+] and the concentration of HPO4^2-.

We found [H+] is about 8.12e-8 M, and [HPO4^2-] is 0.02806 M. So plugging into Ka3, we get [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02806) / 8.12e-8 ≈ (5.05e-14) / 8.12e-8 ≈ 6.22e-7 M.

Which is option A) 6.24e-7 M. So that's the answer.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts and the equilibria involving phosphate species. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O, dissolved in 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L) of water. The molar masses of KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O are 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol, respectively.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each salt
- Moles of KH₂PO₄ = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007345 \, \text{mol} \)
- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005612 \, \text{mol} \)

### Step 2: Calculate initial concentrations
- \([H₂PO₄⁻] = \frac{0.007345 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.036725 \, \text{M}\)
- \([HPO₄²⁻] = \frac{0.005612 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.02806 \, \text{M}\)

### Step 3: Determine the pH of the buffer
The solution is a buffer containing \(H₂PO₄⁻\) and \(HPO₄²⁻\), which corresponds to the second dissociation of H₃PO₄. The equilibrium constant for this step is \(K_{a2} = 6.2 \times 10^{-8}\), and its \(pK_{a2} = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.207\).

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
\[
\text{pH} = pK_{a2} + \log\left(\frac{[HPO₄²⁻]}{[H₂PO₄⁻]}\right)
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 + \log\left(\frac{0.02806}{0.036725}\right)
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 + \log(0.764) \approx 7.207 - 0.117 = 7.09
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \([PO₄³⁻]\)
The third dissociation of H₃PO₄ is:
\[
HPO₄²⁻ \leftrightarrow H⁺ + PO₄³⁻, \quad K_{a3} = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}
\]
The equilibrium expression is:
\[
K_{a3} = \frac{[H⁺][PO₄³⁻]}{[HPO₄²⁻]}
\]
Rearranging for \([PO₄³⁻]\):
\[
[PO₄³⁻] = \frac{K_{a3} [HPO₄²⁻]}{[H⁺]}
\]
From the pH, \([H⁺] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.09} \approx 8.12 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\). Substituting the values:
\[
[PO₄³⁻] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12})(0.02806)}{8.12 \times 10^{-8}}
\]
\[
[PO₄³⁻] = \frac{5.05 \times 10^{-14}}{8.12 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Final Answer
The concentration of orthophosphate ions (\(PO₄³⁻\)) in the solution is approximately \(6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to **Option A**.
