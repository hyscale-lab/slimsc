Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about buffer solutions and phosphate ions. Hmm, let me read through it carefully.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. That's 200 mL, right? And in this solution, there's 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the other salt. The temperature is 25°C, which I think is standard, so maybe some constants are known at that temperature.

The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2- or PO4^3-?) in the solution. Wait, orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, I think. Because H3PO4 is the triply protonated form, then H2PO4^- is dihydrogen phosphate, HPO4^2- is hydrogen phosphate, and PO4^3- is phosphate. So orthophosphate is HPO4^2-.

I remember that in buffer solutions, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is useful. But wait, what's the pH here? Because depending on the pH, different phosphate species will be present. Oh, but in this case, we have KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. So these are a conjugate acid-base pair, right? Because KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), and Na2HPO4 gives HPO4^2-.

So the solution is a buffer solution consisting of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation should help here. The equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Wait, which is which? H2PO4^- is the acid because it can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-. So in the equation, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

So, to use the equation, I need to find the pH of the solution. But wait, the problem doesn't give the pH. Hmm, maybe I can calculate it using the concentrations of the two salts and the pKa values.

Wait, the given Ka values are for H3PO4
