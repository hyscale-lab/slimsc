Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR and reaction mechanisms. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, so plugging in the numbers: C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. So (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2. Let's compute that: 18-9-1+1=9, 9/2=4.5. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, no, I think I made a mistake. The formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So X (halogens) is zero here. So 2*8 +2 is 18. 18 -9 -0 +1 = 10. 10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That makes sense. Five could be a ring and some double bonds or something like that.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H. That's probably an aldehyde proton because aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. But wait, the peak is a tripletâ€”so maybe it's coupled with two neighboring protons. Hmm, but in an aldehyde, the adjacent carbon is a CH, which would have two H's. Wait, but an aldehyde is RCHO. The aldehyde proton is H-C=O. The adjacent carbon would be the one attached to the aldehyde. So if that's a CH2 group, the aldehyde proton would be split into a triplet because each H on the adjacent CH2 would cause splitting. But wait, the adjacent group would need to have two Hs. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde attached to a CH2 group.

Then another peak at 6.98, doublet, 2H. And 6.51, doublet, 2H. Those look like aromatic protons. A doublet for each suggests they're in a para-substituted benzene ring. So if it's a para-substituted benzene, each set of H would be a doublet. So maybe two phenyl groups attached? Or perhaps a single para-substituted benzene with something else.

Then 6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad singlet suggests perhaps some exchange, like an -OH proton, but wait, that's 2H. Maybe an enol or something with two protons in an environment without splitting. Or maybe it's a double bond with two protons. Hmm.

Then 3.66 ppm, doublet, 2H. That seems like a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, maybe an oxygen. Like an OCH2 or something. Or perhaps CH2 between two oxygen atoms.

So putting this together, perhaps the structure is something like a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's think about possible structures. Let's count the carbons. If there are two benzene rings, each has 6 carbons
