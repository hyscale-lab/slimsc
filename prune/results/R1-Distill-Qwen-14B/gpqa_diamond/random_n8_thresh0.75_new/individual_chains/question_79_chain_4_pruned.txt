Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure this out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound X based on the NMR data of the product formed after a certain reaction. Hmm.

Alright, the compound X is C11H12O. The reaction it undergoes is with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, often used in deprotonation reactions, maybe for epoxide ring openings or something similar. Wait, but wait—epoxide ring opening... Oh right, in nonpolar solvents, sometimes such bases are used to facilitate certain eliminations or maybe acid-catalyzed reactions but in a different way. Hmm.

Looking at the product's NMR data. The 1H NMR has several signals. Let's look at the 1H first. The signals are:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s) → Two singlets, each integrating to 3H. These are probably two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't cause splitting, like maybe carbonyls or aromatic rings with substituents.

Then δ6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). So aromatic protons. The doublets suggest coupling with one neighboring proton. Let me think about the pattern. Maybe it's a substituted benzene ring with two substituents, perhaps in a para arrangement, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be a vinyl group—maybe like a styryl group or something similar.

Looking at the 13C NMR data. The signals are:

21.3 (1C, s) and 28.4 (1C, s). These are probably methyl groups attached to something that doesn't cause splitting, maybe a carbonyl or a carbon adjacent to an electronegative atom. Wait, 21.3 is a bit low for a regular methyl. Wait, maybe a carbonyl group nearby? Because in epoxides, the carbons are usually around 50-60 ppm, but maybe if it's something else.

Then a bunch of signals in the 125-140 ppm range—those are typical for aromatic carbons. 126.9 (2C), 127.1 (1C), 129.1 (2C), 130.3 (1C), 141.5 and 144.1 (each 1C). The higher values (140s) are sp² carbons, maybe carbons attached to oxygen or in an aromatic ring with substituents. The 197.7 ppm is a carbonyl carbon, which could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an epoxide? Wait, no, epoxides are usually around 50-60 ppm for the carbons. So 197 is probably a carbonyl—maybe a ketone or an ester, but let me think.

Wait, the starting material is compound X, which is the product of this reaction. So, the product's NMR suggests the presence of a carbonyl group because of the 197.7 ppm. So the product might have a ketone or ester group.

The options given are:

A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane
B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane
C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane
D) 2-styrylepoxide

Hmm, all these options are oxiranes, meaning they have an epoxide group. Wait, but in the product NMR, there's a carbonyl at 197.7. Oh wait, maybe the reaction is an epoxide opening? Because if X is
