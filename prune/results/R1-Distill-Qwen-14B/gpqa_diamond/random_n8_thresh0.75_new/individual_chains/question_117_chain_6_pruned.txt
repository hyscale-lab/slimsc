Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry and optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? So they have to have chiral centers or some kind of asymmetry that allows for such mirror images.

The question lists four compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. Let me go through each one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings connected by a single bond. I remember that biphenyls can have isomers if the substituents are arranged differently on each ring. Wait, but for optical isomerism, the molecule needs a plane of symmetry to lack. If the substituents are in positions that make the molecule chiral, then it would have optical isomers. Let me think about the structure. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each phenyl ring. Wait, so each phenyl has two nitro groups at 6 and two carboxylate groups at 2? Or no, wait, the formula is 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each ring has nitro groups at 6 and 6', and the other substituents are at 2 and 2'â€”so each ring has two substituents. So, if the substituents are such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it could be chiral. For biphenyls, the arrangement of substituents can lead to cis and trans isomers. But wait, in this case, each ring has two substituents. Let me imagine: the two nitro groups are on one ring at 6 and 6' positions, but wait, each ring is numbered independently. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. Wait, no, 6,6'-dinitro would mean each ring has a nitro at 6. Similarly, 2,2'-dicarboxylate would mean each has a carboxylate at 2. So each ring has two substituents: a nitro and a carboxylate at positions 2 and 6, but wait, no, each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. So for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. But each ring's substituents are the same. So the entire molecule would have symmetry. Wait, no, the arrangement of substituents on each ring could be making the whole molecule chiral. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of whether the molecule has a center of chirality or a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl itself is chiral. Wait, biphenyls can have a sort of axial chirality. For example, if the substituents are on the same side or opposite sides. Oh wait, like in biphenyl derivatives, when the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image. So if the substituents are in positions that prevent a plane of symmetry, then yes, it can have optical isomerism. So in this case, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that when the rings rotate, the molecule can't have a mirror image, then it would have isomers. So I think compound 1 might exhibit optical isomerism. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Let's think: each ring has a nitro at 6 and a COOCH3 at 2. So on each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. So each ring is identical in terms of substituents. So would that make the entire molecule symmetrical? Because if each ring has the same substituents in the same positions, then maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry between the two rings. So perhaps this molecule doesn't have optical isomerism. Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to think about other options first and come back.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)CH2OH? Wait, let
