Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. But how do you calculate the probability of that happening?

The question says both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. Both have circular orbits. Oh, and their host stars have the same radii, but different masses. The host of Planet_1 is twice as massive as the one for Planet_2. Interesting.

Wait, I think the probability of a transit depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance. Oh right, the formula I remember is that the probability (P) is proportional to (R_p / a)^2 * (R_s / a), or something like that? Or wait, maybe it's (R_p / R_s)² times something else. Let me think.

Another approach: the transit probability is given by the formula P = (R_p / a) * (something), where R_p is the planet radius, a is the orbital distance, and R_s is the star's radius. But wait, I think the actual formula is more precise. Oh right, the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (something about the orbital distance and inclination). Wait, no, I think the formula is P = (2 * R_p / R_s) * (sqrt(1 - e²)) / (1 + (a/R_s) * sqrt(1-e²)), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so it simplifies. Let me get that right.

So for circular orbits, the transit probability simplifies. The formula becomes P = (2 R_p) / (a (1)) ), but wait, no. Let me think again. Another approach: the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, I remember that the probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a). So, P ≈ (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (R_s / a) ) = R_p²/(a R_s). Because the probability depends on how likely the planet's orbit is aligned edge-on from our perspective. The closer the planet is to the star (smaller a), and
