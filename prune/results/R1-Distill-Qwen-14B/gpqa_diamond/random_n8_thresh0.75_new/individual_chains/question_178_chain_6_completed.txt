Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about Lagrangian and renormalizability. Hmm, I remember that Lagrangians are crucial in quantum field theory because they dictate the dynamics of the system. The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2) times the commutator of gamma matrices, [γ_μ, γ_ν]. 

Wait, I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable. Right, mass dimension is about the scaling in terms of energy. For a term to be renormalizable, the Lagrangian term must have a mass dimension less than or equal to 4, because in 4 spacetime dimensions, renormalizable terms have dim ≤4.

So first, I should probably figure out the mass dimensions of each part of the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 because it's integrated over four-dimensional spacetime, so each term in the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4.

Breaking down the term: κ ψ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each field in the term contributes to the mass dimension. Let's list out the fields: ψ, σ_{μν}, F^{μν}, and κ.

I remember that fermion fields like ψ have mass dimension 3/2. Because in 4D, a Dirac spinor ψ has [ψ] = 3/2. Because the Lagrangian is dimension 4, and a term like iψγ^μ ∂μ ψ has dimension 4. So ψ is 3/2 each.

Now σ_{μν} is made from the gamma matrices. Wait, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_mu, gamma_nu]. Since gamma matrices are dimensionless, and σ is a product of two gammas, so σ itself is dimensionless. So the dimension of σ_{μν} is 0.

What about F^{μν}? F is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. The field strength tensor F is made from the derivatives of the gauge field A, which has dimension 1. Wait, A has dimension 1 because the covariant derivative is ∂ - i e A, and ∂ has dimension 1, so A must too. Then F^{μν} is ∂_μ A^ν - ∂_ν A^mu. Each derivative is dimension 1, and A is 1, so F has dimension (1 +1) = 2.

So putting it all together: the term is κ times ψ times σ times ψ times F.

Calculating dimensions:

κ is the coupling we need to find. Let's compute the dimension of the entire term.

Each ψ is 3/2, σ is 0, F is 2. So the term inside is: [ψ]^2 [F] = (3/2)^2 * 2 = (9/4) * 2 = 9/2. So the term is κ multiplied by a dimension of 9/2. The entire term must have dimension 4 because it's part of the Lagrangian.

So [κ] * (9/2) = 4 → [κ] = 4 * (2/9) = 8/9? Wait, that can't be right because 8/9 is less than 1. But wait, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me redo it.

Each ψ is 3/2. So two ψs give 3/2 * 2 = 3. The F is 2. So the product is 3 * 2 = 6. So [κ] * 6 must be equal to 4 (since the term is part of the Lagrangian which has dimension 4). So [κ] = 4 /6 = 2/3. Wait, wait, that's even worse. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in some dimension.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with F^{μν} dimension. Let me think again. The field strength tensor F_{μν} is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_mu. So A has dimension 1, so each ∂μ acting on A gives dimension 1 +1 = 2? Because ∂ is dimension 1, A is 1. So F has dimension 2.

So the term is: κ ψ σ ψ F. So the dimensions are:

ψ (3/2) * ψ (3/2) * F (2) = (3/2)^2 * 2 = (9/4)*2 = 9/2. So 9/2 comes from ψ^2 F.

So [L] = [κ] * (9/2) ) must equal 4 (since each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4). So [κ] = 4 / (9/2) ) = (4 *2)/9 = 8/9. So 8/9 is approximately 0.888. Which is positive but less than 1.

Wait, but wait. The Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So the entire term κ ψ σ ψ F must have dimension 4.

So [κ] + [ψ]^2 + [F] = 4.

[ψ]^2 is (3/2)*2 = 3. [F] is 2. So 3 + 2 =5. So [κ] must be 4 -5 = -1.

Oh! Oh wait, I see where I messed up. Because the term is [κ] multiplied by the product of the fields. So [κ] + [ψ]^2 + [F] = 4.

So the fields contribute 3/2 (ψ) + 3/2 (ψ) + 2 (F) = 3/2 *2=3 + 2=5. So [κ] must be 4-5= -1. So [κ] = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, about renormalizability. The theory is renormalizable if all the terms in the Lagrangian have mass dimension ≤4. Because each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, and any term with higher dimension would require higher-order counterterms, making the theory non-renormalizable.

Wait, but in this case, the term's dimension is 4 because [κ] is -1, and the product of fields gives 5: [κ] * (5) = 4? Wait no, [κ] is -1, so the term is (-1) +5 =4, which is correct. So the term itself is renormalizable because it's of dimension 4.

Wait, but wait, to check if the theory is renormalizable, the interaction term must have a coupling with dimension ≤0. Because the coupling's dimension tells us how it scales with energy. If the coupling has negative mass dimension, like here, it's marginal or irrelevant? Wait, in 4 dimensions, a coupling with negative mass dimension would imply that the term is nonrenormalizable. Because, in terms of perturbation theory, each vertex brings in a certain power of energy.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should think in terms of superficial degree of divergence. The superficial degree of divergence is calculated as D = 4 - (sum of dimensions of fields) + (coupling dimension).

Wait, no, the superficial degree of divergence formula is D = d - (n_F * [F] + n_B [B] + ... ), where d is the spacetime dimension, and n_F is number of fermion lines, etc. But perhaps I'm mixing methods.

Alternatively, I remember that in 4D, a renormalizable interaction must have coupling dimension ≥ 0. Because if the coupling has dimension [κ] = positive, then when you go to higher energies (or in higher loops), the coupling becomes stronger, but in a renormalizable theory, you can absorb the divergences via a finite number of counterterms.

Wait, more accurately, in 4D, the mass dimension of the coupling must be ≥0 for the interaction term to be renormalizable. Because if the coupling dimension is negative, then the interaction becomes stronger at higher energies, leading to a Landau pole and making the theory non predictive at high energies. Thus, such interactions would require an infinite number of counterterms, making them non-renormalizable.

In this problem, the coupling κ has [κ]_M = -1, which is less than zero. So this term would make the theory nonrenormalizable. Because the coupling has negative mass dimension.

So the theory is nonrenormalizable. Because the coupling is dimensionful with a negative dimension.

So looking back at the options:

Option C says [κ]=-1, theory not renormalizable.

Option A says [k]= -1, theory renormalizable. That can't be right.

Option D says [k]=1, theory not renormalizable. But our calculation says [k] is -1.

So the correct option is C: κ has mass dimension -1, and the theory is not renormalizable.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$. 

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The fermion field $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $[F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 2$.
- $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is a commutator of dimensionless gamma matrices, so $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0$.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The Lagrangian density must have mass dimension $4$ in 4 spacetime dimensions. The term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ contributes as follows:
- $[\bar{\psi}]_M = [\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0$.
- $[F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 2$.

Thus, the total dimension of the fields is:
\[
[\bar{\psi}]_M + [\psi]_M + [F^{\mu\nu}]_M = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]

The coupling $\kappa$ must ensure that the entire term has mass dimension $4$. Therefore:
\[
[\kappa]_M + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa]_M = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all interaction terms in the Lagrangian have mass dimension $\leq 4$. The coupling $\kappa$ has mass dimension $[\kappa]_M = -1$, which is less than $4$. However, in 4 spacetime dimensions, a coupling with negative mass dimension corresponds to an irrelevant interaction, which makes the theory nonrenormalizable. This is because such couplings grow with energy, requiring an infinite number of counterterms to absorb divergences.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
