Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass. But wait, the problem is about elemental abundances, so maybe the masses aren't directly relevant? Hmm, perhaps they're a red herring, or maybe they relate to something else like star formation or lifetimes, but the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. So perhaps the masses aren't directly needed here. Let me see.

The given data includes [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex and [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Also, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. The Sun's photospheric composition is given: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. So for the Sun, nFe/nH is 10^(-5.5), because 7.5 is 12 + log (nFe/nH), so log (nFe/nH) is 7.5 -12= -4.5? Wait, wait, let me recalculate.

Wait, wait. The formula given is 12 + log10(nX/nH) equals a certain value. So for the Sun, 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH =10^(-4.5). Similarly, for Mg, it's 7, so log(nMg/nH)=7-12=-5, so nMg/nH=1e-5.

But wait, what's the question again? It's asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So we need [Si]_1 / [Si]_2, I think.

Wait, no, the ratio of silicon atoms, but as a ratio of their abundances in each star. So, n_Si,1 / n_Si,2.

Wait, but how to get [Si] for each star? Because the given data is [Si/Fe
