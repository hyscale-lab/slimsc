Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and calculating the energy of the nucleus. Hmm, let me think. The question says that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c, and I need to find its energy. Oh right, X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium? So Li has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, its mass number is 3 + 3 = 6. So it's Li-6, right? So the nucleus is a lithium-6 nucleus.

So, the problem is about relativistic energy. I remember that for relativistic particles, the total energy is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the speed.

The formula for gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Here, v is 0.96c. Let me compute that. So plugging in v = 0.96c into the gamma formula:

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)
Let me calculate (0.96)^2. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me double-check that calculation. Oh wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, correct. So yes, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28. Let me compute that: 1 divided by 0.28 is 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

But wait, I should be precise here. Let me compute sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) accurately. Let me compute 0.96^2: 0.96 * 0.96 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784. Hmm, 0.28^2 is 0.0784 exactly, right? So yes, sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... So approximately 3.5714.

Now, the energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy. The rest mass energy is m*c². So I need to find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Li-6 has 3 protons, 3 neutrons. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So the total rest mass would be 3*(938) +3*(939.565). Let me calculate that.

Protons: 3 * 938 = 2814 MeV.
