Okay, so I need to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when these three solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I remember that neutralization reactions usually involve acids reacting with bases to form water and a salt. The enthalpy of neutralization is the energy change when one mole of acid reacts with one mole of base. For strong acids and bases, this is typically around -57 kJ/mol, but I'm not sure if that applies here since there are multiple solutions.

Wait, but wait, the problem mixes three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. So I need to find out how much acid and base are present in each solution and figure out the limiting reagent because that will determine how much reaction occurs.

Let me break it down.

First, calculate the moles of each substance:

1. HCl: It's a monoprotic acid. The molarity is 0.2 M, and the volume is 500 mL (which is 0.5 L). So moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl. Since it's HCl, it will donate 1 H+ per molecule. So 0.1 moles H+.

2. H2SO4: This is a diprotic acid. Each molecule can donate 2 H+ ions. The molarity is 0.3 M, volume 300 mL (0.3 L). Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles of H2SO4. Each mole gives 2 H+, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+.

3. Ba(OH)2: This is a strong base. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions. The molarity is 0.5 M, and volume is 200 mL (0.2 L). Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2. So OH- moles = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Now, when acids and bases react, the H+ and OH- ions combine to form water. The total H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4, and the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Total H+ = 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles. OH- is 0.2 moles.

The reaction between H+ and OH- is:
H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat (exothermic), so enthalpy change is negative.

But the H+ and OH- are from different sources, so I need to see which is the limiting reagent.

H+ total is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reactant. That means all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and there will be 0.08 moles of H+ left unreacted.

So the amount of water formed is 0.2 moles.

Wait, but wait. How does this relate to the enthalpy of neutralization? The enthalpy of neutralization is usually per mole of H+ or OH- reacting. But wait, the enthalpy is often given per mole of acid or base, depending on the context.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization (ΔHn) is defined as the enthalpy change when one mole of an acid reacts with one mole of a base to form water. For strong acids and bases, it's approximately -57 kJ/mol.

But in this case, the H+ comes from two acids, and the OH- comes from a base. So the total reaction is the combination of H+ and OH-.

But wait, let me think about the stoichiometry.

The reaction is:

H+ + OH- → H2O, ΔH = -57 kJ per mole (if considering strong acid
