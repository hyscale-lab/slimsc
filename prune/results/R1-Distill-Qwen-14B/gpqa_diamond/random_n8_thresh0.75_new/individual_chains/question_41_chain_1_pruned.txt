Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I remember that the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's refractive index. So normally, when light travels through a medium like glass, its speed is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum and n is the refractive index. But this problem adds a twistâ€” the glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, towards the observer in the lab.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer. And the light is propagating through it in the same direction as the glass's motion. I'm a bit confused about how the motion of the medium affects the observed speed of light. I think this has something to do with relativity or maybe the Doppler effect? Or perhaps it's a question of reference frames.

Let me break it down. In the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed is c/n, right? Because in that frame, the glass isn't moving, so the light's speed is determined by the medium's properties. Now, from the lab frame, which is moving relative to the glass (since the glass is moving at velocity v towards the lab), how does the light's speed appear?

Wait, but the lab is the observer's frame. So the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. Oh, so the light is moving towards the observer, same as the glass. So the question is: what
