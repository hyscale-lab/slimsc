Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. It's a bit complex, but I'll take it one reaction at a time. So, the starting material is (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. Let me visualize that structure. It's a cyclohexenone ring with a hydroxyl group on carbon 4 in the S configuration. The double bond is between C2 and C3, I think, because it's cyclohex-2-en-1-one. Wait, the numberingâ€”yeah, the ketone is at C1, so the double bond is between C2 and C3.

The first reaction is treatment with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBDMSCl) and triethylamine. I remember that TBDMSCl is a silylating agent, typically used to protect hydroxyl groups. Triethylamine acts as a base, probably deprotonating any acidic protons and facilitating the silylation. So, the hydroxyl group on C4 would be protected. So product 1 should be the silyl ether of the hydroxyl group. So, the OH becomes a TBS group.

Next, product 1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide to form product 2. Ph2CuLi is a Gilman reagent, which is used in conjugate additions. Conjugate addition typically adds a group to the beta position of a carbonyl. Let me think about the structure. The starting material after silylation is a cyclohexenone with TBS-O on C4. When the Gilman reagent is added, it would open the enone in a conjugate addition. The mechanism is that the reagent adds to the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl, so the copper would insert into the double bond.

Wait, the starting material is a cyclohexenone, so the conjugate addition would happen at the beta position. The Gilman reagent (Ph2CuLi) would add a benzyl group or something else? No, wait, the reagent is Ph2CuLi, which is a cupide, and when it reacts, it typically transfers its R group (in this case, two phenyl groups attached to CuLi) in a conjugate addition. Wait, no, actually, the R groups are on the copper. When the Gilman reagent reacts with an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, it adds the R group (from the reagent) to the beta carbon.

Wait, but in this case, the reagent is Ph2CuLi. So the R group is the part that's attached to the copper. So, when it reacts, the benzyl group (wait, no, wait, no, benzyl bromide is added next. Hmm, maybe the Gilman reagent is adding a benzyl group? Or perhaps the benzyl bromide is the electrophile in another reaction.

Wait, the process is: treat with Ph2CuLi, then benzyl bromide. Oh, perhaps the first step is a conjugate addition forming a new carbon-carbon bond, but then followed by an alkylation.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Product 1 is the TBS-protected starting material, so it's 4-TBSO-cyclohex-2-en-1-one. When treated with Ph2CuLi (a Gilman reagent), it would undergo a 1,4-addition (conjugate addition) to the enone. The Gilman reagent would add its R group to the beta carbon. Ph2CuLi has two phenyl groups on the copper and a lithium. So, when it adds, the phenyl groups would end up where? Wait, the Gilman reagent typically transfers a group from the copper to the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl. The general reaction is that the R group (like R-CuLi) adds to the beta position, and the oxygen gets a negative charge which picks up a proton.

But wait, no. The mechanism is that the reagent (R2CuLi) reacts with the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl.
