Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking about the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons, so I think that's lithium-6, right? Because Li normally has 3 protons, and if it has 3 neutrons, that makes 6 nucleons total. So Li-6 would have a mass number of 6.

The options are given in GeV, which stands for giga-electron volts. So I need to calculate the energy the RHIC imparts to the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. 

I remember that in relativity, energy is related to gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. The formula I think is E = gamma * m0 * c². But wait, in particle physics, they often use units where c is set to 1, so maybe the calculations are a bit simpler. 

So gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let me compute that. Let me plug in the numbers: v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c². Then 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784), which is 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, maybe I should be more precise. Let me check my calculator; 0.28 is 28/100. So 1/0.28 is 100/28 which is about 3.57142857... Yeah, so gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the mass of the nucleus X is that of Li-6. I need the mass of Li-6 in appropriate units. I think the mass of a nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c². So let's compute the mass of Li-6. It has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so 6 nucleons in total. So mass m = 6 * 938 MeV/c². Let me compute that: 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV. Oh wait, wait, 6 * 900 is 5400, plus 6*38=228 → 5628 MeV. That's 5.628 GeV/c².

So the rest energy (m0c²) is 5.628 GeV. Then the total energy E is gamma times that. So E = 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV. Let me multiply those numbers. 

3.5714 * 5.628 → First multiply 3.5 *
