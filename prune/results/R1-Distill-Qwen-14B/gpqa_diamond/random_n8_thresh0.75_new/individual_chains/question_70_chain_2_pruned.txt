Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think it through step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it my best shot.

The problem is about various chemical reactions and figuring out the molecular symmetry of a product E. Hmm, the options given are symmetry groups, so I'll need to determine the structure of E first.

Let me start by breaking down the reactions one by one.

The first reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents is a lot. I'm thinking maybe something like the Haber process, but that gives ammonia, which isn't red. Alternatively, maybe a reaction that forms something like a metal oxide or a compound with a lot of bonds.

Wait, another thought: when a solid metal reacts with a diatomic gas in a high ratio, perhaps something like aluminum reacting with chlorine, but that forms AlCl3, which is a white solid. Or maybe iron reacting with sulfur? Iron and sulfur react in a 1:1 ratio to form FeS, which is black. Not sure yet.

Wait, the product C is bright red. That makes me think of something like iron(III) oxide, but Fe2O3 is usually reddish. Alternatively, maybe a transition metal compound. Oh, wait, maybe it's a reaction involving a transition metal like copper or iron.

Wait, but the next reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. C is a product of A and B, and when it reacts with D, which is in a 2:1 ratio, it produces E. Also, C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids F and G. One is a strong acid (probably like HCl, H2SO4), and the other is a weak acid (like CH3COOH, or H3PO4 maybe? Wait, but those are more moderate. Alternatively, like HNO3 is a strong acid, but maybe other possibilities).

So, let's think about C reacting with water. If C is a metal oxide, then reacting with water would produce the corresponding metal hydroxide and an acid. Wait, but if the oxide is of a transition metal, like Fe3O4, but that's a bit more complex. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide? Wait, no, because sulfide reacting with water would form the metal hydroxide and H2S gas, which is a weak acid (since H2S is weak). But the problem says F and G are two different acids.

So maybe C is
