Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Compound A has a proton NMR with two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet means each proton is next to two others, and a quartet is next to three. Also, the chemical shifts can indicate where the protons are—like around 0.9 is maybe a CH3 group, perhaps attached to something like a CH2.

So, for Compound A, the triplet (0.9 ppm, 6H) probably comes from two equivalent CH3 groups next to a CH2. The quartet (1.3 ppm, 4H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to a CH3. Wait, let me think: if a CH2 is next to another CH2, which is next to a CH3, then each CH2 would split the next. So maybe it's a structure like (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, that's 2-pentane or something. Or perhaps it's a cyclopropane derivative? Wait, maybe it's a cyclohexane with some substituents.

Wait, another thought: the triplet and quartet could be from an ethyl group adjacent to a methyl group. Like if you have (CH3)2CHCH2CH2... but wait, the 6H in triplet—so two sets of three H each. So maybe it's a structure where two CH3 groups are attached to a CH2 which is next to another CH2 group. Like, perhaps a diethyl ether? No, because that would have more splitting.

Wait, another approach: if it's a cyclopropane with substituents. For example, cyclopropane with two ethyl groups attached. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted cyclohexane.

Alternatively, think of the NMR as a triplet for 6H: that's two groups of three H each. So perhaps two CH3 groups. Each is adjacent to a CH2. So each CH3 is next to a CH2 with two H. So each CH3 would split into a triplet, because each H is next to two H on the adjacent CH2.

Similarly, the quartet (4H) would be
