Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis pathways can be tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So, the target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let me draw that structure mentally. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, numbering... Oh, wait, I think the positions are actually 1, 2, and 3 in a meta arrangement? No, wait: the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions, but since benzene is a ring, numbering could vary. Let me clarify: the molecule is 2-tert-butyl, 1-ethoxy, and 3-nitro. So substituting positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So if I imagine the ring, ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at 3, tert-butyl at 2. Wait, that's a bit crowded, but perhaps that's how it is.

So starting from benzene, I need to perform a series of reactions to introduce these substituents in the correct positions.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of steps. Let me think about each step.

First, the substituents to add are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. Let me consider their directing effects.

Nitro is a meta director. Ethoxy is an activating, orth
