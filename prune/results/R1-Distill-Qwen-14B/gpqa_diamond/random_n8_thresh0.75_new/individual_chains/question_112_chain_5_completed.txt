Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try my best.

The problem says: We have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. We need to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator A, and also the average value of that operator.

Hmm. Let me break this down. First, I should probably normalize the state |alpha> because it's given as proportional. Then, find the eigenstates of operator A because the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate would depend on the projection of |alpha> onto those eigenstates.

Wait, but the operator A has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. So for a 2x2 system (since we're dealing with up and down spins), the matrix would look like:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, wait. Wait, because if i and j are the row and column indices. So when i != j, A_ij is hbar/2. So for a 2x2, the (1,2) and (2,1) entries are hbar/2, while the diagonals are zero. So the matrix is [[0, h], [h, 0]], where h is hbar/2? Or wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says A_ij is hbar/2 when i != j. So yes, the matrix is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

Wait, but what's the operator? Maybe it's the Pauli X matrix scaled by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So in that case, operator A is (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

Right, so the eigenstates of A would be the same as the eigenstates of sigma_x, because scaling by a scalar doesn't change the eigenstates, just the eigenvalues.

Wait, but the eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates of A as well. The eigenvalues for sigma_x are +1 and -1. So for A, which is (hbar/2) sigma_x, the eigenvalues would be (hbar/2)(+1) and (hbar/2)(-1). So the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Wait, but the question is about the eigenstates of operator A. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, the spin-up and spin-down along the x-axis. These states can be written in terms of |up> and |down> (which are the z-basis).

The eigenstates of sigma_x (or A) are given by:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The spin matrices. The eigenstates of sigma_x are indeed (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? Because sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix, which swaps |up> and |down>.

So, in that case, the operator A has eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, with eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2, respectively.

Now, the problem is to find the probability of measuring the system in each of these eigenstates when the system is in state |alpha>.

So, first, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, or project |alpha> onto these eigenstates and find the probabilities.

Wait, but |alpha> is given in terms of |up> and |down>, which are the eigenstates of sigma_z. So perhaps I should first normalize |alpha>, then express it in terms of the eigenstates of A, and then find the probabilities.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate of A to find the probability.

But before that, I should normalize |alpha> because it's given as proportional. So let's compute the normalization factor.

The state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let me compute the norm squared. The inner product is (1-i)(2 + i) + (2 + i)(1 - i), because |up> and |down> are orthonormal.

Wait, wait. The state is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The normalization factor is the square root of the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients.

So, let me compute |1+i|^2 and |2 - i|^2.

|1 + i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

|2 - i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So the total squared norm is 2 + 5 =7. Thus, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> all multiplied by 1/sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Now, the eigenstates of A are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So the probability of measuring +x is |<+x| alpha>|², and similarly for -x.

So let's compute <+x | alpha>.

First, expand <+x| alpha>:

= [ ( <+x | up> ) (1+i) ) + ( <+x | down> ) (2 - i) ) ] / sqrt(7)

But <+x | up> is 1/sqrt(2), and <+x | down> is 1/sqrt(2), because |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

So:

= [ (1/sqrt(2))(1+i) + (1/sqrt(2))(2 - i) ) ] / sqrt(7)

Factor 1/sqrt(2) out:

= [ (1+i + 2 -i) / sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(7)

Simplify numerator: 1 + i +2 -i = 3.

So:

= (3) / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) )

So the absolute square is (3^2) / (2 *7) ) = 9/(14). So the probability is 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check that calculation. Because if I have (1+i) + (2 - i) = 3. So 3/sqrt(2), then divided by sqrt(7), making 3/(sqrt(14)). Then the magnitude squared is (3^2)/(14) = 9/14.

Similarly, the probability for the | -x> eigenstate is |< -x | alpha> |^2.

Compute < -x | alpha>:

= [ ( < -x | up> ) (1+i) ) + ( < -x | down> ) (2 - i) ) ] / sqrt(7)

< -x | up> is 1/sqrt(2), and < -x | down> is -1/sqrt(2), because | -x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So:

= [ (1/sqrt(2))(1+i) + (-1/sqrt(2))(2 -i) ) ] / sqrt(7)

Factor 1/sqrt(2):

= [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ) / sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(7)

Simplify numerator: 1 + i -2 + i = (-1 + 2i)

So:

= ( -1 + 2i ) / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / (2 *7 ) = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.357.

Wait, but wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.357, so adding 9/14 (≈0.6428) and 5/14 gives 14/14=1. That makes sense.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.643 and 0.357.

Wait, but looking at the options, the probabilities are the first two numbers.

Option A says 0.64 and 0.36. Which is close to 9/14 (≈0.642857) and 5/14 (≈0.357). So 0.64 and 0.36.

Then, the average value of the operator A is the expectation value <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A has eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2 with probabilities 9/14 and 5/14, respectively, the expectation value would be (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) = (9 -5)/(28) hbar.

Wait, let me compute that.

(9/14)(hbar/2) = 9 hbar/(28)
(5/14)(-hbar/2) = -5 hbar/(28)
Sum is (9 -5) hbar/(28) = 4 hbar/28 = hbar/7.

Wait, that's the expectation value.

So the expectation value is hbar/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A: probabilities 0.64, 0.36, expectation hbar/7.

So that's option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the expectation value calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it directly using the matrix representation.

The operator A is (hbar/2) [[0,1],[1,0]].

The state |alpha> is:

(1+i, 2 -i) / sqrt(7), as a column vector.

So, to compute <A> = <alpha | A |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7))(1-i, 2+i) * A * (1+i, 2-i)^T / sqrt(7).

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

First, write |alpha> as a column vector: [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Then, A is hbar/2 * [[0,1],[1,0]].

So, compute A |alpha>:

= hbar/2 * [ [0*(1+i) +1*(2-i)] / sqrt(7), [1*(1+i) + 0*(2-i)] / sqrt(7) ]

= hbar/2 * [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (1 +i)/sqrt(7) ]

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> is:

(1/sqrt(7))(1 -i, 2 +i) * [ hbar/2 (2 -i)/sqrt(7), hbar/2 (1 +i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

Hmm, let me compute the dot product.

= (1/sqrt(7)) (1 -i) * (hbar/2)(2 - i)/sqrt(7) + (1/sqrt(7))(2 + i) * (hbar/2)(1 +i)/sqrt(7)

Factor out (hbar/2) * (1/(7)).

So:

= (hbar/2) * (1/(7)) [ (1 -i)(2 - i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ]

Compute each product:

(1 - i)(2 - i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) -i*2 + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i^2 = 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

(2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 +i*i = 2 +2i +i +i² = 2+3i -1 = 1 +3i.

Adding them together: (1-3i) + (1+3i) = 2.

So the total is (hbar/2) * (1/7) * 2 = (hbar/2) * (2/7) = hbar/7.

So the expectation value is hbar/7, which matches our earlier result.

So putting it together, the probabilities are approximately 0.643 and 0.357, and the expectation value is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, hbar/7.

Yes, that matches.

Option D has 0.61, which is close but not exactly 0.64. So the correct answer should be option A.


The problem involves an electron in the state |α>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, where |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator A, whose matrix representation is given by A_ij = ℏ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Additionally, the average value of A must be determined.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α>
The state |α> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. To normalize it, compute the squared norm of the coefficients:

- |1+i|² = 1² + 1² = 2
- |2-i|² = 2² + (-1)² = 4 + 1 = 5

The total squared norm is 2 + 5 = 7. Thus, the normalization factor is \(1/\sqrt{7}\), and the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\text{up}\rangle + (2-i)|\text{down}\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of operator A
The operator A has the matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\]

This corresponds to \((\hbar/2)\sigma_x\), where \(\sigma_x\) is the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates of \(\sigma_x\) are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{| \text{up} \rangle + | \text{down} \rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{| \text{up} \rangle - | \text{down} \rangle}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

These eigenstates are also eigenstates of A, with eigenvalues \(\hbar/2\) and \(-\hbar/2\), respectively.

### Step 3: Probabilities of measuring eigenstates of A
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \(|+x\rangle\) and \(|-x\rangle\) are given by the squared magnitudes of the projections of \(|\alpha\rangle\) onto these states:

1. Projection onto \(|+x\rangle\):
   \[
   \langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \langle \text{up} | + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \langle \text{down} | \cdot \frac{(1+i)|\text{up}\rangle + (2-i)|\text{down}\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{(1+i) + (2-i)}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}
   \]
   The probability is:
   \[
   P(+x) = \left|\langle +x | \alpha \rangle\right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643
   \]

2. Projection onto \(|-x\rangle\):
   \[
   \langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \langle \text{up} | - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \langle \text{down} | \cdot \frac{(1+i)|\text{up}\rangle + (2-i)|\text{down}\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{(1+i) - (2-i)}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{7}} = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}
   \]
   The probability is:
   \[
   P(-x) = \left|\langle -x | \alpha \rangle\right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357
   \]

### Step 4: Average value of A
The average value of A is the expectation value of A in the state \(|\alpha\rangle\). Using the eigenvalues and probabilities:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \left(\frac{9}{14}\right)\frac{\hbar}{2} + \left(\frac{5}{14}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)
\]
Simplify:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9\hbar}{28} - \frac{5\hbar}{28} = \frac{4\hbar}{28} = \frac{\hbar}{7}
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring \(|+x\rangle\) and \(|-x\rangle\) are approximately 0.643 and 0.357, respectively, and the average value of A is \(\hbar/7\). These results match **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
