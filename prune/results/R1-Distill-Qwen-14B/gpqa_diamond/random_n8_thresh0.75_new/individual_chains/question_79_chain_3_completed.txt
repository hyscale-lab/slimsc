Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. 

The setup is that Compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are given, and I need to identify what Compound X was from the options A to D.

Hmm, wait, what's the reaction here? 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane sounds familiar. Oh right, that's a common reagent used in the Hoffman elimination reaction. But wait, wait. Alternatively, isn't that the same as the base used in the Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement? Or maybe it's for epoxide ring opening. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think. When an epoxide is treated with a strong base like 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (which is a bicyclic amine, a strong, bulky base), it typically leads to an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. So the product would be an alkene. Because the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the epoxide oxygen, breaking the ring and forming a double bond.

Wait, so the product after reaction is an alkene. So the starting material was an epoxide, and it got converted to an alkene via elimination. So looking at the options, all the options are types of epoxides, because the product after elimination would be a styrene or similar.

Wait no, wait. The product's NMR is given, but we're told to find the starting material. So the product is from the reaction of Compound X (which is an epoxide) with the base. So the product is the alkene. So knowing the structure of the product's NMR can help us deduce the structure of the starting epoxide.

Let me look at the NMR data.

First, the 1H NMR:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

Wait, so there are two singlets for 3H each. That suggests two methyl groups, perhaps attached to something that doesn't split their signals. So maybe two methyl groups attached to the same type of environment, like maybe on an aromatic ring in para positions or something else, but more likely, maybe one is part of a substituent on an aromatic ring and the other is attached to something else.

But wait, looking at the 13C NMR data:

δ 21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).

Wait a second, the 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7. That's a high value. What carbons give that? A carbonyl group, like a ketone (around 205-220?), or maybe an aldehyde (around 95-100?), but wait, wait. Alternatively, an ester carbonyl is around 170. An acid carbonyl is higher. Wait, 197 is more like a ketone? Or maybe an epoxide's carbons? Wait, no, epoxide carbons are typically around 50-70 ppm. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe a carbonyl from an elimination, but wait, the product is an alkene, so it shouldn't have a carbonyl. Wait, unless I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no—wait, the product of an epoxide elimination is an alkene. So maybe the NMR is of the product, which is an alkene.

Wait, but the 13C NMR shows a peak at 197.7. That's a carbonyl. So maybe the product isn't an alkene but something else? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the starting compound is an epoxide. It's treated with a strong base—like for example, a Hoffman elimination, but more likely for epoxide ring opening. Wait, but under basic conditions, an epoxide can open via nucleophilic attack, but with such a bulky base, perhaps it's leading to elimination. So that would form an alkene. So the product is an alkene.

But in the 13C NMR, there's a 197 ppm signal. That doesn't fit an alkene. Wait, unless... Wait, I might have made a mistake. Let me think. Oh wait, what else has a carbon around 197? Maybe a carbonyl. But if the product is an alkene, why is there a carbonyl?

Wait another possibility: maybe the product is an epoxide, but that can't be. Because the reaction is a base-induced elimination. So the product should be the alkene. So maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not elimination but something else. 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong base, but sometimes it's used in the formation of epoxides as well. Wait, no. Wait, more accurately, it's a base that can deprotonate acidic hydrogens. Hmm. So in some cases, it's used in the formation of epoxides from alcohols via the SN2 mechanism, but that's when you have an alcohol and a good leaving group. Wait, but the starting material here is an epoxide. So perhaps the reaction is ring-opening.

Wait, but if the starting material is an epoxide, then the base might open it. For example, if the epoxide is symmetrical, the base could open it to form a diol. But if it's asymmetrical, the ring opening could form a conjugate base, leading to elimination. So perhaps the product is a diene or an alkene.

Wait, but the NMR shows a carbonyl. Hmm. Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an enol ether, which would have an oxygen but not a carbonyl. Or maybe the product is a ketone? But that doesn't fit with the reaction conditions.

Wait, maybe I should look at the structures of the options. Let's look at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So, oxirane is the epoxide. Structure would be a three-membered ring with two carbons connected by oxygen. The substituent is a styryl group at position 2, and the styryl group is 4-methyl. So the styryl group is a benzene ring with a double bond leading to a CH2 group.

Wait, so the structure would be something like (CH2CHPh) attached to the epoxide. Wait, more accurately, the oxirane (epoxide) has a substituent that is a styryl group. So the substituent would be CH2CHPh where the Ph is a benzene ring with a methyl group in the para position.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So the substituent on the oxirane is a propenyl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-C=CHPh. Wait, so the substituent is CH2-C(Ph)=CH2? No, wait, 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-C(=CHPh)-. Wait, maybe it's CH2 attached to a carbon that is double-bonded to a phenyl group. Not sure, perhaps it's a substituent like CH2-C(Ph)=CH2. Hmm, maybe not.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the oxirane ring has substituents at positions 2 and 3. Position 2 has a methyl group, and position 3 has a styryl group.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. So the epoxide has a styryl group attached at position 2. Styryl is a vinyl benzene group, so the substituent would be CH2-CHPh.

Wait, the product is the result after reaction with the base. So the product would be the alkene. So the starting material is an epoxide, and upon treatment with the base, it undergoes elimination to form a double bond.

So let me think about each option. For each epoxide, what would happen upon treatment with a strong base like 1,4-diazabicyclooctane?

Let's take option D: 2-styrylepoxide. So the structure is an epoxide where one of the oxygen-adjacent carbons is connected to a styryl group (CH2-CHPh). So when the base abstracts a proton beta to the epoxide oxygen, it would open the ring and form a double bond.

Wait, the epoxide is (CH2-CHPh-O-) and another CH2 group. Wait, no, epoxide is a three-membered ring. So let me draw it: the epoxide would have two adjacent carbons connected by an oxygen. Suppose one of them is attached to a CH2-CHPh group (styryl).

So the structure is:

O
||
C - C
 |   |
CH2-CHPh    something

Wait, maybe better to think as the epoxide being (CH2-CHPh)-O-(CH2-CH2?), no. Wait, perhaps I'm not getting it right. Let me think of the epoxide structure in option D. It's 2-styrylepoxide. So the epoxide is on a cyclopropane-like ring, but wait no. The epoxide (oxirane) is a three-membered ring where the two carbons are connected by an oxygen. So 2-styryl would mean that the substituent is on one of the carbons.

So the structure is:

O
||
C1 - C2

C1 is connected to a styryl group (CH2-CHPh), and C2 is connected to another group.

When the base is added, it abstracts a proton adjacent to the epoxide. The base is strong and bulky, so it would abstract a proton that's more accessible. The abstraction of a proton from either C1 or C2 would lead to ring opening and form a double bond.

Wait, but where would the hydrogen be abstracted from? Let me think of the structure.

Suppose the epoxide has a structure like this:

CH2-CHPh
   |
O
   |
CH2-

Wait, no. Let me think. The epoxide is a three-membered ring, so the two carbons (C1 and C2) are connected by an oxygen. Each is bonded to two other atoms. In 2-styrylepoxide, the substituent (styryl group) is on C2. So C2 is connected to the styryl group and to C1 and the oxygen. The other substituent on C1 is perhaps a methyl group or another hydrogen.

Wait, no, the starting compound is C11H12O. Let's look at the molecular formula.

Compound X is C11H12O. So the epoxide group is O, so the rest is C10H12. Let's see the options:

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. The styryl group is C8H7 (since styrene is C6H5-CH2-CH2?), no wait styryl is C6H5-CH2-CH2? No, wait, styryl is C6H5-CH=CH2. Wait, no, styryl group is a vinyl benzene, so it's C6H5-CH2-CH2? No, wait, styryl is the substituent where a benzene is attached to a vinyl group. So styryl is C6H5-CH=CH-.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option's structure.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. Structure is an epoxide where one of the carbons (the 2-position) has a styryl group. The styryl is C6H5-CH=CH2. So the epoxide would be:

O
|| 
C1 - C2 (with substituents)

C2 is connected to the styryl group (CH2-CHPh), and C1 is connected to another CH2 group (maybe a methyl? Or another substituent). Wait, but the formula is C11H12O. Let's count the carbons.

Epoxide (2 carbons) + O. The substituents: styryl is 8 carbons (Ph-CH2-CH2?), wait, no. Wait, styryl is C6H5-CH2-CH2, but actually, styryl is C6H5-CH=CH2, which is 8 carbons? Wait, no. Wait, benzene is 6 carbons, then CH2-CH2 would be 2 more, but that's ethyl, but styryl is a vinyl group attached to benzene. So it's C6H5-CH2-CH2? No, styryl is a substituent where the vinyl is attached to the benzene. So it's C6H5-CH=CH2, which is 8 carbons (6 from benzene, 2 from the vinyl). Wait, no: benzene (C6), then CH=CH2 is two more, so total 8. So 8 + 2 (epoxide carbons) + 1 oxygen. So the epoxide would have a molecular formula of C8+2= C10H10O? But Compound X is C11H12O. Hmm, so that's 10 carbons, but the formula is C11. So perhaps I'm not counting correctly.

Wait, maybe the substituent isn't styryl but something else. Let me think again.

Let's perhaps think about each option's structure.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.

Styryl is C6H5-CH=CH2. But 4-methylstyryl would be C6H3(CH3)-CH=CH2, which is 8 carbons (6 in benzene ring, two in the vinyl, plus a methyl substituent—so actually, the benzene has three substituents? Wait, no. 4-methylstyryl would be the vinyl group attached to the benzene, which has a methyl group in the para position. So the benzene ring has two substituents: the vinyl group and a methyl group. So the substituent is C7H7 (since benzene is C6H5, but with a methyl and a vinyl group, perhaps it's C7H7).

So the substituent is 4-methylstyryl (C7H7). So the oxirane (epoxide) would have two carbons: one attached to the substituent (C7H7), and the other perhaps a methyl. So the epoxide is C2H3O. So overall, C7 + 2 = C9H10O? But the formula is C11H12O. Hmm, that's 9 carbons, but we need 11. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, the substituent is 4-methylstyryl, which is C6H4(CH3)-CH2CH2. No, wait, styryl is CH2=CHPh. So 4-methylstyryl would be CH2=CH-C6H4-CH3. Wait, that's (Ethenyl group attached to a para-methyl benzene). So that's 8 carbons (6 in benzene, 2 in the ethenyl, 1 methyl on benzene). So substituent is 8 carbons.

So the epoxide (oxirane) has two carbons. So in option A, the structure would be:

O
||
C1 - C2

C1 is attached to the substituent (8C), C2 is attached to a methyl group. So total carbons: 8 + 2 + 1 (methyl) = 11. Oh wait, wait. Wait, no, the substituent is 8 carbons, but the oxirane's carbons are 2. So 8 + 2 = 10. But the molecule is C11H12O. So that's 10 carbons, but the formula is 11. Hmm, maybe I'm not getting the substituents correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent in option B is 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl. Let me think: prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C(Ph)=CH2? No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl group would be CH2-C(=CH2)-Ph. Wait, no. The structure would be CH2 attached to a CH group which is double-bonded to another CH2, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So it would be CH2=CH-CH2-. But with a substituent on C2 as phenyl. So structure is CH2-C(Ph)=CH2. Wait, that's 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl. So that substituent would be 6 (Ph) + 3 (propenyl) = 9 carbons? No, the propenyl is 3 carbons, plus the phenyl is 6, so substituent is 9 carbons?

Wait, but the compound's formula is C11H12O. So substituent is 9 carbons, plus 2 for the epoxide (oxirane), so 11. So that would fit. So option B would have a substituent of 9 carbons (from 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl), epoxide 2 carbons, and one oxygen. So formula would be C11H12O.

Wait, but 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl might have a structure like CH2-C(Ph)=CH2. So when the base is added, the epoxide would undergo elimination. Let me think about how that would look.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm better off looking at the NMR data.

The product's 1H NMR shows:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So two singlets for 3H each. That suggests two methyl groups. Also, the aromatic signals: 6.75 (d, 1H), 7.08 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d, 1H), 7.71 (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring with substituents on either side.

Wait, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents: one is a methyl group and another is an electron-withdrawing group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 1,4-disubstituted ring.

Wait, the aromatic signals in the 1H NMR:

- 6.75 (d, 1H)
- 7.08 (d, 2H)
- 7.68 (d, 1H)
- 7.71 (d, 2H)

Hmm, perhaps there are two doublets each integrating for 2H. Or wait, let's think about substitution. Maybe it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene with one substituent being a methyl group and the other being an oxygen-containing group, like an ester or something else. But the 13C NMR shows a carbonyl at 197.7 ppm, which is high, more like a ketone. But wait, in the product, if the starting material was an epoxide and it underwent elimination, the product would be an alkene, which doesn't have a carbonyl. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the 13C NMR data.

The 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is high. That suggests a carbonyl group. So maybe the product has a carbonyl. But why would elimination from an epoxide produce a carbonyl? That doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but some other process. Wait, another thought: maybe the base is causing a rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement. For example, if the epoxide is part of a bicyclic structure, treatment with a strong base could cause a hydride shift, leading to a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a lactone or another cyclic structure. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps looking at the 13C NMR data more carefully. The data is:

δ 21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).

So the high ppm (197.7) is a carbonyl. Let's see the other carbons. There are two sets of 2C at 126.9 and 129.1, which are likely aromatic carbons. Then 130.3 is another aromatic carbon, perhaps a substituted one. The 141.5 and 144.1 are probably quaternary carbons in the aromatic ring, maybe attached to substituents.

The two singlets at 21.3 and 28.4 are probably two methyl groups attached to non-splitting environments, like being attached to a carbon that doesn't have neighboring hydrogens (like CH3 groups attached to a quaternary carbon or an aromatic ring).

So, the structure likely has two methyl groups, aromatic carbons, and a ketone. So the product is a ketone with an aromatic ring and two methyl groups.

But wait, the reaction was between an epoxide and a base to form this product. So how does an epoxide lead to a ketone? That seems odd. Unless the base is causing some kind of rearrangement.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the starting material is an epoxide that, upon ring-opening, forms a carbonyl group. But that's only possible if the ring-opening leads to oxidation, which would require an oxidizing agent. But the reaction conditions here don't suggest oxidation. The base is 1,4-diazabicyclooctane, which is a strong base but not an oxidizing agent.

Alternatively, maybe the product isn't a ketone, but I'm misinterpreting the 13C NMR. Let me think, 197.7 ppm is a carbonyl. Let's think about possible structures with a carbonyl, two methyl groups, and aromatic signals.

Wait, perhaps the product is acetophenone derivative. For example, maybe it's 4-methylacetophenone. But wait, let's think about the aromatic signals.

But then the acetophenone has a ketone (197 ppm), a methyl group attached to the carbonyl, and a methyl group on the benzene ring. Let me see:

If the structure is 4-methylacetophenone, the aromatic ring would have a methyl at para position and a ketone group (as an acetyl) at another position. The NMR would show two methyl singlets: one from the acetyl (around 21-23 ppm) and another from the para methyl (maybe around 28 ppm if attached to the ring). Then the aromatic protons would be two doublets (o and m positions) and perhaps a singlet if there's symmetry. But the 1H NMR data has four aromatic peaks, which suggests more than two substituents on the benzene.

Wait, another possibility: the product is a methyl group attached to a carbonyl, which is attached to a vinyl group, which is attached to a benzene ring. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a coumaranone or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a benzaldehyde derivative, but the carbonyl in aldehydes is around 190-205 ppm, so 197.7 fits. So maybe it's benzaldehyde with some substituents.

But then, let's think about the 1H NMR:

2.28 and 2.31 are two singlets, each 3H. So two methyl groups. If one is attached to a carbonyl (like an acetyl group), and the other is on the aromatic ring.

But in the 13C NMR, the 197.7 is a carbonyl. So if it's an acetyl group, its carbon would be around 205-220, but 197.7 is a bit lower. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone with some electron-donating groups which lower the chemical shift.

Wait, wait. Another approach: let's think about the reaction. The starting material is an epoxide. The reaction conditions are strong base (1,4-diazabicyclooctane) in nonpolar solvent, 403K for a day. So that's 130°C.

Epoxide under basic conditions can undergo ring-opening. But if the ring-opening leads to a carbonyl, perhaps via a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that requires a peracid, which isn't present here. Alternatively, perhaps a pinacol rearrangement, but that requires vicinal diols.

Wait, perhaps the epoxide is part of a cyclic ether, which upon ring-opening forms a carbonyl. Another possibility is that the epoxide is strained and under basic conditions, it could form a carbonyl via some rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe it's a Cope elimination or similar, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not elimination but a ring-opening via a different mechanism. Wait, but the product is a carbonyl, so maybe the epoxide is part of a structure that can form a carbonyl upon ring-opening. For example, if the epoxide is adjacent to a carbonyl group, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is in a position where ring-opening forms a carbonyl. For example, if one of the oxygens is attached to a carbonyl, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a lactone. So the epoxide could be part of a cyclic structure that upon ring-opening forms a lactone with a carbonyl. But I'm not certain about that.

Another approach: let's look at the possible structures after elimination. The product has a carbonyl. So perhaps the elimination forms a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide with a neighboring carbonyl group. When the base abstracts a proton, the epoxide opens, and the carbonyl is formed. But I'm not exactly sure how that would happen.

Wait, let's think about the 1H NMR of the product. The aromatic signals:

6.75 (d, 1H), 7.08 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d, 1H), 7.71 (d, 2H).

Hmm, perhaps it's a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene? Or maybe a 1,2,4-substitution. But the integration is 1H, 2H, 1H, 2H. That suggests two different substituents on the ring. For example, a methyl group and a carbonyl group.

Wait, if the ring has a methyl group (as one substituent) and a carbonyl group (as another substituent), perhaps in a para configuration. So the ring would have a methyl and a carbonyl group in para positions. Then the other positions would have hydrogens.

But let's think about the pattern. A para-substituted benzene would have two doublets for the two sets of equivalent protons. For example, the ortho protons to the substituents would be equivalent if the substituents are in para positions. Wait, but in this case, the product's aromatic signals are 1H (d), 2H (d), 1H (d), 2H (d). That doesn't seem to fit a para-substituted benzene.

Alternatively, the ring has two substituents in meta positions. But again, I'm not seeing how the integration adds up.

Wait, perhaps the ring has three substituents. Let's say a methyl group, a carbonyl group, and another substituent. But that complicates the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the aromatic ring is part of a vinyl group attached to a carbonyl. Like a styryl group attached to a carbonyl.

Wait, let me think of the possible product structure. If the product is an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group and two methyl groups, perhaps it's something like 4-methylacetophenone. Let me see:

In 4-methylacetophenone, the structure is Ph-C(O)-CH3, with a methyl group on the benzene ring para to the carbonyl group. The 1H NMR would show:

- The methyl group attached to the carbonyl: singlet around δ 2.5-2.6 (3H, s).
- The methyl on the benzene ring: singlet around δ 2.3 (if attached to the ring).
- The aromatic protons: the ortho and meta protons to the substituents.

Wait, in 4-methylacetophenone, the substituents are at para positions. The aromatic protons would be two sets: the ortho protons to the carbonyl and the methyl group. So the ortho protons to the carbonyl would be next to the substituent, so they would be deshielded and appear downfield. The meta protons would be between the substituents.

But in the product's 1H NMR, I see two doublets for 2H each and two doublets for 1H each. So maybe it's not para-substituted.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene with a methyl and a carbonyl group in the ortho positions. Then the aromatic protons would be in two different environments.

But I'm not getting the exact match. Alternatively, maybe the product is a coumarin derivative, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cinnamaldehyde derivative. But cinnamaldehyde has an aldehyde group, which would have a peak around 9-10 ppm in 1H NMR, which I don't see here. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a methyl ketone, like 4-methylpentan-2-one, but that doesn't fit the aromatic signals.

Wait, another thought: the product could be a benzophenone derivative. But in that case, the substituents would be phenyl groups, but the 1H NMR shows only two methyl groups.

Hmm. Maybe I should backtrack and think about the reaction again. The starting material is an epoxide (Compound X), and after reaction with a strong base, the product has a carbonyl group. So perhaps the base is causing a ring-opening that forms a carbonyl via some kind of keto-enol tautomerism. Or maybe it's a Claisen or Cope rearrangement, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or a similar structure. But that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a di-tert-butyl ketone, but that doesn't match the aromatic signals.

Wait, perhaps the product is a trityl group with a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and two methyl substituents. For example, 2,4-dimethylacetophenone. But not sure.

Wait, perhaps looking at the 13C NMR data again. The 197.7 ppm is a carbonyl. The 21.3 and 28.4 are likely two methyl groups attached to different environments. The aromatic carbons are at 126.9, 127.1, 129.1, 130.3, 141.5, 144.1. Those could correspond to a benzene ring with substituents.

Wait, perhaps the product is 4-methylbenzophenone? No, that doesn't have two methyl groups.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a substituted acetophenone with a methyl group on the benzene and another methyl group attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, but that would have one methyl group attached to the carbonyl and one on the benzene. Then in the 1H NMR, we'd see two singlets for the two methyl groups. Let me see:

In 4-methylacetophenone, the methyl on the benzene (para to carbonyl) would be a singlet around δ 2.3-2.4 (3H, s), and the methyl attached to carbonyl would be around δ 2.5-2.6 (3H, s). So that matches the two singlets in the 1H NMR.

The aromatic protons would be: the ortho protons to the carbonyl (two protons) would be around δ 7.4-8.0, and the meta protons (two protons) around δ 7.0-7.3. But in the product's 1H NMR, the aromatic signals are at 6.75, 7.08, 7.68, 7.71. That doesn't quite match the expected pattern for 4-methylacetophenone.

Wait, let me look for other possibilities. Maybe the product is something like 3-methylacetophenone. Then, the substituents are meta. How would the NMR look?

In 3-methylacetophenone, the acetophenone group is at position 1, and the methyl is at position 3. The aromatic protons would be a bit more complex, but perhaps the signals would be split into multiple peaks.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a di-substituted benzene with a methyl group and a ketone group in the ortho positions. But that might not give the correct NMR pattern.

Wait, perhaps the product isn't a simple acetophenone but something else. Let's think about the 13C NMR data again. The aromatic carbons are at 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s). So that's a total of 6 aromatic carbons. Wait, no, each of those is a different carbon. So perhaps the benzene ring has substituents that make some carbons equivalent and others not.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a para-substituted benzene with two substituents: one methyl and one carbonyl group. Then, the ring would have two substituents in para positions, making the ring have two sets of equivalent protons.

But in that case, the aromatic protons would be two doublets: one for the ortho protons and one for the meta protons. But the 1H NMR shows four peaks, which suggests four different protons, so perhaps the substituents aren't in para positions.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in a meta position, leading to four different aromatic protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the ortho positions, leading to more complex splitting.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the options again and see which one's product would fit the NMR data.

Let me consider each option and think about what the product would be after reaction with the base.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.

Styryl group is CH2-CHPh. So the structure is an epoxide with a substituent that's a styryl group (CH2-CHPh) attached to the 2-position of the epoxide. When the base is added, the epoxide would open to form a double bond. So the product would be a compound with a CH2-CHPh group and a double bond.

Wait, but how? Let me imagine the structure.

The epoxide is:

O
|| 
C1 - C2

C1 is attached to CH2-CHPh, and C2 is perhaps attached to a methyl group.

Wait, in option A, the formula is C11H12O. So after elimination, the product would have a double bond. So the product would be something like CH2-CHPh-CH2-CH2-O... No, wait, the elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, leading to a structure like CH2=CH-(CH2-CHPh), but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps it's a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a styrene derivative. For example, if the epoxide is at the end of a chain, elimination would form a double bond. But I'm not seeing the connection to the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the product after elimination is a substituted styrene, which would have aromatic protons and vinyl protons. But the product's NMR shows no peaks around 5-6 ppm which would be typical for vinyl protons. So perhaps that's not it.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane.

The substituent is 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl, which is a propene group with a phenyl attached to C2.

So the structure is O connected to C1 and C2. C1 is attached to a CH2 group, and C2 is attached to a CH group which is part of a propene chain that has a phenyl group. So when the base abstracts a proton, the epoxide would open, forming a double bond.

If the substituent is CH2-C(Ph)=CH2, then the elimination would form a longer chain with a double bond. But I'm not certain.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane.

This is an epoxide where the 2 and 3 positions have substituents: a methyl group and a styryl group.

So the structure would be:

O
||
C1 (CH3) - C2 (CH2-CHPh)

When the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the epoxide, the ring opens, forming a double bond. The product would have a conjugated diene or a longer chain with a double bond.

But I'm not sure how that would result in a product with a carbonyl group.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide.

The substituent is a styryl group (CH2-CHPh) attached to the 2-position of the epoxide. So the structure is:

O
||
C1 - C2 (CH2-CHPh)

When the base abstracts a proton, the epoxide ring opens, forming a double bond between C1 and C2. So the product would be CH2=CHPh connected to a CH2 group. Wait, but that would form a longer chain, perhaps leading to a structure like CH2=CH-CH2Ph? No, because the styryl group is CH2-CHPh.

Wait, eliminating H from which position? Let's say the base abstracts a hydrogen from C1. Then, the O would leave, and a double bond forms between C1 and C2, resulting in CH2=CH-CHPh. Wait, but that would give a propenyl benzene.

But the product's NMR doesn't show any vinyl protons (peaks around 5-6 ppm), which would be expected for a propenyl group. So perhaps that's not matching.

Wait, but perhaps the product is a transannular elimination, leading to a different structure. Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone, but I don't see how that would happen from an epoxide.

Another thought: perhaps the starting material isn't just a simple epoxide but has another functional group, like a carbonyl, which upon ring-opening forms a ketone. But I don't see that in any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't an elimination but a rearrangement. For example, the Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, which involves hydride or alkyl shifts in carbocation. But I'm not sure how that would apply here.

Wait, perhaps the base is causing a hydride shift in the epoxide, forming a carbonyl. But I'm not certain about the mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is part of a bicyclic system, and the base induces a ring-opening that forms a carbonyl. For example, if the epoxide is between two carbonyl groups, but that doesn't fit the given options.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Let's think about each option's structure and the product after elimination.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide.

Structure: epoxide with substituent CH2-CHPh on C2.

After elimination, the product would be an alkene. Let's imagine the structure becomes CH2=CH-CHPh connected via a longer chain. But I'm not seeing how that would give the NMR data with a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product isn't an alkene but a ketone. But that would require a different reaction mechanism. Alternatively, maybe the product is a cyclic ketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7 ppm, which is a carbonyl. So the product has a carbonyl group. So the starting material must have a structure that can form a carbonyl upon reaction with the base.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with a neighboring alcohol group. Then, the base could deprotonate the alcohol, which would form a good leaving group, leading to elimination and forming a double bond. But that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a hemiacetal, which upon ring-opening forms a ketone. But I'm not certain.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider which option's structure, when treated with the base, would form a product with a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but oxidation. But the reagent isn't an oxidizing agent, so that's unlikely.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a nucleophilic ring-opening of the epoxide. For example, the base could act as a nucleophile, attacking the less substituted carbon of the epoxide, leading to a diol. But that wouldn't form a carbonyl group.

Hmm, perhaps the base is leading to an elimination that forms a conjugated carbonyl. For example, if the epoxide is adjacent to a carbonyl group, elimination would form a conjugated double bond and a carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal with an epoxide ring. For example, if the structure is a cyclic hemiacetal where the epoxide is part of a five-membered ring. Then, the base could break the hemiacetal and form a carbonyl. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a di-substituted benzene with a ketone group and two methyl groups. So the aromatic ring would have substituents in such a way that the NMR shows four different aromatic protons.

Wait, maybe the product is 2,6-dimethylacetophenone. Then, the substituents are methyl groups at positions 2 and 6, and the acetyl group at position 1. The aromatic protons would be at positions 3,4,5. But I'm not sure how that would split.

In any case, I'm not making much progress, so perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's think about the options and their possible products.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. After elimination, the product would be a styrene derivative. But the product NMR doesn't show vinyl protons. So perhaps this isn't it.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. Upon elimination, the product would have a double bond between C2 and C3, leading to a structure with a styryl group and a double bond. But again, no vinyl protons in the product NMR.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. Upon elimination, the product would be a longer chain with a double bond. But again, no vinyl protons in the product.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Elimination would form a longer chain with a double bond. But no vinyl protons in product.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the product's structure. Maybe the product isn't an alkene but a carbonyl compound. How?

Wait, another possibility: the base could cause a pinacol-type rearrangement, but that requires vicinal diols. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Cope elimination, but that requires amines.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with an adjacent carbonyl group. For example, if the epoxide is part of a structure like O-CO-O, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that requires a peracid, which isn't present here.

Another approach: considering the 13C NMR, the two methyl groups are at 21.3 and 28.4. The 21.3 is likely a methyl attached to something electron-withdrawing, like a carbonyl. The 28.4 is perhaps a methyl attached to an aromatic ring (like a toluene methyl).

So the product has a methyl attached to a carbonyl and a methyl attached to an aromatic ring. The aromatic ring has substituents that split the protons into four peaks.

Let me imagine the structure: Ph-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that doesn't fit. Or maybe Ph-C(O)-CH(CH3)2? But that would have a different NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 4-methylacetophenone. Let's see: Ph-C(O)-CH2CH3, with a methyl on the benzene ring at the para position. The 1H NMR would show two singlets for the two methyl groups (around 2.28 and 2.31), which matches the data. The aromatic protons would be ortho and meta to the substituents.

Wait, in 4-methylacetophenone, the acetophenone group is at position 1, and the methyl is at position 4. The aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. The H at position 2 would be ortho to the acetophenone group, H at 3 would be meta, and H at 5 would be ortho to the methyl group. Wait, but 4-methylacetophenone's aromatic protons would actually have a particular pattern.

Wait, the acetophenone group has a strong electron-withdrawing effect, so the ortho protons would be deshielded and appear downfield, while the meta protons would be more shielded.

In 4-methylacetophenone, the aromatic protons would be:

- H at position 2 (ortho to COCH3): deshielded, downfield.
- H at position 3 (meta to COCH3): less deshielded.
- H at position 5 (ortho to CH3): deshielded.
- H at position 6 (meta to CH3): less deshielded.

But I'm not entirely certain about the exact chemical shifts.

The product's 1H NMR shows:

6.75 (d, 1H),
7.08 (d, 2H),
7.68 (d, 1H),
7.71 (d, 2H).

Hmm, that's four different doublets. So perhaps the aromatic ring has four different protons, which doesn't fit a para-substituted benzene. Maybe it's a 1,3-disubstituted benzene.

Wait, but in that case, the substituents would be in positions 1 and 3. Then the ring would have two substituents, and the protons would be in four different environments.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a trityl compound with two methyl groups and a carbonyl group. For example, 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl- something. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with two methyl groups and a carbonyl group. Let me think of the structure: maybe (CH3)2C=O attached to a benzene ring. But that would be acetophenone with two methyl groups.

But how would the substituents be arranged? Maybe in a way that creates four different aromatic protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzaldehyde derivative with a methyl group. But that doesn't fit the 13C data because the carbonyl would be around 190 ppm, which matches, but the 1H NMR would have an aldehyde proton around 9-10 ppm, which isn't present.

Wait, another thought: the product could be a substituted acetophenone where the benzene ring has two methyl groups in positions that create four distinct aromatic protons. For example, 2,4-dimethylacetophenone. Then the substituents are at positions 2 and 4, with the acetophenone group at position 1.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be at positions 3,5,6. Wait, no, that doesn't add up to four protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a disubstituted benzene with a ketone and a methyl group, leading to four distinct aromatic protons. For example, 2-methylacetophenone. The substituents are at positions 1 (ketone) and 2 (methyl). The aromatic protons would then be at positions 3,4,5,6. But that's four protons, which could give four signals.

But I'm not sure about the exact splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 2,6-dimethylacetophenone. Then, the substituents are at positions 1 (ketone), 2 (methyl), and 6 (methyl). The aromatic protons would be at positions 3,4,5. Wait, that would give three protons, which doesn't match the four signals.

Hmm. I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think about the possible structures of the options and their corresponding products.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. Structure is an epoxide with a styryl group (CH2-CHPh) attached to one of the carbons. After elimination, the product would be a longer chain with a double bond, perhaps something like CH2=CH-CHPh connected to another group. But the product NMR doesn't show any vinyl protons, so this might not be the case.

Wait, but the product's 1H NMR does show aromatic protons. So the product must have an aromatic ring. So the elimination product would include the aromatic ring from the styryl group.

So, if the starting material is option D, the product would have a styrene group (CH2=CHPh) connected to the rest of the molecule. But I don't see any peaks around 5-6 ppm in the product's 1H NMR, which would correspond to vinyl protons. So maybe this isn't the case.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the base isn't leading to an elimination but a rearrangement that forms a carbonyl. For example, if the epoxide is part of a bicyclic structure that rearranges upon base treatment to form a carbonyl. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a ketal or acetal. But that would require a carbonyl group, which I don't see in the starting material.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's think about the number of signals in the NMR.

The 1H NMR shows six signals, and the 13C NMR shows nine signals. So the product has nine distinct carbon environments. That suggests a relatively symmetrical structure or a structure with multiple equivalent carbons.

The product has two methyl groups, which are non-equivalent (since their shifts are different: 2.28 and 2.31). The aromatic region has four signals, indicating four unique aromatic protons, which suggests a 1,3-disubstituted benzene or similar.

Wait, perhaps the product is a 1,3-dimethyl- something. For example, 1,3-dimethylbenzene (which is meta-xylene) wouldn't have a carbonyl, so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted acetophenone with methyl groups in the meta positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 3,5-dimethylacetophenone. Then, the substituents would be acetophenone at position 1, methyl at 3 and 5. The aromatic protons would be at positions 2,4,6, which are equivalent in pairs, leading to two doublets.

But the 1H NMR shows four doublets, which suggests four different protons, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the product is a substituted benzophenone, but that's more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a coumarin derivative, but I don't see how that would fit.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should consider that the product isn't an alkene but a carbonyl, and the reaction leads to that. So perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or a similar structure.

Wait, another thought: the reaction could be a Dieckmann condensation, which forms a cyclic ketone from an ester. But the starting material isn't an ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with a neighboring carbonyl group, leading to a lactone upon ring-opening. But again, not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a ketone and two methyl groups, and the structure is such that the aromatic protons show four distinct signals. For example, if the substituents are at positions 1 (ketone), 2 (methyl), and 4 (methyl), the aromatic protons would be at positions 3,5,6. But that doesn't account for four signals.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a methyl and another is a carbonyl group, and the ring has two more substituents, but I'm not certain.

At this point, I think I'm not making progress. Perhaps I should look for the correct answer based on the options.

Looking back at the options, Option D is 2-styrylepoxide. If the product after elimination is a styrene, but the product's NMR doesn't show any vinyl protons, perhaps I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as I thought.

Wait, another angle: the 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7 ppm, which is a carbonyl. The product must be a carbonyl compound. So the starting material must have a structure that can form a carbonyl after reaction with the base.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide adjacent to a carbonyl group. For example, the structure could be O-C-O with a carbonyl group nearby. Then, upon treatment with base, the epoxide could open, and the carbonyl could shift. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with a carbonyl group, and the base induces a ring-opening to form a ketone. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D: 2-styrylepoxide. Because upon elimination, the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond, but I'm not seeing how that leads to a carbonyl.

Wait, I'm really stuck. Maybe I should just make an educated guess. The product has a carbonyl, which suggests that the starting material had a structure leading to carbonyl upon reaction. Since the reaction is with a base, perhaps the starting material was a cyclic hemiacetal, leading to a ketone. But none of the options seem to fit that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D: 2-styrylepoxide. Because the product after elimination would have a carbonyl group. Wait, but I can't see how elimination would form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is a benzaldehyde derivative, but then the 13C NMR would have a peak around 190 ppm, which matches 197.7. So maybe the product is benzaldehyde with substituents.

But without more insight, I'm not sure. I think I'll have to go with option D as the starting material, as it seems to fit the elimination scenario, even though I'm not entirely sure about the product's structure.


The question involves identifying Compound X (C11H12O) based on its reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in nonpolar solvent at 403 K for 1 day, and the resulting product's theoretical NMR data. The reaction conditions suggest a base-induced elimination, likely forming an alkene from an epoxide. However, the product's 13C NMR shows a carbonyl peak at 197.7 ppm, which complicates the interpretation, as elimination from an epoxide typically does not produce a carbonyl group.

### Key Observations:
1. **1H NMR Data**:
   - Two singlets for 3H each (δ 2.28 and 2.31), indicating two methyl groups.
   - Aromatic region shows four doublets (δ 6.75, 7.08, 7.68, 7.71), suggesting a substituted benzene ring with four distinct aromatic protons.

2. **13C NMR Data**:
   - A carbonyl peak at 197.7 ppm, consistent with a ketone or aldehyde.
   - Two methyl carbons at 21.3 and 28.4 ppm, likely attached to different environments (e.g., one near a carbonyl and one on an aromatic ring).
   - Aromatic carbons at 126.9, 127.1, 129.1, and 130.3 ppm, indicating a substituted benzene ring.

3. **Reaction Conditions**:
   - The reaction involves a strong, bulky base, which typically induces elimination to form an alkene. However, the presence of a carbonyl in the product suggests a different mechanism or a rearrangement.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**  
  This epoxide has a styryl group (CH2-CHPh) and a methyl group. Upon elimination, the product would likely form a styrene derivative. However, the product's NMR does not show vinyl protons (~5-6 ppm), and the presence of a carbonyl group is unexplained. This option does not fit the data.

- **Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane**  
  This epoxide has a propenyl group with a phenyl substituent. Elimination would form a longer chain with a double bond. However, the product's NMR lacks vinyl protons, and the carbonyl group in the product remains unaccounted for. This option is unlikely.

- **Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane**  
  This epoxide has a methyl group and a styryl group. Elimination would form a double bond, but the product's NMR again lacks vinyl protons. Additionally, the carbonyl group in the product cannot be explained by simple elimination. This option is also unlikely.

- **Option D: 2-styrylepoxide**  
  This epoxide has a styryl group (CH2-CHPh). Upon elimination, the product would form a styrene derivative. While the product's NMR lacks vinyl protons, the presence of a carbonyl group suggests a rearrangement or alternative mechanism. This option aligns most closely with the reaction conditions and the structure of the starting material.

### Conclusion:
Based on the reaction conditions, the elimination mechanism, and the structural features of the product's NMR data, **Option D: 2-styrylepoxide** is the most plausible starting material. The reaction likely involves elimination to form a styrene derivative, with the carbonyl group potentially arising from a rearrangement or side reaction.

Answer: D
