Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D with different pairs of pH values.

Hmm, right. So first, I should probably figure out what's happening during titration. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When they react, they form sodium acetate and water. The reaction should be something like CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

But wait, before that, let's think about the initial solution. We diluted the acetic acid with water. So I need to calculate the new concentration after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add 20 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40 cm³.

Molarity is moles per liter. So the initial moles of acetic acid are M * V. Let me compute that. 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Oh wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters. Yeah, so 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. When diluted to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), the new concentration is moles / V. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, the equivalence point comes when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So moles of acetic acid are 0.001, because we had 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001. So the moles of NaOH needed for equivalence are also 0.001.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume of NaOH needed is moles / concentration. 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question isn't about the equivalence point exactly. It's about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Wait, 25% titration would mean 25% of the way to the equivalence point. So that's 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

So for both parts, I need to calculate the pH at 2.5 cm³ and at 10 cm³.

Let me tackle each part step by step.

First, the 25% titration point.

At this point, some of the
