Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR problems can be tricky. Let me see what I can do. The question gives the molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data, and then we have a series of reactions happening. I need to figure out the structure of the compound and then determine the final product after each reaction step.

First, let's look at the molecular formula: C8H9NO. Breaking that down, I can calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C is 8, H is 9, X (halogens) is 0, N is 1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2 = 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be one ring and two double bonds or other combinations. 

Next, looking at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): A triplet around 9.7 ppm. That's quite upfield for an aldehyde proton. Wait, no, actually, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. A triplet might indicate coupling with two neighboring protons. So maybe an aldehyde group adjacent to a CH2 group.

Wait, the integration is 1H. So that's the aldehyde proton. But wait, another thought: sometimes aromatic protons can be around 7-8.5 ppm, but this is higher. So it's likely an aldehyde.

Then, 6.98 (d, 2H): doublet with two protons. Maybe aromatic protons in a para-substituted ring. Let's think, in a para-disubstituted benzene, the protons are usually as a doublet, each integrating to 2H.

6.51 (d, 2H): another doublet. Also two protons. Hmm, maybe another para-substituted benzene ring, but in a different substitution pattern? Or perhaps a substituent that's ortho to something else.

6.27 (bs, 2H): broad singlet, integrating to 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something, like an -OH group or a conjugated system. Or perhaps this is a coupling with another group. Wait, 2H as a broad singlet. Could this be a vinyl group adjacent to an oxygen, like an enol structure? Or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents that cause the H's to be deshielded but not split into a clear pattern, making it broad.

3.66 (d, 2H): a doublet for two protons. Around 3.66 ppm, that's a bit upfield for CH2. Could be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom like O. So maybe a CH2-O- group. Or perhaps a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl.

Putting this together, let's try to piece the structure. The aldehyde proton suggests an aldehyde group. Then aromatic protons, so perhaps two phenyl groups attached somewhere.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the atoms. So 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one N, one O.

If I have two phenyl groups (each C6H5), but that's 12 carbons, which is more than 8. Hmm, that can't be. So maybe not two benzene rings. Wait, perhaps one benzene ring and another substituent.

Wait, wait, maybe the compound has a benzene ring attached via a side chain. Let me think: maybe a benzaldehyde derivative, but with some substituents that account for the rest of the structure.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a diphenyl compound, but with some substituents.

Wait, let me count the carbons again. The formula is C8H9NO. So 8 carbons. Let's assume a benzene ring (6 carbons), then two more carbons elsewhere. So for example, a benzene ring connected via a two-carbon chain. But where would the O and N come in?

Wait, the O is in the formula as well. So perhaps there's a carbonyl group, ester, amide, etc.

Wait, the NMR shows an aldehyde proton, so maybe a benzaldehyde group. Then, perhaps the other part is a side chain with an amino group or something.

Wait, let me try to think of the possible structure. The NMR has a triplet at 9.72 (1H), which is likely the aldehyde proton. Then, 6.98 and 6.51 are two doublets, each 2H. That could be two sets of para-substituted aromatic protons. So maybe two substituents attached to the benzene ring, each in a para position. Or perhaps two separate aromatic rings.

Wait, but 8 carbons. Let's see: benzene (6 C), plus two more. Let me see, perhaps a benzene ring connected to a CH2-CHO group. But that would be C7H6O. Hmm, but the formula is C8H9NO.

Wait, perhaps the compound has a nitro group or an amine. Wait, the molecular formula includes an N, so maybe an amine group.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible structure based on the NMR.

The triplet at 9.72 (1H) – aldehyde.

The two doublets at 6.98 and 6.51 (each 2H). These could be two para-substituted aromatic protons. So perhaps there's a benzene ring with two substituents. Each substituent is another group. Let's say, the benzene is attached to a CH2 group that leads to another structure.

The 6.27 (bs, 2H) – could be protons on a conjugated system. Maybe a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl or something. Or perhaps this is a -CH2-O- group, but the 3.66 (d, 2H) could be the CH2 next to oxygen.

Wait, 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. If it's CH2-O, then maybe it's part of an ether or ester. Or perhaps it's a CH2 connected to a nitrogen.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is something like a benzaldehyde substituted with a group containing a CH2-O- or CH2-NH-.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a substituent that's a side chain containing an aldehyde and another functional group.

Wait, another thought: the triplet at 9.72 (1H) could be an aldehyde.
