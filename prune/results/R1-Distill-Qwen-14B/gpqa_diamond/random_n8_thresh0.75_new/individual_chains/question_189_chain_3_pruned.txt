Okay, so I've got this question here about particles and symmetry breaking. Hmm, I remember that spontaneous symmetry breaking is a concept in physics where the underlying laws are symmetrical, but the system as a whole doesn't exhibit that symmetry. This usually leads to the appearance of some sort of particles or excitations. 

The question is asking which of the options is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. The options are Phonon, Skyrmion, Magnon, and Pion. Let me think about each of them.

Phonon: I know phonons are quantized sound waves in a crystal lattice. They arise from the vibrations of atoms in a crystal. Wait, but I remember that in solid-state physics, when a crystal has a certain symmetry, phonons can be related to the broken symmetry. For example, in a solid, the translational symmetry is broken because each atom is in a fixed position. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Do phonons come from spontaneous symmetry breaking? Or are they more about the lattice vibrations without necessarily implying the broken symmetry of the vacuum state?

Skyrmion: Skyrmions are topological solitons in magnetism. They were originally considered as models for atomic nuclei, but more recently, they've been studied in the context of magnetic materials. Skyrmions arise due to the symmetry breaking in the magnetic order. So I think Skyrmions are definitely associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking.

Magnon: Magnons are the quasiparticles representing spin waves in a crystal lattice. Spin waves are the collective excitations of the magnetic moments in a material. I think magnons come into play when there's a magnetic order, which implies that the magnetic symmetry is broken. So magnons are linked to symmetry breaking as well.

Pion: Pions are the lightest particles in the strong interaction sector. I remember that in the theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking, pions arise as the Goldstone bosons when the chiral symmetry of the QCD vacuum is broken. So pions are directly tied to spontaneous symmetry breaking in the Standard Model.

Wait, going back to Phonon. I think in the context of crystal lattices, the phonon arises from the vibrations of atoms in a periodic lattice. The lattice itself has translational symmetry, but when it's in a solid state, each atom is fixed in position, so the symmetry is broken. But is the phonon a result of the spontaneous breaking? Or is it just the quantized vibrations on top of the already broken symmetry?

So the question is about effective particles associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. If the
