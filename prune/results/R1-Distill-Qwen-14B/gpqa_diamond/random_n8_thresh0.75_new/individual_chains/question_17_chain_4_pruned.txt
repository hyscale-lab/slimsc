Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution with EDTA. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, so it forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about that complicating things. The temperature is 25°C, which I think is standard, so maybe it's just for providing some constant.

The given K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. Wait, K here is the formation constant, right? Formation constants are for the reaction where EDTA binds to the metal ion. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. So the formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴−]).

Wait, but in this solution, the initial concentration is given as 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So that means that the solution is prepared by dissolving the complex, and it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA⁴- ions. But because K is so large (5e10), the dissociation should be minimal. Because a large K means the reaction favors the product, so the complex doesn't dissociate much.

So the concentration of free Ca²+ ions would be very low. How do I find that?

Let me think about the expression. The concentration of the complex, let's call it [CaEDTA²−], is 0.02 M. Let's denote the concentration of free Ca²+ as x. Then the concentration of free EDTA would also be x, because for each mole of complex that dissociates, you get one mole of each ion. Wait, no, no—wait, because when the complex dissociates, each mole gives one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA. So if the initial concentration is 0.02 M of the complex, and it dissociates by x, then [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA] = x, and [complex] = 0.02 - x. But since K is so big, x is going to be really small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So I can approximate [CaEDTA] as 0.02.

So the K expression would be K = [CaEDTA²−]/( [Ca²+][EDTA⁴−] )

Plugging the numbers in:

5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x)

So that becomes 5e10 = 0.02/(x²)

Solve for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10)

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12. Wait, 2e-2 is 2 *1e-2, so (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12.
