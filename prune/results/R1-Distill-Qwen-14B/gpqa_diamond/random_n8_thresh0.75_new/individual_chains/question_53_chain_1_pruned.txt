Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take a deep breath and start breaking it down.

The question is about identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectral data. The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, it's an aromatic compound with two substituents on a benzene ring, probably ortho, meta, or para positions. 

The FTIR spectrum shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl (C=O) stretch around 1700 cm^-1, which is a strong peak. So, the structure must have an ester group attached somewhere.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there are six signals. Let's decode what that means. 

First, the aromatic-H: two signals. So, the benzene ring has two different sets of protons. Di-substituted rings can have different substitution patterns. If the substituents are para, the ring would have two sets of aromatic protons: two doublets (each integrating for two protons). Wait, no. For para substitution, each substituent is opposite each other, so the aromatic protons are in pairs. Each proton would have two neighboring H's. So, maybe each substituent makes the adjacent H's equivalent. Wait, I need to think about this.

Alternatively, for ortho substitution, the ring would have two substituents next to each other. That would cause the aromatic protons to split into two different environments. Let's imagine substituent A is on position 1 and substituent B on position 2. Then, the protons on positions 3 and 6 would be one set, and positions 4 and 5 another? Or maybe positions 3 and 4, considering the substituents. Hmm, maybe if substituents are in ortho positions, the ring becomes meta to each other, leading to two different sets of aromatic protons. 

But wait, the NMR shows two signals for aromatic-H. So that suggests that the ring has two distinct environments for the H's. For a di-substituted benzene, this could happen in either the para or ortho cases. Let me think: in para substitution, the ring has two sets of equivalent Hs. For example, if substituents are para, let's say two ester groups. Then, the ring would have two sets of Hs each. So, two doublets in NMR for aromatic H. That fits with the given data.

Wait, but the substituents might not be the same. The di-substituted ring could have two different substituents, leading to more complexity. But the problem states it's di-substituted, but doesn't say if substituents are same or different. Hmm.

Wait, the ester group is one substituent. So the other substituent must be something else. Let's see the other NMR signals.

The NMR also shows two signals corresponding to vinyl-H: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Vinyl groups are part of double bonds, like in alkenes. So, there's a double bond somewhere. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton, and the doublet of quartets suggests coupling with two sets of protons. Wait, a doublet of quartets would mean two neighboring groups, each splitting the signal. Alternatively
