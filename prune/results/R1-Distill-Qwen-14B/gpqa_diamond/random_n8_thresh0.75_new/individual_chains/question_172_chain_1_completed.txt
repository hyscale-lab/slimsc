Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me think about what I know.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh, right, this has to do with the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the distribution of particles in different energy states in thermal equilibrium. Oh wait, the problem states that the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so that's the right approach.

The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38 x 10^-23 J. Wait, that number looks familiar. Oh! 1.38 is close to the Boltzmann constant, which is approximately 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K. Oh, so the energy difference ΔE is probably equal to k_B * T, but wait, no, wait. Wait, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly the value of k_B (Boltzmann constant) multiplied by 1 K. So ΔE = k_B * T, but wait, that can't be right because k_B * T is the typical thermal energy. So if ΔE is given as k_B * T, then T would be 1 K, but that's probably not directly needed here. Wait, but maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

The main point is the excitation levels. The ratio of excited to ground state is given by the Boltzmann factor. The ratio for star 1 and star 2 must be related to their temperatures. Let me recall the formula. The ratio is (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k_B T) )

In this problem, the excited state is higher in energy. Let me say that E_i is the higher energy level, and E_j is the lower. So for each star, the ratio of excited to lower state is given by that formula. But I think the problem says that the excited level in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So excited state population in star_1 is 2 times that in star_2. So let me denote N1 as the excited population in star_1, N2 as the excited population in star_2. So N1 = 2 N2.

But wait, the question says the energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J, which is k_B * T when T is 1 K. So ΔE = k_B * T, so T = ΔE / k_B. But if ΔE is given as 1.38e-23, which is k_B * 1 K, then ΔE = k_B * T => T = 1 K. But wait, that's only when the energy difference equals k_B times the temperature, which is a specific case. Hmm, but maybe that's not directly applicable since each star has its own temperature.

Wait, the problem is comparing two stars. Let me think about the Boltzmann factor for each. For star 1, the ratio of excited to lower state is (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k_B T1) ). Similarly, for star 2, it's (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k_B T2) ).

Assuming that the statistical weights (g_upper and g_lower) are the same for both stars, since the same energy levels are being considered. So the ratio for star 1 is N1/N_lower1 = (g) exp(-ΔE/(k_B T1)), and for star 2, N2/N_lower2 = (g) exp(-ΔE/(k_B T2)).

But the question says that N1 (excited) is twice N2 (excited). Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the excited level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. But I think the question is comparing the ratio of excited atoms to the same lower state in each star. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the excited state populations in the two stars is given. Let me see the exact wording: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps the ratio is (N1/N2) = 2. But that might not include the lower state. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the ratio of excited to lower state in each star.

Wait, but maybe the question is considering the excitation relative to the ground state. So for each star, the ratio of excited to ground is N_upper / N_ground = exp( -ΔE/(k_B T) ) * (g_upper/g_lower). If we assume that the statistical weights are the same for both stars, then the ratio for star 1 is (N1_upper/N1_ground) = exp( -ΔE/(k_B T1) ), and for star 2, it's (N2_upper/N2_ground) = exp( -ΔE/(k_B T2) ).

But the problem states that the excited level (upper) in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Wait, but that's not entirely precise. It says the excited atoms are twice as excited, but that could be in terms of their populations. So perhaps N1_upper = 2 N2_upper. Hmm, but each star's N_upper is relative to their own N_ground. Alternatively, perhaps the question is that the ratio (N_upper / N_ground) for star_1 is twice that for star_2. That is, (N1_upper/N1_ground) = 2 * (N2_upper/N2_ground). That would make sense because it's the excitation relative to their own ground states.

Wait, the actual wording is that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps the ratio of excited to ground is higher in star_1. So maybe (N1_upper/N1_lower) = 2 * (N2_upper/N2_lower).

If that's the case, then:

(N_upper / N_lower)_1 = 2 * (N_upper / N_lower)_2.

From the Boltzmann equation, (N_upper / N_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k_B T) ) * (g_upper/g_lower).

Assuming that the statistical weights are the same (g is same for both stars), then:

exp( -ΔE/(k_B T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k_B T2) )

I can take the natural logarithm of both sides:

-ΔE/(k_B T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k_B T2))

Rearranging,

ΔE/(k_B T1) - ΔE/(k_B T2) = -ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k_B):

ΔE/(k_B) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) = - ln(2)

Wait, but 1/T1 -1/T2 is (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2). So,

ΔE/(k_B) * ( (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2) ) ) = - ln(2)

Wait, but ΔE is k_B multiplied by some temperature? Because earlier I thought ΔE is k_B * T, but wait, since ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, which is k_B * 1 K. So ΔE = k_B * T0, where T0 is 1 K? So substituting that,

(k_B T0) / k_B ) * ( (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2) ) ) = - ln(2 )

So T0 ( (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2) ) ) = - ln(2 )

Wait, but T0 is 1 K, so:

( T2 - T1 )/( T1 T2 ) ) = - ln(2 )

Multiply both sides by (T1 T2 ), get:

T2 - T1 = - ln(2) * T1 T2

Rearranged,

T2 - T1 = - ln(2) T1 T2

Hmm, perhaps factor this differently. Let me see.

Wait, let's go back to the equation before substituting T0. The equation was:

(ΔE/(k_B)) [ (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2) ) ] = -ln(2)

But since ΔE = k_B * T0 (as T0=1 K), then:

T0 (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2) ) = - ln(2)

Which gives:

(T2 - T1) / (T1 T2) ) = - ln(2) / T0

But T0 is 1 K, so:

(T2 - T1)/(T1 T2) ) = - ln(2)

Wait, but then:

(T2 - T1) = - ln(2) * T1 T2

Hmm, but this seems a bit messy. Maybe I should approach it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again.

We have:

(N_upper / N_lower)_1 = 2 (N_upper / N_lower)_2

Which is,

exp( -ΔE/(k_B T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k_B T2) )

Take natural logs:

-ΔE/(k_B T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k_B T2))

Rearranging:

ΔE/(k_B T2) - ΔE/(k_B T1) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k_B):

ΔE/(k_B) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ) = ln(2 )

But ΔE is equal to k_B * T0, with T0=1 K.

So:

(k_B T0 )/(k_B) ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2 )

Which simplifies to:

T0 * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

But T0 is 1 K, so:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Which rearranged gives:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Looking back at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So that would correspond to option D.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So yes, that's exactly what we have here.

So the correct equation is option D.


The problem involves comparing the excitation levels of iron atoms in the photospheres of two stars, star_1 and star_2, under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), which is equal to \( k_B \cdot T_0 \), where \( k_B \) is the Boltzmann constant and \( T_0 = 1 \, \text{K} \). The key is to relate the excitation levels to the effective temperatures of the stars using the Boltzmann distribution.

The Boltzmann factor relates the ratio of populations in two energy states to the temperature:

\[
\frac{N_{\text{upper}}}{N_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T}\right) \cdot \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}}.
\]

For simplicity, assume the statistical weights \( g_{\text{upper}} \) and \( g_{\text{lower}} \) are the same for both stars. The problem states that the excited state population in star_1 is twice that in star_2, i.e., \( \frac{N_{\text{upper,1}}}{N_{\text{lower,1}}} = 2 \cdot \frac{N_{\text{upper,2}}}{N_{\text{lower,2}}} \). Substituting the Boltzmann factor for each star:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_2} - \frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \( \Delta E / k_B \):

\[
\Delta E / k_B \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Substituting \( \Delta E = k_B T_0 \) (where \( T_0 = 1 \, \text{K} \)):

\[
\frac{k_B T_0}{k_B} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
T_0 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Since \( T_0 = 1 \, \text{K} \), this reduces to:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches option D, which states:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Thus, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is given by option D.

**Answer: D**
