Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about some reactions and determining the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) Dâˆžh, D) C2v. I'm a bit rusty on my group theory, but I'll try to work through it.

So, let's break down the reactions first. 

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents... that makes me think of something happening in an octahedral geometry, maybe. Because 8 equivalents could imply a structure with six ligands, but wait, 8 is the stoichiometric number here. Alternatively, maybe it's a coordination number of 6, but 8 moles... Not sure yet.

Second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. So maybe it's a substitution reaction here. If C is a complex, reacting with D could be displacing something.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is hydrolyzed, it breaks down into A, and produces two acids. Since F is strong and G is weak, maybe F is something like HCl (strong) and G is maybe acetic acid or something weaker. But wait, the problem doesn't specify. So perhaps the hydrolysis is leading to the release of these acids.

Fourth reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So D and B combine to make H. Since H is a solvent, maybe it's something like water? But D and B are gases, so perhaps H is something like ethanol or another alcohol? Or maybe H is a protic solvent. Alternatively, if D and B are gases, maybe they form something like HCl gas? Wait, but D and B are both gases, reacting to form H, which is a solvent. Could H be something like HCl? But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm. Wait, maybe B is a halogen. For example, if B is Cl2, and D is H2, then H would be HCl. But HCl is a gas. Alternatively, maybe B is something else. Wait, but D reacts with B, in 1:1. So possible, for example, D is H2 and B is Cl2, producing HCl. Or maybe D is something else. Alternatively, maybe B is NH3? No, because B is a gas. Alternatively, perhaps B is CO2? Not sure yet.

Wait, let me think about the first reaction again. Solid A and gas B (8 equivalents) forms C. Maybe A is a transition metal, and B is a halogen. For example, if A is Fe, and B is Cl2, then maybe C is FeCl4? But wait, 8 equivalents would be 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of A. Iron typically has a valency of +3, so FeCl3 would require 3 Cl2 moles. But 8 is higher, perhaps a higher coordination number. Alternatively, if A is something else. Wait, another approach: perhaps A is a metal that forms an octahedral complex. For example, let's say A is Co, and B is Cl2. Then CoCl3 would require 3 Cl2, but 8 Cl2 would imply 8 Cl ions, so maybe a complex with a +4 oxidation state? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms a complex with a coordination number of 6. For example, if A is Co^3+, and B is Cl2, then CoCl3 has a coordination number of 6. Wait, but 8 Cl2 would mean 16 Cl^- ions? Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms an octahedral complex with a higher number of ligands. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is with another type of gas, like H2. But I'm not making much progress here. Let's think about the third reaction. When C reacts with water, it forms A plus two acids: F (strong) and G (weak). So maybe C has some metal ions that hydrolyze to produce these acids
