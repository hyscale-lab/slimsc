Okay, so I've got this question about solving higher dimensional heat equations using finite differences and parallel splitting. Hmm. Let me think through this. The question is about the key factor in converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one when using matrix exponential functions approximated by fractional methods.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with heat equations, especially in higher dimensions, the solution often involves methods like finite difference methods. These methods discretize the PDE into a system of equations, leading to a matrix form. The matrix exponential comes into play when solving the time evolution of the system, right? Because the solution can be expressed in terms of e^(-At), where A is the matrix derived from the spatial discretization.

Now, when it comes to parallel splitting, I think it refers to methods like the parallel alternating direction implicit (ADI) method, which breaks down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts that can be solved concurrently. This approach allows for parallel computation, which speeds things up.

The question mentions the matrix exponential is approximated by a fractional approximation. Fractional approximation methods... Oh, right! Techniques like the Padé approximation are used to approximate the matrix exponential. Padé approximants are rational functions that approximate a given function, like e^(-At), more accurately than Taylor series expansions, especially for larger time steps.

The key factor for converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one—so what's crucial here? Well, in the sequential case, you might solve the entire matrix exponential at each time step. But with parallel splitting, you probably decompose the matrix into parts that can be handled in parallel. Oh, I remember that methods like the exponential splitting or time-parallel methods require the matrix to have certain properties. For instance, if the matrix can be split into a sum of matrices that commute, you can apply each part's exponential separately and then combine them, which can be done in parallel.

Wait, but the options given are about the factors involved in the fractional approximation. So the question is about the key factor in the approximation method that enables the parallel conversion.

Option A: Stability analysis. Stability is important in numerical methods, but I'm not sure it's the key factor here for converting to parallel algorithms. It's more about ensuring the method works correctly over time.

Option B: Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions. Nonlocal conditions might complicate things, but I'm not directly connecting them to the parallel conversion. It's more about the setup of the problem rather than the method's parallelism.

Option C: Complex roots of fractional approximation. Hmm. Padé approximants have poles and zeros. The roots might affect the stability and accuracy of the approximation. If the approximation has complex roots, does that impact how the matrix can be decomposed for parallel computation?

Option D: Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation. Oh, partial fractions. Wait, I remember that certain approximations can be broken down into simpler fractions, which might allow for easier computation. For example, if the approximation can be expressed as a sum of simpler exponentials, each corresponding to a part of the matrix, then each part can be computed in parallel. So the ability to split the approximation into linear partial fractions would allow parallel splitting of the algorithm.

So the key factor is whether the fractional approximation can be decomposed into linear partial fractions. That would mean each part can be handled separately, enabling parallel processing.

Thinking again, the Padé approximant is a rational function. If it can be expressed as a sum of simpler fractions, perhaps through partial fraction decomposition, then each term might correspond to a part of the matrix that can be exponentiated and multiplied together. But wait, in the context of matrix functions, if the approximation can be written as a sum of terms that each involve a different matrix (or a diagonal matrix), then each term can be computed in parallel.

Alternatively, if the approximation leads to a matrix that can be diagonalized or decomposed into commuting parts, then their exponentials can be computed independently and combined. But how
