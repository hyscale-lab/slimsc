Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance, right? The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Like, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So, plx = 1/distance. Or wait, is it the other way around? Oh right, distance in parsecs is 1 over parallax in arcseconds. So if a star is closer (smaller distance), the parallax is larger. Makes sense.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. So their actual number density doesn't depend on distance. Hmm, but when we observe them, their distribution as a function of parallax might change because of how volume works with parallax.

So the number of stars per unit volume is uniform. But when we consider the number as a function of parallax, which correlates with distance, we have to account for how volume changes with distance.

Let me think about the volume. For a given parallax range, say from plx to plx + dplx, the corresponding distance is from d = 1/plx to d = 1/(plx + dplx). But maybe it's easier to think in terms of small increments. So, if plx increases by dplx, what's the change in distance?

Wait, plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let's take a small change in plx, dplx. The change in d would be approximately d(d) = - (d²) * dplx. Since d = 1/plx, so d² = 1/(plx)^2. So the change in distance is approximately -d^2 * dplx.

But wait, I'm trying to find the change in volume as I go from a distance d to d + dd. The volume around that distance is a spherical shell of radius d and thickness dd. The volume of a thin shell is 4π d² dd. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to 4π d² dd.

But since we want to express this in terms of parallax, let's substitute d with 1/plx. So, d = 1/plx → plx = 1/d. Let's find dd in terms of dplx.

dd = d(d)/d(plx) * dplx. Since plx = 1/d, d(plx)/dd = -1/d². So, dplx = - d² dd → dd = - d² dplx. Hmm, but when plx increases, d decreases, so I think the sign will take care of the direction, but for the volume, just dealing with magnitudes.

So, the volume element dV is 4π d² dd. Substituting dd from above, dV = 4π d² (-d² dplx). But wait, the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But for the number of stars, we're concerned with the magnitude, so perhaps we can write dV in terms of dplx.

Wait, substituting:

dV = 4π d² dd = 4π (1/plx)^2 (-d^2 dplx) ? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think again.

Wait, let me express everything in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, then d^2 = 1/plx^2. And dd = d^2 dplx? No, earlier substitution says dd = - (d²) dplx. So, dV = 4π (d)^2 * (dd) = 4π (1/plx^2) * (-1/plx^2) dplx. Wait, that would make dV proportional to -1/plx^4 dplx. But since dV is positive, maybe the negative sign is about direction, not magnitude. So perhaps the magnitude is 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx? That would be 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me re-express it correctly. Since d = 1/plx, so d = (plx)^-1. Then, dd = derivative of d with respect to plx * dplx. So, dd/d plx = - (plx)^-2 → dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx.

So, putting it into dV: dV = 4π d² dd = 4π (1/plx²) * (-1/plx²) dplx.

But since dV is the volume element, and we're considering the number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dd, the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But for the number of stars, which depends on the volume, we take the absolute value. So, dV = 4π (1/plx²) (1/plx²) dplx? Wait, no, because dd is - (1/plx²) dplx, so the magnitude is 1/plx² dplx. So dV = 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars in a thin shell around distance d (parallax plx) is proportional to the volume of the shell. Since the number density of stars is uniform (n), the number is n * dV. So, stars per unit plx would be n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, but the question asks for the number of stars per unit range of plx. So the number per unit plx is (number of stars) / (dplx). But in our case, the number of stars is n * 4π (1/plx^4
