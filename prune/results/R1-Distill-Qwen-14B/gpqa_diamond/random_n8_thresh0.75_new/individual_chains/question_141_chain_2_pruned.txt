Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. So the question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. Hmm, I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base and is often used in dehydrohalogenation reactions, especially for eliminating substituents from aromatic rings. Wait, but wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d â€“ that's a bit confusing. Oh wait, benzene rings with substituents have positions indicated by numbers. So 1-bromo and 2-d something? Maybe it's 1-bromo-2, something else? Wait, the formula is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene? Or maybe it's a typo and it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Or maybe 1-bromobenzene with a deuterium somewhere? No, wait, the formula is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, wait, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. Because 'd' might stand for something else. Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dichlorobenzene? Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,3-dichlorobenzene? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Maybe that's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene? Oh, that makes sense! So the benzene ring has a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium (D) at position
