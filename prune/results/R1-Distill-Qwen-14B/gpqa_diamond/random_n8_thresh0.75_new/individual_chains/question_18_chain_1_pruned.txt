Okay, so I've got this problem about the elemental abundances in two stars compared to the Sun. I'm a bit rusty on my stellar chemistry, but I'll try to work through this step by step.

The question gives me data about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Each has a mass that's a bit more than the Sun: 1.5 and 1.2 times, respectively. But wait, I don't think the mass directly affects the abundance ratios, so maybe I can ignore that part for now. The important stuff is the elemental abundances determined using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width. But since the problem states to assume LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), which is a common assumption in stellar atmosphere modeling, I don't need to worry about that complicating things.

The given data points are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = 7-12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5

Wait, but I think the notation is [X/Y] which is log(nX/nY) in base 10. So the brackets mean log10 of (nX/nY) minus log10 of (nX/nY in the Sun). Or wait, no—actually, the notation [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. So for example, [Fe/H] is the logarithm of the ratio of iron abundance compared to hydrogen, relative to the Sun.

So let me parse each abundance.

Starting with Star_1:
[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log(nFe/nH)_1 - log(nFe/nH)_sun = 0 → log(nFe/nH)_1 = log(nFe/nH)_sun → nFe/nH in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. So nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi/nFe)_1 - log(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3 → So (nSi1)/(nFe1) = 10^(0.3) * (nSisun / nFesun) 

Wait, because [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So for [Si/Fe]_1=0.3, that is log(nSi1/nFe1) = 0.3 + log(nSisun / nFesun). So nSi1/nFe1 = 10^0.3 * (nSisun / nFesun).

But since Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0, nFe1/nH1 is same as solar. So nFe1 = (nFe_sun) * (nH1 / nH_sun).

Wait, but nH is the hydrogen density. So in Star_1, nH1 = nH_sun * (nH_sun / nH1) ? Wait, no, because [Fe/H] is 0, so nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun. So nFe1 = nFe_sun * (nH1 / nH_sun). And nH1 is... hmm, but without knowing the total density, maybe it's better to express everything in terms of solar ratios.

Let me think in terms of the number ratios.

Let me denote for Star_1:
nFe1 = nFe_sun * (nH1 / nH_sun) → because nFe1/nH1
