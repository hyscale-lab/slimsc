Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology, specifically about a problem with a transgenic mouse model. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

The scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G protein is overexpressed. They're using a construct that includes the coding sequence for GADD45G with an added hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with this plasmid using Lipofectamine and are using an antibiotic to select resistant colonies. But when they check, they can't overexpress the protein as expected. They look at the plus strand sequence of their construct and notice an issue.

The question is asking why they can't overexpress the protein. The options are A to D.

First, I need to understand what each part of the scenario entails. Let me think about the process of creating a transgenic construct. The HA tag is usually added at the N-terminus so that it can be used for immunoprecipitation or detection. So they probably cloned the HA sequence before the GADD45G coding sequence.

Looking at the DNA sequence they provided, I should check for possible issues. Let me look for any obvious problems in the sequence that might prevent proper expression.

One thought is whether the construct has a proper start codon and whether the reading frame is correct. The very beginning of the sequence is 5' ATG, which is the start codon (methionine). So that's good.

Wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus. HA is a peptide tag, so the DNA sequence would encode it before the GADD45G. So the first ATG would be the start for the HA tag, or is the HA tag added without an additional ATG? Because sometimes tags are added in frame without an additional start codon, relying on the existing one.

But wait, the HA tag is a small peptide. Its coding sequence would be included in the construct. Since the plasmid is designed for expression, the vector likely has a promoter, the inserted gene with the HA tag, and then the terminator.

Looking at the provided sequence, the initial part is ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG T... So the first codon is ATG (start), followed by TAC (tyrosine), then CCC (proline), etc. Wait, but if the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus, the HA coding sequence should come before the GADD45G's start codon.

Wait, I might have gotten that wrong. Suppose the HA tag's coding sequence is added right after the start codon. So the reading frame should be correct.

Another possibility is the presence of a stop codon in the sequence, which would terminate translation early. Let me see if any of the triplets are TAG, TGA, or TAA. Let's scan the sequence.

Looking through the sequence: the first few codons are ATG, TAC, CCC, ATA, CGA, TGT, TCC, AGA
