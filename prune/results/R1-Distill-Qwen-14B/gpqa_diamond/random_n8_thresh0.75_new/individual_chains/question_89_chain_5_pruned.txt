Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first reaction is heating it with excess KOH at 240°C to give a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR and IR data are provided for product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide to give product 3. We need to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum, excluding any that exchange with the solvent.

Hmm, I think I need to figure out what each product is. Let's break it down.

Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on two non-adjacent carbons. Heating with KOH... that sounds like a dehydrohalogenation or elimination reaction, maybe forming an alkene.

Wait, but since it's dibrominated, maybe a double elimination? So, when KOH is used with vicinal dihalides, it can cause elimination to form an alkene. But in this case, the dihalide is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which isn't vicinal but separated by one carbon. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, in adamantane, the positions are such that maybe the bromines are on adjacent carbons in a certain arrangement. No, wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has the two Br atoms on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane skeleton. So, perhaps the reaction leads to forming a diene or a bridged diene?

Alternatively, another possibility is that each Br undergoes elimination, but since they're not adjacent, perhaps two separate eliminations occur. Or maybe it's a double elimination to form a ring structure.

Wait, let's think about the product's IR. The IR has an absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong peak. That's indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. Also, the NMR data for product 1: 4.
