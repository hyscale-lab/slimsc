Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question is about identifying a compound X based on the NMR data of its product after a specific reaction. The reaction conditions are with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Hmm, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a bicyclic amine, often used as a catalyst in certain reactions, maybe something like an acid catalysis or a ring-opening or -closing reaction. Wait, but wait—another thought: Oh right! It's commonly used in the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of epoxides. Or wait, wait. Oh! No, wait—another angle. Oh right, when epoxides react under certain conditions, especially with such catalysts, they can undergo ring-opening reactions. Or wait, maybe it's an acid-catalyzed ring-opening with a specific reagent.

But wait, the reaction time is a day at 403 K, which is about 130°C. That's a high temperature, so maybe it's an elimination reaction or some kind of rearrangement.

But wait, the question is about the product's NMR. The product is formed from compound X, which is C11H12O. Let me look at the options first to get an idea.

The options are:
A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane
B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane
C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane
D) 2-styrylepoxide

Wait, I think all the options are epoxides except maybe D? No, wait, D is 2-styrylepoxide, which is an epoxide as well. Because an epoxide is a three-membered ring with two adjacent oxygen atoms, making it an ether.

Wait, but wait. The starting material is compound X, which reacts to form the product. The NMR data is for the product. So the product is formed from X via some reaction.

Wait, but what's the structure of X? Let's think about each option.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxir
