Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this. Let's try to break it down step by step. 

The problem says that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Hmm, right, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so that's the standard basis for spin-½ systems. I remember that for such systems, the spin operator in the z-direction has eigenvalues ±ħ/2. But wait, the question is about an operator whose matrix representation has elements Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Oh, that's interesting. So the matrix is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. Let me write that out.

So for a 2x2 matrix, the A matrix would look like:
[0, ħ/2]
[ħ/2, 0]

Wait, is that right? Because i and j are the row and column indices. So when i≠j, it's ħ/2, else zero. So yes, that's correct. 

But wait, what operator has such a matrix representation? Oh, right! It's the Pauli X operator multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is:
[0 1]
[1 0]

So A would be (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So the operator in question is (ħ/2) σ_x. 

The question asks for two things: the probabilities of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of this operator, and the average value of the operator. 

Wait, but wait. The eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |−x>, which are the spin-up and spin-down states along the x-axis. So first, I need to find the probabilities of measuring the system in these eigenstates. 

But the state |alpha> is given in the z-basis. So to find the probability of measuring |+x> and |−x>, I need to express |alpha> in the x-basis. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the overlap between |alpha> and each eigenstate of A, square it to get the probability. 

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is better. Since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, the eigenstates are |+x> and |−x>, with eigenvalues
