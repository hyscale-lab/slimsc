Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's happening.

The starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene, right? Its structure is something like a bicyclic compound with a menthofuran skeleton. Oh wait, no, wait. Limonene is actually a cyclic monoterpene, not bicyclic. Wait, no, wait, isn't limonene a bicyclic monoterpene? Hmm. Alternatively, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with a specific structure. I think I should sketch its structure. So, Limonene is a bicyclic compound with a structure that includes a cyclohexene ring and another ring. Wait, no, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, more specifically, a bicyclic monoterpene with a structure that includes a trans double bond. 

Wait, actually, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with a structure that has a six-membered ring and a double bond. Oh right, I think limonene is a bicyclic compound with a six-membered ring and a fused five-membered ring, but wait, no. Or is it a single six-membered ring with a double bond?

Wait, no, I think limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene. Let me think. Limonene has a structure where there's a cyclohexene ring with a substituent and a fused cyclopropane ring, no, wait, that's not right. Alternatively,
