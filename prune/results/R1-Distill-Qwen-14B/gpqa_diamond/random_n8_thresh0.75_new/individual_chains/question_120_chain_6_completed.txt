Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, it says to assume stars are uniformly distributed. I'm a bit confused about what that means. Oh wait, uniform distribution probably means that the number density of stars is the same throughout space, right? So, if you look at any region of space, the number of stars per unit volume is constant.

The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are different power laws, like 1 over plx to the power of something.

I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax plx is the reciprocal of distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is distance. So as plx increases, the distance decreases. Smaller plx means farther away.

Wait, but how does the number of stars per unit plx change with plx? Let's think about it. The number of stars in a certain range of plx would depend on the volume of space that corresponds to that range.

Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number is proportional to the volume. So the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx would be proportional to the volume of that shell.

Wait, what is the volume of a shell at a certain distance d with thickness dd? The volume should be 4π d² dd, because it's a spherical shell. Because the surface area of a sphere is 4πr², multiplied by the thickness dr gives the volume.

But since plx is 1/d, we can express d in terms of plx: d = 1/plx. So dd = -1/(plx²) dplx. Wait, the negative is because as plx increases, d decreases. But since we're dealing with positive volumes, maybe we can ignore the sign for this calculation.

So substituting, the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me clarify.

Let me write d = 1/plx. So the volume element in terms of plx is the volume of a thin spherical shell at distance d, with thickness dd. So the volume is 4π d² dd. But since d = 1/plx, then dd is the change in d due to a small change in plx, dplx. Wait, no, we can express dd in terms of dplx.

Because plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Taking derivative: dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So, dd = - dplx / (plx)^2.

But since we're considering an infinitesimal change, the negative just indicates the direction. When plx increases, d decreases, but for the volume, which is positive, we can take the absolute value. So the volume becomes 4π*(1/plx)^2 * (dplx/(plx^2)). Wait, no, wait. Oh no, wait. Let's see: the volume is 4π d² dd. So substituting d in terms of plx and dd again:

Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d d). But d d is ( -1/plx² dplx ). Hmm, but when we take the magnitude (since volume can't be negative), it's (1/plx²) dplx.

So putting it all together, the volume is 4π * (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx? Wait, that would be 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. That doesn't seem right. Wait, no, wait. Let's recheck.

Wait, the volume is dV = 4π d² * dd. Since d = 1/plx, then d² = 1/(plx^2). And dd is (1/plx²) dplx in magnitude. So:

dV = 4 π (1/plx^2) * (d d) → since dd = (1/(plx²)) dplx, then:

dV = 4 π (1/plx^2) * (dplx / plx^2 ) → 4 π (dplx) / plx^4.

So the number of stars in this volume is proportional to dV, which is proportional to 1/plx^4 dplx.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So per unit plx, like how many stars are there between plx and plx + dplx, divided by dplx.

Wait, if the number is proportional to dV, which is (4 π / plx^4 ) dplx, then the number per unit plx (dplx) is (4 π / plx^4). So the number per unit plx is 1/plx^4.

But wait, that's not matching the options. Let me see the options again. Option A is ~1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit plx would decrease as plx increases, which makes sense because higher plx (lower distance) would be closer, but if stars are uniformly distributed, there are more stars in the nearby regions. Wait, no. Wait, no, because if plx is small (large distance), then the number of stars per unit plx would be higher or lower?

Wait, wait, the way the question is phrased is a bit tricky. It says, "how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx?" So if plx is small (d is large), what is the number per unit plx?

Wait, let me think again. Suppose we're looking at a range of plx from plx to plx + dplx. The number of stars in this range is proportional to 1/plx^4, as we've found. So the number per unit plx (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Therefore, as plx increases (distance decreases), the number of stars per unit plx decreases like 1/plx^4. So the number is inversely proportional to plx to the fourth power.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes in these problems, it's about the density of stars in space. Oh wait, the question says stars are uniformly distributed, so their number density is uniform. So the number of stars in a volume depends on the volume. So the analysis should hold.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely related to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance to the star. Assuming stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume itself.

The volume of a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we have \( d^2 = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \) (ignoring the negative sign for magnitude). Thus, the volume of the shell becomes:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) d\text{plx} = \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars in this volume is proportional to \( dV \), so the number of stars per unit range of parallax (i.e., per unit \( d\text{plx} \)) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). This means the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \text{plx} \) increases, following the relation \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ 1/plx^4**
