Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's a bit challenging, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to find the major products for each. Then, I have to match them with the given options A, B, C, or D to find the correct answer.

First reaction: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacts with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. The product is A.

Second reaction: 1-nitropropane reacts with KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water. The product is B.

I need to figure out what each product is. Let's tackle them one by one.

Starting with the first reaction. I remember that when a ketone reacts with an acrylate ester in the presence of a strong base like t-BuOK, it's likely an example of a Robinson annulation reaction. Wait, wait, no, wait. Robinson annulation involves a conjugate addition followed by cyclization to form a six-membered ring. But wait, maybe it's an example of a Michael addition followed by aldol condensation? Or perhaps it's a Claisen-like condensation. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, the base could deprotonate the alpha position, leading to a conjugate addition.

Wait, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The structure is a cyclohexanone ring with substituents. Let's draw it mentally. The ketone is at position 1. Positions 2, 2, and 6 have substituents? Wait, noâ€”the compound is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the ring is cyclohexane with a ketone at C1. Then, at C2, there's an ethyl group, and methyl groups at C2 and C6? Wait, no, the numbering is 2,6-dimethyl. So, at C2, there's an ethyl group (since it's 2-ethyl) and a methyl? Or wait, no, wait. Let me clarify: the formula is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl. So that's a cyclohexanone with a substituent at position 1 (the ketone). Then,
