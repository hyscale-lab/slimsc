Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because Grubbs catalyst reactions can be a bit tricky for me. Let me try to think it through step by step.

The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

First, I should recall what Grubbs catalyst does. From what I remember, Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. It's a type of ring-opening or ring-closing reaction, or it can be a cross metathesis between different alkenes. But wait, in this case, the starting material is a single alkene. So, perhaps it's an intramolecular metathesis?

Wait, no, wait. Grubbs catalyst can cause ring-closing metathesis if the molecule is set up for it. So maybe I should draw the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene.

The structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent is 5 carbons. So pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2? No, wait. Let me count again. The formula for pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But when it's 3-methyl, that means there's a methyl group on the third carbon. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe not. Let me draw the structure correctly.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent means five carbons. The double bond is at position 1, so the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's number the chain.

Pent-1-ene: positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The double bond starts at carbon 1. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. But wait, if it's 3-methyl, there's a methyl branch on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait,
