Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let's see. The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh right, LTE means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, so the usual laws of thermodynamics apply here.

Wait, I remember that the number of atoms in a particular energy level is governed by the Boltzmann distribution. The formula is something like n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

In this case, since they're comparing the same transition but in two different stars, I can set up a ratio. Let's say the excitation level in star_1 is n1 and in star_2 is n2. The problem states that n1 = 2 * n2. So, the ratio n1/n2 is 2.

Assuming that the statistical weights g_i and g_j are the same for both stars (since they're the same element), the ratio simplifies to exp( -(ΔE)/(k T) )^{-1} because the energy difference ΔE is E_i - E_j. Wait, no, let me think again. Oh wait, in the Boltzmann factor, it's (E_i - E_j) over kT. Wait, when moving from lower to higher energy, E_i is higher than E_j, so ΔE = E_i - E_j is positive. But the excited state is higher energy, so the probability of being in a higher state is lower unless temperature is high.

Wait, so the ratio of excited to ground state is given by that exponential. So, in star_1, the excited state has double the population of star_2's. So:

n1/n2 = 2 = [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )] / [exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Wait, no, wait. Because the Boltzmann factor is for the excited state relative to the ground. So, if E is the excited level, then the population ratio is (n_E) / (n_ground) = exp( -ΔE/(kT) ). Alternatively, sometimes it's written as (n_j)/(n_i) = exp
