Okay, let me try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, so the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. I remember that orthophosphate is PO4^3-.

The solution has 200.00 cm³, which I think is 0.2 liters because 1 cm³ is 1 mL and 1000 mL is a liter. So 200 cm³ is 0.2 L. Got it.

The solution contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. Wait, what's the molecular weight of each? KH2PO4 is given as 136.09 g/mol, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol.

I think I need to find the moles of each compound. Moles are mass divided by molecular weight.

So for KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me calculate that. Let's see, 1 divided by approximately 136 is about 0.00735 moles. But let me be precise. 1/136.09 is roughly 0.007337 moles.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. Calculating that, 1/177.99 is approximately 0.00561 moles.

Wait, what's the significance of these compounds? I remember that KH2PO4 is a diprotic acid, H2PO4^- (acidic form), and Na2HPO4 is the conjugate base, HPO4^2- (but wait, isn't that the dihydrogen phosphate? Or wait, H3PO4 can lose three protons: first to H2PO4^-, then to HPO4^2-, then to PO4^3-.

So, when you have a mixture of KH2PO4 (which is H2PO4^- as the ion because K+ is the counterion) and Na2HPO4 (which is HPO4^2-), the solution is probably a buffer solution. Because a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-) are present
