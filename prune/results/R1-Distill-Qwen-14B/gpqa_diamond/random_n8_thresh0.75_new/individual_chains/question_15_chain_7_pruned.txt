Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, let me think through this.

So, the setup: Two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, both Earth-like. They've been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits. The host stars have same radii, but Planet_1's host is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Oh, and Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but same radius.

The question is about transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size. Specifically, the probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is more likely to align with our line of sight, which is determined by the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, but wait. The transit probability formula is P = (R_star / a_planet) * (sqrt(1 - (R_planet^2 / a_planet^2))) but since the planets are Earth-like and their radii are much smaller than the star's, the R_planet term is negligible. So the probability is approximately proportional to (R_star / a_planet). Or wait, no, actually, the formula I have in mind is P = (R_*/ a)^2 * (something). No, wait. Wait, I think the probability is proportional to (R_*/a)^2. Or is it (R_* / a) multiplied by some factor?

Wait, let me get this straight. The chance of a transit is the area of the star divided by the area of the sphere from which the planet can appear in front. Oh, right, the probability is roughly (R_*/ a)^2, but wait, no, that's not quite right. Another approach: the condition for transit is that the planet's orbital plane is edge-on enough such that from our perspective, the planet passes in front of the star. The probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital distance. So, P = (R_*/a), but only if the orbit is randomly oriented. Wait, no, the formula I'm recalling is P = (R_* / a) * (1 + (R_* / a)), but no, that doesn't seem right.

Wait
