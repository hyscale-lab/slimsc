Alright, so I've got this question about a transmission electron microscope and the mean free path of gas molecules in the sample compartment. Let's try to break this down step by step.

Okay, so Mike created an ultra-high vacuum with a pressure less than 10^-9 Torr. He used vacuum pumps, and even though some gas particles are still there, the mean free path of these molecules is λ1. Mean free path, I remember, is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. It depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules. The formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2)*π*d^2*P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the effective diameter of the molecules, and P is pressure.

Wait, but the question says that when Mike starts the electron beam, the mean free path changes to λ2. Why would that happen? The temperature is the same, so T is constant. The pressure in the compartment was already ultra-low, so why would the mean free path change?

Hmm, maybe the electron beam affects the gas molecules somehow. I'm thinking about electron scattering. When the beam is on, electrons are moving at a high speed—since the accelerating voltage is 1000 kV, the electrons have a lot of energy. So when these high-energy electrons hit the gas molecules, they might cause some sort of interaction.

Wait, in the initial state, without the electron beam, the gas molecules are just moving around, and their mean free path is λ1. But when the beam is on, these electrons are passing through the gas. How does that affect the gas? Maybe the electrons ionize the gas molecules. Ionization would change the gas—turning neutral molecules into ions or charged particles. Charged particles would interact more strongly with the electron beam, but also, their behavior in the vacuum might change.

Wait, but if the gas molecules become charged (ions), their effective diameter might change. Or perhaps the pressure isn't the same because some molecules are ionized and maybe pumped out more efficiently? Or maybe the ionization causes more scattering events for the electrons.

Wait, but the question is about the mean free path of the gas molecules, not the electrons. Oh, right, the mean free path for the gas molecules is λ2 now. So, how does the presence of the electron beam affect the mean free path of the gas molecules?

Hmm. Let's think about the factors that determine the mean
