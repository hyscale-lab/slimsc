Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology and genetics, specifically dealing with a ligand-receptor system and some vectors used in experiments. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

The setup is that someone has identified a new ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They're trying to understand their developmental fate by using a bicistronic vector. So, bicistronic means it has two separate genes in one vector, right? They're using loxP and something else for this construct.

The vector has the ligand's ORF at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor's ORF at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. Wait, so the ligand is first, then the receptor. Let me think about the structure. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. Oh, IRES is involved in internal ribosome entry sites, which can allow for translation of a second gene without a second promoter. So the setup is that the CBA promoter drives the ligand's expression, then through the IRES, the receptor is expressed as a separate ORF.

Between the ligand and mCherry, there's a stop with loxP. And between the receptor and eGFP, there's a stop with lox2272. Wait, so initially, when the vector is introduced, the ligand and mCherry would be expressed together because the stop is in a loxP cassette. Same with the receptor and eGFP. But when Cre is introduced, which Cre? Oh, because it's a lox-Cre vector, I think that the loxP and lox2272 sites are different. Cre would recognize loxP sites and cause recombination, which would delete the stop cassettes. So when Cre is present, the stop is removed, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed as separate proteins.

Wait, more precisely, the construct is bicistronic. The ligand is 5', followed by a stop (loxP), then mCherry. Then, after the IRES, the receptor is at 3', with a stop in a lox2272 cassette before eGFP. So without Cre, the ligand and mCherry are co-expressed (because the stop is in the way), but the
