Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing some acids and a base. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

So the problem says we have three solutions being mixed: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I need to find the enthalpy change when they're all mixed together.

Wait, enthalpy of neutralization. Oh right, that's the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually around -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-), but I think the exact value depends on the reaction.

But first, I need to figure out the mole amounts of each acid and base involved. Because when they mix, the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base.

Let's break it down. The HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but wait, does it donate two H+ ions? Right, sulfuric acid is diprotic. In dilute solutions, the first dissociation is complete, and the second is almost complete, but I think for the purpose of neutralization, we can consider both H+ ions. But wait, actually, when H2SO4 reacts with a base, both H+ ions will be neutralized.

But wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Its formula is Ba(OH)2, which dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH-.

So first, I need to calculate the moles of H+ from each acid and the moles of OH- from the base. Then, see which is the limiting reactant.

Let's compute each component.

Starting with HCl: Molarity is 0.2 M, volume is 500 mL (which is 0.5 L). Moles = Molarity × Volume. So 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol HCl. Since HCl is H+ and Cl-, each mole gives one mole of H+. So 0.1 mol H+.

Next, H2SO4: 0.3 M, 300 mL (0.3 L). Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol H2SO4. Each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 H+ ions, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol H+.

Then, Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M, 200 mL (0.2 L). Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2. Each mole gives 2 OH- ions, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol OH-.

Wait, but how do these react? The H+ from acids will react with OH- from the base. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat.

So total H+ available
