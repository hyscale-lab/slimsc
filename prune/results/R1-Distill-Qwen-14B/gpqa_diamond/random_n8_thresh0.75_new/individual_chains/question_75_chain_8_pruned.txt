Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the transfection didn't work as expected. The question is about a mouse model where they're trying to overexpress the GADD45G protein. They introduced an influenza hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. But when they transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, they couldn't get the protein to overexpress.

Looking at the construct sequence, the problem must be in the DNA sequence they designed. Let me think through the possible options.

Option A: The antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. So, maybe the HA tag has a wrong amino acid. If that's the case, the protein might not fold correctly or be recognized by purification methods, but would that prevent expression? I'm not sure. They're using it for affinity purification, so if the tag is messed up, they might not detect it. But if the construct isn't being expressed, maybe it's not about the tag.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would mean there's a stop codon upstream in the coding sequence. If the ribosome stops early, the protein won't be made properly. So I should check if the provided DNA sequence has any stop codons before the end. Let me look.

The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then, looking for TAA, TAG, or TGA which are stop codons. Let me scan through the bases. Hmm, I'm seeing a lot of A's, T's, C's, G's. Wait, let me look for the stop codons. Do I see any TGA, TAG, or TAA in frame? Oh, I notice towards the end, there's a TGA. Let me see where. 

Looking at the end of the sequence: ...CTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, near the end, I see 'TGA' in the sequence. Let me count the letters to see if it's in frame. The start is ATG, so the reading frame is every three nucleotides. So the TGA is: looking for the triplet. Let me see... Let's break the sequence into triplets after the start.

After the initial ATG, the next triplet is TAC, then CCA, TAC, GAT, G... wait, I think I need to see where the TGA is. Let me check the last few triplets. The last part is ...CGAGTGA. So that would be CGA GTG TGA. Wait, no, perhaps the last few triplets: AGT GAG TGA.

Wait, no, the very end is ...GAGTGA. Let's see:

The full sequence ends with 'GAGTGA'. So the last few triplets are:
