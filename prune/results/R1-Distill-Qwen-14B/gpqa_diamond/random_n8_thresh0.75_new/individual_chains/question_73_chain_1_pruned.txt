Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about. 

The question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and we need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, right, relativistic speeds mean we can't just use classical mechanics; we need to apply Einstein's theory of relativity, specifically special relativity concepts.

So the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with relative speeds in relativity, we can't just subtract them like in classical mechanics because that would give a speed greater than c, which isn't possible. Instead, we have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The first part is finding the relative speed. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Wait, but I'm a bit rusty—let me make sure I got that right. Oh wait, no, wait. Because if both are moving in the same direction, then the relative velocity from the perspective of the slower one (I think) would be (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). No, wait. Wait, I think I should think about it from each astronaut's frame. Let me get this straight.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to consider observer in the first astronaut's frame. So, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c. What is the speed of the second astronaut as seen from the first's frame? So, using the velocity addition formula: u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is the second astronaut's speed in the lab frame, and v is the first astronaut's speed. Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The formula is when you have an object moving at speed u in the lab frame, and you want to find its speed in a frame moving at speed v relative to the lab. So if the lab frame is the first astronaut's frame, then the second astronaut's speed in that frame would be (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the lab frame might be the rest frame where the first astronaut is moving at v, and the second at u. Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the first astronaut is stationary in his own frame,
