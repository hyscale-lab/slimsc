Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution made by mixing two specific amounts of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4•2H2O. 

Alright, first, the problem says the solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. That's good to note because concentrations are in molarity, which is moles per liter.

They give me the masses of both compounds: 1.00 g each. And their molecular weights are 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4•2H2O. I think I need to calculate the moles of each first. 

Wait, so for KH2PO4, moles would be mass divided by molecular weight. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me do that math. Let's see, 1 divided by approximately 136 is about 0.00735 moles. But wait, let me calculate it more accurately. 136.09 * 0.00735 is around 1, so yes, 1.00g /136.09 ≈ 0.00735 mol.

Similarly, for Na2HPO4•2H2O, the moles would be 1.00g /177.99 g/mol. That's roughly 0.00561 mol. 

Wait, but I need to think about what these salts dissociate into. KH2PO4 is K+ and H2PO4^- (because it's a diprotic acid, I think). And Na2HPO4 would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So in solution, we have K+ and Na+ as spectator ions, and the phosphate species H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The problem is about orthophosphate ions. Wait, what's orthophosphate? Oh right, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it's more about the different forms based on deprotonation. Or wait, maybe orthophosphate is HPO4^3-? No, wait. Let me think.
