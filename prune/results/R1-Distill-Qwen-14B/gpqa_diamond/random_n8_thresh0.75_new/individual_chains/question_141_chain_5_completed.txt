Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is.

The question says: 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction? The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

Hmm. I'm a bit rusty, but I think I can work through this. Let me try to recall what I know about reactions involving NaNH2 in ammonia.

So, NaNH2 is a strong base, right? And when it's used in a condensed ammonia solvent, it's typically used for dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. Wait, no, wait. Wait, another thought: when you have a benzene ring with substituents, especially halogens, and you treat it with a strong base like NaNH2, what reactions can happen?

Wait, I remember something about elimination. Like, in the case of toluene derivatives, when you have a benzyl halide, you can eliminate to form a benzene ring with a double bond. Oh! Wait, like the formation of styrene from toluene derivatives. But wait, no, that's with something else.

Wait, no, wait. Oh, right! Benzene rings with substituents can undergo elimination reactions. For example, if you have a benzyl bromide, like CH2CH2Br attached to benzene, treatment with a strong base can eliminate HBr to form a double bond between the benzene and the CH2 group, forming a styrene-type structure.

But wait, the starting material here is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, what's that structure? 1-bromobenzene would be bromobenzene, with the bromine on the benzene ring in position 1. But the "-2-d" part is a bit confusing. Oh, wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene? Or perhaps it's a typo and it's 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, which is bromotoluene.

Wait, no, perhaps the molecule is 1-bromobenzene-d (maybe the d is a typo or stands for something else). Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,6-dimethylbenzene, which is 2,6-dimethyl bromobenzene. Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, which is bromotoluene. Hmm, perhaps I should think of it as bromo-substituted benzene with another substituent.

Wait, but maybe the "2-d" is a typo and it's actually 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene. Let's proceed under that assumption for now.

So, the structure would be bromobenzene with a methyl group in the ortho position relative to the bromine. That's position 1 and 2 on the benzene ring.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in ammonia. I think that's a common condition for elimination. So, when a benzene ring has a substituent adjacent to a leaving group, like bromine, and is treated with a strong base, it might undergo a elimination to form another structure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps this is a case of dehydrohalogenation. But wait, that's more for aliphatic compounds. For aromatic compounds, maybe it's more about forming a ring expansion or other structures.

Wait, perhaps the bromine is a leaving group, and the base abstracts a proton adjacent to it, leading to elimination and formation of a double bond. But benzene is already an aromatic ring; maybe it's forming a ring with a larger conjugated system.

Wait, but benzene has six pi electrons. Maybe the elimination forms a larger ring with a triple bond or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of forming a benzene ring with a substituent that is a diradical or something else. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about elimination in aromatic compounds. Oh, wait! I remember that when a benzene ring has a substituent that's adjacent to a leaving group, for example, a bromine, the base can abstract a proton alpha to the leaving group. In this case, the methyl group is adjacent to the bromine. So, perhaps the base (NH2-) abstracts a proton from the methyl group, which is next to the bromine.

Wait, but methyl groups are not very acidic. The pKa of a methyl proton is around 43, I think. That's higher than the conjugate acid of the base NaNH2. The conjugate acid is NH3, which has a pKa of about 38. So NaNH2 is a stronger base than what would be needed to deprotonate a methyl group. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, that suggests that the methyl group's protons are not acidic enough for NaNH2 to abstract them. So elimination from the methyl group adjacent to the bromine may not be feasible.

Hmm, perhaps I'm thinking about this the wrong way. Maybe the compound isn't bromo with a methyl group and another substituent. Wait, maybe the structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. No, but the question says 1-bromobenzene-2-d, which is a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, and the "d" is a typo or stands for something else. Maybe it's 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, but the structure is o-bromotoluene.

Wait, if the starting material is o-bromotoluene, and we're treating it with a strong base like NaNH2 in ammonia, what would happen? I'm not exactly sure, but perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the bromine, leading to elimination and the formation of a new double bond.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a benzidine rearrangement or some kind of elimination to form a naphthalene derivative. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of dehydrohalogenation to form a new ring. Wait, in some cases, when a benzene ring has two substituents on adjacent positions, like a methyl and a bromine, the base can abstract a proton from the methyl and eliminate HBr, leading to the formation of a new double bond between the two carbons. So the benzene ring would expand, forming a seven-membered ring with a double bond.

Wait, but benzene has six carbons. If a seven-membered ring is formed, that would require adding a carbon, but perhaps it's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a diradical or a triple bond.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible products. Let me imagine the structure: benzene ring with bromine at position 1 and a methyl group at position 2.

If the base abstracts a hydrogen from the methyl group, which is adjacent to the bromine, that would lead to the formation of a carbanion intermediate, which then eliminates the bromide ion, leading to the formation of a double bond between the carbon where the methyl was and the benzene ring.

Wait, but wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So if there's a methyl group attached to the ring at position 2, and the base abstracts a hydrogen from the methyl, then the elimination would occur between the methyl's carbon and the adjacent ring carbon, leading to the formation of a double bond within the ring.

Wait, but benzene is already conjugated. Forming a double bond within the ring would make it more conjugated, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a new ring. For example, the benzene ring (six carbons) plus the adjacent methyl group (one carbon) could form a five-membered ring if the elimination occurs. Wait, that might not make sense because the ring would be too small.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. When you have o-bromotoluene (bromine at position 1, methyl at position 2), and you treat it with a strong base, NaNH2 in ammonia, what happens?

Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond between the positions where the bromine was and the methyl group. But in that case, the ring would have a double bond, making it more aromatic but perhaps leading to a different structure.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from the benzene ring, leading to a diradical. But that doesn't seem likely.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that's not applicable here because we're using a strong base, not an acid catalyst.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for similar reactions or mechanisms.

Wait, I remember that when you have a benzyl halide, like CH2Br attached to benzene, and you treat it with a strong base like NaNH2, it undergoes elimination to form a triple bond, creating a benzene ring with a triple bond (like phenylacetylene). But in that case, the structure is benzyl bromide, not a substituted benzene ring.

Wait, but in this problem, the substituent is a methyl group, not a benzyl group. So perhaps the reaction isn't applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of elimination forming a new ring, such as forming a naphthalene derivative. For that, you'd need two adjacent rings, but I'm not sure how that would happen with just a methyl group and a bromine.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a dearomatization. But that's probably not the case here.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the bromide is a leaving group, and elimination occurs to form a double bond between the adjacent carbons. So, the benzene ring would have a double bond where the bromine was and the adjacent position. But I'm not sure how that would affect the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a cycloheptatriene ring. But I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible products. Let's say the methyl group is at position 2, and the bromine is at position 1. If the base abstracts a hydrogen from the methyl group, causing elimination of HBr, we'd get a double bond between the benzene ring's position 2 and the position where the methyl was attached. So the structure would have a double bond between C-2 and the former methyl carbon, making it a benzene ring with a double bond adjacent to where the methyl was.

Wait, but benzene's structure is all double bonds, so perhaps this would form a diene within the ring? That doesn't make sense because benzene is already a fully conjugated system.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a new ring, such as a seven-membered ring with one double bond. But that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't go as I'm thinking and instead involves some rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. That could change things. But the question says 1-bromobenzene-2-d, which is unclear.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, which is also known as o-bromo-xylene. In that case, perhaps the elimination would be possible in multiple positions.

But I'm not sure, so perhaps I should think about the possible elimination positions.

Wait, considering that NaNH2 is a strong base, perhaps it can abstract a proton alpha to the bromine. So in 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, the methyl is at position 2, adjacent to the bromine at position 1. The base would abstract a hydrogen from the methyl group, leading to the formation of a carbanion, which could then eliminate the bromide ion, leading to the formation of a double bond between the benzene ring and the former methyl carbon.

Wait, but the methyl group is attached to the benzene ring. So if you lose H and Br, you would form a double bond between the benzene's carbon (position 2) and the former methyl carbon. But wait, that would form a structure where a double bond is between C-2 and a new carbon, but that carbon isn't part of the benzene ring anymore. Hmm, that seems a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a new aromatic ring, but that's a bit unclear.

Wait, maybe I should think about the number of possible products. The options are 1, 2, 3, or 4. So the number of possible products depends on the number of different positions where elimination can occur.

Wait, but in the starting material, if there's a substituent in position 2 relative to the bromine, maybe there's only one position for elimination. Or perhaps not.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2,6-dimethylbenzene, which is para-methyl to the bromine, but that's not the structure I'm thinking of.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the starting material is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene (o-bromotoluene), and when treated with NaNH2, the base abstracts a hydrogen from the methyl group. Then, the elimination of HBr would form a double bond between the methyl carbon and the benzene ring, leading to a new structure.

But how would that affect the ring? Maybe the double bond would be between the benzene's carbon and the adjacent carbon, forming a new structure. Alternatively, perhaps it forms a cycloheptatriene, but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form any new product because the conditions aren't right. But that's not likely because the question is asking about the possible products.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a triple bond. But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of another angle. The reaction NaNH2 in ammonia is often used for dehydrohalogenation, especially in the formation of alkenes from alky halides. But in the case of aromatic compounds, perhaps it's used to form dienes or other structures.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a substituent that has a double bond, like a styrene group. So if the starting material is o-bromotoluene, elimination would form a styrene derivative.

Wait, but the methyl is adjacent to the bromine. So elimination would form a double bond between the benzene ring and the methyl carbon, creating a structure like CH2=CH-Ph, but that's not the case here. Wait, no, that's more like the benzyl bromide elimination.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility of the reaction not proceeding at all. But that's probably not the case, as the question is about the products.

Another approach: perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of an ortho-dimethyl group and elimination of HBr, creating a new structure. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let's try to think about the possible products.

Assuming the starting material is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, and the reaction leads to elimination of HBr to form a double bond between the benzene's position 2 and the methyl's carbon, the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond (CH2) attached to position 2.

Wait, but that would make the structure a benzene ring with a CH2 group that's part of a double bond. Wait, that would be something like Ph-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't sound right. Maybe it's more like Ph-CH2-CH2-Br, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the loss of the bromine and a methyl group, forming a new double bond. But that would require the loss of two substituents, which doesn't make sense in this scenario.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. In that case, the base might abstract a hydrogen from either the methyl at position 2 or the methyl at position 4, leading to different products. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, but the question says 1-bromobenzene-2-d, which might mean 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So if that's the case, the base could abstract a hydrogen from either the methyl group at position 2 or the methyl at position 4. Each abstraction could lead to a different elimination product.

If that's the case, each elimination could form a different double bond, leading to two possible products. But wait, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 2, elimination would form a double bond between position 1 (where the bromine was) and position 2, but that might not be possible because the ring is already conjugated.

Alternatively, perhaps each abstraction leads to the same product because the structure is symmetric. Wait, in 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, the methyl groups are at positions 2 and 4, so the structure is symmetric around the bromine. So eliminating from either methyl might lead to the same product.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps each elimination leads to a different product, but with the same structure due to symmetry.

Wait, so if the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, and the base abstracts a hydrogen from either the methyl at position 2 or 4, each elimination would form a double bond in a certain position. But if the structure is symmetric, both eliminations would give the same product. So that would lead to only one product.

But wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me draw it mentally. 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene would have the bromine at position 1, methyl groups at positions 2 and 4. So the ring would have substituents at positions 1 (Br), 2 (Me), and 4 (Me). So the molecule is symmetric along the 1-4 axis. So if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 2 or 4, the elimination would form the same product.

In that case, only one product is formed. So the answer would be option B) 1.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: perhaps the reaction can proceed via different pathways, leading to different products. For instance, if the starting material has multiple possible sites for elimination, each site could form a different product.

Wait, but in 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, the base could abstract a hydrogen from the methyl groups at positions 2 and 4. If each abstraction leads to a different elimination product, then there would be two products.

But I'm not certain about this. Alternatively, perhaps each elimination leads to the same product due to the symmetry.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a new ring. Let's say that eliminating from the methyl group leads to the formation of a five-membered ring with a double bond. But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a cyclopentadienyl ring. But that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination doesn't form a new ring but just changes the substituents on the benzene ring. So, for example, the bromine is replaced by a double bond, forming a new substituent.

Wait, but the benzene ring can't just lose a substituent and form a double bond because it's already an aromatic ring. So perhaps the substituent is converted into a double bond, but that would require a different mechanism.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the structure again. 1-bromobenzene-2-d. If the 'd' is a typo and it's actually 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, then the base could abstract a hydrogen from either methyl group, leading to two possible products if the elimination occurs at each position.

But wait, in reality, the molecule is symmetric, so eliminating from either position would give the same product.

Wait, but perhaps the elimination can occur in more than one way. For example, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from the same methyl group, but in a different position, leading to different stereochemistry or different regiochemistry.

But in this case, perhaps the elimination leads to the same product regardless of which position the hydrogen is abstracted from.

So if the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, and the reaction produces a single product, then the answer is 1, option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's unlikely because the question is about the products.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a new substituent, such as a vinyl group attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, but for that, the starting material would need a structure where the elimination forms a double bond. So, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from the methyl group adjacent to the bromine, then the elimination would form a double bond between the benzene ring and the former methyl carbon. So the product would be a benzene ring with a CH2 group attached as a double bond, like a styrene group.

Wait, but that's more like benzyl bromide elimination. So in this case, the product would be benzene with a CH2 group attached as a double bond, but I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is benzene with a substituent that's a vinyl group, like Ph-CH2-CH2-Br, but that doesn't make sense here because the bromine is eliminated.

Wait, perhaps the product is Ph-CH2-CH2, but that's not a stable structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclopropane or something.

I'm not making much progress here. Let me try a different approach. What's the general reaction when a benzene ring has a substituent, say, R-X, and treated with a strong base like NaNH2 in NH3?

I think in some cases, elimination can occur, especially if the substituent is a good leaving group, like bromine. So the base abstracts a proton alpha to the leaving group, leading to the formation of a double bond as the leaving group departs.

So in the case of o-bromotoluene, the base would abstract a proton from the methyl group adjacent to the bromine, leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a double bond between the benzene ring and the former methyl carbon.

So the product would be benzene with a CH2 group that's part of a double bond, making it a vinyl group. So the structure would be benzene with a substituent CH2=CH2? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to a new substituent. Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is o-bromotoluene: benzene with Br at position 1 and CH3 at position 2.

The base abstracts a hydrogen from the CH3 group at position 2. Then, the Br leaves, and the electrons form a double bond between the benzene's position 2 and the former CH3 carbon. So the structure would have a double bond between the benzene ring and the carbon where the methyl was.

So the substituent becomes a CH2 group attached to the ring via a double bond. So the product would be benzene with a CH2 group attached via a double bond, making it a styrene-like structure. So the product would be 1-phenylethylene (styrene), but I'm not sure about the substitution pattern.

Wait, but the elimination would form a new double bond. So the product would be benzene with a substituent that's a vinyl group, like -CH2-CH2, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a substituent that's a methylene group (CH2) attached via a double bond.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a triple bond, but I'm not sure.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't produce any products, but that's unlikely. So if the reaction produces one product, the answer is B) 1. But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, another possibility: if the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, which is more symmetric, then the elimination could occur in two different positions, but due to symmetry, they would yield the same product. So only one product is formed.

So, if the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, and the base abstracts a hydrogen from either the 2 or 4 position, the elimination would form the same product, leading to only one product.

In that case, the number of possible products would be 1, so the answer is B) 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as I thought, and the answer is different.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that usually requires activating groups. Bromine is a deactivating group, so substitution might not occur easily. But under strong basic conditions, perhaps elimination is favored.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't form any products because the conditions aren't right for elimination. But the question states that the reaction occurs, so there must be products.

Considering all this, I think the correct answer is that only one product is formed. So the answer is B) 1.


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, is interpreted as 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, a symmetric molecule with bromine at position 1 and methyl groups at positions 2 and 4. NaNH₂, a strong base, can abstract a proton from the methyl group adjacent to the bromine, leading to elimination of HBr and the formation of a double bond.

In this case, the base can abstract a hydrogen from either the methyl group at position 2 or the methyl group at position 4. However, due to the symmetry of the molecule, both eliminations lead to the same product. The elimination forms a double bond between the benzene ring and the carbon where the methyl group was attached, resulting in a single unique product.

Thus, the reaction produces only one possible organic product.

Answer: B
