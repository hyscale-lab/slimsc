Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances. Hmm, it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

So, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Each has a certain mass, but I'm not sure if the mass plays a role here. The problem gives me elemental abundance ratios using the EW method under LTE. I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres.

Let me jot down the given data:

- Star_1:
  - Mass: 1.5 solar masses
  - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
  - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- Star_2:
  - Mass: 1.2 solar masses
  - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
  - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Wait, the Sun's photosphere has:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5

I need to find the ratio [nSi/nH]_1 / [nSi/nH]_2 or [nSi Star1 / nH Star1] divided by [nSi Star2 / nH Star2]?

Wait, no, the problem says the ratio of silicon atoms, so [Si/Star1] to [Si/Star2]?

Wait, the question is about the ratio of the silicon atoms in the photospheres. So I think it's (nSi_1 / nH_1) divided by (nSi_2 / nH_2). But maybe I should think in terms of the logarithms since the given data is in dex.

Wait, let me think about what each abundance ratio means. The notation [X/Y]_star is log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. So [X/Y]_star = log10(nX/nY)_star - log10(nX/nY)_sun.

Given that, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log(n
