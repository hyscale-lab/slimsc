Okay, so I've got this question about stars and parallax. Hmm, let me think. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the parallax (p) of a star is the reciprocal of its distance in parsecs. So p = 1/d, where d is distance in parsecs.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So, uniform distribution means the number density of stars is constant in space. Wait, but the way we observe them is different because of their distances. So, how does the number of stars per unit range of parallax change with plx?

I think I need to relate the number of stars in a certain range of parallax to their actual distances. Let's say we're considering a range of parallax from p to p+dp. Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, a small change in p corresponds to a change in distance.

So, if parallax increases by dp, that means the distance decreases. Let me write this down. The distance d = 1/p. So the change in distance dd would be the derivative of d with respect to p times dp. So, dd = (-1/p²) dp. Hmm, but wait, when p increases, d decreases. So maybe I should consider the range in terms of d.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the volume of a spherical shell. The number of stars in a shell of radius r and thickness dr is 4π r² dr multiplied by the number density of stars. Since the distribution is uniform, the number density is constant.

Wait, but how does this relate to parallax? Parallax p = 1/r. So r = 1/p. Then, dr = -1/p² dp. The negative sign indicates that as p increases, r decreases. But for the volume, we can take absolute values.

So, the volume of a shell at radius r with thickness dr is 4π r² dr. Substituting r = 1/p, dr = (-1/p²) dp. But I can write dr = (1/p²) |dp|, so the volume becomes 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp. Wait, no, wait. Wait, let's be careful.

Wait, the volume element is 4π r² dr. Since r = 1/p, dr = -1/p² dp. So, |dr| is (1/p²) dp. So substituting, the volume is 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp? Wait, that would be 4π (1/p^4) dp. That doesn't seem right. Wait, no, no. Wait, r^2 is (1/p)^2, and dr is (1/p²) dp. So 4π r² dr = 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp = 4π (1/p^4) dp. 

But the number of stars in that shell would be the volume multiplied by the number density. Since the distribution is uniform, the number of stars per unit volume (n) is constant. So number of stars N = n * 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx). So, for a small range dp, the number of stars is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number per unit par
