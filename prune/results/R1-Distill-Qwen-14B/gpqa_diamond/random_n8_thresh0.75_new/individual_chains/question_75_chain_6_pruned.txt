Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology, specifically about gene expression and constructs. Hmm, let me try to parse it step by step.

So the scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G protein is overexpressed. They're adding a coding sequence with an inducible promoter, and they want to add a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus for affinity purification. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine, but the protein isn't overexpressing as expected. They checked the construct's plus strand sequence and found an issue.

The options are about possible reasons why the protein isn't expressed. Let's look at the given sequence. 

Wait, looking at the sequence, I should probably check for any in-frame stop codons or issues with the reading frame. Let me see. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then comes some nucleotides. Let me look for TAA, TAG, or TGA, which are stop codons in the coding sequence.

Looking through the sequence, I'll scan through for any of these. Let's see:

The first part is ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Wait, I see a TGA towards the end. Let me find where that is. Let's look for TGA. Hmm, towards the end, there's a ...GAGTGA. So that would be the last few codons. Let's see: the last part is ...GCGTGA. Wait, the last few bases are ...GAGTGA. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop codon.

But wait, where is the stop codon in the sequence? Let me check the exact point. Let me count backwards from the end. The last part is CGAGTGA. So before that, it's ...GAGTGA. So the last codon is TGA. So the sequence ends with TGA, which is a stop codon. So the construct probably includes this stop codon.

Wait, but in the construct, the person wanted to add a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. So the construct should have the HA tag followed by the GADD45G coding sequence, right? So maybe the problem is that the stop codon is present in the wrong place in the construct.

Wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the construct should start with the HA sequence, then the GADD45G sequence. But in the given sequence, the first codon is ATG (start), then TAC (tyrosine), then CCA (proline), etc. Wait, but wait, the HA tag is a short peptide, typically from the influenza virus hemagglut
