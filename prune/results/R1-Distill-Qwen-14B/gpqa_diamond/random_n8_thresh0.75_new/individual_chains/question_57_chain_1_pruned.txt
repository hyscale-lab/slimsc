Okay, so I've got this physics problem about electron scattering, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me see what the question says. 

The question gives me phase shifts δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. The experiment is about elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. I'm supposed to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, which probably means beyond δ₄. The goal is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that scattering amplitude relates to the phase shifts in the partial wave expansion. The scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) can be expanded in terms of Legendre polynomials and phase shifts. Specifically, the expression involves a sum over l of (something with the phase shifts δ_l).

Wait, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident direction—I think that corresponds to when the angle θ is zero degrees. Because along the incident beam, the scattering angle is 0 (or 180 if it's backward, but maybe 0 here).

I recall that the scattering amplitude f has real and imaginary parts. The imaginary part is given by a term involving the sum of the sines of the phase shifts δ_l multiplied by some factors. Oh right, the formula for the imaginary part of f at θ=0 is ( - (1/(2k)) ) times the sum over l of ( (2l + 1) * sin δ_l ), where k is the wave number.

So the formula is Im f(0) = - (1/(2k)) * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l +1) sin δ_l.

Wait, but wait. I might have the sign wrong. Or maybe it depends on the conventions. Let me think again. The general form is f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l (1 - cosθ)} [ sin δ_l P_l(cosθ) + i cos δ_l P_l' (cosθ) ) ].

Wait no, another source says that the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts is f(θ, φ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ sin δ_l P_l (cosθ) + i cos δ_l P_l' (cosθ) ] e^{i(δ_l - lφ)} }.

Wait, but that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, when considering the imaginary part, perhaps it's simplified when considering θ=0. Because when θ is 0, cosθ=1, so P_l(1) is 1 for all l, since P_l(1)=1 for any l. And P_l'(1) is zero, because the derivative of P_l(x) at x=1 is zero. Because P_l(x) is a polynomial that's 1 at x=1, so the derivative would be zero there.

So, for θ=0, the expression simplifies. The amplitude becomes:

f(0, φ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) [ sin δ_l * 1 + i cos δ_l * 0 ] e^{i (δ_l -
