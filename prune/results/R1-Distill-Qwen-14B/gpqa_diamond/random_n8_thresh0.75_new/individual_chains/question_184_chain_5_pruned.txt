Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this. Let me see if I can figure it out by thinking it through step by step.

The question is about synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. I need to choose the correct sequence of reactions from the options A to D. That's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, let's figure out the structure of the target molecule. The formula is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, benzene ring with three substituents: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro groups. The numbering is such that tert-butyl is at position 2, ethoxy at 1, and nitro at 3. Wait, waitâ€”I need to get the numbering right. Let me sketch it mentally:

Positions are 1, 2, 3 around the ring. So, position 1 is ethoxy, 2 is tert-butyl, 3 is nitro. Wait, no. The substituents on benzene are in positions 1, 2, and 3. So, 1 is ethoxy, 2 is tert-butyl, 3 is nitro. But wait, benzene is a ring, so the numbering can be done in a way that gives the substituents the lowest possible numbers. Oh, but the target structure is specifically 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-n
