Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. 

The problem is about an electron's spin state and measuring probabilities and the average value of some operator. Let's try to parse what the question is asking.

First, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, so it's not normalized yet. I remember that to find probabilities, I need the state to be normalized. So I should probably normalize it first.

The first part asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation where Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Wait, that sounds familiar. Let me think. Oh, right! For a 2x2 matrix, the operator would look like this:

A = [[0, ħ/2],
     [ħ/2, 0]]

Because when i≠j, it's ħ/2, else 0. So this is a Pauli matrix scaled by ħ/2. The Pauli X matrix, if I'm not mistaken. Oh wait, no, Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this operator is just (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So its eigenstates are |+> and |->, which are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator. So the eigenstates are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), probably.

Wait, but wait. The operator's eigenvalues would be ±(ħ/2), right? Because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, so multiplying by ħ/2 gives ±ħ/2.

But the question is about finding the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator. So I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A and then the coefficients' squared magnitudes will be the probabilities.

Alternatively, since A is Hermitian, the probabilities are the square of the absolute values of the components when you project |alpha> onto each eigenvector.

So the plan is:

1. Normalize the given state |alpha>.
2. Find the eigenstates of operator A.
3. Express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates.
4. The coefficients' squares are the probabilities.
5. Also, find the average value of operator
