Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction, respectively. So, first, I need to find the relative speed between them, and then the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction like in classical mechanics, right? Oh right, because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). But wait, since both are moving in the same direction, I think the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Let me calculate the numerator first: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. For the denominator: (0.6*0.5)c² = 0.3c². So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel is (0.1c)/(0.7) = (1/7)c which is approximately 0.1428c. So about 0.14c. Looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c. So that's a clue.

Now, the total energy of the system. I remember that total energy in relativity includes the rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. Oh wait, no, wait. The total energy of a moving object is given by gamma times m c squared. So for each astronaut, their energies are gamma1 * 2m c² and gamma2 * 3m c².

Wait, let me compute gamma for each. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

First astronaut: v =0.6c. So v²/c² = 0.36. 1-0.36=0.64. sqrt(0.64)=0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8=1.25. So energy for astronaut 1 is 1.25 *2m c²
