Okay, so I have this organic chemistry question here about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? That makes them chiral. So, the question is asking which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism.

The options are four different organic moieties, and I need to determine which ones show optical isomerism. Let me go through each one step by step.

1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**. Okay, let me visualize this. It's a biphenyl structure where each phenyl ring has substituents. The substituents are at the 2 and 6 positions. Wait, so the two rings are connected at position 1 and 1'. The groups are in positions 2 and 2' on each ring, and there are nitro groups at 6 and 6'. The structure is symmetrical around the central bond, right? Wait, because the substituents are in positions that are mirror images across the central bond. So, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it can't be chiral. But wait, the substituents are in positions that might not allow for a plane of symmetry. Let me think: the two rings are connected and each has substituents at 2 and 6. Wait, if the substituents are at 2 on each ring, and nitro at 6 and 6'—so each ring has a nitro at position 6 relative to the central bond. So, when you have a biphenyl, whether the substituents are in positions that make the molecule symmetric.

Wait, the structure is 6,6'-dinitro, so each ring has a nitro at position 6. So, for each ring, the substituents are in 2 and 6 positions. Let me imagine the molecule: each ring has a methyl ester group (from the dimethyl) at position 2, and a nitro group at position 6. So, the substituents are opposite each other on each ring, but because the rings are connected, does that create a plane of symmetry? If the substituents are opposite, like para to each other on each ring, but the biphenyl itself—does that make the whole molecule have a plane of symmetry? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is meso. If the substituents are arranged such that there's a plane of symmetry, then it
