Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reaction mechanisms. But I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let's break it down.

First reaction: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with strong bases like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically forming an alkene through dehydrohalogenation. But wait, adamantane is a pretty rigid molecule, so the structure would influence where the elimination happens.

Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, right? So 1,3-dibromo would have Br atoms on adjacent carbons in the diamond lattice. When KOH is added, it probably abstracts a β-hydrogen, causing the two Brs to leave and form a double bond between those carbons. So the product would be 1,3-didehydrogenated adamantane… Wait, but wait, no—actually, elimination would form a double bond. So the product is likely 1,3-didehydroadamantane, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a bridged structure?

Wait, no, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a molecule with two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. When KOH is used, it's an E2 elimination, so two Br- would leave, and the double bond would form between the two carbons. So the product should be an adamantene, which is an adamantane with one double bond. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantene. That makes sense.

Looking at the NMR data for product 1: the 1H NMR shows peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). The IR has a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm-1. Wait, but wait, product 1 is an alkene, so IR should show a C=C stretch around 1640-1680 cm-1, but the given IR is at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Hmm, that's conflicting. So maybe I
