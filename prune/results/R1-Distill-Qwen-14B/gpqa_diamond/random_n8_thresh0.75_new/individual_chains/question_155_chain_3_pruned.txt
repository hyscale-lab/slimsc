Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about the uncertainty of an operator, specifically ΔP_z. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the expectation values, right? The formula is ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). Oh yeah, that's the one.

The system is in the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Oh wait, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the state is already expressed in the P_z eigenbasis. That might simplify things because if the state is in an eigenbasis of P_z, then the expectation value of P_z should be the eigenvalue corresponding to that state.

Wait, no. Wait a second. The given state is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So even though the basis is for P_z, the state is not necessarily an eigenstate of P_z. So I can't just take the eigenvalue directly; I need to compute the expectation values.

So the first step is to compute ⟨P_z⟩, which is the expectation value of P_z. Then I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩, which is the expectation value of P_z squared. Then plug them into the uncertainty formula.

Let me write down the matrix form of P_z. It's given as a 3x3 matrix:

P_z = [ [ħ, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, -ħ] ]

Wait, no. Let me look again. Oh yeah, the first row is (ħ, 0, 0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-ħ). So yes, that's correct.

The state vector is ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Let me double-check that. It's a 3-component vector. The first component is -1/2, second 1/√2, third -1/2.

So to find ⟨P_z⟩, I compute ψ† P_z ψ. Wait, no, more precisely, it's ψ^T P_z ψ. Because ψ is a column vector, so when you transpose it, you get a row vector.
