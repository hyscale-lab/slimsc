Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it. Let's read the question again.

The question says: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)? The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is involved in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when you break and reform carbon-carbon double bonds, right? Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, usually ruthenium-based, and it facilitates ring-closing, ring-opening, or cross metathesis.

The starting compound is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene has five carbons with the double bond starting at carbon 1. So, structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, 3-methylpent-1-ene would have a methyl branch on carbon 3. Let me number the carbons: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So, the double bond is between 1 and 2. Then, the 3rd carbon has a methyl group. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but 3-methyl would have a methyl on C3. So, C1 is CH2, C2 is CH, C3 is CH(CH3), then C4 and C5? Wait, no, wait. Let's count again. 

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. Now, if it's 3-methyl, that means on carbon 3 (the third carbon from the left), there's a methyl group. So carbon 3 is CH2 in the original, but with a methyl substituent. So the structure becomes CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, the chain would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Because, wait, pentene is five carbons. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The double bond is between 1 and 2. Then, at carbon 3, we have a methyl group.

So
