Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let's see. The question is a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I'll try to outline the reactions given. The problem describes a series of reactions involving compounds A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. My goal is to identify the structure of E to determine its molecular symmetry.

Reaction 1: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, A + 8B → C.

Reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E. So, C + 2D → E.

Reaction 3: C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids, F and G. F is strong, G is weak. So, C + H2O → A + F + G.

Reaction 4: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So, D + B → H.

Let me try to figure out what each of these compounds could be.

Starting with reaction 4: D + B → H, which is a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, acetone, etc. But since D and B are gases, maybe they're reacting to form something like H2O? For example, if B is H2 and D is O2, they react to form H2O. But wait, H2 and O2 are both gases, but they react in a 1:1 ratio? Wait, no, the reaction for water formation is 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. So that's 2:1. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe B is something else. Let's think about other possibilities.

Another common solvent is ethanol (CH3CH2OH). But then, the reactants D and B would have to be something that can form ethanol in a 1:1 ratio. Alternatively, maybe H is something like diethyl ether, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps H is NH3? No, NH3 is a gas, but it's not a solvent in the same way. Wait, maybe D and B are HCl and NaOH? No, because that would form NaCl and water. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is something else. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's try to think about reaction 1 and 2 first.

Reaction 1: A reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form C. The product is bright red, which makes me think of something like sulfur (which is bright red) or maybe a transition metal compound. But sulfur is a solid, so perhaps A is Fe, reacting with something else. Wait, another bright red solid could be mercury(II) oxide, but that's more of a brick red. Alternatively, maybe it's a chromium compound. Or perhaps it's something else entirely.

Wait, another possibility: maybe C is a metal sulfide. For example, copper(II) oxide is black, but maybe some other sulfide is red. Alternatively, perhaps it's an iron compound. Wait, when Fe reacts with Cl2, it forms FeCl3, which is a yellow solid. But maybe when it's in a different state or form, it's red.

Alternatively, let's think about a reaction where a metal reacts with a gas to form a compound. For example, if A is Na, and B is Cl2. Then, 2Na + Cl2 → NaCl. But that's not 8 equivalents. Wait, but 2 moles of Na react with 1 mole of Cl2, so the ratio is 2:1. Hmm, not matching the 8:1 ratio given here.

Wait, maybe B is a diatomic gas like O2. Then, perhaps A is aluminum. Aluminum reacts with O2 to form Al2O3. Let's see: 4Al + 3O2 → 2Al2O3. That's a 4:3 ratio. Not 8:1. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is a diatomic halogen, like Cl2. So, if A is Fe, then Fe + Cl2 → FeCl3. The reaction is 2Fe + 3Cl2 → 2FeCl3. That's a 2:3 ratio,
