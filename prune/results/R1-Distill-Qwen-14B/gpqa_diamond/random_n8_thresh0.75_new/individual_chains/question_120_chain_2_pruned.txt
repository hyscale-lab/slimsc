Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Parallax, right. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So, plx (in parsecs) equals 1/distance. So plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, like, if I make a slice in parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that slice?

I think this has to do with the distribution of stars in the galaxy. Assuming they're uniformly distributed, which probably means they're spread out evenly in all directions, but probably in a disk or something. But the question says uniformly distributed, so maybe it's an infinite or uniform density everywhere.

Wait, but the number of stars would depend on the volume of space they occupy. Because stars are spread out, the number in a certain region depends on the volume. So, if the density is uniform, then the number would be proportional to the volume.

So let's model this. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number density (stars per unit volume) is constant. So n = constant.

Now, the volume corresponding to a range in parallax. Parallax is related to distance, so we need to think about how the volume changes with distance.

I remember that the volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4πd² dd. Because the surface area is 4πd², and multiplying by thickness gives the volume.

But wait, since parallax plx is 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, let's rewrite the volume in terms of parallax.

d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, because plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Taking derivative, dd/dplx = -1/(plx²). So, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Since we're dealing with positive ranges, maybe the negative just indicates direction, but in terms of magnitude, the volume will be positive.

So the volume element is 4π d² dd. Substituting d=1/plx, d² = 1/plx². So 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, because dd is (1/plx²) dplx. So putting it all together:

Volume dV = 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

Wait, the spherical shell volume is 4πd² * dd. So in terms of parallax:

d = 1/plx, so substituting:

dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd)

But dd = -(1/plx²) dplx, so substituting:

dV = 4π (1/plx²) * (-1/plx² dplx )

But the volume can't be negative, so taking the absolute value, dV = 4π (1/plx^4) d
