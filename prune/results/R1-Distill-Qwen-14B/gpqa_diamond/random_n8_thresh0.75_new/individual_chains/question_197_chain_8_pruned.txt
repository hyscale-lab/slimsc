Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to think it through. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, then figuring out what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm.

First, the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad range, maybe due to an O-H stretch or an N-H. But the most prominent ones would be in that region. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl, probably a ketone or an ester or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids have broad O-H stretches around 2500-3000 cm-1, right? But the 3400–2500 is a very broad range, which could suggest an O-H. Oh, but wait, 1720 is more of a carbonyl, maybe ester or ketone. Wait, but carboxylic acids have their carbonyl around 1700, but if the O-H is present, maybe that's it.

Looking at the NMR. The 1H NMR data: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) is a strong singlet, maybe a phenolic O-H? Or an aldehyde proton? Aldehydes are around 9-10, but phenolic O-H is deshielded and broad, so that might fit. Then, 8.0 ppm (d
