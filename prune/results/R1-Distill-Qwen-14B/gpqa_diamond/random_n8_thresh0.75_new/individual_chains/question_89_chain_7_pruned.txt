Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break it down.

First step: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C gives a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR and IR data are provided for product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to get product 3. Finally, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in the NMR of product 3.

Hmm. Let's take it one step at a time.

First, reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Since KOH is a strong base, probably an elimination reaction is happening. In dibrominated compounds, especially vicinal dihalides, treatment with a base typically leads to elimination (E2) forming an alkene. So product 1 is likely an adamantylene (adamantane with a double bond). Wait, the structure of adamantane is a diamondoid with four cyclohexane rings fused in a particular way. So if you remove two bromines from adjacent carbons, the elimination would form a double bond between those positions. But wait, the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, but in adamantane, are the 1 and 3 positions adjacent? I think in adamantane, each carbon is connected in a way that each has two adjacent carbons. Wait, maybe the structure is such that 1 and 3 are not adjacent, but perhaps in the same face or something. Wait, I might be getting this wrong. Let me think. Oh, wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane — perhaps the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, but in adamantane, each carbon is part of a diamond structure. Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to a bridged structure.

Wait, when KOH is used with a vicinal dihalide, it forms an alkene via dehydrohalogenation. So product 1 should be an alkene. Then, the NMR for product 1 is given as 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl group. Wait, but product 1 is from an elimination reaction, which typically forms an alkene. But the IR shows a carbonyl, which is unexpected. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong about the reaction.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the initial reaction is a substitution. Wait, but KOH is a strong base, so more likely elimination. Alternatively, if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps elimination is not possible because the two Brs are not on adjacent carbons. Wait, in adamantane, the positions are such that each carbon is connected to three CH2 groups in a particular arrangement. Wait, no, adamantane is a polycyclic structure where each carbon is part of multiple rings. So in 1,3-dib
