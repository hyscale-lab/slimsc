Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing some solutions. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on enthalpy calculations, but I'll try to work it out.

The question says that 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed. I need to find the enthalpy change, and the options are given in kcal or kJ. Wait, but enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. Oh right, the most common one is when a strong acid and strong base react, releasing a certain amount of heat per mole of H+ or OH-.

First, I think I should figure out how many moles of H+ and OH- are present in each solution. Because when they mix, the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat.

Let me break down each solution:

1. HCl: It's a strong acid, so it completely dissociates. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+. So, moles of HCl = Molarity × Volume (in liters). The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. So 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles of HCl → 0.1 moles H+.

2. H2SO4: Sulfuric acid is a strong acid, and it's diprotic, meaning each molecule can donate two H+ ions. So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles H+. The volume is 300 mL, which is 0.3 L. So moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Multiply by 2 for H+: 0.18 moles H+.

3. Ba(OH)2: This is a strong base. Each formula unit gives two OH- ions because Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-. So, moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Multiply by 2 for OH-: 0.2 moles OH-.

Now, summing up the H+ and OH-:

Total H+ = 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles.
Total OH- = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but neutralization requires H+ + OH- → H2O. So the limiting reagent here is the one with the smaller moles. So comparing 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-, OH- is less. So all the OH- will react, and some H+ will remain.

But wait, wait. The OH- is 0.2 moles. So the reaction will consume 0.2 moles H+ and produce 0.2 moles H2O.

But wait, what about the excess H+? The problem is about enthalpy of neutralization, which is usually per mole of H+ reacting. But wait, neutralization in terms of acid and base is when they react in a 1:1 ratio. But when you have excess acid or base, the neutralization is only up to the limiting reagent.

But wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is typically the heat released per mole of H+ (or OH-) consumed. So in this case, the maximum heat would be based on the moles of OH- reacting, which is 0.2 moles. Because OH- is the limiting reagent.

Wait, but wait a minute. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, releasing two H+ ions. So each mole contributes twice as much H+ as HCl.

So, in the reaction between the acids and the base:

The H+ from both HCl and H2SO4 will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

So, the total H+ is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28.

The total OH- is 0.2 moles.

H+ + OH- → H2O. So 0.2 moles of OH- will react with 0.2 moles of H+.

The total moles of H+ available are 0.28, so 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles H+ left. But the OH- is all consumed.

So the neutralization involves 0.2 moles H+ reacting with 0.2 moles OH-.

Wait, but in reality, the neutralization is the amount of acid that can be neutralized by the base. So the neutralization here is 0.2 moles of acid (H+). Because Ba(OH)2 is the base, and it's neutralizing the acids.

So the reaction is between H+ from acid (HCl and H2SO4) and OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Now, the enthalpy of neutralization is typically given in kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of OH-). For strong acids and strong bases, the enthalpy of neutralization is around -57 kJ/mol (or about -24 kcal/mol). Wait, I should confirm the exact value. Wait, I think the standard value for enthalpy of neutralization is approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of OH-), which is equivalent to -24.2 kcal per mole. Because 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal (because 57 /4.184 ≈13.6). Wait, wait that can't be right. Wait, no, let me calculate: 57 kJ per mole is approximately 13.6 kcal (since 4.184 kJ = 1 kcal). But wait, 57 kJ is 57,000 J. 1 kcal is 4184 J. So 57,000 /4184 ≈ 13.6 kcal. Wait, but I might be mixing this up. Alternatively, I might be confusing the units. So wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is known to be about -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and strong bases. So that's per mole of H+.

So for each mole of H+ that reacts, it releases 57 kJ of heat. Since the reaction is exothermic, the enthalpy change (ΔH) is negative.

Wait, but in the problem, when the solutions are mixed, some of the H+ will react with OH-, and the rest will remain. So the neutralization only involves the limiting reagent, which is OH- here.

So the amount of H+ reacting is 0.2 moles (since OH- is 0.2). So the enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options given. Let me check the options:

Options are A) -2.72 kcal, B) -11.42 kcal, C) -3.80 kcal, D) -16.0 kJ.

Wait, but let's be precise. Let me think again. Or maybe I made a mistake in units.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total H+ and OH- again.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

OH- is 0.2 moles.

So moles of H+ reacting is 0.2, because OH- is 0.2. So moles of H+ consumed = 0.2.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57,000 J) = -11,400 J, which is -11.4 kJ. Wait, but option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is in kcal. Let me try that.

Wait, 57 kJ/mol is about 13.6 kcal/mol (since 57/4.184 ≈13.6). So per mole of H+, it's -13.6 kcal.

So for 0.2 moles, it would be 0.2 * 13.6 ≈ 2.72 kcal. But since it's exothermic, it's -2.72 kcal. Which matches option A. Wait, but earlier when I thought in kJ, it didn't match any option, but in kcal, it does.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check. The enthalpy of neutralization is typically given as about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of OH-). So that's per mole of reaction.

Wait, but the problem is about mixing the solutions and calculating the enthalpy change. So perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- available, determine the amount that can react (the limiting reagent), then multiply by the enthalpy per mole.

So with 0.28 moles H+ and 0.2 moles OH-, the reaction will proceed until OH- is all used up, consuming 0.2 moles H+ and producing 0.2 moles H2O.

So the moles of reaction is 0.2. So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57,000 J) = -11,400 J → -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, let's check the conversion between kJ and kcal again.

Wait, 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ. So 11.4 kJ is about 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So, 0.2 moles of H+ reacting would release 0.2 *13.6 kcal = 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting results when using kJ and kcal. So which one should I use?

Looking back at the options: option A is -2.72 kcal, option D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, another thing: perhaps I'm forgetting that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in the presence of a strong base, the first H+ is deprotonated, but the second may not be. But wait, in reality, H2SO4 is a strong acid and in solution, it dissociates completely in two steps, releasing both H+ ions. So both H+ are available for neutralization.

But wait, maybe in neutralization, each mole of H2SO4 can donate two H+ ions, but when reacting with a base, each mole of H+ reacts. So the approach I took earlier is correct.

So, let me re-examine the calculations. Let's compute the total H+ and OH- again.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol → 0.2 mol OH-.

So total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2.

Limiting reagent is OH- (0.2 moles). So 0.2 moles of H+ will react.

Enthalpy per mole of H+ is about -57 kJ/mol. So 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ, which is -11,400 J. But option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching.

Alternatively, if using the per mole of H+ basis in kcal: 57 kJ/mol ≈13.6 kcal/mol.

So 0.2 * (-13.6 kcal) = -2.72 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal.

But the options have B as -11.42 kcal. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moles of H+ and OH-.

Wait, let me re-calculate:

HCl:

Volume: 500 mL = 0.5 L.

Molarity: 0.2 M.

Moles HCl = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4:

Volume: 300 mL = 0.3 L.

Molarity: 0.3 M → 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol H2SO4. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2:

Volume: 200 mL = 0.2 L.

Molarity: 0.5 M → 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol OH-.

So that's correct.

So the moles reacting are 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (−57,000 J) = −11,400 J = −11.4 kJ. Which isn't an option, but option B is -11.42 kcal.

Wait, wait a second. Let me check the conversion factor again.

Yes, 1 kJ is approximately 0.239 kcal (since 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ → 1 kJ = 1/4.184 kcal ≈ 0.239 kcal).

So 11.4 kJ is 11.4 * 0.239 ≈ 2.72 kcal.

So the enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But why is option B -11.42 kcal? That would be if the calculation was done in kJ and then incorrectly converted. Let me see:

If someone thought that each mole releases 57 kcal instead of kJ, that would be a mistake. 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kcal. But that's not correct because 57 is in kJ, not kcal.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is wrong. Maybe it's considering all H+ available, but that's not correct because the OH- is the limiting factor. Let me think: if the OH- is 0.2, then only 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized. So the correct enthalpy is 0.2 * (−57 kJ) = −11.4 kJ ≈ −2.72 kcal.

So the answer should be option A: -2.72 kcal.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the total H+ that is in excess. But that doesn't make sense for the neutralization enthalpy, which is the heat released during the neutralization reaction.

So, the correct answer is option A.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing the given solutions, we first determine the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ available:

1. **HCl (500 mL, 0.2 M):**  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely, contributing \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

2. **H₂SO₄ (300 mL, 0.3 M):**  
   Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each mole of H₂SO₄ contributes 2 moles of H⁺, so total \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

3. **Ba(OH)₂ (200 mL, 0.5 M):**  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ contributes 2 moles of OH⁻, so total \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

### Reaction and Limiting Reagent
The neutralization reaction is:  
\[
\text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]  
The total moles of H⁺ available are \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \), and the total moles of OH⁻ are \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
Since OH⁻ is the limiting reagent, only \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺ reacts with \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻.

### Enthalpy of Neutralization
The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) or \( -13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol} \) per mole of H⁺ or OH⁻.  
For \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺ reacting:  
\[
\Delta H = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
\]  
Converting to kcal:  
\[
\Delta H = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol}) = -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
\]

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A (-2.72 kcal):** Matches the calculated value in kcal.  
- **Option B (-11.42 kcal):** Incorrect, as it does not match the conversion from kJ to kcal.  
- **Option C (-3.80 kcal):** Incorrect, as it does not align with the stoichiometry or calculations.  
- **Option D (-16.0 kJ):** Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value in kJ.

The correct answer is **Option A (-2.72 kcal)**.  
Answer: A
