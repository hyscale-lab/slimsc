Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read what it says. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also mention that the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25°C. The stability constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent and forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The stability constant, K, tells us how stable the complex is. A high K means the complex is very stable, so it doesn't dissociate much.

So the question is, what is [Ca^2+] in this solution? The options are A to D.

Let me think about the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. The complex is CaY^2-, where Y^4- is the EDTA^4- ion. The dissociation reaction would be:

CaY^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + Y^4-

The stability constant K for this reaction is given by K = [Ca^2+][Y^4-] / [CaY^2-].

Wait, actually, the stability constant is the inverse of the dissociation constant. Or wait, no. Let me get that right. The formation constant (Kf) is [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y^4-]). So when they say K_Ca-EDTA is 5e10, that's the formation constant. So the dissociation constant K_d would be 1/(Kf) = 1/(5e10), which is 2e-11.

But for this problem, perhaps I don't need to worry about that. The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and assuming it's the only source of Ca^2+ and Y^4-.

Wait, the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So in a stoichiometric solution, meaning the concentration of the complex is much higher than the individual ions. So when the complex dissociates slightly, the [Ca^2+] and [Y^4-] will be approximately equal because the reaction is 1:1.

Let me denote the concentration of CaY^2- as 0.02 M. Let x be the concentration of Ca^2+ that dissociates from the complex. So at equilibrium:

[CaY^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 M (since x is probably very small compared to 0.02)
[Ca^2+] = x
[Y^4-] = x

So the expression for K (the formation constant) is:

Kf = [CaY^2-] / ([Ca^2+][Y^4-])

Plugging in the values:

5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x)
5e10 = 0.02 / x²
Rearranging, x² = 0.02 / 5e10
x² = 2e-3 / 5e10? Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2, right?

So x² = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12.

Taking the square root of both sides: x = sqrt(0.4e-12) = sqrt(4e-13) = approx 6.32e-7.

Wait a minute, sqrt(0.4e-12) is sqrt(4e-13) which is 2e-6.5? Wait, let me compute it accurately.

0.4e-12 is 4e-13.

sqrt(4e-13) = sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5 = 2 * 3.16e-7? Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16 is about 6.32e-7.

So x is approximately 6.3e-7 M. That would be the concentration of Ca^2+.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that should be the answer.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the formation and dissociation constants. The K given is the formation constant, Kf. So the formula I used is correct.

Alternatively, considering the dissociation, K_d = [Ca^2+][Y^4-]/[CaY^2-] = 1/(Kf) = 2e-11.

So, setting up the dissociation equation:

x * x / (0.02) = 2e-11.

So x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13.

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = same as before, 6.3e-7.

Yes, same result. So the concentration of Ca^2+ is 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the stability constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{Y}^{4-}\) ions that dissociate from the complex. At equilibrium:
- \([\text{CaY}^{2-}] = 0.02 - x \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\) (since \( x \) is expected to be small),
- \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x\),
- \([\text{Y}^{4-}] = x\).

The formation constant \( K_f \) is given by:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
