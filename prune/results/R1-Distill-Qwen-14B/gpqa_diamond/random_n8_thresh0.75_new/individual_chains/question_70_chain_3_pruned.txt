Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts. But I'll take it step by step.

The question is about a series of reactions and determining the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v. I'm not exactly sure what each of these symmetry groups correspond to, so maybe I should start by recalling what those symmetries mean.

Molecular symmetry groups are based on the different symmetry elements a molecule has. For example, C2 means a 2-fold rotation axis. D4h would have a four-fold rotation axis with a horizontal mirror plane. D∞h is like a diatomic molecule symmetry, which is higher and includes an infinite-fold rotation axis. C2v has a 2-fold rotation and a vertical mirror plane.

Now, looking at the reactions given. The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I'm trying to think of a reaction where a solid reacts with a gas in such a way. Maybe something like a metal reacting with a halogen? Or perhaps a nitrate formation? Wait, bright red product. Hmm, I remember that when metals like copper react with certain gases, they form colored compounds. For example, Cu and sulfur might form a red compound, but wait, the reaction involves 8 equivalents. That seems a lot. Maybe it's something like the formation of a nitride? Or perhaps a sulfate?

Wait, another thought: Maybe solid A is a metal and gas B is a halogen. For example, sodium (Na) reacting with chlorine gas (Cl2) would form NaCl. But that's a 1:1 ratio, not 8. Hmm, but the question says 8 equivalents, which could mean moles. So if B is a diatomic gas, like Cl2, 8 equivalents would be 4 moles of Cl2. So if A is something like sodium (which is monovalent), reacting with Cl2 (diatomic) would require 2 moles of Cl2 per mole of Na to get NaCl. But 8 equivalents might mean 8 moles of Cl2 reacting with 1 mole of A. Let me think: if A is, say, aluminum (Al^3+), and B is Cl2, then each Al would need 3 Cl atoms. So 3 Cl2 would be needed per Al. But 8 equivalents? Maybe it's a transition metal with a higher valency. Alternatively, perhaps it's something else.

Wait, another angle: the product C reacts with D in a 1:1 ratio to form E. Then, C also reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C reacts with water, it produces two acids. Hmm. Strong acid and weak acid. Maybe one is sulfuric acid (strong) and another is carbonic acid (weak), but I'm not sure. Or maybe sulfamic acid? Wait, no. Alternatively, if C is a sulfide, reacting with water could form H2S (but that's a weak acid, but wait, H2S is a weak acid. Alternatively, if C is a nitride, it could produce NH3 and maybe some other acid. Not sure.

Wait, another thought: when a metal reacts with a halogen, the product is a binary ionic compound. But if C reacts with D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. Hmm, maybe E is a highly toxic gas like HCl, but that's not right because HCl isn't extremely hazardous in that context. Wait, perhaps E is something like phosgene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the second reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to produce E. So if C is something like SO3, and D is H2O, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride or sulfide. Let me think again.

Wait, the first reaction: solid A + 8 B → C. If B is Cl2, and A is something that reacts in an 8:1 ratio. Maybe A is a metal with +2 charge, and each B molecule contributes two Cl- ions. So for each A, 8 Cl would be needed. Wait, 8 Cl would be 4 Cl2 molecules. Because each Cl2 is two atoms. So 4 Cl2 per A. So if A is Ca (Ca^2+), then 4 Cl2 (which is 8 Cl atoms) would react to form CaCl2. But that's a 1:4 ratio of A to Cl2 in terms of moles. So 8 equivalents of B (Cl2) would be 4 moles, and A would be 1 mole. So 1 mole of A and 8 moles of B (Cl2) would produce 1 mole of CaCl2. But I'm not sure if CaCl2 is bright red. Calcium compounds are usually white or pale.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe A is a metal like Fe, and B is Cl2. Iron reacts with Cl2 to form FeCl3. Bright red? Well, FeCl3 is usually yellowish. Alternatively, maybe it's another reaction. What about the reaction of a metal with
