Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow and think through each part.

The problem has two reactions, A and B, and I need to choose the correct major products from the given options. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different structures for products A and B.

Starting with Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, which suggests an elimination reaction might be happening here. Wait, but ethyl acrylate is an ester with an acrylate group; that's a good Michael acceptor, right? So maybe this is a Michael addition reaction.

Wait, the starting material is a ketone. 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me try to draw its structure. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1. Wait, actually, wait. The numbering would be such that the ketone is at position 1, so the carbonyl is attached to C1. Then, at position 2, there's an ethyl group, and at position 6, a methyl group. Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the cyclohexane ring has a ketone at C1. Then, C2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group (since it's 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl). Wait, no, wait. No, 2-ethyl would mean on C2, a substituent is an ethyl group. And 2,6-dimethyl would mean C2 and C6 each have a methyl group. So C2 has both a methyl and ethyl group attached. Hmm, that's a lot of substituents on C2. So the structure would be cyclohexanone (position 1), with C2 bearing both -CH2CH3 (ethyl) and two -CH3 groups (from 2,6-dimethyl?), wait no. Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexane ring with the ketone at C1 (position 1). Then, C2 has an ethyl group
