Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents on two unknown compounds, A and B. The products after treatment with LiBH4 and BH3 (with H+ in both cases) are the same: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one respectively. I need to determine what the starting materials A and B are from the given options.

Hmm, so I think this involves some kind of reduction reaction. The products are ketones, but wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no, LiBH4 is used to reduce carbonyl groups, like ketones or aldehydes, but wait, wait, pyran-2-one is a cyclic ketone. So maybe the starting material is an ester or something that can be reduced to form a cyclic hemiacetal or something else?

Wait, wait. Let me think. Pyran-2-one is a six-membered ring with an oxygen, so it's similar to a cyclic ether but with a ketone. So the product is a cyclic hemiacetal? Or maybe it's a cyclic ketone. Wait, tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one would be a saturated six-membered ring (since it's tetrahydro) with an oxygen and a ketone at position 2.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are esters or something that upon reduction form a cyclic structure. Oh, wait, maybe it's about reducing an ester to form a diol, but no, the product is a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps it's about reducing a cyclic ester or something else.

Wait, another approach: the products are both (R) and (S) configurations. So the starting materials must have some stereochemistry that leads to the formation of either R or S when reduced.

Wait, but the starting materials are treated with different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3. Oh wait, LiBH4 is typically used for reductions of esters, ketones, aldehydes. BH3 is often used in hydroboration reactions, which are anti-Markovnikov additions to alkenes and have specific stereochemistry.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a ketone. So maybe the starting material is an ester, which upon reduction becomes a diol, but then how does that form a cyclic ketone? Hmm, perhaps it's a Claisen or Aldol condensation scenario, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the reaction is about reducing a cyclic ketone, but that doesn't make sense because the product is a cyclic ketone. Oh, wait, maybe the starting materials are epoxides? Or perhaps the starting material is a hemiacetal that upon reduction forms a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the product is 4-ethyl... So that suggests that there's an ethyl group at the 4-position of the ring. The starting material may have an ethyl group in a certain position that, upon reduction, ends up there.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are esters. For example, if the starting material is an ester like R-O-CO-O-R', then when reduced, maybe it becomes a diol or something else. Wait, but LiBH4 can reduce esters to alcohols. Wait, esters when treated with LiBH4 would typically be reduced to the corresponding alcohols, but I'm not sure how that would form a cyclic ketone.

Wait, another thought: maybe the starting materials are cyclic ketones with protecting groups, and the reduction is removing the protecting group. No, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are epoxides. When epoxides are treated with LiBH4 or BH3, they might open up. But how would that lead to a ketone?

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are some kind of cyclic esters, like lactones. When a lactone is treated with a reducing agent, it could open up and form a diol, but how would that form a cyclic ketone?

Wait, perhaps the products are formed via reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, but that doesn't seem right because the product is a ketone, not an alcohol. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are beta-keto esters. When a beta-keto ester is reduced, perhaps it forms a secondary alcohol, but that doesn't fit with the product being a ketone.

Wait a second, maybe the starting materials are acetals. Acetals can be hydrolyzed under acidic conditions to form carbonyl compounds. But wait, the products here are ketones, so maybe the starting materials are some kind of acetals that, when treated with a reducing agent, are hydrolyzed and reduced to form the ketone.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves the reduction of an ester to a diol, which then cyclizes to form a hemiacetal or something similar.

Wait, let me think about the product structure. 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Pyran is a six-membered oxygen-containing ring. So tetrahydro implies it's a saturated ring (like THP, tetrahydropyran). So, structure-wise, the ring is O connected to two CH2 groups on either side. The ketone is at position 2: so it's (CH2)3-O-C(=O)-CH2-CH2.

Wait, no, wait, pyran is six-membered. So in 2H-pyran-2-one, the ring is O at position 1, then positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So the ketone is at position 2, so the ring would have an oxygen at position 1, and a carbonyl group at position 2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic hemiacetal, but not sure.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an ester that when reduced forms a diol which then forms a cyclic hemiacetal. Let's try to think about the reaction mechanisms.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce esters to alcohols, but maybe it's also used in other reductions. Alternatively, BH3 is more about hydroboration reactions, which add to alkenes in an anti-Markovnikov fashion, leading to alcohols upon protonation.

Wait, but the product is a ketone, so perhaps the starting material is an epoxide. Alternatively, maybe it's something else.

Wait, perhaps this is about the reduction of a cyclic ketone to form a secondary alcohol, but the product is a ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic hemiacetals that upon reduction form the ketone.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because reducing a hemiacetal would probably break it down, not form a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is about the reduction of an ester group. For example, if the starting material is a cyclic ester, like a lactone, then reduction would open it up. But how would that lead to a cyclic ketone?

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a ketone with certain substituents, and the reduction is leading to the formation of the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester. Let me think: a beta-keto ester is something like RCO-COOR'. When reduced, perhaps it forms a diol, but that may not form a ring.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options, the starting materials are all (R) or (S) configurations of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, the starting materials are pentanoic acids substituted with an ethyl group and an isobutoxy group, and an oxo group (a ketone) at position 5.

Wait, so the structure of the starting material, let me imagine that: it's a pentanoic acid, so five carbons, with a carboxylic acid group at the end. Then positions 3 has an ethyl group, position 5 has an isobutoxy group and a ketone. Wait, but position 5 is the last carbon before the carboxylic acid? Or is it another substituent.

Wait, the structure would be something like: CH2-CH2-COOH, but with substituents. Let me try drawing it.

Wait, 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. The pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but with substituents on carbons 3 and 5.

Carbon 1: COOH
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: CH(CH2CH2CH3)
Wait, no, ethyl group is CH2CH3. So 3-ethyl would be a CH2CH3 group on carbon 3.

Wait, the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-O-...?

Wait, no, wait. Let's number the pentanoic acid from the COOH end: 1 (COOH), 2 (CH2), 3 (CH2), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH3?), but the substituents are on 3 and 5.

Wait, no, wait. The IUPAC name is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Pentanoic acid is five carbons: COOH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH? No, wait, it's CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. So the chain is COOH-(CH2)3-CH3.

But the substituents:

At carbon 3: ethyl group.

At carbon 5: isobutoxy and oxo.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-O-... (but that's getting a bit complicated.)

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The pentanoic acid is:

CH2(COOH)CH2CH(CH2CH3)CO-O-isobutyl.

Wait, maybe not. Let me break it down.

The parent chain is pentanoic acid: positions 1 to 5.

Position 3: ethyl group.

Position 5: isobutoxy (O-isobutyl) and a ketone (oxo).

So the structure would be:

1: COOH

2: CH2

3: CH2 (but with an ethyl group substituent?), wait no, position 3 is CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, more accurately:

The structure is:

COOH-CH2-C(CH2CH3)(CO-O-isobutyl)-CH2-CH3?

Wait, but that would make the chain longer than pentanoic. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the correct structure is:

Carboxylic acid group on C-1.

C-2: CH2.

C-3: CH with an ethyl group (CH2CH3).

C-4: CH2.

C-5: C=O (oxo group) and an isobutoxy group.

Wait, but that would make the chain longer than five carbons if the substituents are on C-5. Hmm, maybe I'm not getting the structure right, but perhaps that's not the main point right now.

The key point is that when these compounds (A and B) are treated with LiBH4 and BH3, respectively, they form the same product but with different configurations (R and S).

Wait, but both reactions produce 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, but as R and S configurations respectively.

Wait, so the starting materials must have the correct configuration that upon reduction produces either R or S.

Wait, but the starting materials are the same compound in the options, except for their configurations. Looking at the options:

Option A: Both A and B are S configuration.

Option B: Both A and B are R.

Option C: A is S, B is R.

Option D: A is R, B is S.

So the correct answer is either C or D, because if the starting material's configuration determines the product's configuration, and since the reducing agents are different, perhaps they influence the stereochemistry.

Wait, but in this case, the reducing agents are LiBH4 and BH3. Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce esters, ketones, etc., to their corresponding alcohols. BH3 is more commonly used in hydroboration reactions, which follow anti-Markovnikov addition and have specific stereochemical outcomes.

Wait, but wait, in the case of ester reductions, LiBH4 would reduce an ester to a primary alcohol, while BH3 might do something else. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, and the reduction leads to diols with different configurations.

Wait, no, the product is a ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone). Let me think: a lactone would have the structure O-CO-O in a ring. When reduced, it would open the ring and produce a diol. But how would that form a cyclic ketone?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal ester, which upon reduction forms a diol and then cyclizes to form the ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an ester that, when reduced, forms a secondary alcohol which then undergoes cyclization to form the cyclic ketone. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester. The reduction of a beta-keto ester with LiBH4 could lead to the formation of a secondary alcohol, but I'm not sure.

Another angle: the product is a tetrahydropyran-2-one. So, perhaps the starting material is a diol that, upon treatment with acid, forms the cyclic hemiacetal (like the formation of a cyclic ether). But I'm not sure how that relates to the reducing agents.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide. Epoxides can be opened by nucleophilic attack. But again, I'm not seeing the connection to the product.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, and then the alcohol undergoes some kind of cyclization to form the cyclic ketone. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the stereochemistry part. The product has (R) and (S) configurations, depending on which starting material is used.

So, the starting materials A and B are enantiomers, perhaps? Because when treated with different reducing agents, they form the opposite configurations.

Wait, but the options have starting materials that are either R or S configuration. So, for example, A is (R) and B is (S), or vice versa.

So, the question is, when each is treated with LiBH4 or BH3, which one gives R and which gives S.

Wait, perhaps the reaction involves the reduction of a ketone to form an alcohol, and the configuration of the starting material dictates the product configuration.

But how do the reducing agents affect the outcome? LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and typically leads to the formation of the more substituted alcohol, but in the case of a cyclic ketone, perhaps the approach of the hydride determines the stereochemistry.

Wait, wait, when a cyclic ketone is reduced, the hydride would attack from the less hindered side. So, the configuration of the starting material would influence which face the hydride approaches.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, and the reducing agent breaks certain bonds leading to the formation of the ketone with specific stereochemistry.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible products and the starting materials.

The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the ring has an ethyl group at position 4.

The starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Wait, so the starting material has a pentanoic acid chain with substituents.

When this is treated with LiBH4 or BH3, perhaps the ester group is reduced. Wait, but wait, the starting material is a carboxylic acid, not an ester. Hmm.

Wait, LiBH4 can reduce carboxylic acids, but I think it's not very effective; more commonly, LiBH4 is used for esters, ketones, aldehydes. Carboxylic acids are typically reduced with stronger agents like LiAlH4 to form primary alcohols.

Wait, but the options say that the starting material is a pentanoic acid with substituents. So, if the starting material is a carboxylic acid, perhaps it's converted to an acid chloride first, but the question says it's treated with LiBH4 or BH3.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a lactone (a cyclic ester). For example, if the pentanoic acid is cyclized into a five-membered lactone (gamma-lactone), but that would have four carbons in the ring, which doesn't match the product.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a beta-propiolactone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester. The starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Wait, no, that's a description of a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps the reaction involves the reduction of the ester group (if the starting material is an ester), but the starting material as given is a carboxylic acid.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the possible reaction mechanisms.

If the starting material is a beta-keto ester, for example, RCO-COOR', then treatment with LiBH4 could reduce the ketone group to an alcohol. But then how would that form a cyclic ketone?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and LiBH4 reduces it to a diol, which then cyclizes to form a cyclic ketone. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Wait, another thought: maybe the starting materials are cyclic ethers with a ketone substituent. When treated with a reducing agent, they form alcohols, which could lead to ring formation.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the problem from another angle. The product is a cyclic ketone, and the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative.

Perhaps the reaction is a Claisen condensation, where the starting material forms an enolate, which then undergoes aldol condensation to form a ring. Then, upon reduction, the ring is formed.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a beta-keto acid. When treated with a reducing agent, it forms a secondary alcohol, which then cyclizes to form a ring. But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, another approach: the product is a bicyclic compound? No, it's a six-membered ring with an ethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and the reduction leads to the formation of a diol, which then forms an acetal with the hydroxyl groups, but that's speculative.

Wait, I'm going in circles here. Let me think about the reagents. LiBH4 is a hydride source, which would typically add to carbonyl groups.

If the starting material is a ketone, LiBH4 would reduce it to a secondary alcohol. But the product is a ketone, so that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester group, which upon reduction forms a primary alcohol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, but how would that happen? Let me think. If I have RCOOR', and I reduce it with LiBH4, I get RCH2OH and R'OH (if R' is an alkyl group). But that doesn't directly form a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is part of a larger structure, such as a cyclic ester (lactone). When reduced, the lactone ring opens, and the resulting diol could cyclize to form a new ring, perhaps a six-membered ring with a ketone.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure about the mechanism here.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has an ester group and a ketone. For example, a beta-keto ester. When reduced, the ketone group is converted to an alcohol, which could lead to ring formation.

Wait, another thought: when a beta-keto ester is treated with a reducing agent like LiBH4, it could reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol, but the ester remains. Then, under acidic conditions, the ester could undergo cyclization to form a ring.

Wait, but in the presence of H+, perhaps the ester group gets protonated, leading to the formation of a good leaving group, and then a ring forms via intramolecular attack.

Wait, but I'm not exactly certain.

Wait, perhaps the product is formed via a reduction of an epoxide. Epoxides, when treated with LiBH4, can open to form diols. But how does that lead to a ketone?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with a ketone substituent. When LiBH4 is added, it reduces the ketone to an alcohol, but that doesn't explain the product.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the correct answer based on the options and the configurations.

The question is, which starting materials (A and B) would, upon treatment with LiBH4 and BH3 respectively, produce the R and S configurations in the product.

So, the product's configuration (R or S) depends on the starting material's configuration and the reducing agent.

Since the product is a cyclic ketone, perhaps the reduction of a cyclic ester or lactone occurs, leading to the formation of the ring with a specific configuration.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a lactone (a cyclic ester) with a chiral center. When it is reduced, the ring opens to form a diol, which then cyclizes to form the cyclic ketone with a specific configuration.

But again, I'm not entirely sure about the exact mechanism.

Another approach: think about the reaction of LiBH4 and BH3 with esters.

LiBH4 can reduce esters to the corresponding alcohols. For example, RCOOR' + LiBH4 → RCH2OH + R'OH.

But if the starting material is a cyclic ester (like a lactone), then the reduction would break the ring, forming a diol.

Wait, so for a gamma-lactone (five-membered ring), the reduction would produce a 1,4-diol. Then, perhaps under acidic conditions, the diol could undergo cyclization to form a cyclic ketone.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the diol could lose a water molecule to form a ketone. But that doesn't seem straightforward.

Wait, perhaps the diol undergoes an elimination reaction to form an alkene, which then rearranges to form a cyclic ketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the diol can form a cyclic hemiacetal, but that would form an ether, not a ketone.

Hmm, perhaps another approach is needed. Let's think about the possible reaction of a beta-keto ester with LiBH4.

A beta-keto ester has the structure RCO-COOR'. Reduction with LiBH4 would reduce the ketone (the beta-keto part) to an alcohol. So, RCO-COOR' → RCH(OH)-COOR'.

But then, how would that form a cyclic ketone.

Wait, maybe the ester group is then hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid under acidic conditions, but that would break the ester, not form a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the alcohol formed could undergo an elimination reaction to form an alkene, which then forms a ring upon cyclization.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester, and when reduced, the ketone becomes an alcohol, leading to a compound that can cyclize to form the cyclic ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is part of a larger structure that, upon reduction, forms a diol which then cyclizes.

Wait, but I'm going in circles here. Let me think about the options again.

The starting materials are either R or S configurations. So, the reaction with LiBH4 on A produces the R configuration, and BH3 on B produces the S configuration, or vice versa.

Wait, perhaps the reaction involves the stereochemistry of the hydride addition. When a ketone is reduced, the hydride adds to the carbonyl carbon. The configuration of the starting material would influence the approach of the hydride, determining the configuration of the resulting alcohol.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a ketone, so maybe the starting material is an epoxide. Wait, no, that's not making sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, and the reduction breaks it down, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a chiral center. When reduced with LiBH4, the ester is opened to form a diol, which then forms a new ring with a specific configuration.

Assuming that, the configuration of the starting material would dictate the configuration of the diol, which in turn would influence the configuration of the product.

So, perhaps when the starting material is R, the diol forms in such a way that when cyclized, it forms the R configuration in the product. And when the starting material is S, it forms the S configuration.

But I'm not sure about the exact mechanism here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves the reduction of a nitrile to an amine, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a ketone, and the reducing agent leads to the formation of an alcohol which then cyclizes to form the cyclic ketone. But how?

Wait, maybe the starting material is a diethyl ester of a keto acid. When reduced, the ester becomes an alcohol, and the keto group becomes a secondary alcohol, which could then form a cyclic structure.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about which reagent (LiBH4 or BH3) would lead to which configuration.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and is typically used in reductions where steric factors influence the approach of the hydride. BH3, on the other hand, is used in hydroboration reactions, which are anti-Markovnikov and involve the BH3 adding to the less substituted end of the double bond. But again, how does that tie into the product being a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with a ketone substituent. When treated with LiBH4, the ketone is reduced to an alcohol, which then could form a ring. But again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, and the reduction leads to the formation of a diol, which then cyclizes to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, if the starting material is a five-membered cyclic ester (gamma-lactone), then the reduction with LiBH4 would break the ring, producing a 1,4-diol. Then, under acidic conditions, the diol could cyclize by eliminating water to form a five-membered ring with a ketone.

Wait, but the product is a six-membered ring. So perhaps the starting material is a six-membered lactone. When reduced, it forms a 1,5-diol, which then cyclizes to form a six-membered ring with a ketone.

Hmm, perhaps. Let me try to visualize this.

Imagine a six-membered lactone (the ester is part of a six-membered ring). When reduced with LiBH4, the ring opens to form a diol with the hydroxyl groups on positions 1 and 5.

Then, perhaps in acid, the diol undergoes cyclization: the hydroxyl on C1 could attack the carbonyl carbon (which is now an alcohol, but I'm not sure) leading to the formation of a new ring.

Wait, but I'm not exactly certain about the exact steps.

Assuming that the diol forms in such a way that when it cyclizes, the configuration of the starting material determines the configuration of the product.

So, the starting material's configuration (R or S) would influence the diol's configuration, which in turn would influence the product's configuration.

Given that, the correct option would be where starting material A is R and B is S, leading to products R and S respectively, or vice versa.

Looking at the options:

Option D: A is R, B is S.

So, when A is treated with LiBH4, it produces the R product, and when B (S) is treated with BH3, it produces the S product.

Alternatively, perhaps the opposite is true.

Wait, but the reagents could influence the face of attack, leading to different configurations.

Hmm, perhaps the approach of the hydride in LiBH4 reduction would be influenced by the configuration of the starting material, leading to a certain configuration in the product.

Similarly, BH3 may approach from a different face, leading to the opposite configuration.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure about how the reducing agents would affect the stereochemistry.

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. The addition of the hydride occurs from the less hindered side, leading to the formation of the more stable alcohol (anti addition).

But in this case, perhaps the starting material's configuration affects which face is more hindered, influencing the hydride's approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting material determines the way the diol forms, which then affects the configuration of the product.

In any case, considering that the starting materials must be enantiomers (so that their reduction leads to enantiomeric products), the correct option is either C or D.

Between the two, the key is to determine which starting material leads to which configuration when treated with each reducing agent.

Assuming that the product's configuration is determined by the starting material's configuration and the reducing agent's approach, perhaps A (R) with LiBH4 gives R, and B (S) with BH3 gives S.

Looking at the options:

Option D: A is R, B is S.

So, when A (R) is treated with LiBH4, it produces R product.

When B (S) is treated with BH3, it produces S product.

Alternatively, if the reagent affects the configuration, then perhaps the opposite is true.

Wait, but without knowing the exact mechanism, it's hard to be certain. However, the options suggest that the correct answer is either C or D. Given that, and considering that the starting materials must be enantiomers (since their reduction leads to enantiomeric products), the correct option is D: A is R, B is S.


The question involves determining the correct starting materials (A and B) that, when treated with different reducing agents (LiBH4 and BH3), produce the enantiomeric products (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. The starting materials are given as 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, differing in their configurations (R or S).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Nature of the Reactions**:  
   - LiBH4 and BH3 are reducing agents, but they differ in their mechanisms and stereochemical outcomes. LiBH4 typically reduces esters or ketones to alcohols, while BH3 is commonly used in hydroboration reactions, which follow anti-Markovnikov addition and can influence stereochemistry.

2. **Product Formation**:  
   - The product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, is a six-membered cyclic ketone with an ethyl group at position 4. The stereochemistry (R or S) of the product depends on the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent.

3. **Starting Material**:  
   - The starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which has a carboxylic acid group, an ethyl group at position 3, and an isobutoxy group with a ketone at position 5. The stereochemistry at the chiral center (R or S) determines the product configuration after reduction.

4. **Stereochemical Outcome**:  
   - The configuration of the starting material dictates the approach of the reducing agent, influencing the stereochemistry of the product. For example, an (R)-configured starting material treated with LiBH4 may produce the (R)-enantiomeric product, while an (S)-configured starting material treated with BH3 may produce the (S)-enantiomeric product.

5. **Options Analysis**:  
   - **Option A**: Both A and B are (S)-configured. This cannot produce both (R) and (S) products.  
   - **Option B**: Both A and B are (R)-configured. Similarly, this cannot produce both (R) and (S) products.  
   - **Option C**: A is (S)-configured, and B is (R)-configured. This would not align with the stereochemical outcomes of the reactions.  
   - **Option D**: A is (R)-configured, and B is (S)-configured. This is consistent with the stereochemical outcomes, as the (R)-configured starting material with LiBH4 produces the (R)-enantiomeric product, and the (S)-configured starting material with BH3 produces the (S)-enantiomeric product.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting materials are (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid (A) and (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid (B), as they align with the stereochemical outcomes of the reactions when treated with LiBH4 and BH3, respectively.

**Answer: D**
