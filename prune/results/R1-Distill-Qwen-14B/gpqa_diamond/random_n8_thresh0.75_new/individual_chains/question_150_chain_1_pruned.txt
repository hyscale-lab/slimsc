Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me jot down what I know and think through it.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, that's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. The NMR data is provided, so I should start by analyzing that to figure out the structure.

Looking at the 1H-NMR:

- 9.72 ppm: a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a pretty high chemical shift, which probably indicates an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, but aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and don't split much because they're at the end. Oh wait, maybe it's not an aldehyde. Or perhaps it's something else with that region. Alternatively, could it be an aromatic proton in a specific situation? Or maybe an acidic proton like a phenol?

Next, 6.98 ppm: a doublet of 2H. Aromatic protons in a para-substituted ring maybe? Because the doublet suggests each H is next to one other H. Wait, no, in a para-substituted benzene, each proton has only one neighboring H? No, wait, para substitution would create a symmetrical structure where each proton is next to two others. Wait, no. Wait, in a para-disubstituted benzene, each substituent is opposite each other. So the protons adjacent to substituents would have coupling. For example, if you have two substituents at the para positions, the aromatic protons would be at ortho and meta positions. Or maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents? Or maybe it's a substituent like a nitro group or something else that causes the doublet.

Wait, the 6.51 ppm is another doublet of 2H. So two sets of aromatic protons, each as doublets, with 2H each. That suggests that the molecule has two benzene rings, each with substituents that cause their protons to couple in a certain way. So maybe each benzene ring is para-substituted, so the protons next to substituents are in a doublet.

Then, 6.27 ppm: a broad singlet of 2H. That's a bit tricky. Broad usually indicates something like an
