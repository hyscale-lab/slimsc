Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to unpack it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. Alright, let's start by reading the problem carefully.

The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So, first, I think I need to normalize this state because the problem says it's proportional, not necessarily normalized. So I have to find the normalization constant.

Wait, the eigenstates of the z-projection of spin are |up> and |down>, which form an orthonormal basis. So the inner product of |up> with itself is 1, same for |down>, and their cross terms are zero.

So the state |alpha> is a linear combination: (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. But it's proportional, meaning it's not normalized yet. Let me compute the norm (the square of the magnitude) of this vector.

The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2. Because when you have a vector in a two-dimensional space, the squared norm is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of its components.

Calculating each term:

|1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2. Because 1+i has real part 1 and imaginary part 1.

Wait, wait, no, wait. The modulus squared is (Re)^2 + (Im)^2. So (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Right.

Now |2 - i|^2: real part is 2, imaginary part is -1. So (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So total norm squared is 2 +5=7. So the norm is sqrt(7). Therefore, the normalized state would be [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ].

So |alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the next part is about calculating the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation A_ij where A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix because the state is two-dimensional (up and down).

So the matrix would be:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
      [ħ/2, 0] ]

Wait, because if i≠j, then A_ij is ħ/2. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are 0, and the off-diagonal are ħ/2.

But wait, operators are usually Hermitian, so this matrix must be Hermitian. Let me check: the (1,2) and (2,1) elements are both ħ/2, which is real, so yes, it's symmetric, hence Hermitian. So that's correct.

The eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix, I believe. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0 1],[1 0]], but scaled. Wait, the standard Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so our operator A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So the eigenstates of A should be the same as those of X, which are the states |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates for the spin in the x-direction.

Wait, but the question is, when we measure the system in the eigenbasis of A, what are the probabilities? So the state |alpha> is in the z-basis, but to find the probabilities of the eigenstates of A, we need to express |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A, and then find the squared magnitudes.

Alternatively, since the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, perhaps it's easier to compute the overlap between |alpha> and each of these states.

But wait, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x
