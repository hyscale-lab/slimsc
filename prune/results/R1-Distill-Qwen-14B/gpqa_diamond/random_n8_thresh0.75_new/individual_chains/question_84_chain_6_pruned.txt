Okay, so I've got this question about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. The question is asking about the key factor in converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one, specifically regarding the matrix exponential function approximation using a fractional approximation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that when solving partial differential equations numerically, especially heat equations, we often use finite difference methods. These methods discretize the equations into a system of algebraic equations, which can be represented in matrix form. For time-dependent problems, the solution often involves computing matrix exponentials because the time evolution can be expressed using terms like e^(At), where A is the matrix derived from the spatial discretization.

Now, when moving from a sequential to a parallel algorithm, the key is how to split the computation so that different parts can be handled simultaneously. Matrix exponentials can be tricky because they're typically computed in a sequential manner. So, how do we make this parallel?

I recall something about parallel splitting methods, like the method of lines or using splitting techniques where the matrix is decomposed into parts that can be exponentiated separately. But wait, the question mentions a fractional approximation. Fractional here probably refers to methods that approximate the exponential function using a fraction of the terms or a different approach, maybe like Pad√© approximants or something similar.

Wait, another thought: when approximating the matrix exponential, especially for parallel computation, one approach is to use a technique called "matrix exponential splitting." This involves decomposing the matrix A into several submatrices that can be exponentiated independently. Each of these submatrices might represent a part of the original differential equation, such as different directions in a multi-dimensional problem.

But how does this relate to the options given? Let's look at the options:

Option A) Stability analysis: That's important for ensuring the numerical method doesn't blow up, but I don't think it's directly the key factor in converting to a parallel algorithm.

Option B) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions: Nonlocal conditions complicate things, but I'm not sure how that ties into parallelism. Maybe if you have nonlocal conditions, it affects how you split the problem, but I'm not certain.

Option C) Complex roots of fractional approximation: Hmm, fractional approximation methods might involve rational functions where the denominator could have complex roots. If the approximation has complex roots, maybe it affects the stability or the way you split the matrix. Or perhaps it relates to how the matrix is decomposed for parallel processing.

Option D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation: A partial fraction decomposition is a way to break down a rational function into simpler fractions. If the approximation is done using partial fractions, each term could be handled in parallel. So this might involve expressing the exponential as a sum of simpler exponentials, each corresponding to a part of the matrix that can be computed independently.

Wait, I think the key here is how the matrix exponential is approximated. If we use a fractional approximation, like a rational function approximation, then the exponential can be expressed as a sum of terms involving different submatrices. Each submatrix's exponential can be computed in parallel, which would allow the algorithm to be parallelized.

So, perhaps the linear partial fraction decomposition of the fractional approximation is the key. Because if the approximation can be broken down into a sum of terms, each involving a different part of the matrix, then each term can be computed in parallel. That would make the algorithm parallel.

Alternatively, if the fractional approximation's denominator factors into linear terms (like partial fractions), each term could be exponentiated separately, which would be parallelizable.

So, looking at the options, option D says "Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation." That seems to align with this idea. The process of decomposing the approximation into partial fractions allows each component to be handled in parallel.

Another angle: the matrix exponential's computation. For a matrix A, e^A could be
