Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question gives me a compound with a molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. Then, it says that this compound is reacted with a sequence of reagents, and I need to find the final product from the given options.

Alright, let me break this down step by step. First, I'll try to figure out the structure of the starting compound based on the NMR data. Then, I'll think about what each reaction step does to it.

Starting with the molecular formula: C8H9NO. That's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, and 1 oxygen. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let's see the possible functional groups. Nitrogen could be part of an amine, amide, nitro group, etc. Oxygen could be from an alcohol, ketone, aldehyde, ester, or something else.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a triplet, likely an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually appear around 9-10 ppm. So maybe there's an aldehyde group here.

- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet, probably aromatic protons. Maybe part of a benzene ring with substituents.

- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet. Maybe adjacent aromatic protons, like in para-substituted rings.

Wait, the other two signals: 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H) and 3.66 ppm (d, 2H). The broad singlet at 6.27 could be something like an enol proton or maybe some vinylic protons adjacent to an electronegative group. The 3.66 ppm doublet with 2H suggests something like a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom, maybe O. Like an OCH2 group or something similar. But wait, if it's a doublet, maybe it's part of a larger structure, like a cyclic ether or an alkoxy group attached to something else.

Putting this together, perhaps the compound is an aldehyde with two phenyl groups attached. Let's think about the structure. Maybe a butyraldehyde derivative with two phenyl groups attached somewhere.

Wait, the NMR has two doublets in the aromatic region. Like perhaps two para-substituted benzene rings. Like if the molecule has two phenyl groups attached to a central chain. Let me try drawing this. So, maybe the structure is something like diphenylbutanal? Or maybe with substituents.

Wait, the 'd' for doublet in NMR suggests coupling between two protons. So, for example, in a para-substituted benzene, each proton has two adjacent protons (ortho). But wait, para-substituted benzene rings with two substituents would have two doublets, each integrating for two protons. So that fits the 6.98 and 6.51 peaks. That would suggest two phenyl groups, each para-substituted.

So perhaps the molecule is something like 4-phenyl-3-butenal with another substituent? Or maybe it's a diphenyl compound with a conjugated system.

Wait, the aldehyde is in the
