Okay, so I've got this problem about quantum mechanics and uncertainty. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see. The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z. I remember that uncertainty is calculated using the standard deviation formula, which involves the expectation values of the operator and its square.

So first, the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which I think means we're working in the P_z eigenbasis.

Wait, but the state is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So to find the expectation value of P_z, I need to compute ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩. Then, the expectation value of (P_z)^2 is ⟨ψ| P_z^2 |ψ⟩, and from these, I can find ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

Let me write down the state vector ψ. It's a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me denote this as ψ = [a, b, c]^T where a=-1/2, b=1/√2, c=-1/2.

The P_z operator matrix is given as:
[ ħ   0    0
  0   0    0
  0   0  -ħ ]

So, P_z is diagonal. That should make things easier because when you multiply P_z by a vector, you just scale each component by the diagonal elements.

First, compute ⟨P_z⟩.

⟨P_z⟩ = ψ† P_z ψ, where ψ† is the conjugate transpose. Since all elements are real here, ψ† is just [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

Multiplying that by P_z matrix:

Let me think. When I do ψ† multiplied by P_z, each element of the resulting vector is the sum of products. Wait, no, actually, it's a matrix multiplication. Let me think of ψ† as a row vector, and P_z is 3x3.

So ψ† P_z would be a row vector where each element is the dot product of ψ† with each column of P_z.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute each component. Alternatively, since P_z is diagonal, the product P_z ψ is simply scaling each component of ψ by the diagonal elements.

So P_z ψ would be:

First component: ħ * (-1/2) = -ħ/2
Second component: 0 * (1/√2) = 0
Third component: (-ħ) * (-1/2) = ħ/2

So P_z ψ is the column vector [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]^T.

Then, ⟨P_z⟩ = ψ† (P_z ψ) = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ] multiplied by [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ].

Calculating this dot product:

( (-1/2)*(-ħ/2) ) + ( (1/√2)*0 ) + ( (-1/2)*(ħ/2) )

Which is ( ħ/4 ) + 0 + (- ħ/4 ) = 0. Oh, interesting, so ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Hmm, now for ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z squared would be (P_z)^2, which for a diagonal matrix is just the squares of the diagonal elements.

So P_z^2 matrix is:

[ ħ²   0     0
  0    0     0
  0    0   (ħ)^2 ]

So when I compute P_z^2 ψ, it's [ ħ² * (-1/2), 0, ( (-ħ)^2 )*( -1/2 ) ] ?

Wait, no. Wait, P_z^2 is diagonal with entries [ ħ², 0, ħ² ].

So P_z² ψ = [ ħ² * (-1/2), 0 * (1/√2), ħ² * (-1/2) ]^T.

So that's [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ]^T.

Now, ⟨P_z²⟩ is ψ† (P_z² ψ) = [ (-1/2), (1/√2), (-1/2) ] multiplied by [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ].

Calculating each term:

(-1/2) * (-ħ²/2) = (ħ²)/4
(1/√2) * 0 = 0
(-1/2) * (-ħ²/2 ) = (ħ²)/4

Adding them: (ħ²/4) + 0 + (ħ²/4) = ħ²/2.

So now, the variance is ⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2 = (ħ²/2) - 0 = ħ²/2.

So the uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of that: sqrt(ħ²/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which matches.

Wait a minute, let me double-check the calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with the signs or arithmetic.

For ⟨P_z⟩: the components are:

Row ψ†: [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]

P_z ψ: [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]

Dot product: (-1/2)(-ħ/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)( ħ/2 )

Which is (ħ/4) + 0 + (-ħ/4) = 0. Correct.

For ⟨P_z²⟩, the components of P_z² ψ are [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ].

Dot product with ψ†:

(-1/2)(-ħ²/2) = ħ²/4

(1/√2)(0) = 0

(-1/2)(-ħ²/2) = ħ²/4

Total: ħ²/4 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2. Correct.

So variance is ħ²/2, so uncertainty is sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2). So the correct answer is option B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ for the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state vector is given as:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix for $P_z$ is:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To compute $\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi$, we first calculate $P_z \psi$:

\[
P_z \psi = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar}{2} \\ 0 \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, compute the dot product $\psi^\dagger (P_z \psi)$:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Simplify:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{4} + 0 - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix for $P_z^2$ is:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi$, first calculate $P_z^2 \psi$:

\[
P_z^2 \psi = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \\ 0 \\ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, compute the dot product $\psi^\dagger (P_z^2 \psi)$:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\right).
\]

Simplify:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The variance is:

\[
\text{Var}(P_z) = \langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

The uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\text{Var}(P_z)} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to **Option B**.

**Answer: B**
