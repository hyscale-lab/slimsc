Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.

The question is about finding the probabilities of measuring an electron in certain eigenstates and then the average value of an operator. Let me read the problem again.

We have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Oh, right, |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so they form a basis for the spin-1/2 system.

The operator in question has a matrix representation Aij where Aij is hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that means it's a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with two states. So for a spin-1/2 system, the basis is |up> and |down>, so the matrix would be:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, no, wait—because if i and j are different, then Aij is hbar/2. So the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. So yeah, that's correct.

First, I think I need to normalize the given state |alpha>. Because the problem says it's proportional to that combination, meaning it's not necessarily normalized yet.

So |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. To normalize it, I need to compute the inner product <alpha|alpha> and then divide by its square root.

Let me compute that. The inner product is (1 - i)* (because it's the conjugate) times |up> + (2 + i)|down>, multiplied by (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>.

Expanding that, I get:

(1 - i)(1 + i) * <up|up> + (1 - i)(2 - i) <up|down> + (2 + i)(1 + i) <down|up> + (2 + i)(2 - i) <down|down>.

Since <up|down> and <down|up> are zero (they're orthonormal), only the diagonal terms contribute.

So, the first term is (1 - i)(1 + i) = (1^2 +1^2) because (a - b)(a + b) = a² - b², but since i^2 is -1, it's 1 - (i^2)=1-(-1)=2.

Wait, (1 - i)(1 + i) = 1*(1) +1*i - i*1 -i*i = 1 +i -i -i². The i terms cancel: 1 - (-1) = 2. Right.

Similarly, the last term is (2 + i)(2 - i) = 2^2 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) =5.

So the inner product is 2*<up|up> +5*<down|down> =2*1 +5*1=7. So the norm is sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i, 2 -i) / sqrt(7).

So the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the operator A has the matrix given. Wait, but what are the eigenstates of A? Because when we measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes in each eigenstate.

So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A. Let's do that.

The matrix is:
[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

This is a 2x2 matrix. To find eigenvalues, solve det(A - λI)=0.

So determinant of [ -λ      hbar/2 ]
               [ hbar/2  -λ      ] =0.

That's λ² - (hbar/2)^2 =0 → λ² = (hbar^2)/4 → λ= ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are +hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Now, the eigenvectors. For λ = hbar/2:

(A - (hbar/2) I) v =0 → [ -hbar/2   hbar/2 ] [v1]   [0]
                        [ hbar/2   -hbar/2 ] [v2] = [0]

The equations are:

- (hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 =0 → -v1 +v2=0 → v1 =v2.

So the eigenvector is proportional to (1,1). Similarly for λ= -hbar/2, the equations would give v1 = -v2, so eigenvectors proportional to (1, -1).

Wait, let
