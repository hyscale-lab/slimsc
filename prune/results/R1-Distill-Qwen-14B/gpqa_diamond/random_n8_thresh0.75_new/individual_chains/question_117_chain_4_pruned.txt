Okay, I've got this question about organic chemistry and optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism, that's when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? So they can't be rotated or flipped to match each other, leading to different physical properties like the direction they rotate plane-polarized light.

The question asks which of the given moieties show optical isomerism. There are four options, and I need to evaluate each one.

Let me look at each compound one by one.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.
Wait, I think biphenyl compounds can have stereoisomerism if there's a possibility of the substituents being in different positions. But wait, biphenyls can have a single bond between the two benzene rings, which allows rotation. Oh wait, but if there are bulky groups on each ring that can't rotate past each other, like in some cases, they can have different isomers. But for optical isomerism, the molecule must have a chiral center or some form of asymmetry.

In this case, the compound has two nitro groups at 6,6' positions and two carboxylate groups at 2,2'. Carboxylate groups are usually O- so they're not chiral. Are the nitro groups in a position that creates a chiral center? Wait, the biphenyl structure... Let me visualize. The central bond is single, so the substituents on each benzene ring can rotate. But if both substituents on each ring
