Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question here about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair in neural crest cells. The setup involves some vectors and transfection into primary astrocyte cultures. Then they breed mice and look for a green signal under a confocal microscope, but see nothing. The options are about why that happened.

Let's start by understanding the setup. They created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means two genes in one vector, right? So the vector probably contains two open reading frames (ORFs). The ligand's ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. Wait, so the ligand is linked to mCherry? Or is mCherry just another marker? Hmm.

Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. I remember that the CBA promoter is a strong, constitutive promoter, often used for expression in various tissues. So the ligand should be expressed from the CBA promoter.

Wait no, the ligand is at the 5' position, and the ORF is fused to mCherry. So the ligand is probably under the CBA promoter, and then mCherry is maybe a tag or a reporter. But then, there's a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP) between the ligand ORF and mCherry. So, when the stop is in place, the ligand is expressed, but not mCherry? Or the other way around. Wait, no. The stop cassette would prevent expression downstream unless something like Cre is used to excise it.

Wait, the vector has the ligand ORF first, followed by a stop cassette, then mCherry. Oh wait, no. The ligand is 5', then the stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP) is in between the ligand ORF and mCherry. So, when the stop is present, the ligand is expressed, but mCherry isn't because the stop prevents it. But if Cre is used, which would be loxP specific, then Cre would excise the stop cassette, allowing the mCherry to be expressed in the same transcriptional unit as the ligand. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused here.

Then, the receptor ORF is at the
