Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the energy of a particle accelerator called RHIC. The question states that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c, and I need to find the energy. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm, first, I should figure out what nucleus X is. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Oh wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium nucleus has 3 protons. So if it has 3 neutrons, the isotope would be Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons, so it's lithium-6.

So the mass number A is 6. Now, I think the energy calculation will involve the rest mass energy of the nucleus and its kinetic energy when moving at a relativistic speed. Since the speed is given as 0.96c, which is pretty high, relativistic effects are definitely important here.

I remember that the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I'll need to calculate gamma first.

Let me compute gamma. v is 0.96c, so v² is (0.96)^2 c². 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but let me double-check that calculation. 0.96 squared is 0.9216, yes. 1 divided by sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784). The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28. Let me calculate that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.57142857... So yeah, gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy of the nucleus is its rest mass multiplied by c squared. But wait, do I know the rest mass of Li-6? I'm not exactly sure. I think I can look it up or calculate it based on the masses of protons and neutrons.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the atomic mass. The mass of a nucleus can be approximated using the sum of the masses of its nucleons (protons and neutrons) minus the mass lost due to binding energy, but I'm not sure about the exact values.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the rest mass of the nucleus as approximately the same as the sum of the individual nucleons. Or perhaps there's a standard value for the rest mass of Li-6. Hmm. I don't remember the exact mass, but maybe I can find an approximate value.

Wait, the atomic mass of lithium-6
