Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. The question involves diluting the acetic acid first and then titrating it. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. 

Let me try to break this down. The initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. We dilute it with 20 cm³ of water. Wait, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Oh wait, no, actually, wait. When you dilute a solution, you add more solvent. So in this case, the initial volume is 20.00 cm³, and we're adding 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40.00 cm³. 

So the concentration after dilution would be half of the original concentration because the volume doubles. So the original concentration is 0.05 M. Diluting it by adding equal volume makes it 0.025 M. Oh, right, because M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 is (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. 

Next, we're titrating this diluted acetic acid with 0.1 M NaOH. I remember that in a titration, the equivalence point is where the moles of base equal the moles of acid. 

Wait, let's think about the moles. The acetic acid after dilution is 0.025 M in 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So moles of acetic acid = Molarity * Volume (in liters) = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. 

NaOH is a strong base, so it will react completely with the acetic acid. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So at equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added should be equal to the moles of acetic acid. So moles of NaOH = 0.001. 

Since the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed would be moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. But wait, the question isn't directly asking about the volume, but the pH at 25% titration and equivalence point. 

So first, let's tackle the pH at 25% titration. 

25% titration means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So moles of NaOH added at this point would be 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles. 

Wait, wait. Wait, the total volume at 25% titration is the initial solution (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added. Oh, but when you add the NaOH, the total volume changes. Hmm, but perhaps for simplicity, in these problems, sometimes they ignore the volume change unless it's specified. Or maybe they consider it when necessary. 

Wait, the initial solution is 40 cm³. The NaOH is 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence. The equivalence requires 10 cm³ of NaOH, so 25% would be 2.5 cm³. So the total volume at 25% is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³. 

But wait, maybe I should calculate the moles and then find the concentrations. So after adding 0.00025 moles of NaOH, which reacts with 0.00025 moles of acetic acid. 

So the reaction: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So initial moles in solution: 0.001 moles of CH3COOH. After adding 0.00025 moles of NaOH, which is 25% of the equivalence, here's what happens. 

Moles of CH3COOH left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 moles.

So the solution now has both the weak acid and its conjugate base. This is a buffer solution. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. 

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]). 

The pKa is given by the formula: pKa = -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5. 

Let me compute pKa. Let's see, log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is -4.733. So pKa is 4.733. 

Now, the concentrations of A^- and HA. 

The total volume is 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

Concentration of HA (CH3COOH) is 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approximately 0.017647 M.

Concentration of A^- (CH3COO^-) is 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So plugging into Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)

Let me compute 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. So approximately 4.26. 

Looking at the options: option A says 4.26 and 8.52. Option D is 4.57, etc. 

Wait, so for the first part, the pH is about 4.26. 

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate ion. So the solution will consist of Na+ and CH3COO^-.

But wait, since the acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic. 

So first, we need to find the concentration of CH3COO^- at equivalence. 

At equivalence, all 0.001 moles of CH3COOH have been converted to 0.001 moles of CH3COO^-.

The total volume is initial volume of acid + volume of NaOH added. Initial volume was 40 cm³, and at equivalence, we'd added 10 cm³ of NaOH. So total volume is 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

Concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will react with water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. 

So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10. 

Wait, let me compute that: 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10.

The Kb is small, which makes sense because the acetate is a weak base. 

We can set up the expression for Kb: Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced. Let me denote C as the initial concentration of acetate, which is 0.02 M.

So Kb ≈ x^2 / (C - x). Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than C, so C - x ≈ C. So:

x^2 ≈ Kb * C → x^2 = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

Taking square root, x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M. 

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M. 

pOH is -log([OH^-]) → log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pOH ≈ 4.98.

pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02. Hmm, but wait, the options don't have 9.02. 

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. Did I calculate Kb correctly?

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = 4.733. 

Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Wait, but
