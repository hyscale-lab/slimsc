Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis generally involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal catalyst, typically used in ring-closing metathesis or cross metathesis.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let's draw its structure to visualize. 3-methylpent-1-ene would have a double bond between C1 and C2, with a methyl branch on C3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃. Wait, no, wait. Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃? No, wait, pent means five carbons. So pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₃? No, wait, wait. Oh wait, the correct structure for 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-C(CH₂CH3)-. Wait, wait, maybe I should think again.

Wait, pent has five carbons. 3-methylpent-1-ene would be:

Carbon 1: CH₂=
Carbon 2: CH-
Carbon 3: C(CH3)-
So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Let me number: 1 2 3 4 5.

So pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3? No, wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3? No, wait, no, wait. Wait, pentene has five carbons, 1-ene implies double bond between C1 and C2. So structure is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH3. But wait, 3-methyl would be a methyl group on C3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH2. Wait, but wait, the chain is five carbons. Let me count again:

1: CH₂=
2: CH-
3: C(CH3)-
4: CH2
