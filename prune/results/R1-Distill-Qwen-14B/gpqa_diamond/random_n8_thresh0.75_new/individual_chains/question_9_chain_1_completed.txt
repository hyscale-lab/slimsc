Alright, so I've got this question about molecular symmetry, specifically about which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that symmetry in molecules is important for understanding their structure and properties. C3h symmetry... wait, what does that mean? Oh right, the C3h point group. From what I recall, C3h has a threefold rotation axis (C3) and a mirror plane (σ) that's perpendicular to the C3 axis. So the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and have that mirror plane.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.
Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.
Option C: triisopropyl borate.
Option D: quinuclidine.

Let me think about each structure.

Triphenyleno[...]trifuran... that probably has three benzene rings attached in some way. Wait, the way the substituents are attached might influence the symmetry. If it's symmetric around the central tricyclic structure, maybe it has higher symmetry.

Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, a [3.3.1]bicyclo structure. I remember quinuclidine has a threefold axis of rotation. Because it's a bridged tricyclic compound, perhaps it has C3 symmetry. But does it have the mirror plane needed for C3h? Hmm.

Triisopropyl borate. The structure is a borate with three isopropyl groups. Isopropyl groups are symmetric themselves, arranged around the central boron. So the molecule is probably trigonal planar around the boron. Wait, but trigonal planar is D3h symmetry, which is higher than C3h. Or wait, no, D3h includes a C3 axis and three mirror planes. But I'm not sure if triisopropyl borate has that. Maybe it's just C3 because of the threefold rotation. But I'm not certain.

Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran... that's a structure with three benzene rings attached to a central furan ring? Or maybe it's a tricyclic system with benzene rings fused in a certain way. The way the substituents are arranged might affect the symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the key is looking for a structure that has a threefold rotation axis and a mirror plane perpendicular to it. Quinuclidine's structure is like a cage. It has a threefold axis, but I'm not sure about the mirror plane. Alternatively, triisopropyl borate has three identical isopropyl groups around the central boron. So the molecule is symmetric with a C3 axis. But for C3h symmetry, there needs to be a mirror plane. If the molecule is planar and has such a plane, then yes. But triisopropyl borate is planar around the boron, but each isopropyl group is not planar. Wait, no, the molecule itself would have a plane of symmetry. Let me visualize: each isopropyl is like CH(CH3)2. So, if you have three such groups around B, the molecule has a trigonal planar arrangement. So the symmetry would be D3h, because it has C3, three mirror planes, and maybe a horizontal mirror. Or wait, maybe it's just C3. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Another approach: think of common structures. I know that triphenylborate (like triphenylboron) has D3h symmetry because it's planar and has three identical substituents symmetrically placed. But triisopropyl borate—each substituent is an isopropyl group. Are they arranged in a trigonal planar fashion? If the borate ion is trigonal planar with all three substituents the same, then yes, it should have D3h symmetry. But the question is about C3h, which is a lower symmetry.

Wait, what's the difference between C3h and D3h? D3h has more symmetry elements: it includes a C3 axis, three C2 axes, and three mirror planes. C3h has a C3 axis and a single mirror plane perpendicular to it. So, D3h includes C3h but has additional planes.

So if a molecule has D3h, it also has C3h symmetry. But if the molecule only has a C3 axis and one mirror plane, it's C3h.

Wait, triisopropyl borate—does it have a mirror plane? Let me imagine the structure. The boron is in the center, with three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl is a CH2 group attached to another CH2 group? No, wait, isopropyl is CH(CH3)2. So, around the central B, each isopropyl is the same. So, the molecule would have a threefold axis (C3) and a mirror plane through the B and each isopropyl. So that's three mirror planes. So it would have D3h symmetry, not just C3h.

Wait, so if that's the case, triisopropyl borate has higher symmetry than C3h. So maybe that's not the answer.

Then, what about quinuclidine? Quinuclidine is a bicyclic structure with a bridge. It has a three-membered ring attached to two other rings. The molecule has a threefold axis of rotation where you can rotate 120 degrees and it looks the same. But does it have a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis?

Quinuclidine's structure, if I'm not mistaken, has a threefold axis through the bridge. Let me visualize: it's a [3.3.1]bicyclo structure, so when you look down the threefold axis, the molecule should look symmetric. But does it have a mirror plane? If the molecule is symmetric along a plane that's perpendicular to the threefold axis, then yes. So, perhaps quinuclidine has C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. That's a more complex structure. The benzo rings are connected in a way that might give a threefold axis. Wait, the substituents are in a way that each 'c' is connected to the next, perhaps creating a tricyclic system. If the molecule has three identical substituents arranged symmetrically around a central point, then it would have C3 symmetry. If there's also a mirror plane, then C3h.

Wait, but in benzo systems, sometimes the symmetry is lower because the substituents might not be arranged in a way that allows for a threefold axis and a mirror plane.

Alternatively, the triphenyleno[...]trifuran might have three phenyl groups attached in a symmetric fashion around the central furan. If each phenyl is in the same position relative to the central ring, then the overall molecule could have a threefold axis and a mirror plane.

Wait, perhaps the triphenyleno structure has three benzene rings attached to the central trifuran. If each benzene is in the same position, the molecule would be symmetric with a C3 axis. And if there's a mirror plane, then C3h.

So, I'm a bit stuck. Let's think about each option:

Option D: quinuclidine. If it has a threefold axis and a mirror plane, then yes. I think quinuclidine's structure allows for both a C3 axis and a mirror plane. So maybe it has C3h symmetry.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. I thought it might have D3h, but the question is about C3h. So if it has higher symmetry, then it's not the correct answer.

Option B: benzo ... I'm not sure. The hexaone suggests six ketone groups? Or maybe it's a structure with multiple rings and ketones. The substituents might be arranged symmetrically.

Option A: triphenyleno... maybe it's similar to option B, but with more substituents. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran... has three benzene rings attached in a symmetric way. Each benzene is connected at specific positions, which could lead to a threefold axis. If the molecule also has a mirror plane, then C3h.

But how to decide between the options?

Another thought: Which of these molecules is known for having a threefold axis and a mirror plane?

Quinuclidine is a well-known molecule with a threefold axis. Its structure is such that rotating 120 degrees brings the molecule back to itself. But does it have a mirror plane perpendicular to the C3 axis? I think yes. So that would make it C3h.

Alternatively, the triphenyleno... structure might have three benzene rings in a three-dimensional arrangement. For example, arranged so that each is in a symmetric position around the central part, leading to a threefold axis and a mirror plane.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact structure of each option. Without the actual structures, it's a bit challenging.

Wait, perhaps the key is to look for the presence of a threefold axis and a mirror plane. Triphenyleno... sounds like it's a tricyclic system with three benzene rings, perhaps in a three-dimensional arrangement that allows for a C3 axis and a mirror plane.

Alternatively, quinuclidine is a bicyclic system with a bridge, which may have a threefold axis but no mirror plane. Hmm, no, I think quinuclidine does have a mirror plane.

Wait, perhaps quinuclidine's structure is such that it's symmetric across a plane perpendicular to the threefold axis. So, when you look along the C3 axis, the molecule is symmetric, and there's a plane that reflects one part to another, leading to C3h symmetry.

If that's the case, then option D (quinuclidine) would have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, another approach is to think about the common examples. For instance, I know that the molecule adamantane has Td symmetry, which is higher. Triisopropyl borate, as I thought earlier, might have D3h. So perhaps the right answer is option A or B.

Wait, let me think about the options again.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

The benzo rings are fused to the trifuran. The numbering suggests that each benzene is attached in a way that may create a tricyclic system. If each benzene is in a symmetric position, it might have a threefold axis and a mirror plane.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is planar with a central threefold axis, making it have C3h symmetry. But without knowing the exact structure, it's tricky.

Another thought: C3h symmetry requires that the molecule has a threefold rotation and a mirror plane. So, the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also be superimposable on its mirror image.

Quinuclidine's structure: it's a bridged bicyclic compound. Rotating 120 degrees around the threefold axis would map the molecule onto itself. If there's a mirror plane that goes through the bridge and the opposite side, then the molecule would have C3h symmetry.

But wait, does quinuclidine have a plane of symmetry? Let me think. The molecule's structure is such that it has a plane that bisects the bridge and reflects two of the rings onto each other. So yes, there's a mirror plane, leading to C3h symmetry.

So, if option D is quinuclidine, it would have C3h symmetry.

Other options:

Triisopropyl borate (option C) is a trigonal planar molecule, which would have D3h symmetry. So it's higher than C3h. Therefore, it's not the correct answer.

Option B, benzo[...]trifuran... I'm not sure, but if the substituents are arranged in a trigonal symmetric fashion, it would have C3h. However, the presence of ketones (hexaone) might break the symmetry, depending on where they're located.

Option A, triphenyleno...trifuran... perhaps similar to option B but with more substituents. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, it could have a threefold axis and a mirror plane.

Wait, but without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to tell. I think I should focus on the options I'm more familiar with.

So, quinuclidine, option D, is a molecule I remember has a threefold axis. But does it have a mirror plane? I think it does. So D could be the correct answer.

Alternatively, the triphenyleno[...]trifuran (option A) may have three phenyl groups arranged symmetrically, which would give a threefold axis. Plus, if it's planar, it could have a mirror plane.

Wait, but the triphenyleno structure is more complex, perhaps tridimethylamine or something. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: the number of symmetry elements. C3h has a threefold rotation and one mirror plane. D3h has three mirror planes, etc.

If a molecule has three identical groups arranged around a central point, it's likely to have higher symmetry. Triphenyleno... sounds like three phenyl groups attached symmetrically. So that would give D3h symmetry, which includes C3h. But the question is about which has C3h symmetry. So it could have C3h as part of a higher symmetry.

But wait, the question is which molecule has C3h symmetry, not higher than that.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A or B.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of another way.

Which of these molecules is known for having a threefold axis and a mirror plane?

I remember that triphenylene has C3h symmetry. Triphenylene is a tricyclic aromatic compound with three benzene rings fused together. Its structure has a threefold axis and a mirror plane. So if option A is triphenyleno, perhaps it's similar.

Looking at the names:

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

So perhaps it's a triphenylene core with a trifuran attached. If the triphenylene part is symmetric, then the overall molecule would have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but the substituents might affect the symmetry. The hexaone suggests multiple ketone groups. If those are arranged symmetrically, perhaps the molecule retains its symmetry.

Alternatively, if the ketones are in positions that break the mirror plane, then the symmetry would be lower.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging. However, given the options, I think quinuclidine (option D) is a strong candidate because it's known to have a threefold axis and a mirror plane, making it C3h.

Wait, another thought: quinuclidine's mirror plane. Let me try to picture it. The molecule has a bridge, and if you imagine a plane cutting through the bridge and reflecting one side to the other, that would be a mirror plane. So yes, it would have that.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is D) quinuclidine.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry properties. **C₃h** symmetry requires a molecule to have a threefold rotation axis (C₃) and a single mirror plane (σ) perpendicular to the C₃ axis. The analysis of each option is as follows:

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
This molecule likely has a tricyclic structure with three benzene rings attached to a central furan system. If the benzene rings are symmetrically arranged around the central core, the molecule could have a threefold rotation axis (C₃). However, the presence of multiple ketone groups (hexaone) might disrupt the symmetry, especially if they are not equally spaced or oriented. Without explicit structural details, it is unclear if this molecule retains **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
This molecule has a similar tricyclic structure to Option A but with a different arrangement of substituents. The benzo rings are fused in a way that could potentially create a threefold rotation axis (C₃). However, the ketone groups (hexaone) might again disrupt the symmetry, depending on their positions. This makes it uncertain whether this molecule has **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option C: Triisopropyl borate
Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar structure with three identical isopropyl groups arranged symmetrically around a central boron atom. This arrangement gives the molecule **D₃h** symmetry, which includes a threefold rotation axis (C₃) and three mirror planes. However, **D₃h** is a higher symmetry than **C₃h**, meaning this molecule does not have **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option D: Quinuclidine
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a [3.3.1]bicyclo structure. It has a threefold rotation axis (C₃) passing through the bridge of the molecule. Additionally, there is a mirror plane perpendicular to the C₃ axis that reflects one part of the molecule onto the other. This combination of a threefold rotation axis and a mirror plane satisfies the requirements for **C₃h** symmetry. Therefore, quinuclidine has **C₃h** symmetry.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the molecule that exhibits **C₃h** symmetry is **quinuclidine**.

Answer: D
