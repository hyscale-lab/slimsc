Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and try to break it down.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember that Limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene, which is a type of terpene. It's found in citrus peels, like oranges and lemons. The (R) configuration indicates that it's the enantiomer with a specific spatial arrangement in its structure.

The first reaction is with Pd/C under hydrogen. That setup sounds like a hydrogenation reaction, which typically adds hydrogen across double bonds. Since Limonene has double bonds, this is probably hydrogenating it. But wait, how many double bonds does Limonene have? I think Limonene is a bicyclic compound with one double bond. Let me visualize it: the structure of limonene is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene, specifically a cyclic monoterpene with a specific double bond.

So when hydrogen is added, Pd/C as a catalyst would hydrogenate the double bond, reducing it. But wait, how many equivalents of hydrogen are used? The question says 1 equivalent is consumed. So that suggests that only one double bond is hydrogenated. Oh wait, limonene has only one double bond, so it gets hydrogenated once. So product 1 would be the hydrogenated version, which would be a cyclohexane derivative. Wait, no: limonene is a bicyclic structure. Let me think about the structure again. Limonene is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene structure. So when hydrogenated, the double bond would become a single bond, converting the bicyclic structure into a single ring with more substituents.

Wait, perhaps I should draw this out mentally. The starting material is (R)-Limonene, which is a bicyclic monoterpene. The double bond is between C2 and C3 in the bicyclo system. Hydrogenation would add H2 across that double bond, opening the ring? Or making a single bond but keeping the bicyclic structure? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, no. Bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene has a bridge structure, with the double bond in the bridge. When hydrogenated, the double bond would become single, but the bridge structure remains. So product 1 would be bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, which is a saturated bicyclic compound.

Wait, no, but that's a seven-membered ring. Oh wait, no. Wait, limonene is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, meaning it's a fused ring structure with two bridges, I think. When you hydrogenate it, you add H2 across the double bond, making a single bond, so the structure becomes bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, which is a norbornane structure. But wait, maybe I'm mixing up the structures. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation leads to a ring-opening if the bridge is under strain, but I think in this case, it's a hydrogenation without ring-opening.

So product 1 is the hydrogenated limonene, which is norbornane. Wait, but norborn
