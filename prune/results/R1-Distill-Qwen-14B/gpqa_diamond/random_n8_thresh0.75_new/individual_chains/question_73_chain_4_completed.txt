Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical mechanics because the effects of relativity come into play. Let me think about how to approach this.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The first part is about their relative speed, and the second part is about the total energy.

Starting with the relative speed. I think in relativity, you can't just subtract the speeds like you'd do in classical mechanics. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different. The formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, no, wait. Wait, because both are moving in the same direction. Let me make sure I get the formula right. So, if two objects are moving in the same direction, the relative speed of one with respect to the other is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c^2)). So I need to plug in v1 =0.6c and v2=0.5c.

Calculating the numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²). Let's compute that. 0.6*0.5 is 0.3, and c*c is c², so 0.3 c² / c² is 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel is (0.1c)/0.7 = approximately 0.142857c, which is roughly 0.14c when rounded. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.

Now the second part is the total energy of the system. Wait, the total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, each astronaut's mass is different, so I need to compute each energy separately and then add them.

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Let's compute gamma for him. v = 0.6c, so v²/c² = 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. v²/c² is 0.25. 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is around 0.8660, so gamma is 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.4641 mc².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.4641 ≈ 5.9641 mc². So the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². Looking back at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc² and the relative speed 0.14c. So option C seems correct. 

Wait, let me double-check the calculations for any possible mistakes. For the first astronaut: gamma is 1.25, correct. E1 is 2.5 mc². Second: 0.5c, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 -0.25)=1/sqrt(0.75)= approximately 1.1547. So E2 = 3 * 1.1547 = 3.4641. Sum is 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641, which rounds to 5.96. So yes, option C.

Wait, but option D says E=5 mc², which is less than what I calculated. So C must be the correct answer. Then the relative speed is 0.14c. So the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed of two objects moving in the same direction is given by the relativistic formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

1. **Numerator**: \(v_1 - v_2 = 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c\)
2. **Denominator**: \(1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7\)

Thus, the relative speed is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1429c \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### First Astronaut
- Mass: \(2m\), Speed: \(0.6c\)
- \(\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25\)
- Energy: \(E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2\)

#### Second Astronaut
- Mass: \(3m\), Speed: \(0.5c\)
- \(\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547\)
- Energy: \(E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.4641mc^2\)

#### Total Energy
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.4641mc^2 \approx 5.9641mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
