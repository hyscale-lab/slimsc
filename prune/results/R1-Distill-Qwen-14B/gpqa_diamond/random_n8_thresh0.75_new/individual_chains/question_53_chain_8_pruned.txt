Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's take it step by step.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, the core is a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group, which means there's an -O-CO-O- or more likely an -O-CO-R group somewhere. Esters usually show strong absorption around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹. I think that's the carbonyl stretch. So, the compound has an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: six signals total. Let me break them down.

Two signals for aromatic-H. Wait, di-substituted benzene could have different substitution patterns. If the substituents are in para positions, the aromatic protons would split into two sets. For example, two equivalent H in the ortho positions and two in the meta. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in such a way that the ring isn't symmetric, giving more signals. But here, it's two signals. So perhaps it's a para-substituted ring? Let me think about that. A para-substituted benzene would have two sets of equivalent H. For example, two H ortho to substituents and two H meta, but wait, no, that wouldn't be equivalent. Wait, maybe the substituents are ortho to each other, leading to more splitting? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the number of aromatic protons. For a di-substituted benzene, the number of aromatic protons could vary. If it's para, then the substituents are opposite each other, leaving four H on the ring. They would split into two doublets if the substituents are strong de-shielders. So, two aromatic signals.

Then, two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically adjacent to double bonds, like in an ester group. Esters usually have a carbonyl and an adjacent oxygen, but wait, in an ester group, there's the R-O-CO-O-R structure. Wait, no, an ester is R-O-CO-R'. Oh, wait, perhaps the substituents on the benzene include an ester group. So maybe the ring has an ester substituent, like a COO-R group attached. Then, the ester's structure would have a vinyl group perhaps. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached. 

Wait, the NMR has two vinyl H signals. Vinyl Hs are those attached to double bonds, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester or something. So, maybe the substituent is an ester group that's part of a vinyl group, like an allyl ester or something else.

The other two signals are for –CH3 groups. Each as singlets? Or maybe split. The fact that there are two signals for –CH3 suggests two different types of methyl groups. So, perhaps one is attached to an oxygen, like an OCH3, but wait, that's a methoxy group. But in the IR, an ester is present. So the other substituent could be an ester group, like
