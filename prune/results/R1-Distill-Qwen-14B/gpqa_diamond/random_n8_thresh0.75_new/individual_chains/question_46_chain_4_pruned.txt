Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I need to figure out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. Let me think...

Alright, first, what's Grubbs catalyst used for? Oh right, it's a transition metal catalyst used for alkene metathesis reactions. That means it can break and reform double bonds. I remember that Grubbs is good for olefin metathesis, like breaking rings or forming new alkenes by swapping ends.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. So the molecule has a double bond at position 1-2, and a methyl group on carbon 3. Let me draw the structure. So the molecule is CH₂=CH-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a methyl substituent on the third carbon. So it's CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? Wait, no, wait, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)? No, wait, wait, let's count the carbons. 3-methylpent-1-ene: The pent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. The 3-methyl would be a methyl group on the third carbon of the pentene. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2. Wait, wait, wait, maybe I should think of it as the double bond between C1 and C2, and a methyl group on C3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's 3-methylpent-1-ene. Yes, okay.

Since it's racemic, each enantiomer is present. But in metathesis reactions, I'm not sure if the stereochemistry affects the outcome much. Because Grubbs catalyst is a neutral catalyst, maybe the racemic part doesn't matter in terms of the products—maybe it just affects the starting material's structure.

Now, Grubbs catalyst will cause a ring-closing metathesis if there are appropriate dienes, but wait, in this case, the molecule is a monoene. So maybe it's an internal metathesis, but wait, what can happen? Alternatively, perhaps it's a cross
