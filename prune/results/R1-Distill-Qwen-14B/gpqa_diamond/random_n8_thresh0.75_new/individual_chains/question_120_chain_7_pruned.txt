Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is a measure of how far away a star is. The closer the star, the larger its parallax. Oh right, the formula for distance in parsecs is 1 divided by the parallax (d = 1/plx). So, a star with a parallax of 1 arcsecond is 1 parsec away, and one with 0.5 arcseconds is 2 parsecs away. Got it.

The question says the stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Wait, uniform distribution usually means that the number per unit volume is constant. But in this case, we're looking at how it changes with parallax, not distance. So I need to think about the relationship between parallax and the number of stars in a given range.

Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (d). So as plx increases (meaning the star is closer), the distance is smaller. But I think the question is about the number of stars per unit of plx, like how many stars you'd find in each small range of plx values.

Wait, in a uniform distribution, the number density of stars is the same in all regions. But if we're looking at how the number of stars in a certain plx range depends on plx, we have to consider the volume involved. Because when you're looking at a higher parallax (closer stars), the volume around us in that parallax range is smaller. Or wait, noâ€”since parallax decreases with distance, higher parallax means closer stars, so the volume (like a shell) at a certain parallax would be a specific range in distance.

Wait, wait, parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance. So a small change in parallax corresponds to a larger change in distance. For example, from plx=1 to plx=2, the distance changes from 1pc to 0.5pc. So the volume between plx and plx+dplx would be a spherical shell with inner radius r = 1/(plx + dplx) and outer radius R = 1/plx. Hmm, but maybe it's easier to think in terms of the volume as a function of distance.

Wait, let's model this. The number of stars per unit volume is constant, say n. So the number of stars in a volume
