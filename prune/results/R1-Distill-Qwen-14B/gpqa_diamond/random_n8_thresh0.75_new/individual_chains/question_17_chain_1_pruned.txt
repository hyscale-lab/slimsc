Okay, I have this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me see. So the question is asking for the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25 degrees Celsius. They also give the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10.

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The Ca-EDTA complex is probably CaY^2-, where Y^4- is the EDTA^4- ion. So the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

The formation constant, Kf, is given as 5e10. Oh wait, sometimes formation constants are expressed as Kf, the formation constant, which is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Right?

But wait, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, I think the concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M. Since the complex is formed, the free calcium ions and free EDTA ions would be in solution, but in very low concentrations because Kf is large (so the complex is stable).

So the problem is to find the concentration of Ca²+ ions in solution. Let me think about how to approach this.

The formation constant equation is Kf = [CaEDTA²-]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

But wait, EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, and in solution, it exists in different protonated forms. However, the problem says the pH is ideal, which I think means that EDTA is in its Y^4- form, so we don't have to worry about the alpha fraction or anything like that. So [EDTA^4-] is just the concentration of free EDTA in solution.

Let me denote the concentrations:

Let’s let s be the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate from the complex. So then, the complex concentration is 0.02 M. When the complex dissociates, for each mole that dissociates, we get 1 mole of Ca²+ and 1 mole of EDTA^4-.

But wait, the initial situation is that all the Ca is in the complex, right? So when the complex dissociates a
