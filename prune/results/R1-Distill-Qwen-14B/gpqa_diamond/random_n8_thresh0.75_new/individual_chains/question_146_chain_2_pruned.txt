Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still trying to wrap my head around these reactions. Let's see what the question is.

The question says: 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene is reacted with maleic anhydride. What's the major product? The options are A, B, C, D, all with different structures and stereochemistry.

Hmm. I remember that maleic anhydride is a dienophile. So this must be a Diels-Alder reaction. Right, the Diels-Alder is a [4+2] cycloaddition between a diene and a dienophile, forming a six-membered ring with two new sigma bonds.

Wait, but what's the diene here? The compound given is 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene. So that's a cyclopentadiene with a fluorine at position 5. Wait, cyclopentadiene is a conjugated diene. Let me draw that structure.

Cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with two double bonds? No, wait, no. Wait, 1,3-diene in a five-membered ring. So positions 1 and 2 are double bond, and positions 3 and 4 are single, then 4 and 5 are double? Or maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, it's a cyclopentene with two double bonds, but that doesn't make sense because cyclopentene would have one double bond. Oh wait, no: 1,3-d
