Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me see what the question says. 

Alright, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So that's like a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows ester groups, so there's an ester functional group present. Ester groups typically have a carbonyl (C=O) which absorbs around 1700-1750 cm^-1. So that's one clue.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six signals. Let's break them down:

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. So the substituents on the benzene ring must be such that there are two different types of aromatic protons. Wait, but it's a di-substituted benzene. Di-substituted benzene rings can have different substitution patterns. For example, ortho, meta, or para. Each substitution pattern leads to a different number of signals in the aromatic region.

Wait, in di-substituted benzene, if the substituents are identical and in the para position, the ring has two equivalent protons on each adjacent carbon, leading to usually two signals (maybe a doublet and a triplet or something else). Alternatively, if substituents are in the ortho positions, maybe symmetry leads to two signals? Hmm, not sure. Or maybe it's a case where the substituents cause different environments for the aromatic protons.

Wait, but the aromatic signals are two. So perhaps there are two distinct sets of aromatic protons. For example, maybe the substituents are in para positions, and each substituent is causing two equivalent protons each. Or maybe the substituents are in meta positions, but that would lead to more signals, I think. Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, but the aromatic ring is di-substituted, so let's think about possible structures. The ester group is attached to the benzene ring. So maybe the benzene has two substituents: one is an ester group (like OCOOR), and another substituent, maybe another group like a methyl ester or something else.

Wait, but let's look at all the NMR signals. The NMR shows two aromatic signals, two vinyl signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets), and two methyl groups. And no signals for CH2 groups. So the molecule must have CH3 groups but no CH2.

Hmm. So the structure probably includes an ester group and another group that has vinyl protons and methyl groups.

Wait, vinyl protons are typically in doublets or something else, depending on neighboring protons. So maybe there's a vinyl group, like CH2=CH2, but wait, that would have CH2 groups. But the problem says no CH2 signals, so perhaps it's a CH2=CH- group attached to something else. Or maybe a substituted vinyl group where the CH2 groups are not present. Hmm, maybe a propenyl group, like CH2=CH-CH3? But that would have CH2 groups. Alternatively, perhaps a group where the vinyl protons are on a substituent that's attached to oxygen, like an ester.

Wait, let me think about the structure. The FTIR shows ester group, so likely O-CO-O. So perhaps the benzene has an est
