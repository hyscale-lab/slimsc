Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about. 

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has a volume of 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1 gram each of KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The molecular weights are given, along with some Ka values for H₃PO₄. 

Wait, orthophosphate ions... I think orthophosphate is HPO₄^3- or maybe PO₄^3-? Hmm, let me recall. Oh right, H3PO4 can dissociate in steps. The first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1), the second is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2), and the third is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3). So orthophosphate would be PO4^3-, but wait, the problem says "orthophosphate ions". Wait, sometimes people refer to HPO4^2- as orthophosphate. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think. Oh wait, HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4^-, and PO4^3- is the conjugate base of HPO4^2-. So maybe the question refers to HPO4^2- as orthophosphate. Or perhaps it's PO4^3-? I think I need to clarify this.

Wait, maybe the term orthophosphate refers to the HPO4^2- ion. Because ortho usually refers to the next step. Like in the nomenclature, phosphoric acid H3PO4, when losing one H+ becomes H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), losing another becomes HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate, or orthophosphate), and then PO4^3- (phosphate). So I think orthophosphate is HPO4^2-.

So the question is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- ions in the solution.

The solution contains KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO4·2H2O. So both are phosphate salts, but in different forms. 

I think the first thing I should do is calculate the moles of each salt in the solution. Then, figure out the concentrations of each species, and how they affect the pH. Because the phosphate species will depend on the pH of the solution.

So let's get started. 

First, calculate moles of each substance.

KH2PO4 has a molecular weight (MW) of 136.09 g/mol. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = let's see, 1 divided by approximately 136.1 is about 0.00735 moles. Let me calculate it more accurately.

1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007348 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O has a MW of 177.99 g/mol. So 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol is approximately 0.005614 mol.

So moles of KH2PO4 is approximately 0.007348 mol, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 0.005614 mol.

Next, let's consider the dissociation of these salts in solution.

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-: 
KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4^-

So each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (since it's Na2HPO4, which is Na+ and HPO4^2-): 
Na2HPO4 → 2 Na+ + HPO4^2-.

So each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So in the solution, we have H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 and HPO4^2- from the Na2HPO4. 

Now, the solution is a buffer solution because it contains a weak acid and its conjugate base. Wait, H2PO4^- can act as an acid (donating a proton to become HPO4^2-) or as a base (accepting a proton to become H3PO4). But in the presence of HPO4^2-, which is its conjugate base, the solution is a buffer. So this is a buffer solution involving H2PO4^- (acid) and HPO4^2- (base). 

The pH of
