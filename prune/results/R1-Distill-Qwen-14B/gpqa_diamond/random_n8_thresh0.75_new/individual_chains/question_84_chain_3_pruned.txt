Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about solving higher dimensional heat equations using finite difference approximations and parallel splitting. Hmm, the question is about the key factor in converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one, using matrix exponential functions approximated by a fractional approximation. 

Let me try to break this down. I remember that when solving PDEs like the heat equation, especially in higher dimensions, the approach often involves discretizing the equation using methods like finite differences. This leads to a system of linear equations that can be represented in matrix form. Solving such systems efficiently is crucial, especially for large problems.

The question mentions parallel splitting. I think parallel algorithms often involve breaking down the problem into smaller parts that can be solved simultaneously. For matrix operations, this might relate to how the matrix is decomposed or the method used to compute the matrix exponential, which is part of the solution process.

Matrix exponential functions are used in methods like the exponential time integration. For example, the solution to the heat equation can be expressed using the matrix exponential of the discrete Laplacian operator. But computing this directly can be computationally expensive, especially for large systems. So, approximations are used, such as Krylov subspace methods or other techniques.

Now, the question is about converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one, so I'm thinking about how matrix operations can be parallelized. One approach is to use splitting techniques, like the splitting of the matrix into submatrices that can be processed in parallel. But how does this relate to the options given?

The options are:

A) Stability analysis
B) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions
C) Complex roots of fractional approximation
D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation

Stability analysis (A) is about ensuring that numerical methods don't produce growing errors, but it's more about the correctness and accuracy of the method rather than the parallelization aspect. So maybe not the key factor here.

Nonlocal boundary conditions (B) are a type of boundary condition where the value at a point depends on values at other points, which can complicate the solution process. But I'm not sure how this directly ties into parallel processing. It might affect the setup but not the parallel conversion's key factor.

Options C and D are about the fractional approximation. The matrix exponential is approximated using a fractional approximation, perhaps a rational approximation or Pad√© approximant. The roots of such approximations could influence the stability or the convergence of the method. But how does this relate to parallel algorithms?

Wait, when you approximate the matrix exponential, the method's structure can affect whether it can be broken down into parts that run in parallel. For example, if the approximation can be expressed as a sum of terms that can be computed independently, that's a plus for parallelism. Also, the roots of the approximation (C) might determine how the matrix is split. Or maybe it's about the partial fraction decomposition (D), which could allow the matrix to be split into simpler components that can be processed in parallel.

Wait, linear partial fraction decomposition of the approximation. If the approximation can be broken down into a sum of simpler fractions, each corresponding to a different part of the matrix, then each part can be handled in parallel. So option D might be the key factor. Because if the approximation allows for such a decomposition, the algorithm can be split into parallel tasks.

Alternatively, complex roots might affect the stability or the convergence rate but not directly enable parallel processing. So perhaps C isn't the right choice.

Another angle: when you have a matrix exponential e^{At}, and you approximate it using a rational function, say p(A), where p is a polynomial or rational function. If p(A) can be expressed as a sum of terms that can be computed in parallel, that would allow the algorithm to be parallelized. Partial fractions might represent such a decomposition.

Wait, in the context of matrix functions, partial fraction decomposition refers to expressing the function as a sum of simpler fractions, each involving a specific
