Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in that structure. 

Heating it with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so maybe an elimination reaction? Dehydrohalogenation perhaps. When vicinal dihalides (like 1,3-dibromo in adamantane) are treated with a strong base, they undergo elimination to form alkenes. Since there are two bromine atoms, it's likely to form an alkene via an E2 mechanism.

So product 1 would be an adamantyl compound with a double bond. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. Wait, that's around the region for carbonyl groups (like ketones or esters). But wait, elimination of HBr would form an alkene, which doesn't have a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Wait, KOH could also cause a substitution if it's an SN2, but with two leaving groups, maybe elimination is more likely. Wait, maybe the product is a diol, but that would come from hydrolysis, but KOH is more about elimination in such structures. Or perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination, but that usually involves amines.

Wait, another thought. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps it's a double elimination, forming a double bond. So the product would be 1,3-diamantadiene or something similar. But wait, the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's more like a carbonyl, not a double bond. Oh, wait! Maybe it's an epoxide? No, epoxide formation usually requires an acid catalyst. Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a ketone, but how?

Wait, another approach. The NMR of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Let's break that down. 

The 4.79 ppm (2H) is probably two protons adjacent to something electronegative. Maybe an OCH2 group? Or maybe part of an ethylene group, but that's less likely. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide's protons, but those are usually around 3.5-4.5, maybe. Or perhaps an -OCH2CH2O- group in a diether. Alternatively, maybe the product has a carbonyl group and some adjacent protons.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. But wait, if you eliminate two HBr molecules, you could form a double bond. But that doesn't explain the carbonyl peak. Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide, but I'm not sure. Wait, another idea: maybe the KOH is causing a substitution, but where?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think about the structure. Adamantane has a cage structure. The 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine on adjacent bridgehead carbons. When treated with a strong base like KOH, perhaps it undergoes a double elimination, losing two HBr molecules to form a double bond. So product 1 would be an adamantane with a double bond between the 1 and 3 positions. So that would make it 1,3-diamantadiene.

But then, why is the IR showing a carbonyl peak? Hmm, that doesn't add up. Wait, perhaps the reaction is actually a substitution. If KOH is in excess and heated, maybe it's an SN2 reaction. But with two bromines, maybe both are substituted. So two hydroxyl groups would be added. But that would form a diol, 1,3-diol. The NMR would have signals around 1-2 ppm for the adamantane protons, but the OH would be broad, but maybe exchanged, so not seen. But where would the 4.79 ppm (2H) come from? Maybe that's part of an ether or something else.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution to form a diol. So 1,3-diol. Then, when treated with a strong base, perhaps elimination occurs. Wait, but the first step is KOH, which is a base. So if you have a diol, and then eliminate, you could form an epoxide? No, diols under certain conditions can form epoxides with an acid catalyst, but not sure about KOH. Alternatively, perhaps it's more likely that in the first step, elimination occurs to form a double bond. So product 1 is 1,3-diamantadiene.

But then, the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ is confusing. Carbonyl is around 1680-1750 cm⁻¹. So maybe I'm wrong. Another possibility: maybe the product is an ester or ketone. But how?

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. If KOH is in aqueous solution, perhaps it's a hydrolysis. But dibromides usually hydrolyze to diols, but under strong basic conditions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not getting the right IR.

Wait, here's another angle. Let's look at the NMR data for product 1. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be an -OCH2CH2O- group, like in a diether. Alternatively, it might be a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen, such as in a carbonyl group. Wait, wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. So, if two HBr are eliminated, but also, a carbonyl group is formed. But in that case, maybe it's a keto-ester or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction forms a ketone and a double bond. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the IR first. The 1720 cm⁻¹ peak is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, perhaps a ketone or an ester. So product 1 must have a carbonyl.

So, if the product has a ketone group, how does that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH? Maybe elimination isn't the right approach. Let's think about oxidation. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the heating with KOH is causing a rearrangement. Maybe it's a pinacol-like rearrangement? Wait, pinacol rearrangement involves diols losing water to form ketones. But in this case, we're starting with dihalides. 

Wait, another possibility: The dihalide could undergo a substitution where each Br is replaced by an -OH group, giving a diol. Then, that diol might undergo a pinacol-like elimination upon heating, forming a carbonyl. So product 1 is a diol, which upon heating, rearranges to a ketone.

Wait, but the question says that product 1 is formed when heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. So product 1 is the initial product, not a subsequent rearrangement. So perhaps the initial product is the diol, but then why the IR shows a carbonyl?

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the nomenclature. 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon treatment with KOH, perhaps undergoes a double dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But that would not give a carbonyl.

Wait, unless the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Wait, maybe it's an oxidation. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution where one Br is replaced by an -O- group, leading to an epoxide? But that would require both Br atoms to be in positions that can form an epoxide, which is possible if they're adjacent.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has Br atoms on adjacent bridgehead carbons. So if both Br groups are eliminated as HBr, perhaps it forms a double bond. But then again, why the carbonyl in IR?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where each Br is replaced by an -O- group, leading to a diether. But then where's the carbonyl?

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone. How could that happen? Maybe the base induces a migration, like a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't the initial reaction but a subsequent step. Wait, no, the first step's product is described as product 1, which is heated with KOH, creating product 1.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a substitution of both Br atoms by hydroxide, forming a diol. Then, when heated, perhaps dehydration occurs. But that would take us to a double bond, but the initial product is the diol, which would show an IR peak around 3300 (OH), but the given IR is at 1720. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. Let me think: if two Brs are on adjacent carbons, treatment with a base might form an epoxide. But how? Epoxides usually form from diols via acid catalysis. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is treated with a base to form an epoxide. Wait, I'm not sure about that mechanism. Maybe it's a double elimination but forming an epoxide instead of a double bond.

Wait, another approach: The IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone. How can 1,3-dibromoadamantane form a ketone upon treatment with KOH?

Wait, maybe the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a carbonyl. So, perhaps each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a CH2 group, and eliminating HBr from each would form carbonyl groups.

Wait, but that would require both Brs to be in such a position. Alternatively, maybe one Br is eliminated, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure of adamantane is such that when two HBr are eliminated, a carbonyl group is formed. Let me think about the structure. If the two Br are on adjacent bridgehead carbons, perhaps elimination leads to forming a bridge with a double bond, but that doesn't directly form a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the base induces a solvolysis where each Br is replaced by an -OH, but then the diol undergoes a pinacol rearrangement upon heating, leading to a ketone. But that would require heating, and the product 1 is formed when heated with KOH. So perhaps product 1 is the diol, but the IR shows a carbonyl from the rearrangement. Wait, but the NMR would show different protons if a pinacol rearrangement occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial product is a ketone. Let me think: The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating with KOH could cause a dehydrohalogenation, but perhaps a pericyclic reaction, like a cyclo elimination, forming a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the structure of adamantane allows for the formation of a ketone. For example, perhaps the loss of two HBr molecules leads to a carbonyl group. Let me imagine: Each Br is on a carbon that's connected to two other bridgehead carbons. If each Br is eliminated as HBr, perhaps the adjacent carbons form a double bond, but that doesn't directly form a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a carbonyl group through some rearrangement.

Hmm, maybe I should look at the NMR data again. The NMR of product 1 shows:

4.79 (2H): Maybe a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen? Like OCH2CH2O?

2.41-2.23 (10H): These are probably the protons on the bridgehead carbons of the adamantane structure, which are typically around 1.5-2.5 ppm. Ten hydrogens might suggest five equivalent protons on each of two adjacent carbons, but not sure.

1.94 (2H): Maybe a CH2 group somewhere else, perhaps connected to the oxygen.

So if product 1 is an ether, like a diether, then the 4.79 ppm (2H) could be part of an OCH2 group. So maybe the starting material undergoes substitution, replacing Br with O- groups, leading to an diol. But then, perhaps the diol is an epoxide? Wait, no, an epoxide would involve an oxygen bridge, not a diol.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a geminal diol, but that's unlikely with two Br on different carbons.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the reaction forms a carbonyl via oxidation. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Unless there's an alternative pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone, and the NMR shows the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, let me imagine product 1 as having a carbonyl group. So, in the NMR, the 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl, like in a ketone. For example, a structure like (CH2)2CO. But in adamantane, perhaps that's a bridgehead.

Wait, but the 4.79 ppm is a singlet for 2H. Maybe it's a methylene group next to oxygen or a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide. The NMR would have the epoxide protons around 3.5-4.5. But product 1's NMR shows 4.79 ppm for 2H. Hmm.

Alternatively, the 4.79 could be a CH2 group attached to an oxygen, like an ether. So OCH2CH2O. But then the 1.94 (2H) could be part of the adamantane structure.

Wait, maybe product 1 is 1,3-dioxa-adamantane, meaning the two bridgehead carbons have oxygen atoms in place of the Br. But then, that would be an ether structure, which would have an OCH2 group.

But how does KOH lead to that? Maybe through a substitution where each Br is replaced by an -O- group. But I'm not familiar with such a reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the base induces an elimination to form an epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane ring, but that doesn't fit with the IR data.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the IR peak again. 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong, medium-intensity peak, probably a ketone or an ester. If it's a ketone, then product 1 would have a carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't a substitution but an elimination leading to a ketone. Let me think: If two Br are on adjacent carbons, and each elimination of HBr leads to the formation of a carbonyl group. But that seems odd because elimination usually forms either a double bond or an epoxide.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a proton beta to the Br, causing elimination and forming a carbonyl via a conjugated base. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by a keto-enol tautomerism or some rearrangement. But I'm not certain.

Well, perhaps I should move forward and consider the next steps. Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1 has a ketone group, perhaps. So if product 2 is formed by a Friedel-Crafts reaction, maybe product 1 is an acylium ion or an acyl chloride. But no, product 1 is a solid, so perhaps it's a ketone.

Wait, but product 1 has a ketone group, as per the IR. Then, when treated with Al(i-Pr)3, perhaps it undergoes some kind of acylation. But adamantane is already a polycyclic structure, so Friedel-Crafts might not work because it's not activated towards electrophilic substitution. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an acyl chloride, but I don't think so because KOH is a base, not a chlorinating agent.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an ester, but no, KOH is more likely to cause elimination or substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes some kind of condensation, like forming a hemiacetal or acetal. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Heating product 1 (which has a ketone) with Al isopropoxide might lead to the formation of an enol ether via an acid-catalyzed dehydration. For example, if product 1 is a diol, acid could dehydrate it to form an alkene or an ether. Or maybe an acetal formation.

Wait, but product 1's NMR includes a singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That could be a methylene adjacent to an oxygen. If product 1 is a diol, Al isopropoxide might dehydrate it to form an ether bridge, like an epoxide or a cyclic ether.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether, which would have an oxygen double bond to a carbon adjacent to an ether oxygen. The enol ether might have a structure like CH2-O-CH2 with some double bond.

But I'm not entirely certain. Let me try to think about product 2. Then, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, leading to product 3.

Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds. The conditions (-78°C and then dimethyl sulfide) suggest that the ozonolysis is done in a reductive work-up, which usually gives aldehydes and ketones. If product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl-containing fragments.

So, the key is to figure out the structure of product 2, which would determine what product 3 looks like. Then, the NMR of product 3 would show the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen.

But I'm getting stuck because I'm not sure about the structure of product 1. Let me try to make some assumptions and see if it makes sense.

Assumption 1: Product 1 is a diol. So, 1,3-diol. The IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ doesn't fit, but maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, which would have an IR peak around 1250 cm⁻¹ for the C-O-C stretch, but the given peak is at 1720, so that's less likely.

Assumption 2: Product 1 is a ketone. So, after heating with KOH, 1,3-dibromoadamantane becomes a ketone. The IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ supports this. The NMR shows 4.79 ppm (2H), maybe a methylene adjacent to the carbonyl. So perhaps it's something like (CH2)2CO-adamantane.

Then, product 1 is a ketone, which is then treated with aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts. But adamantane isn't very reactive towards electrophilic substitution. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 undergoes some kind of acetylation or alkylation.

Wait, but if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an acetal or ketal. Wait, but ketones can form acetals with alcohols, but in this case, it's treated with aluminum isopropoxide, which isn't an alcohol. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Claisen or aldol condensation, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, maybe product 2 is a conjugated enone, formed by some elimination. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. Then, product 3 would be formed by ozonolysis.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether, which upon ozonolysis would break into smaller fragments.

Wait, let me think of the steps again. Product 1 is a ketone. When product 1 is heated with Al isopropoxide, which is a strong Lewis acid, perhaps it facilitates the formation of an enol ether. Enol ethers are formed by the dehydration of diols, but if product 1 is a ketone, maybe it's a different mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a more reactive compound, like an acylium ion, but that's a stretch.

Wait, another possibility: Product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl compounds.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis of an alkene typically breaks it into two carbonyl groups. The work-up (like with dimethyl sulfide) would give aldehydes or ketones, depending on the substituents.

So product 3 would be a compound with carbonyl groups. The NMR of product 3 would show the protons adjacent to these carbonyls. The most deshielded hydrogen would likely be near an electronegative group, like oxygen. So, in the NMR, that hydrogen would have a certain coupling pattern.

But I need to figure out the structure of product 3. Let's try to outline the steps.

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (with IR 1720 cm⁻¹ → likely a ketone) → product 2 (with Al isopropoxide) → product 3 (after ozonolysis).

Assuming product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether (from dehydration), ozonolysis would break the double bond.

Wait, but enol ethers have double bonds. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond, so product 3 would be two carbonyl compounds.

But how does the coupling pattern look? Let's think about the product after ozonolysis. Suppose product 2 is an enol ether, like CH2=CH-O-CH2-... Then, ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls.

But the exact structure is unclear. Another angle: the NMR of product 3. The most deshielded proton would be the one closest to the carbonyl, perhaps a methine (CH) group next to a carbonyl. Its coupling would depend on adjacent protons.

Wait, let's imagine product 3 has a structure such as (CH2)nCO. The most deshielded proton would be on a CH group adjacent to the carbonyl, maybe in a CH2 group next to CO. Or perhaps it's a CH group that's split into a triplet, doublet, etc.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging. Maybe I can think of the possible options.

The options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

I'm trying to figure out what kind of splitting a proton would have. The most deshielded hydrogen would likely be adjacent to a carbonyl group, so it's probably a CH2 or CH group next to a carbonyl.

If that CH group is next to a CH2 group, which is next to another CH2, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, perhaps the proton is adjacent to two sets of equivalent protons. For example, if it's a CH2 group next to a CH which is next to another CH2, the splitting could be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if it's a CH group next to two equivalent CH2 groups, each with two protons, the coupling could be a triplet.

Wait, let me think in terms of vicinal coupling. If a proton is adjacent to two different sets of protons, each with two protons, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets. For example, if it's next to a CH2 and another CH2, each with two protons, it would couple with both groups, leading to (n+1)(m+1) = (2+1)(2+1) = 9, but that's a nonet. Wait, but maybe it's a doublet of triplets or something else.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH group next to a CH2 group, which is next to another CH2 group. So the first coupling is with the adjacent CH2 (2H → triplet), and the second coupling is with another CH2 (2H → triplet). So the splitting would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is with two different sets, each with two protons, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but how would that happen? Let me imagine the structure. Suppose the molecule is something like CH2-CO-R. The CH2 protons would be split by the neighboring groups. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH group with two adjacent CH2 groups.

For example, structure: CH2-CH-CO-R. The central CH would have coupling with both adjacent CH2 groups. Each CH2 has 2H, so each coupling would be a triplet. So the central CH would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the CH group is next to a CH2 which is next to another CH2, then each adjacent group would split the signal. So the splitting would be a triplet (from the first CH2) and another triplet (from the second CH2), leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another possibility is that the most deshielded proton is part of a CH2 group next to a CH which is next to another CH2. So, each coupling would be a triplet, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, maybe it's a pentet if it's coupling with four equivalent protons. But that would require being next to a CH2 group that's next to another CH2 group, leading to 2+2=4, so (4+1) = 5, a pentet. But that seems less likely because the coupling would be between non-equivalent protons.

Wait, another angle: the most deshielded proton is in a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say the structure is CH2-CO. The CH2 protons would be split by any adjacent protons. If the CH2 is next to another CH2 group, each with two protons, then each would split into a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the CH2 is next to a CH, which is next to another CH2. So the first CH would split into a doublet, and the second CH2 would split into a triplet. So the overall splitting would be a doublet of triplets, which is option C.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded proton is a methylene (CH2) group adjacent to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is next to another CH2 group. Each would cause a splitting. So the first CH2 would split into a triplet, and the second would also cause a triplet, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH group adjacent to two different CH2 groups, each with two protons, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the possible structures again.

Product 3 comes from ozonolysis of product 2. If product 2 has a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would break each double bond into two carbonyl groups. But if product 2 is a monoene, ozonolysis would split it into two carbonyl compounds.

Assuming product 2 is an enol ether with a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl-containing fragments. The most deshielded proton in product 3 would be adjacent to the carbonyl group.

Suppose product 3 is a ketone or aldehyde. The protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded. Let's say it's a structure like CH2-CO-R. The CH2 protons would be split by any neighboring protons.

If CH2 is next to a CH2 group, each with two protons, the splitting would be a triplet for each. So the CH2 protons would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to another CH2 group which is next to a CH group, the splitting pattern might be more complex.

Wait, another way to approach this: The most deshielded hydrogen is likely in a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and another CH2 group. So each coupling is with two Hs, leading to a triplet for each coupling. So the overall pattern would be a triplet of triplets.

So the answer would be option B: triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if it's adjacent to a single CH group, perhaps it's a doublet of triplets.

Hmm. Without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging, but given the options, I think the most plausible is a triplet of triplets.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   - 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH, forming product 1.  
   - The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group (likely a ketone).  
   - The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests a structure with a carbonyl group and adjacent protons, possibly a methylene group (CH₂) near the carbonyl.

2. **Reaction with Al(i-Pr)₃**:  
   - Product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, to form product 2.  
   - This step likely facilitates the formation of a compound with a double bond, such as an enol ether, which is reactive toward ozonolysis.

3. **Ozonolysis and Work-Up**:  
   - Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by a reductive work-up with dimethyl sulfide, forming product 3.  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, producing carbonyl-containing fragments. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group.

4. **NMR Analysis of Product 3**:  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen is adjacent to a carbonyl group. Its coupling pattern depends on the number and arrangement of neighboring protons.  
   - If the hydrogen is adjacent to two CH₂ groups, each with two protons, the splitting would occur as a triplet of triplets (each coupling contributes a triplet).  
   - This matches the description of the coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3.

**Conclusion**: The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet of triplets.  
**Answer: B**
