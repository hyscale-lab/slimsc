Okay, so I've got this pretty complicated question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to unpack it step by step.

Alright, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells, and the experiment involves some transgenic mice. The researcher created a bicistronic vector, which means it has two coding sequences in one transcript, right? So, the vector has the ligand ORF at the 5' end fused to mCherry, and the receptor ORF at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, and between the ligand and mCherry, there's a stop cassette with loxP. Similarly, the receptor has an IRES upstream, and between the receptor and eGFP, there's a stop cassette with lox2272.

Wait, bicistronic vectors use internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) to allow translation of two separate ORFs from the same mRNA. So, the ligand is first, then the receptor. The IRES is before the receptor, so that would allow the ribosome to translate it after the ligand.

But the vector is a lox-Cre setup. So, when Cre is expressed, it would recombine the loxP sites, causing the stops to be removed. So the ligand and mCherry would be co-expressed, and the receptor and eGFP would also be co-expressed.

In the experiment, they transfected the vector into primary astrocyte culture and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins on a Western blot. The blot uses actin as a loading control. So, they probably checked if the proteins (ligand and receptor, tagged with mCherry and eGFP respectively) are being expressed.

But then they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed it with SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, I believe. SOX10-Cre would drive Cre expression in neural crest cells, leading to recombination in those tissues.

After the offspring are born, they look for green signal under the confocal. But they don't see any green. The green is from eGFP, which is linked to the receptor. So the receptor-eGFP isn't being expressed, or isn't being detected.

Looking at the options:

A) Ligand and receptor are in paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about expression in neural crest cells, so I'm not sure how that relates. Maybe if the ligand is secreted and acts on nearby cells, but why would that affect the expression of GFP? Not sure.

B) Receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. That would mean it doesn't get to the cell surface, so no fluorescence. But why would it not work in the mouse but work in the culture? Because in culture, maybe the cells are treated to allow proper trafficking, but in the mouse, perhaps some issue. Or maybe the vector's expression isn't working. Not sure.

C) Enhancer for expression is missing. The problem could be that the ligand and receptor are under the wrong promoters. The ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor has an IRES, which is a method for allowing separate translation. Wait, but the IRES typically allows for the second ORF to be translated without the need for a second promoter. So if the ligand and receptor are both expressed, why no eGFP?

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic construct with the ligand first, then the receptor, with IRES. So the same transcript has ligand and receptor. The stop cassettes are between them, so without Cre, the ligand is expressed with mCherry, and the receptor is not expressed because the stop cassette is in the way. But with Cre, the loxP sites are cut, the stops are removed, so both ligand and receptor can be expressed.

Wait, but in the mouse, they are homozygous for the construct. Oh, but the Cre is from the SOX10-Cre mice. So when they cross, the Cre is expressed, leading to recombination, which should allow both ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But in the mouse, the receptor-eGFP isn't expressed, as seen by no green signal. So why? Let's think about the vector setup.

The ligand is at 5', with a CBA promoter. The receptor is after an IRES. So for the mouse, the Cre would have to delete the stop cassettes, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed.

Wait, but how is the stop cassette arranged? The ligand ORF is followed by a stop with loxP, and the receptor is after the IRES but before its own stop with lox2272. Hmm, maybe the stop cassettes prevent expression until Cre deletes them.

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So the construct would have the ligand followed by a stop in a loxP cassette, then the IRES, then the receptor followed by a stop in a lox2272 cassette.

So, in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed (since its promoter is active), but the stop cassette after ligand prevents expression of the IRES and receptor. So the receptor isn't expressed. But when Cre is present, the loxP sites are cut, removing the stops. So the ligand is expressed, and the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed.

Ah, but wait, the IRES is between the ligand stop and the receptor. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't. But when Cre is present, the stops are removed, so both ligand and receptor are expressed.

In the Western blot, they transfected the vector into astrocytes, so they must have seen both mCherry and eGFP. Because in culture, Cre isn't present? Or maybe Cre is expressed in some cells. Hmm, but in the mouse, they are using SOX10-Cre, which would activate Cre in neural crest cells.

So, in the mouse, the construct is homozygous, meaning both alleles have the vector. When Cre is introduced, the stops are removed, so both ligand and receptor should be expressed.

But in the offspring, they don't see eGFP on the confocal. So the receptor-eGFP isn't expressed. Why?

Looking at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. The vector's receptor is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. If the ORF is not in frame, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed correctly. But why would the Western blot show the receptor in culture, but not in the mouse? Or wait, the Western blot was done after transfection. Maybe in the mouse, the construct isn't being expressed, but in culture, it was.

Wait, in the vector, perhaps the eGFP is under a stop cassette that's not correctly removed. Or maybe the IRES isn't functioning properly.

Alternatively, maybe the ligand is under a strong promoter, but the receptor is under the IRES. So in the presence of Cre, the stops are removed, and the IRES allows the receptor to be translated. But if the IRES isn't functional, the receptor might not be expressed.

Another thought: The vector has the ligand ORF with mCherry, but in the mouse, perhaps the Cre isn't working correctly. But the mice were crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should activate Cre in neural crest cells.

Wait, but the construct is in a homozygous state. So both copies of the gene have the vector. But when Cre is present, it should delete both loxP and lox2272 stops. So both alleles would express ligand and receptor.

Wait, but the problem says the mouse model is homozygous for the construct in the wt background. So, the construct is present in both alleles.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the vector's design is leading to a read-through or other issues. Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't compatible with the receptor's expression.

Wait, the IRES is used to allow for the translation of the second ORF (the receptor) from the same mRNA. But if the IRES isn't functional, then the receptor's ORF might not be translated.

Alternatively, the stop cassettes weren't properly removed. So, perhaps in the mouse, the Cre didn't recombine the lox sites correctly. Or perhaps the construct is in a region of the genome where recombination isn't happening.

Alternatively, maybe the vector design is causing the receptor to not be in frame with eGFP, so the eGFP isn't made. So option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Wait, if the eGFP is attached to the receptor's C-terminus, then the ORF should be in frame. Otherwise, the eGFP wouldn't be functional. If the ORF is out of frame, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, or would produce a truncated or nonfunctional protein.

In the Western blot, they probably used an antibody against the receptor or eGFP. If in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed, they wouldn't see a band for eGFP. But the question says they don't see the green signal, which is eGFP.

So, the problem is that eGFP isn't being expressed. Why? If the eGFP is part of the receptor construct, perhaps the IRES isn't functioning. Or perhaps the stop cassette wasn't removed, so the receptor isn't being expressed.

Alternatively, the IRES isn't working. IRES elements can be tissue-specific or virus-specific. Maybe the IRES used doesn't function in the neural crest cells, so even though the stop is removed, the receptor isn't expressed.

But wait, in the Western blot after transfection, they probably saw expression if the vector works. So in culture, the construct works. But in the mouse, perhaps the IRES isn't active.

Wait, another angle: The vector has the ligand under CBA, which is constitutive. The receptor is under the control of the IRES. So when Cre is present, the stops are removed, and the IRES allows the receptor to be translated. But if the IRES doesn't function in the cells of the mouse, then the receptor wouldn't be expressed.

Alternatively, maybe the IRES is in the wrong orientation. Or perhaps the construct didn't insert correctly into the genome, causing the IRES not to function.

But the question is about the options provided. Let me look again.

Option C says the enhancer for expression is missing. The ligand is under CBA, which is a promoter, not enhancer. But the receptor relies on the IRES. If the IRES isn't working, then the enhancer could be an issue.

Wait, maybe the CBA promoter is sufficient for the ligand, but the receptor's expression requires a promoter. But no, the IRES is supposed to drive the second ORF's translation without a promoter. So if the IRES isn't functional, the receptor wouldn't be expressed.

But I'm not sure if any of the options directly address that. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that the eGFP is either not expressed or expressed as a nonfunctional protein. So if the ORF is out of frame, the eGFP wouldn't be made, so no green signal.

But why would the frame be wrong? Maybe during cloning, the receptor ORF and eGFP were not correctly ligated in frame. If the vector was constructed incorrectly, the eGFP might not be in frame with the receptor, leading to no expression.

In the Western blot in culture, they used antibodies against overexpressed proteins. If the construct had a frame shift, perhaps the receptor wouldn't be expressed, but the mCherry might be. Or maybe the eGFP wouldn't be expressed either.

Wait, but in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed, but in the culture, they might have transfected the construct and saw expression. Unless the frame problem only occurs in the mouse, which doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a problem with the stop cassettes. If the stop is not correctly flanked by loxP sites, Cre might not delete them. So, the receptor remains under the stop cassette, so it's not expressed.

But the question says that the mouse is homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background, and then crossed with SOX10-Cre. So, Cre is present, and should remove the stops.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't compatible with the receptor's expression. For example, the IRES might work better with certain types of genes. If the receptor's ORF is not compatible with the IRES, it won't be expressed.

But none of the options directly address that. Wait, looking at the options again:

Option B: the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. That would imply that the protein isn't trafficked correctly. But if the eGFP is part of the receptor, which is a transmembrane protein, maybe the construct is causing it to misfold and get stuck. But I'm not sure why this would happen specifically in the mouse and not in the culture.

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. I'm not sure how that affects the expression of eGFP. If they are paracrine, perhaps the ligand is secreted and acts on other cells, but the construct is designed to express both ligand and receptor.

Wait, but if the ligand is expressed, and the receptor is not, then the cells wouldn't have the receptor to respond. But in the mouse, the Cre is present, so both should be expressed.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the ligand is being expressed, but the receptor isn't, so the construct isn't working. But why would that happen? Maybe because the IRES isn't working.

Another angle: The vector has the ligand under CBA, which is a strong promoter. Then the IRES is used for the receptor. So the mRNA is ligand followed by IRES, then receptor. So in the presence of Cre, the ligand and receptor are expressed.

In the mouse, since the Cre is active (from SOX10-Cre), the stops are removed, so both should be expressed. But the eGFP isn't showing up. So that suggests the receptor isn't being expressed.

So why isn't the receptor being expressed? Let's think about the vector design. The ligand is in the 5' ORF, and the receptor is in the 3' ORF. The IRES is between them. So if the IRES isn't functional, the receptor won't be translated.

But in the culture, when they transfected the vector, perhaps the IRES worked, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed, hence why they saw eGFP on Western. But in the mouse, perhaps the IRES isn't functional.

Alternatively, maybe the IRES is only active in certain cell types. But the SOX10-Cre is active in neural crest cells, which is where the receptor is supposed to be expressed.

Hmm. Let me think about the possible answers again.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If that's the case, then the eGFP won't be expressed, so no green signal. But why would this affect the mouse and not the culture? Unless the frame issue only became apparent when the construct was inserted into the genome. Or perhaps in the culture, the construct was transiently expressed, allowing the eGFP to be made despite the frame issue. But that seems unlikely.

Another possibility is that the eGFP is not correctly fused to the receptor. If the frame is wrong, the eGFP isn't produced, so no signal.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassette wasn't correctly removed. But the Cre is supposed to do that.

Wait, the vector has two different lox sites: loxP and lox2272. Lox2272 is a variant of loxP. I think Cre can't cut lox2272 on its own; it requires another enzyme like FLP. Or wait, no, I think lox2272 is a lox site that Cre can recognize, but it's a different arrangement. Wait, no, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. LoxP is 13 bp with 8 bp palindromic arms, and lox2272 is a 34bp site with different arms. I think Cre can cut both, but perhaps in a specific way. So, the vector uses loxP and lox2272 as stop cassettes. So, when Cre is expressed, both stops should be removed.

But if the vector wasn't correctly recombined, the stops would remain, and the receptor wouldn't be expressed.

But the mouse is homozygous for the construct, meaning both alleles have this setup. So, when Cre is present, both should have their stops removed.

Wait, but SOX10-Cre is a transgenic mouse line where Cre is under the SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells. So, in those cells, Cre is expressed, leading to recombination.

If the stops are not removed, the receptor wouldn't be expressed. But why would the stops not be removed? Because the lox sites aren't recognized? Or maybe the vector has both loxP and lox2272, and the Cre can't cut both.

Wait, I'm not sure about this. I think that Cre can cut both loxP and lox2272 sites, but perhaps the lox2272 requires a different strain or condition. No, Cre should work with lox2272 as well.

Alternatively, maybe the lox2272 stop cassette isn't correctly placed. For example, the lox sites are in the wrong orientation, so Cre doesn't cut them, and the stop remains.

If the stop isn't removed, the receptor wouldn't be expressed, so no eGFP. So the mouse wouldn't show green. But why would the Western blot in culture show expression? Because in the culture, without Cre, the stop is in place. Wait, no. Wait, in the construct, in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed because it's under CBA, but the receptor is under the IRES with a stop in front. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed with mCherry, and the receptor is not expressed. But when Cre is present, the stops are removed, allowing the receptor to be expressed.

Wait, but in the culture, they used the vector without Cre, I suppose. Wait, no, the vector is a lox-Cre vector, so whether Cre is present depends on whether the cells have it. So if they transfected the vector into astrocytes, which don't express Cre, then the stops are in place. So the ligand would be expressed with mCherry, and the receptor not expressed. But the question says that after transfection, they used antibodies against overexpressed proteins on a Western blot. So perhaps in the culture, the vector isn't expressing both because Cre isn't present. But the question states that they saw a signal proportional to actin loading, which suggests both proteins are expressed.

Wait, that's confusing. Maybe in the culture, the vector is in an environment with Cre. Perhaps the researchers used a cell line that expresses Cre, or they added Cre recombinase in vitro.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector was designed in such a way that in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed, and the receptor is not. But when Cre is present, both are expressed. So if the culture is transfected without Cre, only the ligand would be expressed. But the question says that they used the vector in primary astrocyte culture and then tested expression. So if the vector wasn't expressing the receptor in culture, they wouldn't have seen eGFP. But the question says that they had antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. Maybe the ligand was overexpressed, but the receptor wasn't. Or perhaps both were expressed.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to approach the options again.

The key issue is that in the mouse, after SOX10-Cre activation, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the most likely reason is that the receptor-eGFP construct isn't being expressed.

Looking at the options, option D suggests a frame issue. If the frame is wrong, eGFP won't be produced. So no green signal.

Alternatively, option B suggests the construct is stuck in the Golgi. That would prevent the GFP from being on the surface, so no fluorescence. But GFP is often cytoplasmic or membrane, depending on the tag. If it's on the receptor, which is a transmembrane protein, it might be on the surface. But if it's stuck in the Golgi, it wouldn't reach the surface, hence no signal. But why would the construct traffic improperly? Maybe due to a mutation or incorrect signal.

Option C suggests the enhancer is missing. But the ligand is under a promoter (CBA), which is strong, so the enhancer might not be the issue. The receptor relies on the IRES, so maybe IRES isn't functional.

Wait, but the question is about the most likely reason. The fact that the eGFP isn't expressed suggests that the construct isn't working. The vector has two ORFs, and both are dependent on Cre.

If the vector's ORF for the receptor is not in frame with the eGFP, then eGFP wouldn't be expressed. That would lead to no green signal.

So, the correct answer is D.


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair, where the ligand is fused to mCherry and the receptor to eGFP. The vector includes stop cassettes (loxP and lox2272) that prevent receptor expression in the absence of Cre. Upon Cre recombination, these stops are removed, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed. The experiment involves transfecting the vector into primary astrocytes and testing its expression via Western blot, followed by crossing the homozygous construct into SOX10-Cre mice to visualize eGFP expression under a confocal microscope. However, no green signal (eGFP) is observed in the mouse offspring.

Key analysis of the options:

- **Option A**: Suggests the ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. This refers to their functional interaction but does not explain why eGFP is not expressed. The question focuses on expression, not function, so this is unlikely to be the correct answer.

- **Option B**: Proposes that the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If this were the case, eGFP would not reach the cell surface and would not fluoresce. However, this does not explain why the construct works in culture but fails in the mouse, as Golgi trafficking issues would likely affect both contexts.

- **Option C**: Suggests the enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. The ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, and the receptor relies on an IRES for translation. While an enhancer might influence expression, the absence of an enhancer would likely affect both ligand and receptor expression, not just the receptor-eGFP fusion.

- **Option D**: States that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the receptor ORF and eGFP are not correctly aligned, eGFP would not be expressed, resulting in no green signal. This is consistent with the observation that eGFP is missing while the ligand may still be expressed. A frame issue could also explain why the construct works in culture (transient expression) but fails in the mouse (stabilized genomic integration).

The most likely explanation is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, preventing eGFP expression and resulting in no green signal in the mouse. 

Answer: D
