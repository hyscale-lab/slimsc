Okay, so I have this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let me recall what optical isomerism is. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, meaning the molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image. This leads to enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images, and these can rotate plane-polarized light, hence the term optical isomers.

Now, looking at the question, there are four compounds given, and I need to determine which of them exhibit optical isomerism. The options are combinations of these four.

The compounds are:
1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate
2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
3. benzophenone
4. dimethyl fumarate

Let me go through each one.

1. Starting with compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, the structure here sounds like a biphenyl system. The substituents are at positions 6 and 2 on each benzene ring. Wait, but biphenyls can have different conformations, but does that lead to stereoisomerism? I'm thinking about whether there's a plane of symmetry or not. Oh wait, if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule has a center of chirality. Or maybe it's about the possibility of the molecule being meso or not. Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl has a single bond between the two phenyl rings, allowing for rotation. Wait, but for biphenyls, if the substituents are in positions that create different configurations, like if each ring has two substituents, maybe leading to cis or trans isomerism. But wait, that would be stereoisomerism, but optical isomerism requires a chiral center. So unless the molecule has a chiral center, it can't exhibit optical isomerism. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me think: in 6,6',2,2' positions, perhaps it's symmetric. If the substituents are in such a way that the molecule is symmetric, then it wouldn't have a chiral center. Wait, if the substituents are in positions that mirror each other, then the molecule might be achiral.
