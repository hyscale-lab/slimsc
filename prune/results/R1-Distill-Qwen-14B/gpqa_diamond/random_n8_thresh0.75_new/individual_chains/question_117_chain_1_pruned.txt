Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, I need to figure out which of the given compounds exhibit this property. Let me think through each compound one by one.

The question lists four compounds, numbered 1 to 4, and the options are combinations of these. Optical isomerism, or optical activity, occurs when a compound has chiral centers, meaning it has non-superimposable mirror images. So I need to check each compound for the presence of chiral centers or other forms of asymmetry like geometric isomerism that can lead to optical activity.

Let's start with option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, biphenyl rings with substituents. The structure has two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, but in biphenyls, the arrangement around the single bond can lead to cis and trans isomers. Oh wait, but does that lead to optical isomerism? Actually, for a compound to have optical isomers, it needs a chiral center or some sort of asymmetry. Biphenyls with substituents can sometimes have atropisomerism if the rotation around the bond is restricted. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. The substituents are at 2 and 6 positions on the biphenyl, which are across from each other. If the substituents are in positions that make the molecule non-symmetrical, maybe. Wait, positions 2 and 2' are on each ring, and 6 and 6' are nitro groups. The structure: each benzene has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. So the substituents are in para positions relative to each other. Wait, wait: 1,1'-biphenyl means the two benzene rings are connected at position 1 and 1'. So the substituents at 2 and 2' would be adjacent to the connecting bond. So each ring has a nitro at position 6 (which is opposite to the connecting bond), and a COOCH3 group at position 2 (next to the connecting bond). So each benzene ring has two substituents: one at 2 (COOCH3) and 6 (NO2). Now, in the biphenyl structure, if the substituents are in a way that makes the molecule non-planar and rigid, perhaps it can have atropisomers. But does this compound have a plane of symmetry? Let me think. The two rings are each substituted with a nitro and a carboxylate. Are these positions symmetrical? The substituents are in the same positions on each ring, but I'm not sure if that leads to a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a center of symmetry. Let me visualize: each ring has a nitro and carbamate group. Are they arranged in a way that the molecule is symmetrical? I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps this could have enantiomers. Alternatively, the substituents might create a chiral environment. Hmm, maybe this compound can have optical isomerism. I'll tentatively say yes, but I'm not completely confident. Maybe I should hold off on that and check the others first.

Next, option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's draw that. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2COOCH3. Wait, no, wait: propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Or maybe it's (CH3)CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2CH2COOH? Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, propanoate is the conjugate base of propanoic acid. So the structure would be CH2CH2COO- with a methyl as the ester. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester where the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but wait, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate: the propanoate has three carbons, with the hydroxyl on the second carbon. Now, does this compound have a chiral center? Let's see: the second carbon has a hydroxyl, a methyl (from the CH2), and two other groups. Let me count. The structure would be: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, methyl ester. Propanoate would be CH2CH2COO-; so methyl ester is CH2CH2COOCH3. The hydroxy is on the
