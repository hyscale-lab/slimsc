Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So the question is asking which of the given particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. The options are A) Phonon, B) Skyrmion, C) Magnon, D) Pion.

Hmm, I remember that spontaneous symmetry breaking is a concept in physics where the underlying laws have a certain symmetry, but the system as a whole doesn't exhibit that symmetry because it's in a particular state. Like how a spinning top can have rotational symmetry, but when it's spinning, the direction of rotation breaks that symmetry.

In particle physics and condensed matter, certain particles arise due to this spontaneous symmetry breaking. Let's think about each option.

Option D, Pion: Pions are associated with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in QCD. Chiral symmetry is broken when the quarks acquire a mass, and pions are the Goldstone bosons from that breaking. So pions are linked to spontaneous symmetry breaking.

Option B, Skyrmion: Skyrmions are a type of topological soliton, and I think they arise in models of nuclear physics. They are solutions to the equations of motion in a theory with certain symmetries. Wait, do they come from spontaneous symmetry breaking? Or are they more about the vacuum structure of the theory? Skyrmions represent a configuration that has a certain symmetry, but maybe they emerge due to other reasons. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I think skyrmions can be related to chiral symmetry as well, perhaps as a way to model the proton and neutron.

Option C, Magnon: Magnons are the quasiparticles associated with spin waves in a crystal. I believe they arise in systems where there's magnetic order, like in antiferromagnets. The system has a broken symmetry because the magnetic moments are aligned in a particular way, not randomly. The spin waves (magnons) are a result of this ordered state and thus linked to the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry. So magnons are connected to spontaneous symmetry breaking.

Option A, Phonon: Phonons are the quasiparticles for lattice vibrations. They arise in solids from the quantized vibrations of the crystal lattice. Phonons are associated with the spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry? Wait, no. Wait, in a solid, the translational symmetry is broken because the atoms are arranged in a periodic lattice. So the phonon is a remnant of that broken symmetry. Or wait, when a crystal forms, the translational symmetry (continuous) is broken to the discrete symmetry of the lattice. So phon
