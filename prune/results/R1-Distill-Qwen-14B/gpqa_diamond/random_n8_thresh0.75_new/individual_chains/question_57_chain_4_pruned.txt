Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through.

The question gives me some phase shifts: delta_0 is 90 degrees, delta_1 is 67 degrees, delta_2 is 55, delta_3 is 30, and delta_4 is 13 degrees. They tell me to ignore the rest, so I guess we only consider up to l=4. Wait, phase shifts are for each angular momentum quantum number l, right? So delta_0 is for l=0, delta_1 for l=1, etc.

The problem asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Oh wait, I remember something about partial waves and scattering amplitudes. The scattering amplitude f(theta) is given by a series involving these phase shifts. Specifically, the formula is something like f(theta) = (1/k) * sum over l of ( (2l + 1) * (sin(delta_l) ) / (1 + cos^2(theta)/3) ) * (sin(theta)/2) ) ) * (something with spherical Bessel functions... wait, no, maybe not. Wait, another approach: the general expression for f(theta) is (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^âˆž (2l+1) e^{2i delta_l} sin(delta_l) (sin(theta)/2)^{l} ... Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing it up.

Wait, I think the formula is f(theta) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^infty (2l +1) [ sin(delta_l) ] * ( (e^{2i delta_l} -1 ) ) * ( (1 + cos(theta) )/( 2 (2l+1) ) ) )? Maybe that's not right. Alternatively, I've heard that the scattering amplitude can be written in terms of the phase shifts as f(theta) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) [ (sin(delta_l) ) * (e^{i delta_l} - 1) ) ] * ( (1 + cos(theta) )/( 2 ) )^l * ... Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, another approach: the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at theta=0 degrees (along the incident direction) would be when theta is zero. So maybe I can find the formula for f
