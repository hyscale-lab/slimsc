Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out what the molecular symmetry group of product E is. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry groups, so I need to think this through step by step.

First, let me parse the reactions given to figure out what each compound is. The problem describes a series of reactions, and from the products and their properties, I can probably deduce the structures.

So, the first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, bright red product... that makes me think of something like sulfur, maybe? Or perhaps a compound like copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate, but that's blue. Wait, another thought: maybe it's something like sulfur trioxide (SO3) reacting? Or maybe a transition metal compound. Bright red could also be lead dioxide (PbO2), but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another possibility: I remember that when solid sodium sulfide (Na2S) reacts with something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction involving vanadium or chromium. Oh, wait, maybe it's about the formation of a sulfide or another compound.

Alternatively, perhaps it's sulfur trioxide? But wait, sulfur trioxide is a liquid under certain conditions, but I'm not certain about the color. Another thought: maybe it's about the formation of a coordination compound. Bright red could be a complex ion like [Fe(CN)6]^3- or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's look at the second reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. E is hazardous, so maybe it's something like chlorine gas, but no, that's a gas. Alternatively, it could be a toxic compound, perhaps phosgene or something else. But I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think about the third reaction. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, when C is treated with water, it produces two acids. Let's think about what compounds upon hydrolysis produce two different acids.

One possibility is a sulfite ester, but that might not fit. Another thought: maybe C is a sulfite or a sulfate. Wait, if C is a sulfite (SO2^2-), but that would probably lead to H2SO3 (which is a weak acid) and... Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle: when a nitrate salt reacts with water, that's not typical. Or perhaps C is a metal sulfide. Wait, if C is a sulfide like Na2S, but how does that react with water? It would just stay as Na2S, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think again. C is a bright red product. Another thought: maybe it's a transition metal compound. For example, MnO2 is a dark brown solid, but maybe some other Mn compound is red. Alternatively, maybe it's a chromium compound. Chromium trioxide is orange, maybe not red. Wait, perhaps it's a vanadium compound. Vanadium(V) oxide is orange, but vanadium(IV) oxide is a greenish-yellow powder. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonamide or another organic compound, but I'm not sure that's the case here.

Wait, let me think about the first reaction again. A reacting with 8 equivalents of B gives C. 8 equivalents is a lot, so perhaps the formula involves multiple B atoms per A. Let's think about what gases are possible for B. It could be something like O2, S, Cl2, etc.

Wait, another approach: the second reaction, C with gas D (2 equivalents) gives E, which is hazardous. So, perhaps D is a gas that can react with C. Let's think about common gas reactions.

If D is Cl2, perhaps C is a sulfide, and reacting with Cl2 would produce HCl and maybe SO2 or something else. But E is extremely hazardous, so perhaps E is something like SO2Cl2? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps D is H2O? But that's a liquid, I think. Or maybe it's O2.

Wait, the problem says D is a gas. So maybe D is something like Cl2 or O2.

Another thought: what if D is H2O? No, because H2O is a liquid at standard conditions. Unless it's under gaseous conditions. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the third reaction again. C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is hydrolyzed, it produces two acids. One strong, one weak.

Wait, if C is a sulfite (SO3^2-), then hydrolysis would produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and possibly another acid. But that might not fit.

Wait, another possibility: if C is a nitrite (NO2^-), but that's more of a brown color. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfate (SO4^2-), but that's typically colorless or slightly yellow.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonate ion. No, not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's a metal sulfide. For example, if C is FeS, then reacting with water might not produce two acids. Alternatively, maybe it's a more complex salt.

Wait, another approach: the first reaction is A + 8 B → C. So, perhaps A is a metal, and B is a polyatomic ion. For example, if A is sodium (Na), and B is S, then 8 equivalents would give Na2S. Wait, that would be 2 Na + S → Na2S, which only requires 2 Na, not 8. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another thought: maybe B is O2. So, if A is Fe, then B is O2, and the reaction forms FeO2 (but I'm not sure about that). Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction forming a metal oxide, but I'm not certain
