Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, it's about identifying a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its spectral data. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

So, the compound has an ester group. Ester groups have specific peaks in IR. The IR shows peaks indicating an ester, so that's a clue. Esters typically show a strong absorption around 1740-1760 cm⁻¹, which is the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Also, the ester oxygen might show up around 1100-1250 cm⁻¹. But that's probably more for identification than formula.

Looking at the NMR data: 1H NMR shows six signals. Let me think about what each part of the spectrum tells us.

The aromatic-H part: two signals. So for a di-substituted benzene ring, the substituents can be in different positions. The number of signals depends on the substitution pattern. For example, if it's para-substituted, there are two types of aromatic protons: the two equivalent ortho to one substituent and the two meta. Wait, no, in para substitution, the ring has two substituents opposite each other. The aromatic protons would split into two sets: two Hs in the ortho positions (but actually, in para, each ortho is equivalent), and two in the meta positions, but wait, di-substituted in para would have symmetry. Wait, no, for a di-substituted benzene ring, the number of NMR signals depends on the substituents. If the substituents are identical and para, the ring would have two types of H: the two ortho to the substituent, and the two meta. So that would be two signals for the aromatic Hs. So that fits with the NMR data.

Next, two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically adjacent to double bonds, like in an ester group. Esters have an R-O-CO-O-R structure, but more accurately, it's RCOOR'. Wait, no, the ester functional group is RCO-O-R'. So the carbonyl is attached to an oxygen, which is attached to another R group. So the structure would have a carbonyl and an adjacent OR group.

Wait, maybe the vinyl-Hs come from something else. Oh, wait
