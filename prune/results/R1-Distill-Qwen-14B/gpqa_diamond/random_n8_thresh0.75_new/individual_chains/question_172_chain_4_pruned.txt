Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. The problem says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. We need to find the correct equation relating their effective temperatures T1 and T2, assuming LTE.

Hmm, LTE stands for Local Thermal Equilibrium, right? So in LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels should follow the Boltzmann distribution. I remember the Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy states to the temperature.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where g's are the statistical weights. But wait, the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So maybe the ratio is 2?

Wait, let me think. Let me denote the two energy levels as E1 and E2, where E2 is higher than E1 by ΔE. The excitation here refers to the population in the upper level. So n2 is the number in the upper state, and n1 in the lower.

The problem states that in star_1, the excitation (n2) is twice that of star_2. So n2_1 = 2 * n2_2. Or wait, maybe it's the ratio of the excited state to the ground state? The question says "twice as excited", so I think it's n2_1 / n1_1 = 2 * (n2_2 / n1_2). Or wait, maybe the ratio n2_1/(n1_1 + n2_1) is twice n2_2/(n1_2 + n2_2). Hmm, but perhaps for simplicity, in LTE, each star's own atoms are in equilibrium, so perhaps for each star, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)).

But wait, the problem says the energy difference is the same for both stars, since it's the same transition. So ΔE is the same for both. And the statistical weights g2 and g1 are the same for each star, since it's the same element and transition.

So for each star, the ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k*T)).

Let me denote for star 1:
