Okay, so I have this organic chemistry question in front of me, and I need to figure out which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism... I remember that refers to compounds that have chiral centers, meaning they are not superimposable on their mirror images. So, when a molecule has a chiral center, it can have enantiomers, leading to optical activity.

Let me look at each option one by one.

The question lists four compounds:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate
2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
3. benzophenone
4. dimethyl fumarate

And the options are A to D, each selecting a combination of these. I need to determine which compounds can show optical isomerism.

Starting with compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, biphenyl structures can sometimes have stereoisomerism if there's a substituent on each ring that's in the meta position. Wait, but biphenyls can have a type of stereoisomerism called geometric isomerism if the substituents are in certain positions. Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it might not be chiral. Let me think about the structure.

The biphenyl has two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' for the dicarboxylate groups, and 6 and 6' for the dinitro groups. So, in a biphenyl system, if the substituents are in positions that prevent a plane of symmetry, the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, substituents at 2 and 2' on each ring. So each ring has a COOCH3 group at position 2 and a NO2 group at position 6. Wait, wait. Let me visualize the structure. Each ring has two substituents, but how are they arranged? The two substituents on each ring are at 2 and 2'â€”no, wait, the substituents are at 2 and 2' on each ring. Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetric because the substituents are in symmetrical positions. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the arrangement allows for a plane of symmetry through the central bond. For example, if the substitu
