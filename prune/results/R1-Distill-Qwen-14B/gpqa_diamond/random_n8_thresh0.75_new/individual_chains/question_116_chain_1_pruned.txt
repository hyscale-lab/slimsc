Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that compound A has two signals in the proton NMR: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, okay. So, NMR signals can tell us a lot about the structure. Let me think about what these signals might correspond to.

A triplet at 0.9 ppm with 6H. That's usually indicative of a methyl group adjacent to another CH2 group. Because in NMR, when a CH3 is next to a CH2 that's split into a quartet, the methyl would be a triplet. Wait, no, actually, the splitting is based on neighboring protons. If we have a CH2 next to another CH2, each CH2 would split the other into a quartet if they have two neighboring protons. Wait, no, let me correct that. For a triplet, the neighboring group must have two protons. So, maybe a CH2 group next to a CH(CH3)2 or something else.

Wait, another approach: The triplet at 0.9 ppm is 6H. That's two CH3 groups. Because each CH3 has 3H, so 6H would be two CH3 groups. And they are next to a CH2 group because the splitting is a triplet. The quartet at 1.3 ppm is 4H. Quartet means each of those protons is next to a CH2 with two protons. Wait, so maybe it's a CH2 group next to another CH2. Because a quartet would come from being next to a CH2 with two protons.

Let me think about a structure where we have two CH3 groups attached to a CH2 which is next to another CH2. So perhaps something like (CH3)2CHCH2CH2...? No, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclopropane ring? No, that would have different splitting. Or perhaps it's a di-substituted cyclohexane?

Wait, another thought: Maybe compound A is a di-substituted cyclohexane where there are two methyl groups attached to adjacent carbons. Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it's a neopentyl group or something similar. Wait, neopentyl is (CH3)CCH2CH2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about splitting
