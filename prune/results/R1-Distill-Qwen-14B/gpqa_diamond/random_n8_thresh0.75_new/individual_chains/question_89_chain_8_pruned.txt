Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question starts with a compound called 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so it's a very rigid molecule. The starting material has two bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane framework.

Heating this with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination or maybe substitution. Since it's dibromide and in KOH, probably an E2 elimination would occur. Wait, but adamantane is a bulky structure. Maybe it's a double elimination. Oh, wait, the product is a light yellow solid. Wait, what's the product when a dibromide reacts with KOH? If it's vicinal dihalide (like 1,2-dibromo), elimination would form an alkene. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a diegeminal dihalide, or maybe it's on adjacent carbons? No, wait, adamantane's structure is such that 1 and 3 are across from each other, so maybe they're not adjacent. Wait, no, in adamantane, the structure is like a diamond, so maybe 1 and 3 are on adjacent carbons? Or perhaps they are separated. Wait, maybe I should think about the structure.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane probably has two bromines on two different but adjacent carbons in the diamondoid structure. When KOH is used, it's likely a dehydrohalogenation reaction. If two bromines are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond. So the product would be an adamantane with a double bond. Wait, but adamantane is already a fully saturated structure. Oh wait no, no, wait, adamantane doesn't have double bonds; it's a polycyclic structure with all single bonds. So if you have 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps it's a diegeminal dihalide? Or maybe the bromines are on bridgehead positions.

Wait, I'm not exactly sure about the structure, but let's proceed. The product after KOH is a light yellow solid. Let me think about the IR data. The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O). So the product after KOH is likely an epoxide or a ket
