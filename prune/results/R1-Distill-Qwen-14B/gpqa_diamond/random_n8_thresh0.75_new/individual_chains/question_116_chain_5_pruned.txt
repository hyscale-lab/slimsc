Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully and try to figure out each step.

The question starts by talking about Compound A, which has a proton NMR spectrum with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet suggests each proton has two neighboring protons, and a quartet means each has three neighbors.

Wait, but wait. The triplet is 6H and quartet is 4H. Oh, maybe it's about methyl groups (CH3) next to CH2 groups. Let me think. If the triplet is 6H, that might be two CH3 groups each next to a CH2. So maybe like (CH2CH3)2 something. Or perhaps it's a more complex structure, but wait, if the triplet is for 6H, maybe two equivalent CH3 groups. For example, if you have a structure like (CH2CH3)2CH-something. Or perhaps it's a diethyl group, but that might not fit.

Wait, another possibility: the triplet at 0.9 ppm is typically for methyl groups adjacent to a CH2, like in an ethyl group. So maybe the structure is something like (CH2CH3)2CH-... Maybe it's 2,2-dimethylpropane or something else, but the integration doesn't fit. Wait, 6H as a tripletâ€”perhaps two CH3 groups each attached to a CH2 that's next to another CH2.

Wait, if I think of a diethyl group. Diethyl ether, for example, but that's an ether. Or maybe it's a structure where two ethyl groups are attached to a central atom. Like (CH2CH2)2 something. But wait, the quartet is 4H, so that would be the CH2 groups adjacent to the CH3.

So putting this together: the triplet (6H) is two CH3 groups each attached to a CH2. The quartet (4H) would be the two CH2 groups adjacent to the CH3. So the structure could be CH2CH2CH(CH2CH3)2? No, that doesn't sound right. Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH2CH3)2CHCH2... Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: the splitting pattern. The triplet
