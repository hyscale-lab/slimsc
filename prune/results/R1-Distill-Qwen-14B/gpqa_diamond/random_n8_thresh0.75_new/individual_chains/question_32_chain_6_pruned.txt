Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy of a nucleus moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says that the nucleus is X, which is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So the standard lithium has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that would make it lithium-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

But wait, for the purpose of calculating the energy, I think I need the rest mass energy of the nucleus. Or maybe just the rest mass in terms of energy? Or perhaps the kinetic energy? Hmm. Wait, no, wait. The question is about the energy of the RHIC, which accelerates heavy ions. So I think they're asking for the total energy, which would include both rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, no, wait. In particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, it's usually the kinetic energy each beam has. Or wait, sometimes it's the total energy, but I think in this context, they probably mean the kinetic energy. But I'm not so sure. Hmm.

Wait, the formula I remember for relativistic energy is gamma times m c squared. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity. So if the speed is 0.96c, I can calculate gamma first.

Gamma is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So let's compute that. V is 0.96c, so v²/c² is (0.96)^2 which is 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me check that calculation again. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. 1 minus that is 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28
