Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand everything.

The problem says that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so those are the standard basis states for spin-½ particles.

The task is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements Aij where Aij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. So this operator is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere.

Additionally, I need to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.

First, I think I need to normalize the state |alpha>. Because it's given as proportional, which means I have to figure out the normalization constant.

The state is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let's denote |up> as |0> and |down> as |1> for simplicity. So |alpha> = (1+i)|0> + (2 - i)|1>.

To normalize, I'll compute the inner product of |alpha> with itself. The normalization factor will be the inverse square root of this inner product.

The inner product <alpha|alpha> is (1-i)(2+i) + (2+i)(1-i). Wait, wait, no. Wait, let me think. The state is |alpha> = a|0> + b|1>, where a=1+i and b=2 - i.

The inner product is a* a + b* b, because the basis states are orthonormal. So:

a = 1 + i → a* = 1 - i
b = 2 - i → b* = 2 + i

So |a|² is (1 - i)(1 + i) = 1 + 1 = 2.

|b|² is (2 + i)(2 - i) = 4 +1 =5.

Wait, no, wait: (2 + i)(2 -i) is 2² - (i)² = 4 - (-1) = 5. Right.

So the inner product is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(
