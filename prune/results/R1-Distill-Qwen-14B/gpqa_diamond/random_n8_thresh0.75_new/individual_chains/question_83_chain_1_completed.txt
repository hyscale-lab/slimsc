Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with titration problems, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

Alright, the problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ (which is 20 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we're titrating that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I can check my work against them as I go.

First, let me think about what's happening here. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When you titrate a weak acid with a strong base, you form the acetate ion, which is the conjugate base of acetic acid. 

Wait, but before that, I need to figure out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. So the initial solution is 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, we add 20 mL of water. So the total volume becomes 40 mL, right?

The dilution equation is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 is (0.05 M * 20 mL) / 40 mL. Let me calculate that. 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M. Got it.

Now, when we titrate this with NaOH, the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O. 

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. The NaOH is 0.1 M. To find the equivalence point, I'll need to calculate how much NaOH is needed to react with all the acetic acid.

Wait, what's the initial moles of acetic acid? The initial concentration is 0.025 M in 0.04 L (since 40 mL is 0.04 L). Moles = Molarity * Volume in liters. So 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles. 

So, moles of NaOH needed at equivalence point would be the same as moles of acetic acid, because it's a 1:1 reaction. So moles NaOH = 0.001 mol. 

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL. So at equivalence, 10 mL NaOH has been added.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume would be 2.5 mL NaOH added. So before equivalence, we have a buffer solution.

So to find the pH at 25% titration, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Because at that point, not all the acetic acid has been neutralized, so we'll have some acetic acid and some acetate ions.

Let me think, the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 moles. At 25% titration, 25% of that has reacted. So moles reacted = 0.001 * 0.25 = 0.00025 moles. So the moles of acetic acid left would be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And moles of acetate formed would be 0.00025 moles.

But wait, the solution's volume now is the initial acetic acid solution (40 mL) plus the NaOH added. At 25% titration, 2.5 mL NaOH has been added. So total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 mL, which is 0.0425 L. 

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of concentrations. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the ratio of acetate to acetic acid. Because in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, I can use the ratio of the concentrations, which depends on the moles since the volume is same for both.

So the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). 

The pKa is given by the Ka of acetic acid, which is 1.85e-5. So pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait, no, pKa = -log(Ka). So let me calculate that. Let me think: log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5). Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

At 25% titration, the ratio [A-]/[HA] is (moles of A-)/(moles of HA). Which is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. So log(1/3) is approximately -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 + (-0.477) = about 4.256. Hmm, so around 4.26. Looking at the options, option A starts with 4.26, option D is 4.57, etc.

But wait, wait. Let me double-check. Because when you add NaOH, it reacts with the acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio. So for every mole of NaOH added, one mole of acetic acid is neutralized, producing acetate.

So, at 25% of the required NaOH (which is 10 mL), 2.5 mL is added. So moles NaOH added is 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. So, yes, that's 25% of 0.001 mol.

So, moles HA (acetic acid) left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075.

Moles A- (acetate): 0.00025.

So the ratio is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. So log(1/3) is about -0.477. So pH is pKa + (-0.477) → 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256, which is approximately 4.26. So that's the first pH value.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water.

The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution. So, we'll need to calculate the pH of a solution of sodium acetate.

First, find the concentration of acetate ions. The total volume at equivalence point is initial acetic acid solution (40 mL) plus the NaOH added (10 mL), so 50 mL total, which is 0.05 L.

Moles of acetate: 0.001 mol (since all the acetic acid has reacted). So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Now, the concentration of OH- can be found using the Kb. Since Kb is very small, the change x will be negligible, so we can approximate:

Kb ≈ [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ x^2 / (0.02) → x^2 = Kb * 0.02 → x^2 = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6 M.

So [OH^-] is approximately 3.29e-6 M. Then, pOH is -log(3.29e-6) → log(3.29) is about 0.517, so 5.483. So pOH ≈ 5.483 → pH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says 8.52 for the equivalence point. So that would fit. The first part was about 4.26.

So the two pH values would be approximately 4.26 and 8.52. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26; 8.52. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think about the equivalence point again. Because sometimes, when you have a weak acid and strong base, the pH at equivalence is determined by the hydrolysis of the conjugate base. But maybe I should check if the assumption that x is negligible is correct.

So, Kb = 5.405e-10. The initial concentration is 0.02 M. So, the approximation assumes that x is much smaller than 0.02. Let's see, if Kb is 5.4e-10, then x^2 = 5.4e-10 * 0.02 = 1.08e-11 → x = ~3.28e-6. So 3.28e-6 is much less than 0.02 (which is 2e-2), so the approximation holds.

So the equivalence point pH is indeed around 8.52.

But wait, let me check the calculations again. Because another approach is to calculate the pH directly using the formula for a weak base. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the pH of a salt solution.

Yes, the formula for the pH of a salt of a weak acid and strong base is given by:

pH = pKa + ½ (pKa - pKw) )

Wait, no, another approach is to use the formula pH = (pKa + pKw - pKb)/2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the hydrolysis.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the equation:

[OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C) → which is what I did. So perhaps that's correct. 

So, the pH at equivalence is about 8.52, and at 25% titration, it's about 4.26. So the correct option would be option A.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option A: 4.26;8.52 → which matches.

But let me check the other options. Option D is 4.57;6.92. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So I think option A is correct. 

Wait, but wait another thought. Did I correctly calculate the initial dilution?

Wait, initial acetic acid solution is 20 mL of 0.05 M. So moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. When diluted to 40 mL (0.04 L), concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That's correct. Then, when titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point is when 0.001 mol NaOH is added, which is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L → 10 mL. So yes, the equivalence point is at 10 mL NaOH.

So, at 25% titration, 2.5 mL NaOH is added. Moles NaOH: 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 mol. So HA is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. A- is 0.00025 mol. The ratio [A-]/[HA] is (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3. So pH = pKa + log(1/3) → 4.733 + (-0.477) = 4.256 → 4.26. That's correct.

So the pH at 25% is 4.26, equivalence is 8.52. So option A is the correct choice.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial solution is 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and 20.00 cm³ of water is added, making the total volume 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). Using the dilution equation \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \), the new concentration is:

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1 \cdot V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 20}{40} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we determine the moles of acetic acid at this concentration:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = M \cdot V = 0.025 \cdot 0.04 = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized by NaOH, forming acetate ions. The moles of NaOH required are equal to the moles of acetic acid (1:1 reaction). Since the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume of NaOH needed is:

\[
V = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{mL}.
\]

Thus, the equivalence point is reached when 10 mL of NaOH is added. At this point, the solution contains 0.001 mol of acetate ions in a total volume of 50.00 cm³ (40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³). The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{Acetate}] = \frac{\text{Moles of acetate}}{\text{Volume in liters}} = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water, and the pH is determined using the \( K_b \) of acetate, where \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10} \). The hydrolysis reaction is:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

Using the approximation for weak bases, the concentration of \( \text{OH}^- \) is:

\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot [\text{Acetate}]} = \sqrt{5.405 \times 10^{-10} \cdot 0.02} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log{[\text{OH}^-]} = -\log{(3.29 \times 10^{-6})} \approx 5.48.
\]

The pH at the equivalence point is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence volume (2.5 mL of NaOH) has been added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \cdot 0.0025 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This reacts with 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid (HA)} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]

and forming:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate (A^-)} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume is now 42.5 mL (40.00 cm³ + 2.5 mL). The concentrations of HA and A⁻ are:

\[
[\text{HA}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.0059 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log{\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}} = 4.73 + \log{\frac{0.0059}{0.0176}}.
\]

\[
\log{\frac{0.0059}{0.0176}} = \log{(0.333)} \approx -0.477.
\]

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.26.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**A) 4.26; 8.52.**
