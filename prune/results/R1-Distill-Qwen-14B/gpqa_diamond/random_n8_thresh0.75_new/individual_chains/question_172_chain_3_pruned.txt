Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the photosphere is the layer of a star where light is emitted, right? And the question is about iron atoms in the photospheres of two stars, star_1 and star_2. It says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to those in star_2. Oh wait, and the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. 

The question is asking which equation correctly relates the effective temperatures T1 and T2 of the stars, assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). Okay, LTE means that the gas in the photosphere is in thermal equilibrium with the radiation field, so the Boltzmann distribution applies here.

So, the key here is the Boltzmann distribution equation. From what I recall, the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy states to the temperature. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature.

In this question, it's given that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. Wait, so I think that means the population of a higher energy level (say level 2) relative to a lower one (level 1) is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. Or maybe it's the other way around? Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, for star_1, the population of the excited state is twice that of star_2's excited state in the same energy level. Or perhaps the ratio between the two levels is twice as high in star_1 as in star_2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it. Let's say that for each star, the ratio n2/n1 is given by their respective temperatures.

So for star_1: n2_1/n1_1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - ΔE/(k*T1) )
For star_2: n2_2/n1_2 = (g2/g1) * exp( - ΔE/(k*T2) )

But the
