Okay, so I've got this question here about a genetic construct and why a fluorescent signal isn't showing up. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the scenario is that a researcher has created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two genes in one vector, right? So, in this case, the ligand and the receptor are both in the same vector.

The vector structure is described as follows: The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, and it's fused to mCherry. After the ligand, there's a stop cassette with loxP sites. Then comes the receptor ORF, which is under the IRES regulatory element. The receptor is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus, and there's another stop cassette here with lox2272 sites.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about how this works. So, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. The CBA promoter is a strong promoter, so it should drive the expression of the ligand. The receptor is after an IRES, which I think is a way to allow internal ribosome entry, so the receptor can be expressed as a separate protein without a stop in between. But wait, bicistronic constructs often use IRES or 2A peptide to allow two proteins to be expressed from a single mRNA. So in this case, the IRES comes after the receptor ORF, but the ligand is first, right?

Wait, no. Let me read again. The ligand ORF is at the 5' position, followed by a stop in a loxP cassette. Then comes the receptor ORF, which is under the IRES. Hmm, maybe the IRES is for the receptor, allowing it to be expressed after the ligand. Or perhaps the IRES is between the two ORFs?

Wait, wait. Bicistronic vectors often have two ORFs in one transcript, with a way to separate them. So, the promoter drives the first ORF (ligand), which ends with a stop. Then, perhaps an IRES allows the ribosome to switch and translate the second ORF (receptor), without the stop interfering. Or maybe the IRES is in the middle, allowing both proteins to be expressed from the same mRNA.

Wait, the question says the ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. Then a stop
