Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try my best.

The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. Alright, so I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the expectation values. The formula is ΔP_z = sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ). So I need to find both <P_z> and <P_z²>.

Wait, but wait a second. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x. So that means when you measure P_x, the outcome is definite. But since P_x and P_z don't commute (they're different components of angular momentum or something similar?), the uncertainty in P_z might be significant.

The state given is a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So this is the state vector, probably expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, as the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z.

So first, I need to compute the expectation value of P_z. The expectation value <P_z> is given by the state vector's conjugate transpose multiplied by P_z matrix multiplied by the state vector.

Let me write down the state vector. Let's call it |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T.

Wait, the state is given as a column vector, so when I take the conjugate transpose (bra), it would be a row vector with the complex conjugates. But looking at the components, all the elements are real, so the conjugate transpose is just the transpose.

So, the first step is to compute <P_z> = <ψ| P_z |ψ>.

Let me write down the P_z matrix again. It's a 3x3 matrix:

Row 1: [ ħ, 0, 0 ]
Row 2: [ 0, 0, 0 ]
Row 3: [ 0, 0, -ħ ]

So, it's a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ along the diagonal.

So, to compute <P_z>, I can perform the matrix multiplication.

Let me compute each term step by step.

The state vector is:
