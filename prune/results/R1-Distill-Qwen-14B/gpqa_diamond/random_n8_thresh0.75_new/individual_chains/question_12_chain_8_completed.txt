Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Let me see what I remember from my studies.

The problem states: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are four possible pairs of kinetic energies for the products.

Hmm, I think this is a particle physics problem involving conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So, the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum. That makes sense.

So, let's outline what I know:

1. The pion is initially at rest. So, its initial momentum is zero.
2. The decay products are a muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu).
3. The muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV, and the pion is 139.6 MeV. The neutrino is nearly massless, so its rest mass is approximately zero. I remember that neutrinos have very little mass, so for this problem, I can consider the neutrino's mass as zero.

The total energy before the decay is just the rest energy of the pion. So, the energy after decay must equal that. The initial energy is m_pi c², which is 139.6 MeV. But wait, the mass of the muon is 105.7 MeV. So, the pion's mass is larger than the muon's, which means there's energy left for kinetic energy of the products.

Since the pion is at rest, its initial momentum is zero. So, the total momentum after decay must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, p_mu = -p_nu. But since the neutrino's mass is zero, its momentum is just p_nu = E_nu / c, because for massless particles, E = pc.

Wait, but for particles with mass, the energy is related to momentum by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². For the neutrino, m is zero, so E_nu = pc.

So, let's denote p as the magnitude of the muon's momentum. Then the neutrino's momentum is also p, but in the opposite direction. So, the total momentum cancels out.

Now, the total energy after decay is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy is sqrt((p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2) divided by c²? Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, the total energy of a particle is given by E = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2 ). So, the muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt(p² c² + m_mu² c^4 ) / c²? No, that's not right. Wait, no, the units might be a bit confusing here. Let me get this right.

Actually, E in MeV is E = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2 ). But since m is given in MeV/c², perhaps. Let me think in terms of units.

The rest energy of muon is m_mu c² = 105.7 MeV. So, E_mu = sqrt( p² c^4 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) * c²? Hmm, perhaps I should express everything in units where c=1, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use natural units where c=1, so energy and mass have the same units, and momentum has units of MeV/c or something.

Wait, maybe I should set c=1 for simplicity, but I have to remember that in the equations, momentum p and energy E are related as E² = p² + m². So, for the muon, E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²), where m_mu is 105.7 MeV.

The neutrino's energy E_nu is just p, since m_nu is zero (so E_nu = p).

The total energy before decay is m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV. Since the pion is at rest, its energy is purely its rest energy, so 139.6 MeV.

So, the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6 MeV.

That's the equation we can solve for p. Let's write it down:

sqrt( p² + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6

Let me let x = p, so:

sqrt(x² + 105.7²) + x = 139.6

I can rearrange this equation.

sqrt(x² + 105.7²) = 139.6 - x

Now, square both sides:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2

Expanding the right side:

(139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 * x + x²

So,

x² + 105.7² = 139.6² - 2 * 139.6 x + x²

The x² terms cancel out on both sides:

105.7² = 139.6² - 2 * 139.6 x

Now, compute 105.7 squared and 139.6 squared.

105.7²:

Let me calculate 100^2 is 10,000, 5.7^2 is about 32.49, and 2 * 100 *5.7 = 1140. So, (100+5.7)^2 is 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49 → approximately 11172.49 MeV².

139.6 squared: Let me compute 140^2 is 19600. So 139.6 is 140 - 0.4. So, (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

So,

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2 * 139.6 * x

Let me compute 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

So,

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x

Rearranging,

279.2 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49

Compute 19488.16 minus 11172.49:

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67

So,

x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let's compute that.

Hmm, 279.2 times 30 is approximately 8376. So 30 * 279.2 = 8376. So 8315.67 is just a bit less than that. 30 * 279.2 is 8376, which is 60.33 more than 8315.67. So 8315.67 is 30 - (60.33/279.2), which is approximately 30 - 0.216 ≈ 29.784.

Wait, wait, let me compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Let me write it as:

279.2 * x = 8315.67 → x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 

Let me do this division more accurately.

279.2 * 29 = 8096.8.

Because 279.2 * 30 = 8376, so 279.2 * 29 = 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8.

Subtract 8096.8 from 8315.67: 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.

Now, 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ approximately 0.782. So, x ≈ 29.782.

So, p ≈ 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but let me double-check these calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, 105.7 squared is 11172.49, correct. 139.6 squared is 19488.16, correct.

So, 19488.16 minus 11172.49 is 8315.67.

Then, 8315.67 divided by 279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 * 29.78.

But perhaps a better way is to compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Another approach: 279.2 × 29 = 8096.8. Remaining is 8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87. So, 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.782.

So, x ≈ 29.78 MeV/c.

So, p ≈ 29.78 MeV/c.

Now, the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p = 29.78 MeV.

The muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.78 squared: approx 29.78^2 = (30 - 0.22)^2 ≈ 30² - 2 *30 *0.22 + 0.22² = 900 - 13.2 + 0.0484 ≈ 886.8484.

105.7 squared is 11172.49.

So, E_mu = sqrt(886.8484 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.3384) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Wait, but wait. Because 109.81 squared is about 12059. So that's correct.

But wait, the sum of E_mu and E_nu is 109.81 + 29.78 ≈ 139.59 MeV, which is close to 139.6, so that checks out.

Now, the kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy.

So, for the muon, KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu c². Because the rest energy is m_mu c², which is 105.7 MeV.

So, KE_mu = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

The neutrino's KE is simply its energy because its rest mass is zero. So, KE_nu = E_nu = 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The muon's kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu c², which is 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

The neutrino's kinetic energy is E_nu, which is 29.78 MeV.

So, the options are pairs (mu KE, nu KE). Let's look.

Options:

A) 2.84, 26.8 → No, because our calculation is 4.11 and 29.78.

B)7.2, 32.8 → No, our numbers are lower.

C)3.52, 20.8 → No.

D)4.12, 29.8 → Very close to our 4.11 and 29.78.

So, the correct answer should be D.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes when you do this quickly, you might make an error.

Another way: After solving x = p ≈ 29.78 MeV/c.

Then, E_mu = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(886.8 + 11172.49) → sqrt(12059.29) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

So, KE_mu = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

KE_nu = 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, which matches closely.

So the correct answer is D.


To determine the kinetic energy of the decay products in the reaction:

\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu,
\]

we use the conservation of energy and momentum. The pion (\(\pi^+\)) is initially at rest, so its total energy is its rest energy, \(E_{\pi} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\). After the decay, the total energy is shared between the muon (\(\mu^+\)) and the neutrino (\(\nu\)).

### Key Equations:
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   \[
   E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}.
   \]
   Here, \(E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2}\) (total energy of the muon) and \(E_{\nu} = p\) (energy of the neutrino, since its rest mass is negligible).

2. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   Since the pion is at rest, the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:  
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu} = p.
   \]

### Solving for \(p\):
From energy conservation:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p = m_{\pi}.
\]
Let \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\). Rearranging:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = m_{\pi} - p.
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = (m_{\pi} - p)^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = m_{\pi}^2 - 2 m_{\pi} p + p^2.
\]
Canceling \(p^2\):
\[
m_{\mu}^2 = m_{\pi}^2 - 2 m_{\pi} p.
\]
Solving for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{m_{\pi}^2 - m_{\mu}^2}{2 m_{\pi}}.
\]

### Substituting Values:
1. Compute \(m_{\pi}^2\) and \(m_{\mu}^2\):  
   \[
   m_{\pi}^2 = 139.6^2 = 19488.16 \, \text{MeV}^2, \quad m_{\mu}^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \, \text{MeV}^2.
   \]
2. Compute \(p\):  
   \[
   p = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{2 \times 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c.
   \]

### Energy of the Muon and Neutrino:
1. **Neutrino Energy**:  
   Since \(E_{\nu} = p\),  
   \[
   E_{\nu} = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Muon Energy**:  
   Using \(E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2}\):  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2} = \sqrt{886.8 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.29} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Kinetic Energy:
1. **Muon Kinetic Energy**:  
   \[
   KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} c^2 = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Neutrino Kinetic Energy**:  
   Since the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy equals its total energy:  
   \[
   KE_{\nu} = E_{\nu} = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Matching with Options:
The closest match to the calculated values (\(KE_{\mu} \approx 4.11 \, \text{MeV}, KE_{\nu} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}\)) is:

**Option D: \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}, 29.8 \, \text{MeV}\).**
