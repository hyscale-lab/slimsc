Okay, so I've got this question about stars and parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think it through. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, and we need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance, right? The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh wait, no, wait. The formula I remember is that parallax (in parsecs) is 1 divided by distance (in parsecs). So a star at 1 parsec has a parallax of 1 arcsec. If a star is twice as far, its parallax is 0.5, and so on. So as distance increases, parallax decreases.

Now, the problem is about how the number of stars per unit parallax interval changes with parallax. So if we look at a range of parallax values, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, their actual spatial distribution is uniform. That probably means that the number density of stars (number per volume) is constant.

Wait, but we're looking at it in terms of parallax. So I need to relate the number of stars in a given parallax interval to the actual distances, which would affect the volume they occupy.

Let me think about the volume in terms of distance. The volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr would be 4πd² dr. But wait, I'm trying to find the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx. Since plx is inversely proportional to distance (plx = 1/d), d = 1/plx.

So, if I have a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx, that corresponds to a range in distance from d to d + dr, where dr is the change in distance. Let's compute dr in terms of dplx.

Since plx = 1/d, taking differentials: dplx = -1/d² dr. Hmm, solving for dr: dr = -d² dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, distance decreases, but maybe we can ignore the sign for this purpose and just take the magnitude.

So the volume between plx and plx + dplx is the volume of a spherical shell at distance d (which is 1/plx) with thickness dr = d² dplx. The volume is 4π (d)^2 dr. Substituting d = 1/plx, and dr = (1/plx)^2 dplx (since dr = d² dplx, because d =1/plx), wait, no, wait: from earlier, d =1/plx, so dr = -(1/(plx))² * dplx. So dr = -(d^2) dplx.

But since I'm calculating the volume between d and d + dr, which would correspond to plx and plx - dplx (because plx decreases as d increases). Wait, maybe I should think in terms of infinitesimal intervals. Let me think again.

The number of stars in a volume element dV at distance d is proportional to dV, since the stars are uniformly distributed. So N = n * dV, where n is the number density (constant).

dV is the volume of a spherical shell of radius d and thickness dr. So
