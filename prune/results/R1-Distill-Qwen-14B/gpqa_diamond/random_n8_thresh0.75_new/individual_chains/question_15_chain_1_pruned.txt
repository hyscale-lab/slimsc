Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit, so the researchers can observe it. Hmm, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on several factors. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says both planets are Earth-like, detected by the RV method, so their minimum masses are known. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 orbits much faster. Oh wait, but what about the stars they orbit?

The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radii. Interesting, so even though the mass is higher, the radius is the same. I think the radius plays a big role in transit probability because a larger star makes the transit less likely if the planet's orbit isn't aligned edge-on.

The transit probability formula I remember is something like the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius, but maybe it's more precise than that. Wait, the probability is approximately (R_star / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 + (R_star/a)^2))) ), but I might be mixing it up. Alternatively, I've heard that the probability is roughly (R_* / a) where R_* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis.

Wait, more accurately, the probability P is about (R_*/a) * (1/(sqrt(1 + (R_*/a)^2))) ), but another source I recall says it's approximately (R_*/a), especially when a is much larger than R_*, which is usually the case. So for small R_*/a, P ≈ R_*/a.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is given by (R_star + R_planet)/(a) * something, but since Earth is small compared to stars, R_planet is negligible. So the main factor is R_star / a.

Wait, but let me get the exact formula. I think the transit probability for a random inclination is P ≈ (R_star / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 + (R_star/a)^2)) ). Which can be rewritten as P ≈ (R_*^2 / (a^2 + R_*^2))^(1/2) * (R_*/a) ) / [something]. Wait, maybe I should think about the formula again.

Alternatively, the formula for the probability
