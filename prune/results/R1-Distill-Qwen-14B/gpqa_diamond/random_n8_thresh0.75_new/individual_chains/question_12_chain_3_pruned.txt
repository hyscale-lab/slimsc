Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Let me read it again.

The reaction is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino. The Pi(+) is stationary. The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV, mu is 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D, each with two numbers, presumably the KEs of the muon and neutrino.

Hmm, right. So this is a decay problem, specifically a pion decay. I remember that in such cases, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is initially at rest, the total momentum after the decay should be zero because the initial momentum is zero.

Wait, wait. Let me think about conservation of momentum here. Since the pion is stationary, the total initial momentum is zero. So the final momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal and opposite. But neutrinos are massless in these approximations, right? Or wait, are they? Because in reality, neutrinos have very small mass, but sometimes in problems like this, they're treated as massless to simplify things. Oh wait, the problem here doesn't mention the neutrino's mass, so I think I can assume it's massless.

So, the muon has mass m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c², I think. And the neutrino is massless (m_nu = 0). So the pion's mass is m_pi = 139.6 MeV/c².

Since the pion is at rest, the total energy before decay is simply its rest energy: E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy will be the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino. Energy is conserved, so E_initial = E_mu + E_nu.

But the neutrino is massless, so its energy E_nu is just its momentum times c. Similarly, the muon's energy is its kinetic energy plus its rest energy. Wait, no, the total energy of the muon is its rest mass energy plus its kinetic energy. Hmm, but wait, the muon's energy is E_mu = K_mu + m_mu c².
