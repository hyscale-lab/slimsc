Okay, so I've got this physics problem about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question gives me some phase shifts: δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. The electrons are 50 MeV, but I don't think the energy is directly relevant for this calculation. The task is to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Oh wait, right, the scattering amplitude's imaginary part relates to the cross-section or something like that.

I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all the angular momentum states, each contributing a term with a phase shift. The formula is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l), where k is the wave number. But wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, I think for each partial wave, the amplitude has terms involving the phase shifts.

Wait, another approach: the total scattering cross-section is the sum over l of (something involving the phase shifts). But that's for the cross-section. But the problem is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. Hmm.

Oh right, the scattering amplitude f has real and imaginary parts. The imaginary part is particularly important because it relates to the inelastic processes, but in elastic scattering, maybe it still contributes. Wait, in the case of elastic scattering, the imaginary part of the amplitude might be zero except for contributions from the phase shifts? Or maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no. Let me think. The scattering amplitude f is given by:

f(θ) = 16π² (sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l)) ) / (k l (l+1) ) ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of partial waves is:

f(s, θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1)/(k) ) ( e^{i δ_l} sin( lθ + δ_l ) )

Where k is the wave number, and δ_l are the phase shifts. But wait, I'm not exactly sure about the exact expression. Alternatively, maybe the expression is f(θ) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l). Assuming that, then the imaginary part of f(θ) would be the imaginary part of each term in the sum.

But wait, the question asks specifically about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. Along the incident beam direction, that's θ=0 degrees. So we're evaluating f(0), and taking its imaginary part.

So let's plug θ=0 into the formula. The sine term becomes sin(l*0 + δ_l) = sin(δ_l). So each term in the sum is (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l) / k, because f(θ) is (1/k) multiplied by the sum.

Wait, let me write this properly. f(θ) = (1/k) * sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l). When θ=0, sin(lθ+δ_l) = sin(δ_l). So f(0) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l).

But e^{i δ} is cos δ + i sin δ. So e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l = [cos δ_l + i sin δ_l] * sin δ_l = cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l.

So the imaginary part of f(0) would be (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ sin² δ_l ].

So Im(f(0)) = (1/k) * sum_{l} (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

But then, what is k? k is the wave number. The electrons are 50 MeV, so I need to compute k. Hmm.

Wait, the electron mass is m_e. The relativistic energy is given. The energy E is 50 MeV. But to find the wave number, we have to relate it via the relativistic energy-momentum relation.

The energy of a relativistic particle is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). Then, the momentum p is sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c^2. Wait, no: E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 → p = sqrt( E² - (m c²)² ) / c² ?

Wait, no, more accurately, p = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) / (c^2) * c? Wait, maybe I should better write the equation correctly.

Wait, E = γ m c², and p = γ m v, where v is the velocity. Alternatively, for a high-energy particle, E ≈ pc, but since 50 MeV is a lot, but electrons have a rest mass of about 0.511 MeV, so 50 MeV is much larger, so perhaps we can approximate E ≈ pc. But better to compute it precisely.

So, let's compute p.

E = 50 MeV.

m c² = 0.511 MeV.

So, E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2 → (p c)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2.

So p c = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) MeV.

Since 50 is much larger than 0.511, (50)^2 ≈ 2500, (0.511)^2 ≈ 0.261.

So (p c)^2 ≈ 2500 - 0.261 ≈ 2499.739 → p c ≈ sqrt(2499.739) ≈ 49.9978 MeV.

Wait, more accurately, sqrt(2499.739) is approximately 49.9978, because 50²=2500, and 49.9978²≈ (50 - 0.0022)² ≈ 2500 - 2 *50*0.0022 + (0.0022)^2 ≈ 2500 - 0.22 + 0.00000484≈ ~2499.78, which is a bit higher than 2499.739. So perhaps a better approach is to compute it.

But maybe it's easier to just note that (E=50 MeV) is much larger than m c², so p c ≈ E, so p ≈ E/(c) → but wait, no, p = E/(c^2) * v, but maybe in units where c=1, it's E = p + m.

Alternatively, perhaps for simplicity, in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, then E = sqrt( p² + m² ), and then k = p / (ħ).

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe I should use the formula for the wave number in terms of energy.

The wave number k is given by k = p / ħ, where p is the momentum. But since we're dealing with units where c=1, and E = sqrt( p² c^4 + m² c^4 ) / c² → I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should switch to using natural units where c=1 and ħ=1. Then, the energy E is in MeV, the mass m is also in MeV/c², but with c=1, m is in MeV. So for an electron, m=0.511 MeV.

So in natural units, E² = p² + m² → p = sqrt(E² - m
