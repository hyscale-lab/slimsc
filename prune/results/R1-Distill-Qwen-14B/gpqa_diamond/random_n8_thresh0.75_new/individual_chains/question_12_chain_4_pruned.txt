Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

The question states that a Pi(+) is stationary and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The rest mass of the pion is 139.6 MeV, and the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV. They're asking for the kinetic energy of the product particles, which are the muon and the neutrino. The options are A, B, C, D with different pairs of energies.

Wait, neutrinos are tricky because they're leptons but are they considered massless here? I think in many problems, especially when dealing with reactions at high energies but not extreme, the neutrino's rest mass is considered negligible. So, I'll proceed under that assumption.

Okay, so the pion is at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the total momentum must still be zero because momentum is conserved. That means the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. So, their magnitudes of momentum should be the same.

Let me think about energy conservation as well. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. Since the neutrino is massless, its energy is equal to its momentum (E = |p|c, but since we're in units where c=1, E = p). The muon, on the other hand, has rest mass, so its energy is sqrt(p²c^4 + m²c^4), again, in units where c=1, it's sqrt(p² + m²).

So, setting up equations. Let me denote the momentum of the muon as p, then the neutrino's momentum is -p (same magnitude and opposite direction). So their energies are E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²) and E_nu = p. The total energy is E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

But wait, there's another equation. The total energy is also the sum of the rest mass energies plus their kinetic energies. But maybe it's easier to write the equation as:

E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c²

And since the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero, so the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta, hence same magnitude p.

So,

sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p = m_pi

Let me plug in the numbers. m_pi is 139.6 MeV, m_mu is 105.7 MeV.

So,

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Hmm, this looks like an equation I can solve for p.

Let me denote x = p for simplicity.

sqrt(x^2 + (105.7)^2) + x = 139.6

Let me rearrange this:

sqrt(x^2 + 105.7^2) = 1
