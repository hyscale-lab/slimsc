Okay, so I've got this question about a transmission electron microscope and the mean free path of gas molecules. Let me try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that the mean free path (MFP) of gas molecules is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. It's calculated using the formula λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2)*π*d^2*p), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the collision diameter, and p is the pressure. Alternatively, I've also heard it expressed as λ = (V * T) / (sqrt(2)*π*n*d²), where V is volume and n is number density. Or maybe another way using pressure, since pressure is related to n. So, yeah, I think λ is inversely proportional to pressure and directly proportional to temperature.

In the scenario, Mike creates an ultra-high vacuum with a pressure less than 1e-9 Torr. He measures the mean free path as λ1. But when he turns on the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes to λ2, even though the temperature is the same. So what's causing this change?

Wait, when the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving through the sample compartment. I remember that high-energy electrons can cause various effects in the surrounding environment. Oh right, when the electrons interact with the gas molecules, they can either scatter off them or cause other effects like ionization.

So, if the electron beam is on, the gas molecules in the vacuum chamber might get hit by these electrons. Each time an electron scatters off a gas molecule, that's an additional collision for the gas molecules. So the effective number of collisions increases because the MFP depends on how often the gas molecules collide with each other and with other objects, like the electron beam.

Wait a second, the MFP depends on the number density of the gas. Lower pressure (higher vacuum) gives a higher MFP because the gas molecules don't collide as often. But when the electron beam is on, the electrons are another source of collisions for the gas molecules. So the gas molecules can collide not only with each other but also with the electrons. So the presence of the electron beam effectively increases the collision rate for the gas molecules.

Let me think about how that affects the MFP. The MFP is inversely proportional to the total collision rate. If there are more collisions (because of the electron beam), the MFP should decrease. Because if a molecule is colliding more often, it doesn't get as far before another collision.

So originally, without the electron beam, the MFP is λ1. With the beam on, the gas molecules collide more often, either with each other or with the electrons. So their mean free path becomes shorter. So λ2 should be less than λ1. Because the same gas in the same conditions (same pressure, same temp) but now more collisions due to the beam.

So the options are looking for what λ2 is compared to λ1. The options are A: λ2 >=1.22λ1 (so longer), B: same (which Mike thinks is a discrepancy), C: λ2 < λ1, D: λ1 < λ2 < 1.22λ1.

So based on my reasoning, λ2 should be less than λ1, which is option C.


The mean free path (MFP) of gas molecules is the average distance they travel between collisions. It is influenced by factors such as pressure, temperature, and the presence of additional collision sources. In this scenario, Mike operates a high-resolution transmission electron microscope under ultra-high vacuum conditions (< 10^-9 Torr), where the MFP of gas molecules is initially measured as λ1. However, upon activating the electron beam, he observes a new MFP, λ2, despite the temperature remaining constant.

The electron beam introduces additional interactions with the gas molecules, such as scattering and ionization, which increase the collision rate. Since the MFP is inversely proportional to the collision rate, the increased collisions due to the electron beam reduce the effective MFP. This means that λ2, the MFP under the influence of the electron beam, is shorter than λ1. 

Analyzing the options:
- **A) λ2 >= 1.22λ1**: This implies a longer MFP, which contradicts the observed decrease in MFP due to increased collisions.
- **B) λ2 = λ1**: This suggests no change in MFP, which does not align with the increased collision rate caused by the electron beam.
- **C) λ2 < λ1**: This correctly reflects the shorter MFP due to the additional collisions introduced by the electron beam.
- **D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22λ1**: This implies a slight increase in MFP, which is inconsistent with the observed decrease.

Thus, the correct conclusion is that λ2 is less than λ1. 

Answer: C
