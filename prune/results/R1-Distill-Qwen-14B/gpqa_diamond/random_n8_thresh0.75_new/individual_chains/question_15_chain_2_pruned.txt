Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the probability of them transiting their host stars. Hmm, I need to figure out which planet has a higher chance of transiting so the researchers can prioritize their observations. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on a few factors. I think the main factors are the size of the planet relative to the star and the size of the star's orbit relative to our line of sight. Oh wait, right, the transit probability formula. The probability (P) of a transit is approximately (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (a / sqrt(a² + d²)), but wait, maybe that's not exactly right. Or perhaps it's a simplified version where P ≈ (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1 / (sqrt(1 + (a)^2 / (d)^2))), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I recall that the transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s)² * [ (1 / (sqrt(1 + (a_p / d)^2 )) ) ] where d is the distance to the star, but since we're comparing two planets around the same star, maybe the distance d isn't a factor here. Wait, no, in this problem, the stars are different. Oh, but wait, the problem says both stars have the same radii. Oh right, same R_s for both host stars. So the R_p is the planet radius, which isn't given here, but wait wait, the question says both planets are Earth-like. So maybe their
