Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Lagrangian and figuring out the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. So this is some kind of interaction term in a quantum field theory. I think this might be a term involving fermions and maybe a gauge field, since F is the field strength tensor, like in electromagnetism or Yang-Mills theories.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I need to look at the dimensions of each part of the term. Remember, the Lagrangian has to be dimensionless in natural units (since it's integrated over spacetime, which has dimension 4 in 4D spacetime). So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

So let's break down each component:

- ψ̄ is the Dirac adjoint of ψ, which has the same dimension as ψ. For fermions, ψ has dimension (mass)^{3/2} because in 4D, the Dirac field has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ is also (mass)^{3/2}.

- σ_{μν} is a commutator of gamma matrices. The gamma matrices are dimensionless, so σ_{μν} is also dimensionless.

- ψ is the same as ψ̄, so it's (mass)^{3/2}.

- F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F_{μν} has dimension mass^2. Wait, because the field tensor is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, and A has dimension mass^{1}, so each derivative adds a mass dimension, so F is [∂][A] → [mass]^1 * [mass]^1 = mass^2.

Putting it all together: ψ̄ σ ψ F.

Each field contributes their dimensions. So ψ̄ is [mass]^{3/2}, sigma is 0, ψ is [mass]^{3/2}, and F is [mass]^2. So multiplying them together: (3/2 + 3/2 + 2) = 3 + 2 = 5. Wait, but the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So the total term is multiplied by κ, which has dimension [κ].

So the term is κ * [ψ̄ σ ψ F], which has dimension [κ] + 5. This must equal 4 because it's part of the Lagrangian. So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ]= -1.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the Lagrangian term is supposed to have dimension 4, the entire expression must. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So the product of the fields times κ must be dimension 4.

Wait, let me re-calculate. Let me list the dimensions again:

ψ̄: 3/2

σ_{μν}: 0 (because it's a commutator of gammas, which are dim 0)

ψ: 3/2

F^{μν}: 2

So the product of ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimensions: (3/2) + (3/2) + 2 = 3 + 2 =5. So κ must make this term have dimension 4. So the dimension of κ is 4 -5= -1. So [κ] = -1.

Wait, that's dimension negative one. Hmm. So that's the first part.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the dimension of the coupling constant. The general rule is that a coupling with dimension [mass]^d is renormalizable if d ≥ 0. Because it's allowed to have counterterms of the same dimension
