Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a sequence of reactions. I need to figure out which sequence would give the desired product with a high yield.

First, let me draw the structure of the target molecule. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has an ethoxy group (OEt), position 2 has a tert-butyl group, and position 3 has a nitro group (NO2). Wait, no, waitâ€”wait, the numbering might be different. Let me think: the IUPAC name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), and 3 (nitro). So the ring looks like:

Positions:
1: OEt
2: t-Bu
3: NO2

So, in a benzene ring with three substituents, each in adjacent positions? Wait, no, positions 1, 2, 3 are meta to each other? Let me imagine the benzene ring. Let's say position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is t-Bu, position 3 is nitro. So they are each adjacent, making a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring, but in a way that two substituents are ortho and the third is meta relative to the others. Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to think about their positions: the ethoxy is at position 1, the t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3. So the substituents are at positions 1,2,3 in a way that they are all adjacent in a row.

But wait, that can't be exactly right. Because benzene is a ring, positions 1, 2, and 3 would mean substituents are in a line, each adjacent. So the substituents are adjacent to each other in a meta arrangement? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in a meta arrangement. Wait, another approach: perhaps the numbering is such that the ethoxy is at position 1
