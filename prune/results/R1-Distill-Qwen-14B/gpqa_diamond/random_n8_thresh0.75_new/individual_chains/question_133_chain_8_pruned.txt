Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my phosphate chemistry, but let me think through this step by step.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 200 mL or 0.2 liters. In this solution, there are 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4·2H2O. I remember that KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, and Na2HPO4 is sodium phosphate dibasic. The molecular weights are given, so I can calculate the moles of each.

Wait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, right? But in solution, it dissociates into various forms. The K values given are Ka1, Ka2, and Ka3 for H3PO4. So, the first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- with Ka1 = 7.5e-3. The second is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- with Ka2 = 6.2e-8. And the third is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- with Ka3 = 1.8e-12. So, the concentration of orthophosphate would be [H3PO4], but wait—no, wait. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it doesn't stay as H3PO4 because it's a weak acid and dissociates. So, the concentration of H3PO4 might be very low. But I'm not sure; maybe I'm mixing this up.

Alternatively, sometimes people refer to the orthophosphate ions as HPO4^2- or PO4^3-. Wait no, orthophosphate is the fully protonated form, H3PO4. So the concentration we're looking for is [H3PO4].

But wait, the problem gives us KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. Let me think about both of these salts.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. The formula is K H2PO4. When dissolved in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So, it's adding H2PO4^- ions to the solution.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium phosphate dibasic with two waters of hydration. When dissolved, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So, it's adding HPO4^2- ions.

So, in the solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. I think this is a buffer solution because it's a mixture of a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-). Oh wait, wait. H2PO4^- can act as an acid (donating a proton to become HPO4^2-) or as a base (accepting a proton to become H3PO4). Similarly, HPO4^2- can act as an acid (donating a proton to become PO4^3-) or a base (accepting a proton to become H
