Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the spectroscopy yet. Let's take it step by step.

The question is about identifying Compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, red phosphorus and HI... Oh wait, I think that's a reaction to reduce a carbonyl group. Like, maybe it's a Clemmensen reduction? Or maybe a hydroboration? Wait, no, Clemmensen uses H2O with acid maybe. Wait, no, Clemmensen is with Zn(Hg)/HCl, right? Oh wait, red phosphorus and HI might be something else. Oh, perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction or maybe a substitution.

Let me first try to figure out what Compound X is. The IR and NMR data will help with that.

Looking at the IR data: The peaks are between 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, probably O-H stretch. Then 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl (like a ketone or ester or aldehyde). The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be C=C aromatic rings. So, the compound likely has a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring.

Now the NMR data:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) - That's a broad singlet, probably an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if it's an aldehyde proton, it's usually around 9-10 ppm. Wait, but an aldehyde is a singlet and maybe a triplet if coupled, but here it's a broad. Hmm. Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, the proton is usually broad and around 10-12 ppm. So maybe that's the case.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) - These are aromatic protons. A double doublet suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Like two protons at 8.0 (maybe ortho to substituents) and two at 7.2 (para to substituents). So it's probably a substituent on a benzene ring, maybe a carbonyl group and another substituent.

Looking at the other NMR signals:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H) - Maybe a CH adjacent to something, like an oxygen or a carbonyl group.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H) - Perhaps a CH2 group, maybe part of a chain attached to the ring.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H) - A methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH2 or a CH.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H) - A terminal methyl group, like from an ethyl chain.

Putting this together: There's a benzene ring with substituents. Let's think about the substituents. The IR suggests a carbonyl. So maybe a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and another substituent.

Wait the NMR at 10.5 ppm is a broad peak, so maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But wait, the 1720
