Okay, so I've got this problem in front of me about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when astronomers talk about [X/Y] notation, that's the logarithm of the ratio of the abundance of element X to element Y compared to the Sun. Oh wait, right! [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_Sun. Or wait, another way: [X/Y] = log10( (n_X / n_Y) / (n_X_sun / n_Y_sun) ), right?

So the problem gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Each has a massâ€”1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass. But I don't think the masses matter here directly because the question is about elemental ratios, not about the star's evolution or anything like that. Unless maybe the mass affects the photospheric composition, but the problem says to use LTE and the EW method, so it's about their current compositions.

The given data:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So Star 1 has silicon to iron ratio 0.3 dex higher than the Sun.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Star 2's magnesium to silicon ratio is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So Star 1's iron abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as the Sun.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0. Star 2's magnesium to hydrogen is same as Sun.

Wait, the Sun's photospheric composition is given: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. Let me parse that. Oh, wait, no. Wait, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5). Similarly for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. So log10(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5. So nMg/nH is 10^-5.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says: photospheric composition for the Sun: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So 12 + log10(nFe/nH) equals 7.5? So log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12= -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^-4.5. Similarly, nMg/nH is 10^(-5) because 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7, so log is -5.

But what are we being asked? The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So [Si/Star1]/[Si/Star2] ratio, or the ratio n_Si_1 / n_Si_2?

Wait, the question is the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2's photospheres. So we need (n_Si_1 / n_Si_2).

Hmm. So to find this ratio, we can use the given [
