Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because these NMR questions can get tricky. But let's take it step by step.

The question says the compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me break that down. Carbon 8, hydrogen 9, nitrogen 1, oxygen 1. I wonder what kind of structure that could be. Maybe it's an aromatic compound because of the benzene rings, but I'm not sure yet.

Looking at the NMR data: there are several signals. The first is at 9.72 ppm, a triplet integrating to 1H. That's pretty high, so maybe an aldehyde proton? Or maybe something else like an acidic proton, like from a phenol? But phenol protons are usually around 5 ppm. Wait, 9.7 is more like an aldehyde. Aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm, so that's a possibility. But wait, the integration is 1H, so it's just one proton. That fits with an aldehyde group.

Then there's a peak at 6.98 ppm, a doublet integrating 2H. Another at 6.51 ppm, also a doublet with 2H. Those might be from aromatic protons. Let me think: maybe a para-substituted benzene? Because doublets in aromatic regions often suggest coupling between two sets of protons. For example, in para substitution, each proton would have two neighbors, but wait, no, para substitution has protons that are typically doublets if it's a di-substituted ring. Alternatively, maybe it's an ortho coupling. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let's move on.

Next, 6.27 ppm, a broad singlet with 2H. Broad usually indicates exchange with something else, like if it's an OH group. But wait, 2H as OH? That's a bit unusual. Or maybe it's a vinyl proton? Because vinyl protons can sometimes be split in a way that looks like a singlet if they're equivalent and coupled to each other. Wait, but 6.27 isn't that high for a vinyl, but it's possible. Alternatively, it could be some sort of conjugated system.

Then, 3.66 ppm, a doublet with 2H. That's probably a CH2 group adjacent to something electronegative, like oxygen. Maybe it's a meth
