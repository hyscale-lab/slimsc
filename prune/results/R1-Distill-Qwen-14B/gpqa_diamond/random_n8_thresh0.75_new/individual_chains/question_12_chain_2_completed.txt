Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. Hmm, the question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) at rest decaying into a mu(+) and a neutrino. 

Wait, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle is at rest and decays, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is initially at rest, its momentum is zero. So after the decay, the momenta of the muon and the neutrino should be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum.

The problem gives the rest masses: the pion is 139.6 MeV/c², and the muon is 105.7 MeV/c². Oh, wait, neutrinos are tricky because their rest mass is negligible compared to other particles. So I think I can treat the neutrino as massless, meaning its energy is equal to its momentum times c. But since we're working in units where c=1 (MeV and MeV/c²), it's easier.

So, the pion is at rest, so its energy is just its rest energy: E_pi = m_pi*c² = 139.6 MeV.

When it decays, the energy is split between the muon and the neutrino. The muon will have some kinetic energy and its rest mass energy, and the neutrino will have just its kinetic energy, since its rest mass is negligible.

So let's denote the kinetic energy of the muon as K_mu and the kinetic energy of the neutrino as K_nu.

But wait, energy and momentum must be conserved. The total energy before decay is the pion's rest energy, 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's energy and the neutrino's energy. The muon's energy is its rest mass plus its kinetic energy, so E_mu = 105.7 + K_mu. The neutrino's energy is just K_nu.

So energy conservation gives:
139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu.

Momentum conservation: since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay must be zero. So the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.

The momentum of the muon is p_mu, and the neutrino's is p_nu. So p_mu = -p_nu.

But for the muon, its total energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c²? Wait, no, units-wise, since in natural units (c=1), E² = p² + m². So for the muon, E_mu² = p_mu² + (105.7)^2.

Similarly, for the neutrino (massless), E_nu = p_nu.

But since p_mu = -p_nu, the magnitudes are equal: |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

So E_nu = p. And E_mu² = p² + (105.7)^2.

So let's write down the energy conservation equation:

139.6 = E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p.

Hmm, this equation should allow us to solve for p. Let's denote x = p. Then:

139.6 = sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) + x.

Let me rearrange that: sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - x.

Now, square both sides:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

So:

x² + 11172.49 = (19488.16) - (279.2 x) + x².

Wait, 139.6 squared is 139.6 *139.6. Let me compute that: 139^2=19321, 0.6^2=0.36, cross term 2*139*0.6=166.8. So (139.6)^2= (139)^2 + 2*(139)*(0.6) + (0.6)^2 = 19321 + 166.8 + 0.36= 19488.16. Yes.

So, x² + 11172.49 = 19488.16 -279.2 x + x².

Subtract x² from both sides:

11172.49 = 19488.16 -279.2 x.

Now, subtract 19488.16 from both sides:

11172.49 -19488.16 = -279.2 x.

Which is:

-8315.67 = -279.2 x.

Divide both sides by -279.2:

x = (-8315.67)/(-279.2) ≈ 29.8 MeV/c.

Wait, but that can't be right because the pion's mass is 139.6 MeV. If p is 29.8 MeV/c, which is more than the muon's rest mass. Wait, but the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV/c², and the pion's rest energy is 139.6. Hmm, but the pion's energy is 139.6, which is less than the muon's rest plus something. Wait, wait, no, the muon's rest mass is 105.7, which is less than 139.6, so the pion can decay into a muon and a neutrino.

Wait, I think the calculation is correct. So x is approximately 29.8 MeV/c. So the neutrino's energy is p =29.8 MeV, and the muon's energy is sqrt(29.8^2 +105.7^2) = sqrt(888.04 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12060.53) ≈ 109.8 MeV.

Wait, but the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy is 109.8 -105.7 = 4.1 MeV.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That would be the answer.

Wait, let me double-check. Because I might have messed up the calculation steps.

Wait, when I plugged in x = p, I got x ≈29.8 MeV/c. So the neutrino's energy is 29.8 MeV, and the muon's energy is sqrt(29.8^2 +105.7^2) = sqrt(888.04 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12060.53) ≈ 109.8 MeV. So the muon's kinetic energy is 109.8 -105.7=4.1 MeV.

But the neutrino's energy is 29.8 MeV, which is its kinetic energy since its rest mass is zero. So the kinetic energies are 4.1 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So the options are:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

Wait, but the question says, "Find KE of product particles in". So the first number is the muon's KE, and the second is the neutrino's KE.

So the muon's KE is about 4.1 MeV, and the neutrino's is 29.8 MeV. So the correct option is D.

But let me think again. Wait, in the equation, 139.6 = E_mu + E_nu.

E_mu is 109.8 MeV, E_nu is 29.8 MeV. Sum is 109.8 +29.8 = 139.6, which matches.

So yes, the KEs are approximately 4.1 and 29.8. Looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That must be the correct choice.


To determine the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay process:

\[
\pi^+ \text{ (at rest)} \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]

we use the principles of energy and momentum conservation. The rest mass of the pion is \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), and the rest mass of the muon is \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). The neutrino is treated as massless (\( m_{\nu} \approx 0 \)).

### Energy Conservation
The total energy before the decay is the rest energy of the pion:
\[
E_{\pi^+} = m_{\pi^+}c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's total energy (\( E_{\mu^+} \)) and the neutrino's energy (\( E_{\nu} \)):
\[
E_{\pi^+} = E_{\mu^+} + E_{\nu}.
\]

The muon's total energy is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2},
\]
where \( p_{\mu^+} \) is the magnitude of the muon's momentum. The neutrino's energy is equal to its momentum (\( E_{\nu} = p_{\nu} \)), and since momentum is conserved, \( p_{\mu^+} = p_{\nu} = p \).

Thus, the energy conservation equation becomes:
\[
139.6 = \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p.
\]

### Solving for \( p \)
Rearranging:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} = 139.6 - p.
\]

Squaring both sides:
\[
p^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.
\]

Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
p^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2p + p^2.
\]

Canceling \( p^2 \) and simplifying:
\[
11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2p.
\]

Rearranging:
\[
279.2p = 19488.16 - 11172.49,
\]
\[
279.2p = 8315.67,
\]
\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.8 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Thus, the neutrino's energy is \( E_{\nu} = p = 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \), and the muon's total energy is:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = \sqrt{29.8^2 + 105.7^2}.
\]

Calculating:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{888.04 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12060.53} \approx 109.8 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The muon's kinetic energy is:
\[
K_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energy of the muon is approximately \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \), and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is \( 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.**
