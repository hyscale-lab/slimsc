Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about operators and uncertainty. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

Alright, the problem says we have an operator P with components Px, Py, and Pz. Each has a given matrix form. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. The system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). We need to find the uncertainty ΔPz.

Wait, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So for Pz, we'll have to find ⟨Pz²⟩ and ⟨Pz⟩, then compute the square root of their difference.

But first, I think I need to compute the expectation value of Pz, ⟨Pz⟩, using the given state. Since the state is a column vector, maybe I can calculate it by multiplying the vector with the Pz matrix and then taking the inner product.

Wait, let me think. The expectation value is ⟨ψ| Pz |ψ⟩. So yes, I'll need to compute that.

Let me write down the state vector ψ. It's a 3-component vector: ψ = [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T.

The Pz matrix is given as:
[ ħ    0      0   ]
[ 0    0      0   ]
[ 0    0   -ħ ]

So to compute Pz |ψ⟩, I'll multiply the matrix by ψ.

Let me compute that:

First component: ħ*(-1/2) + 0*(1/sqrt(2)) + 0*(-1/2) = -ħ/2.

Second component: 0*(all terms) = 0.

Third component: 0*(-1/2) + 0*(1/sqrt(2)) + (-ħ)*(-1/2) = ħ/2.

So Pz |ψ⟩ is [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]^T.

Now, the expectation value ⟨Pz⟩ is the inner product of ψ† (conjugate transpose) with Pz |ψ⟩.

Wait, the state is given, and I don't see any complex numbers except for the P matrices. The state vector has real components, so the conjugate transpose is just the transpose.

So ψ† is [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ].

So ⟨Pz⟩ = ( -1/2 )*(-ħ/2) + (1/sqrt(2))(0) + ( -1/2 )( ħ/2 )

Calculating each term:

First term: (1/2)(ħ/2) = ħ/4.

Second term: 0.

Third term: (-1/2)(ħ/2) = -ħ/4.

Adding them: ħ/4 - ħ/4 = 0. Oh, interesting. So ⟨Pz⟩ is zero.

Wait, but the uncertainty formula requires ⟨Pz²⟩. Let's compute that.

Pz squared is Pz multiplied by Pz. So Pz² is a matrix where each element is the sum of products. Let me compute Pz squared.

Pz is diagonal, so when you square it, the matrix is just each diagonal element squared. So Pz² is:

[ (ħ)^2 , 0 , 0 ]
[ 0 , 0 , 0 ]
[ 0 , 0 , ( -ħ )^2 ]

Which simplifies to:

[ ħ², 0, 0;
0, 0,0;
0,0, ħ² ]

So Pz² is a diagonal matrix with entries ħ², 0, ħ².

Now, to find ⟨Pz²⟩, which is ψ† Pz² ψ.

So let's compute Pz² ψ.

Pz² ψ = [ ħ²*(-1/2), 0, ħ²*(-1/2) ]^T.

Wait no, no, more accurately, it's:

Each component of ψ is multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element.

So for the first component: ħ²*(-1/2)

Second component: 0*(1/sqrt(2)) = 0.

Third component: ħ²*(-1/2)

So Pz² ψ is [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ]^T.

Then, to compute ⟨Pz²⟩, which is ψ† multiplied by this vector.

ψ† is [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]

So the inner product is:

(-1/2)(-ħ²/2) + (1/sqrt(2))(0) + (-1/2)(-ħ²/2 )

Calculating each term:

First term: (1/2)*(ħ²/2) = ħ²/4.

Third term: (1/2)*(ħ²/2) = ħ²/4.

So adding them: ħ²/4 + 0 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2.

So ⟨Pz²⟩ is ħ²/2.

Earlier, ⟨Pz⟩ was 0, so ⟨Pz⟩² is 0.

Therefore, the uncertainty ΔPz is sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩² ) = sqrt( ħ²/2 - 0 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). So the answer should be B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The given state is $\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix}$, and the matrix for $P_z$ is:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To compute $\langle P_z \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z | \psi \rangle$, we first calculate $P_z | \psi \rangle$:

\[
P_z | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -\hbar/2 \\ 0 \\ \hbar/2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, $\langle P_z \rangle$ is the inner product of $\psi$ and $P_z | \psi \rangle$:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z | \psi \rangle = (-1/2)(-\hbar/2) + (1/\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\hbar/2).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix for $P_z^2$ is:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z^2 | \psi \rangle$, we first calculate $P_z^2 | \psi \rangle$:

\[
P_z^2 | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -\hbar^2/2 \\ 0 \\ -\hbar^2/2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is the inner product of $\psi$ and $P_z^2 | \psi \rangle$:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z^2 | \psi \rangle = (-1/2)(-\hbar^2/2) + (1/\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\hbar^2/2).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
