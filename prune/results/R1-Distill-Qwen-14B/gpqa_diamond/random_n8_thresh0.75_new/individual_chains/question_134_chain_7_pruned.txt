Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, right, neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. Enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid donates protons to a base.

Wait, the problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Oh wait, but wait, acids and bases. So HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid as well (but wait, it's diprotic, right?), and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So when these are mixed, they should react.

But wait, I need to figure out how much each contributes. Because when you mix them, the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base. But I have to calculate the moles of H+ and OH- to see which is in excess, if any.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, calculate the moles of each acid and base.

1. For HCl:
Volume is 500 mL (which is 0.5 L), concentration 0.2 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. HCl → H+ + Cl- so 0.1 moles H+.

2. For H2SO4:
Volume is 300 mL (0.3 L), 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each mole gives 2 H+. So 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

3. For Ba(OH)2:
Volume is 200 mL (0.2 L), 0.5 M. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole gives 2 OH- per formula unit. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. So OH- moles = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but wait, when you mix them, H+ and OH- will react. So H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4, and OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Total H+ = 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles H+.

Total OH- = 0.2 moles.

Now, in neutralization, H+ + OH- → H2O. So the reaction depends on which is in excess.

Let me compare the moles. H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So H+ is more. So all the OH- will react, and the remaining H+ will be 0.08 moles.

Wait, but wait, that's the case here. All the OH- will be neutralized by H+, leaving some H+ left
