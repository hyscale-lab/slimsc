Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the first part is about compound A. Its proton NMR shows two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the integration tells us how many protons are in each peak. So 6H and 4H. Also, the triplet and quartet suggest coupling with neighboring protons.

Wait, what structures give triplets and quartets? Oh, maybe it's something like ethyl groups. Because in an ethyl group, the CH2CH3 would show a quartet for the CH2 (because it's next to a CH3 with 3 protons) and a triplet for the CH3 (next to a CH2 with 2 protons). But wait, in this case, the 6H is a triplet, so probably two sets of equivalent CH3 groups, each split into a triplet. And the 4H is a quartet, which could be two sets of equivalent CH2 groups.

Wait, another possibility is that compound A is a diethyl ether or something. Or maybe it's a diol or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclopropane derivative? Hmm.

Wait, the 6H triplet at 0.9 ppm. That's a common shift for CH2CH3 groups. So maybe two CH2CH3 groups. So 2*(CH2CH3) would give 6H as a triplet for each CH3, but wait, no. Each CH3 in ethyl groups would be a triplet. But if they're equivalent, like in diethyl ether, the CH3 would be a triplet. But in diethyl ether, the structure is CH2CH2-O-CH2CH3, but wait, no, that's not right. Diethyl ether is (CH2CH3)2O. So the structure is CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3.

In that case, the CH2CH3 groups would each have their CH3 as triplets, and the adjacent CH2 would be a quartet. Because each CH2 is next to the O, which is connected to another CH2CH3. Wait, but in diethyl ether, the CH2 groups are adjacent to the oxygen, so their protons would be split by the oxygen. Hmm, but I'm a bit
