Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is. 

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product from the given options. They also provided the IR and NMR data for Compound X. 

Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of a nitrile group. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, when a nitrile reacts with HI and red phosphorus, it undergoes a hydrolysis reaction. But wait, isn't HI with red phosphorus used for something else? Oh wait, maybe I'm confusing it with another reaction. Oh wait, I think the other reaction is the Hunsdiecker reaction, which involves halogenation of alkynes. No, maybe not. Alternatively, I think that treating a nitrile with HI and red phosphorus could be a way to convert the nitrile group into a primary amine. Wait, or maybe it's for converting nitriles to amines. Or wait, perhaps it's more about dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. Wait, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation? Or perhaps it's about converting a nitrile to an amine via the Stephen reduction? No, that uses a different catalyst.

Wait, wait. I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. Oh yes, that's right. The standard reaction is that a nitrile group (R-C≡N) when treated with HI and red phosphorus is converted into a carboxylic acid (R-COOH). So the reaction is R-C≡N + HI (excess) in presence of red phosphorus → R-COOH. So, the nitrile group is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. 

So, if that's the case, I need to figure out what the structure of Compound X is, and then see what happens when its nitrile group is converted into a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the IR data: 3400–2500 cm-1. That broad region is usually indicative of O-H stretch, but wait, it's a broad peak. Alternatively, it could be N-H stretching, but more likely O-H because that's a bigger band. Or maybe it's an amine. Wait, let's look at the other peaks. There's a peak at 1720 cm-1. That seems like a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. But if it's a nitrile, the nitrile peak is usually around 2220 cm-1. Hmm, but the IR doesn't show that. Wait, so maybe the compound doesn't have a nitrile? Or perhaps I'm wrong about the reaction.

Wait, wait, let me check the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H). That's a very high chemical shift, which is typical for an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid proton. But wait, carboxylic acids have broad O-H signals around 10-12 ppm. Alternatively, an
