Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic scenario. Oh wait, right, in relativity, the speed can't exceed the speed of light c. So I guess the maximum speed would approach c but not exceed it.

The problem states it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. So this is a quantum or classical problem? Hmm, the options involve square roots and c, so probably a classical treatment.

Wait, no, actually, the question is about classical mechanics but considering relativistic effects. Because in Newtonian mechanics, the maximum speed would be sqrt(kA²/m), but relativistically, we might have to adjust for the velocity approaching c.

I remember that in special relativity, momentum isn't just mass times velocity anymore. Momentum p is gamma times m times v, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But how does that tie into the harmonic oscillator?

In a harmonic oscillator, energy is conserved. In the classical case, the total energy is (1/2)kA². But relativistically, maybe the energy expression changes.

Wait, let's think about energy. The total energy of the oscillator is the sum of kinetic and potential. In the non-relativistic case, it's (1/2)mv² + (1/2)kx². But at maximum displacement (x=A), the potential is max and kinetic is zero. So at equilibrium (x=0), kinetic is max, potential is zero. So maximum speed occurs when all energy is kinetic.

But relativity complicates this. The kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. In relativity, the total energy is gamma mc², so the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc². So when the oscillator is at x=0, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc².

So setting the total energy (which is (1/2)kA² in non-relativistic case) equal to this relativistic kinetic energy. Wait, but wait, the oscillator's potential energy is (1/2)kA². So at x=0, all energy is kinetic. So,

(1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) mc².

So,

(1/2)kA² = (gamma -1) mc².

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, let me rearrange that. Let's write:

gamma = (k A²)/(2 m c²) + 1.

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But wait, gamma is always greater than or equal to 1. So as the amplitude A increases, gamma increases, meaning v approaches c.

Now, we can solve for v. Let me write gamma as 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me let (k A²)/(2 m c²) = some term, say t. So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + t.

Squaring both sides,

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + t)^2 = 1 + 2t + t².

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1 / (1 + 2t + t^2).

Wait, that's getting a bit messy. Let's think about rearranging it.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to express v in terms of gamma.

We know that v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

Because,

v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

So,

v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)).

And since gamma is 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²), substituting that in:

v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/( [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]^2 )).

Hmm, let me compute that denominator.

Denominator inside the square root is [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)] squared.

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/[ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) )^2 ] )

Hmm, looking at the options, option D is v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))^2 ). So is that the same as what I have?

Wait, my expression is correct. Let me write it:

v = c * sqrt(1 - [1/( (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ) ] )

Which is option D: sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + ... )^2
