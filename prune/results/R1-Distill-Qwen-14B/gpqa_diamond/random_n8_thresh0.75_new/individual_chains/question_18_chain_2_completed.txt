Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about the elemental abundances in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Both have masses larger than our Sun. The given data includes their [X/Y] abundances, where X and Y are elements. I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres.

Wait, let's list out the given data:

Star_1:
- Mass: 1.5 solar masses
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

Star_2:
- Mass: 1.2 solar masses
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5

Wait, I think I need to find the [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2 for each star, then find the ratio [Si_1 / Si_2] or [Si_2 / Si_1]? Or maybe the ratio of their silicon abundances.

Wait, the problem says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So I think that's [Si/Star_1] divided by [Si/Star_2], or the other way around? Or perhaps the ratio is (n_Si1 / n_Si2)?

Wait, let me read the question again. It says, "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So I think that's (n_Si, Star1) / (n_Si, Star2) = ?

Wait, but the options are numbers, so I need to compute this ratio.

But how to get n_Si for each star? Let's think about the given data.

I remember that the notation [X/Y] means log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun = [X/Y].

So [X/Y] = log10( (n_X / n_Y)_star / (n_X / n_Y)_sun )

Alternatively, [X/Y] = log10( (n_X / n_Y)_star ) - log10( (n_X / n_Y)_sun )

So, for Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10( (n_Si1 / n_Fe1) / (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) = 0.3

But the Sun's [Fe/H] is given as 0, because [Fe/H] is log10(n_Fe/n_H) - log10(n_Fe/n_H)_sun = 0 → so n_Fe_1 / n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.

Wait, Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0 → [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → so log10(n_Fe1 / n_H1) - log10(n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) ) = 0 → so n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.

So the Fe abundance in Star_1 is the same as the Sun's.

Similarly, for Star_2: [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → n_Mg2 / n_H2 = n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun.

Wait, but how do I get n_Si for each star?

Let me tackle Star_1 first.

Star_1:

We know [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → which is log10( (n_Si1 / n_Fe1) / (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) = 0.3 → (n_Si1 / n_Fe1) = (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But from Star_1's [Fe/H] = 0 → n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun) * (n_H1 / n_H_sun)

Wait, because n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun → n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1 / n_H_sun).

Hmm, but I don't know n_H1. Wait, but in stellar atmospheres, the total hydrogen density is often assumed to be the same as the Sun's if the [Fe/H] is 0? Or maybe not, because the star has a different mass, but for this problem, I think they're considering the metallicity, so if [Fe/H] is 0, that means [X/H] is 0 for all elements. Wait, no, because [Fe/H] is 0 in Star_1, but [Si/Fe] is 0.3, so that would mean [Si/H] is 0.3.

Wait, wait. Let's think again. [X/H] is the logarithm of (n_X / n_H) divided by the solar ratio.

For Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → n_Fe1 / n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.

And [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10( (n_Si1 / n_Fe1) / (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) = 0.3 → (n_Si1/n_Fe1) = (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But n_Fe1 is (n_Fe_sun * n_H1) / n_H_sun.

Wait, let me write equations.

Let me denote S for Sun.

n_Fe1 = (n_Fe,S) * (n_H1 / n_H,S).

Similarly, n_Si1 = ?

n_Si1 = (n_Si,S) * 10^{0.3} * (n_Fe1 / n_Fe,S)

Wait, from [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (n_Si1 / n_Fe1) = (n_Si,S / n_Fe,S) * 10^0.3.

So,

n_Si1 = (n_Si,S / n_Fe,S) * 10^0.3 * n_Fe1.

But n_Fe1 = (n_Fe,S) * (n_H1 / n_H,S).

So,

n_Si1 = (n_Si,S / n_Fe,S) * 10^0.3 * (n_Fe,S) * (n_H1 / n_H,S )

Simplify:

n_Si1 = n_Si,S * 10^0.3 * (n_H1 / n_H,S )

So,

n_Si1 = (n_Si,S / n_H,S) * n_H1 * 10^0.3.

Because (n_Si,S / n_H,S) is the solar Si/H ratio.

Similarly, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → n_Fe1 = n_Fe,S * (n_H1 / n_H,S).

But since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which implies n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe,S / n_H,S → so (n_Fe1) = (n_Fe,S) * (n_H1 / n_H,S).

But then, for Star_1, what about the H abundance? I don't know n_H1.

Wait, but when we compute the ratio of Si in Star_1 and Star_2, perhaps the H cancels out.

Wait, maybe I should compute [Si/H] for each star and then take the ratio.

So let's compute [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2.

First, for Star_1:

We have:

n_Si1 = (n_Si,S) * 10^{0.3} * (n_H1 / n_H,S )

Then,

n_Si1 / n_H1 = (n_Si,S / n_H,S) * 10^{0.3}.

Which implies:

log10(n_Si1/n_H1) = log10( (n_Si,S / n_H,S) * 10^{0.3} ) = log10(n_Si,S/n_H,S) + 0.3.

So,

[Si/H]_1 = log10( (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si,S / n_H,S) ) ) = (log10(n_Si1/n_H1) ) - log10(n_Si,S/n_H,S )

= ( log10(n_Si,S/n_H,S) + 0.3 ) - log10(n_Si,S/n_H,S ) )

= 0.3.

Wait, that's neat. So [Si/H]_1 is 0.3.

Wait, but wait. Let me check.

Yes, because [Si/H]_1 = log10( (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si,S/n_H,S) )

But from above, n_Si1/n_H1 = (n_Si,S/n_H,S) * 10^0.3.

So,

(n_Si1/n_H1)/(n_Si,S/n_H,S) ) = 10^0.3 → log10 is 0.3. So [Si/H]_1 = 0.3.

Wait, that's interesting. So Star_1 has a [Si/H] of 0.3.

Similarly, let's compute [Si/H]_2 for Star_2.

Star_2's data:

[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log10( (n_Mg2/n_Si2) / (n_Mg,S/n_Si,S) ) ) = 0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → log10( (n_Mg2/n_H2) / (n_Mg,S/n_H,S) ) ) = 0 → (n_Mg2/n_H2) = (n_Mg,S/n_H,S).

So, n_Mg2 = (n_Mg,S) * (n_H2 / n_H,S).

From [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → (n_Mg2/n_Si2) / (n_Mg,S/n_Si,S) ) = 10^0.3 → (n_Mg2/n_Si2) = (n_Mg,S/n_Si,S) *10^0.3.

We can substitute n_Mg2 from the [Mg/H]_2 equation:

n_Mg2 = (n_Mg,S) (n_H2/n_H,S )

So,

[(n_Mg,S)(n_H2/n_H,S)] / n_Si2 = (n_Mg,S / n_Si,S) * 10^0.3.

Divide both sides by (n_Mg,S):

(n_H2 / n_H,S) / n_Si2 = (1 / n_Si,S) * 10^0.3.

Multiply both sides by n_Si2 * n_H,S:

n_H2 = (n_Si2 * n_H,S) * (10^0.3) / (n_Si2) ) * [Wait, no, let me solve for n_Si2.

Wait, perhaps rearrange the equation:

n_Si2 = (n_Mg,S) (n_H2/n_H,S ) * (n_Si,S)/(n_Mg,S) * 10^{-0.3}

Wait, because from the equation:

(n_Mg2/n_Si2) = (n_Mg,S/n_Si,S) *10^{0.3} → rearranged, n_Si2 = n_Mg2 * (n_Si,S / n_Mg,S) ) * 10^{-0.3}.

Substituting n_Mg2:

n_Si2 = (n_Mg,S) (n_H2/n_H,S) ) * (n_Si,S / n_Mg,S) ) * 10^{-0.3}.

Simplify:

n_Si2 = n_Si,S * (n_H2 / n_H,S) * 10^{-0.3}.

So,

n_Si2 / n_H2 = (n_Si,S / n_H,S) * 10^{-0.3}.

Which gives:

log10(n_Si2/n_H2) = log10( (n_Si,S / n_H,S ) * 10^{-0.3} ) → log10(n_Si,S/n_H,S) -0.3.

Therefore, [Si/H]_2 = log10( (n_Si2/n_H2) / (n_Si,S/n_H,S) ) → [ log10(n_Si2/n_H2) - log10(n_Si,S/n_H,S) ) ] → [ (log10(n_Si,S/n_H,S) -0.3 ) - log10(n_Si,S/n_H,S) ) ] → -0.3.

So [Si/H]_2 is -0.3.

So now, Star_1 has [Si/H] = 0.3, and Star_2 has [Si/H] = -0.3.

But the question is the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So (n_Si1/n_Si2) is the ratio.

But to compute this ratio, I need to express n_Si1 and n_Si2 in terms of the Sun's values.

But wait, n_Si1 is proportional to (n_Si,S * 10^0.3 * (n_H1 / n_H,S )).

Wait, but I don't know the ratio of the hydrogen densities between the stars and the Sun. How can I proceed?

Wait, maybe because we're dealing with the ratio of silicon, the hydrogen terms will cancel.

Because n_Si1 = (n_Si,S / n_H,S) * n_H1 * 10^{0.3}.

Similarly, n_Si2 = (n_Si,S / n_H,S) * n_H2 * 10^{-0.3}.

So to find n_Si1 / n_Si2:

= [ (n_Si,S / n_H,S) * n_H1 * 10^{0.3} ] / [ (n_Si,S / n_H,S) * n_H2 * 10^{-0.3} ) ]

The (n_Si,S / n_H,S) terms cancel.

So,

n_Si1/n_Si2 = (n_H1 / n_H2) * 10^{0.3 + 0.3} → 10^{0.6} * (n_H1/n_H2).

But wait, what about n_H1 and n_H2? Do we have any information about the H density in the stars?

Wait, the problem states that the stars are in LTE, and the EW method was used. But without knowing the star's temperature or gravity, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the H density is the same as the Sun's because [Fe/H] =0 implies [H/Fe]=0, meaning that [H] is same as Sun's. Wait, no, [Fe/H] is 0, but [H/Fe] would be 0 as well. So, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun → but that doesn't necessarily mean n_H1 is the same as the Sun's, because the star's H could be scaled by another factor. Hmm, but this is getting complicated.

Wait, another approach. Since both stars have [Fe/H] =0 and [Mg/H]=0, their overall metallicity is the same as the Sun's. So, maybe the H density is the same as the Sun's.

Wait, but [Fe/H]_1 =0 doesn't mean [H/Fe] is 0. Wait, no. [Fe/H] is log10(n_Fe/n_H) - log10(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) = 0 → so n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.

Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun.

But does that mean that n_H1 and n_H2 are the same as the Sun's? Not necessarily. Because if the star has more H, but same ratio of Fe to H, then n_Fe would be same as Sun.

Wait, perhaps the assumption here is that the hydrogen density is the same as the Sun's. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps for the ratio, n_H1 and n_H2 cancel out.

Wait, looking back. The ratio n_Si1/n_Si2 is (n_H1/n_H2) * 10^{0.6}.

So if I can find n_H1/n_H2, I can compute the ratio.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the stars have the same metallicity as the Sun, so their overall [H] is same as Sun's. But I don't think that's necessarily the case, because [Fe/H] is 0, but other elements could vary. Wait, but [Fe/H]_1 is 0, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0.

Wait, let's think about the sun's composition. The Sun's [Fe/H] is 0, but that's just for Fe. For Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, so [Fe/H]_1 =0 → log(n_Fe1/n_H1) = log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun).

But for Star_1, the [Mg/Si] is 0.3 → which is a ratio of Mg to Si. So maybe the H is the same for both stars as the Sun's. Or perhaps, because their [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are 0, their H abundance is same as the Sun's.

Wait, perhaps when [X/H] is 0 for an element X, then n_X is the same as the Sun's. But that's not correct because [X/H] is log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X_sun/n_H_sun).

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → log(n_Fe1/n_H1) = log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) → so n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun.

But we don't know n_H1 and n_H2, so perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps the abundance ratios lead us to the conclusion that the H densities are the same. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio n_H1 / n_H2 is 1, but I don't think that's given. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I can find n_Si1 and n_Si2 in terms of the Sun's n_Si and H.

Wait, for Star_1:

n_Si1 = (n_Si,S / n_H,S) * n_H1 * 10^0.3.

And for Star_2:

n_Si2 = (n_Si,S / n_H,S) * n_H2 * 10^{-0.3}.

So the ratio is:

n_Si1/n_Si2 = (n_H1 * 10^0.3) / (n_H2 * 10^{-0.3}) ) = (n_H1/n_H2) * 10^{0.6}.

But without knowing n_H1/n_H2, I can't proceed. So I'm stuck. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, considering that both stars have a photospheric composition where [Fe/H] =0 and [Mg/H]=0, but their masses are different. But how does mass relate to H density?

Wait, perhaps in the photosphere, the number density of H is related to the star's surface gravity and temperature, but without knowing those, it's unclear. Maybe the problem assumes that n_H is the same in both stars as the Sun's, but I don't think that's a valid assumption unless stated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the hydrogen densities equals the ratio of the inverse of their masses, but I have no basis for that.

Wait, another approach. Let me compute [Si/H] for each star.

Star_1: [Si/H] =0.3.

Star_2: [Si/H] =-0.3.

So the ratio of their silicon abundances (in terms of [Si/H]) is 0.3 - (-0.3) = 0.6. But that's the logarithmic difference. The actual ratio is 10^{0.6} = about 3.98.

Wait, wait, that's a much simpler approach. Because [Si/H]_1 =0.3 and [Si/H]_2 =-0.3.

The ratio of n_Si1/n_Si2 is 10^{ [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 }.

Because [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X,Y_sun), but when comparing two stars, the ratio is 10^{([X/Y]_star1 - [X/Y]_star2)}.

Wait, no. Let me think about it.

[n_Si1/n_Si2] = (n_Si1 /n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2) ) * (n_H2 /n_H1).

But since [Si/H]_1 = log10(n_Si1/n_H1) - log10(n_Si,S/n_H,S) =0.3 → n_Si1/n_H1 = 10^{0.3} * (n_Si,S/n_H,S).

Similarly, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 → n_Si2/n_H2 = 10^{-0.3} * (n_Si,S/n_H,S).

So,

n_Si1/n_Si2 = (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2) ) * (n_H2/n_H1 )

= [ (10^{0.3} * (n_Si,S/n_H,S )) / (10^{-0.3} * (n_Si,S/n_H,S )) ) ] * (n_H2/n_H1 )

= (10^{0.6}) * (n_H2 / n_H1 )

So,

n_Si1/n_Si2 = 10^{0.6} * (n_H2 /n_H1 )

Wait, but without knowing n_H2/n_H1, I can't compute this. So I'm back to the same problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the hydrogen density is the same in both stars as in the Sun. So n_H1 = n_H_sun and n_H2 = n_H_sun. Then, the ratio becomes 10^{0.6} = ~3.98.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9. So that's a possible answer.

But why would n_H be the same for both stars? Since their masses are different, perhaps their surface gravities differ, leading to different scale heights and thus different number densities. But in this problem, perhaps the assumption is that n_H is the same as the Sun's.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of H density is the same as the inverse ratio of their masses. Let me see.

Wait, but I don't have any data on the radii or temperatures of the stars, so I can't compute n_H from that.

Wait, the problem states that LTE is assumed, so perhaps the number densities are determined via local conditions, but without knowing T and gravity, it's impossible to find n_H.

So I'm stuck again.

Wait, but maybe the problem expects me to ignore the hydrogen ratio and just compute the ratio based on [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2, assuming that the H is the same in both stars.

In that case, the ratio would be 10^{0.6} ≈ 3.98, which is option A.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio is 10^{0.3} / 10^{-0.3} ), which is 10^0.6 ≈3.98.

Wait, but that's under the assumption that n_H1 =n_H2.

Thus, the correct answer would be ~3.9, which is option A.

So I think the answer is A.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the provided solar photospheric composition.

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

3. **Solar Photospheric Composition**:
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -4.5 \)
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -5 \)

### Step 1: Compute [Si/H] for Each Star
#### Star_1:
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 implies \( n_{\text{Fe,1}}/n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,Sun}}/n_{\text{H,Sun}}} \).
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 implies \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si,1}}/n_{\text{Fe,1}}) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si,Sun}}/n_{\text{Fe,Sun}}) + 0.3 \).
- Substituting \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,Sun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H,1}}/n_{\text{H,Sun}}) \), we find:
  \[
  \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si,1}}/n_{\text{H,1}}) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si,Sun}}/n_{\text{H,Sun}}) + 0.3
  \]
  Thus, \( [\text{Si/H}]_1 = 0.3 \).

#### Star_2:
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 implies \( n_{\text{Mg,2}}/n_{\text{H,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,Sun}}/n_{\text{H,Sun}}} \).
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 implies \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg,2}}/n_{\text{Si,2}}) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg,Sun}}/n_{\text{Si,Sun}}) + 0.3 \).
- Rearranging, we find:
  \[
  \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si,2}}/n_{\text{H,2}}) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si,Sun}}/n_{\text{H,Sun}}) - 0.3
  \]
  Thus, \( [\text{Si/H}]_2 = -0.3 \).

### Step 2: Compute the Ratio of Silicon Atoms
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2 is given by:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{[\text{Si/H}]_1 - [\text{Si/H}]_2}
\]
Substituting \( [\text{Si/H}]_1 = 0.3 \) and \( [\text{Si/H}]_2 = -0.3 \):
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98
\]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

ANSWER: A
