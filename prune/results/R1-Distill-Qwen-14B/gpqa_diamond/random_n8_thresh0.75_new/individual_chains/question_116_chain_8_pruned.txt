Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem starts with compound A, which has two signals in its proton NMR. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Then, A undergoes monobromination to form compound B. B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C, which has two geometrical isomers. The cis-isomer of C reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to produce compound D. I need to identify D from the given options.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I need to figure out what compound A is based on its NMR spectrum.

The NMR has two signals. The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H suggests that these protons are likely attached to a CH2 or CH group that's next to another CH2. Wait, 6H in a triplet... A common group that gives a triplet is a CH2CH2CH3 group. Alternatively, maybe it's two equivalent CH2 groups next to a CH3. Let me think: each adjacent group would split the signal. So if it's a triplet, it's probably neighboring a group with two protons. Like, maybe a (CH2CH2) structure. Wait, maybe it's a diethyl group? No, wait: diethyl would have more H's. Wait, 6H as a triplet suggests maybe two equivalent CH2CH3 groups. Because each CH2CH3 has 2 H's on the CH2, but when you couple, the splitting comes from the neighboring group.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a (CH2CH3)2CH group. No, that would give more complex splitting. Alternatively, 6H as a triplet could be two CH2CH3 groups attached to the same carbon, which would lead to the triplet because each CH2CH3 has two protons, and they're all equivalent. So the structure would be something like CH2CH2CH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's a geminal diethyl group, like C(CH2CH3)2. Oh, wait, that might give a triplet. Because each CH2CH3 group has two H's on the CH2, so when the two CH2's
