Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying the original compound X based on the NMR data of the product after a reaction. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the reaction conditions: compound X (C11H12O) reacts with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane sounds familiar. Oh right, that's a base, commonly used in elimination reactions, like in the formation of epoxides from epoxy precursors. So maybe compound X is an epoxide, and this reaction is some kind of ring-opening? Or perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed ring-opening? Hmm, but the solvent is nonpolar, and the temperature is high, 403 K is about 130°C. So maybe it's an acid-catalyzed ring opening? Or maybe it's a different kind of reaction.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a bulky base, often used in E2 reactions because it can deprotonate and form a double bond. Oh right, it's used in the formation of epoxides via the Prilezhaev oxidation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's used to epoxidize a double bond. Wait, but wait, compound X is C11H12O. An epoxide would have the formula CnH2nO. Let me think: for an epoxide, the general formula is CnH2nO. So for X being an epoxide, n would be 11? Let me see: 2*11=22, so X would be C11H22O? But wait, no, X is C11H12O. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So perhaps X isn't an epoxide but another type of compound that reacts to form an epoxide when treated with this base.

Wait, no. Another approach: what is the product after reaction? The product has the given NMR data. So I need to figure out what the product is, and then backtrack to find what X was.

Looking at the product's 1H NMR:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So there are two singlet triplets, each 3H. Singlet means no neighboring H. So, perhaps two methyl groups that are not near any other H. The aromatic signals are split into doublets and a doublet of doublets maybe. Let me look at the aromatic region.

The 13C NMR:

197.7 (1C, s) is a carbonyl or maybe an ester, but wait, that's a high value. Wait, ketones are around 210-220, so 19
