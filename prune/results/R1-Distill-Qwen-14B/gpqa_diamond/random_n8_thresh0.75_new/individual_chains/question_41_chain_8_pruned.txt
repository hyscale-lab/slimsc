Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams and glass moving relative to an observer. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my optics, but let me think this through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. Wait, wait, same direction as the beam, but towards the observer. So the beam is going towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer as well. Oh, and the question is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame.

I remember that when you're dealing with light in a medium, the speed of light is c divided by n, right? So normally, in the rest frame of the glass, the speed would be c/n. But here, the glass is moving. So I guess I need to consider the effect of the glass's motion on the observed speed of light.

Wait, but speed of light is tricky. Because in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, the problem says, take c=1, so maybe they're assuming non-relativistic speeds or perhaps not worrying about relativistic effects. Hmm, but the glass is moving at velocity v, which I don't know if it's significant compared to c. But in the question, since they didn't specify anything about relativity, maybe it's assuming that v is small compared to c, so we can use a non-relativistic approach, like the Galilean transformation.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at v_light = c/n. But from the lab frame, which is moving relative to the glass, how does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, towards the observer. So in the lab frame, the light is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer as well.

Wait, but when you have a medium moving, the speed of light in that medium can be affected by the medium's motion. I think this is similar to the concept of the Doppler effect, but for light. Or maybe it's about the addition of velocities in a non-relativistic way.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the frame transformations. Let me consider the glass's frame first. In the glass's frame, the speed of light is v_light = c/n (since n is the refractive index).
