Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. 

Alright, the problem says that we're diluting 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we're titrating that diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that when you dilute a weak acid, its concentration changes, which affects the pH. Then, during titration with a strong base like NaOH, the pH will change based on how much of the base has been added. 

First, let's tackle the initial dilution. The initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (since 20 + 20 = 40). 

The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So here, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.02 L. The volume after dilution, V2, is 0.04 L. So the new concentration M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2. Plugging the numbers in: (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04 = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second, 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters. So initial moles of acetic acid are Molarity × Volume. So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. When we dilute to 0.04 L, the concentration becomes 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yeah, that's right.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. 

Let's think about the equivalence point first. Because at equivalence, all the acetic acid would have reacted with NaOH to form acetate ions and water. 

The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So, the moles of acetic acid initially are 0.001 moles (from earlier). So the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid. 

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So moles of NaOH needed = 0.001 moles. Volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. 

Wait, but in the problem, they talk about 2
