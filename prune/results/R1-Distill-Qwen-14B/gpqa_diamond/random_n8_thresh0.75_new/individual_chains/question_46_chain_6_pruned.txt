Okay, so I have this question about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I need to figure out how many possible products are formed when this substrate is treated with Grubbs. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups. Grubbs is particularly good for ring-closing metathesis and olefin cross metathesis. But wait, in this case, since it's a single alkene, it's probably a ring-closing scenario, but wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene isn't cyclic. Oh wait, maybe it's breaking and reforming the double bond in a different position.

Wait, metathesis can also lead to the formation of different alkenes. The reaction mechanism involves the breaking of the original double bond and the redistribution of the substituents. So the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. The molecule is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But with a methyl branch on the third carbon. So it's CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the formula is CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3? Wait, no, maybe I should write the structure correctly.

Wait, pent means five carbons. 3-methylpent-1-ene would be: the double bond is between C1 and C2. Then C3 has a methyl group. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? Wait, no. Let me count. For pent-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. Then the other carbons are C3, C4, C5. So 3-methyl would be a methyl group on C3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Wait, that can't be right because that would be six carbons. Oh wait, no. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that adds up to 5 carbons. Let me check: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So the structure is CH₂=CHCH(CH3)
