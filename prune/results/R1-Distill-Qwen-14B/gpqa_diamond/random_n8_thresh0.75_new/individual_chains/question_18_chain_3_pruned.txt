Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances, and I'm trying to figure out the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

So the problem gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, each with different masses. Star_1 is 1.5 solar masses, and Star_2 is 1.2. But wait, I don't think the mass directly affects the abundance ratios, unless it's about something like stellar evolution, but the question says to use the EW method and LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), so maybe mass isn't the focus here.

The elemental abundances given are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Oh, right, those square brackets denote the logarithmic abundance ratios. So [X/Y] = log(n_X / n_Y) - log(n_X / n_Y)_sun. So it's the difference relative to the Sun's abundance.

I also have the Sun's photospheric composition: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7. Wait, why 12 plus? Oh, because in stellar atmospheres, they often scale the logarithm of the number density ratios. So for hydrogen, the scale is typically set such that log(n_H/n_H) is 12. So for the Sun, log(nFe/nH)
