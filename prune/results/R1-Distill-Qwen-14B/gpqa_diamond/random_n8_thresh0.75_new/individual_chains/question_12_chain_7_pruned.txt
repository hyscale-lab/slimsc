Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, let's see what I remember from my classes. 

The problem states that a Pi(+) is stationary and decays into a muon(+) and a neutrino. The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV and mu is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energy of each product particle, I think. The options are A, B, C, D with different values.

Wait, decay processes... Oh right, in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. So the initial momentum is zero since Pi is stationary. So the total momentum of the products must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. 

But neutrinos are tricky because their mass is so small, almost zero. So the neutrino's mass can probably be neglected in this calculation. That simplifies things because the neutrino's energy would be approximately equal to its momentum (since E = pc for massless particles), right?

The decay equation is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. So the initial energy is just the rest energy of the pion, which is m_pi * c², but since we're using MeV, and c² is incorporated, it's just 139.6 MeV. 

The muon, on the other hand, has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV. The neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so we can treat it as zero. 

When the pion decays, the total energy of the products must equal the initial rest energy of the pion. So the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino is 139.6 MeV.

And since their momenta are equal and opposite, the total momentum is zero. So let's denote the momentum of the muon as p, and the neutrino's as p (same magnitude) but opposite direction. 

The total energy is the sum of the muon's total energy (E_mu) and the neutrino's energy (E_nu). E_mu is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2 ? Wait, no, because in units where c=1, E = sqrt(p² + m²). So, E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²), and E_nu = p, since for neutrino, m_nu ≈ 0.

So the equation is:
E_mu + E_nu = m_pi
Which is sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p = m_pi

Let me plug the numbers in. m_pi is 139.6 MeV, m_mu is 105.7 MeV.

So sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Hmm, let's denote x as p. Then the equation becomes sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) + x = 139.6.

I need to solve for x. Let me subtract x from both sides: sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - x.

Then square both sides: x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expanding right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*x + x².

So, x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

The x² terms cancel out. So:

105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6 x

Let me compute the squares. 105.7 squared is approximately 105.7 * 105.7. Let's calculate: 100^2 is 10000, 5^2 is 25, 0.7^2 is 0.49. Cross terms: 2*(100)(5.7) = 1140, and 2*(100)(0.7)=140, and 2*(5.7)(0.7)=7.98. Hmm, maybe another approach: 105.7^2 = (105 + 0.7)^2 = 105² + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7². 105² is 11025, 2*105*0.7 is 147, 0.7² is 0.49. So 11025 +147=11172, +0.49=11172.49 ≈11172.5.

Similarly, 139.6^2: Let's compute. 140^2 is 19600. 140-0.4=139.6. So (140 - 0.4)^2=140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 -112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

So plug back into equation:

11172.5 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 x

Rearranging:

2*139.6 x = 19488.16 - 11172.5

Compute 19488.16 -11172.5 = 8315.66

So 2*139.6 x =8315.66 → x = 8315.66 / (2*139.6)

Calculate denominator: 2*139.6=279.2.

x=8315.66 / 279.2 ≈ let's see. 279.2 * 30=8376. That's a bit more than 8315.66. So 29.8?

Wait, 279.2 *29.8 = let's compute 279
