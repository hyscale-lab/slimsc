Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking for the energy of RHIC such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is lithium with 3 neutrons. So, first, I think I need to figure out what nucleus X is. Lithium usually has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it lithium-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So X is Li-6.

Next, I remember that in particle accelerators, the energy of the particles is often given in terms of their kinetic energy or total energy. But wait, in high-energy physics, the energy usually refers to the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy. So I'll need to calculate the total energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c.

The formula I think I need is the relativistic energy equation. The total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy (m*c²). Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's compute gamma first.

Let me calculate gamma. The formula is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Plugging in v = 0.96c: v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, since 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, let me double-check that. 1/0.28 is approximately 3.5714, yes.

Now, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The nucleus consists of protons and neutrons. Each proton is about 938 MeV/c², and each neutron is similar. So for Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So total rest mass is 6 * 938 MeV. Let me compute that: 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV. Oh wait, but wait a second. The actual mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the sum of its parts due to binding energy and mass defect. However, in high-energy physics, when calculating rest mass energy, they often use the sum of the individual masses because the binding energy is negligible compared to the rest mass energy of the nucleons. So I'll proceed with 6 * 938 MeV.

So, m = 6 * 938 MeV/c² = 5628 MeV/c². Converting that to GeV because the options are in GeV: 5628 MeV = 5.628 GeV.

So the total energy E is gamma * m*c². Gamma is approximately 3.5714, and m*c² is
