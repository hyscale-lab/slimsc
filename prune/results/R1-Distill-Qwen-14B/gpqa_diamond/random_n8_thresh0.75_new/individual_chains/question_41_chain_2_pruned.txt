Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through a glass block, and the block is itself moving. Hmm, I need to figure out the speed of the light relative to the observer in the lab. Let me think step by step.

Alright, the setup: a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. Wait, same direction as the beam and towards the observer? That might be a bit confusing. So the glass is moving towards the observer but in the same direction the light is going? Hmm, maybe that means the glass is moving forward, and the light is moving with it, but the glass's motion is towards the observer. Or perhaps the glass is moving in the direction the light is going, but the light is moving toward the observer? Wait, no. The glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is also moving towards the observer? Or maybe the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam in the lab frame. Hmm, the wording is a bit tricky.

Wait, the problem states: the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Oh, okay, so the beam is moving toward the observer in the lab frame. And the glass is moving along with the beam towards the observer. So the glass's velocity is in the same direction as the beam, which is toward the observer.

But wait, the beam is inside the glass, right? Because it's propagating through the glass. So the speed of light in the glass is c/n, but that's in the frame of the glass. But the glass itself is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So I think I need to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab, taking into account both the glass's motion and the light's motion within the glass.

Wait, but I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. Oh wait, but the problem doesn't mention anything about relativistic speeds, and the options have terms like n*v, so maybe it's using the classical approach, like Galilean addition.

Hmm, Galilean addition would say that the speed of the light in the lab frame is the speed of the light in the glass frame plus the speed of the glass. But wait, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, so the light's
