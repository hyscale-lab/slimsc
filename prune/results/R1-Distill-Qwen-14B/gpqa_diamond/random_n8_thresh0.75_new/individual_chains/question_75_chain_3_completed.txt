Okay, so I need to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the mouse model. Let's see what the problem is.

The setup is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. They added a sequence for the HA (hemagglutinin) tag at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary cells, but the protein isn't overexpressing. They looked at the construct's plus strand sequence and found an issue.

Looking at the options: The problem might be in the DNA sequence. Let me think about each option.

Option A: Missense mutation in the HA sequence. If the HA sequence has a mutation, maybe the tag isn't recognized, but would that stop expression? Probably not; the protein might still be made but not detected. But the question is about overexpression, so maybe the construct isn't expressed at all.

Option B: Ribosome terminating early. That would mean a premature stop codon somewhere. Let me look at the sequence. I should check for in-frame stop codons. The sequence starts with ATG (which is methionine, the start codon). Let me go through it. The plus strand starts with ATG, so the coding sequence is from there.

Wait, but the sequence given is the plus strand. So the coding sequence is from ATG to the end. But wait, the entire sequence is the plus strand, but in the actual mRNA, it's the complementary minus strand that's translated. Hmm, no. Wait, the plasmid's plus strand is the same as the coding sequence, right? Because the gene is cloned in the forward direction. So when the mRNA is made, it's the same as the plus strand (except T becomes U). So the given sequence is the coding sequence.

Looking through the sequence, I should look for any in-frame stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA). Let me scan the sequence.

Looking at the beginning: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA... Wait, TGA is a stop codon. Oh wait, the sequence has TGA. Let me check the exact part.

The sequence is 5' ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Looking for TGA or other stop codons. Let me count the triplets.

From the start:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ... Oh wait, there's a TGA at position where? Let me look:

Breaking into triplets:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ...

So after the initial ATG (start), next is TAC, then CCA, TAC, GAT, GTT, CCA, GAT, TAC, GCC, AAA, then TGA. So the 12th codon is TGA, which is a stop signal. So the DNA sequence has a TGA at position 30-32 (assuming triplets: ATG is 1-3, then TAC 4-6, etc. So the 35th nucleotide would be the third in the 12th codon, which is A in TGA. So the 12th codon is TGA, which is a stop codon.

That's a problem. Because the ribosome would terminate translation here, leading to a truncated protein, or no protein at all if the construct isn't expressed. So the gene is introducing a stop codon early in the sequence. That's why the protein isn't being overexpressed.

So the issue is that the coding sequence has an early stop codon. That would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early, resulting in no or a small protein. So the problem is the presence of a premature stop codon.

Looking at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would be the case because of the TGA.

Wait, but the actual sequence in the gene, is TGA present? Let me make sure. The plus strand has the coding sequence, which is the same as the mRNA. So the mRNA would have UGA at that point, which is a stop codon for the ribosome. So when the mRNA is translated, the ribosome would stop at UGA, leading to a short peptide.

So the construct is introducing a stop codon right after the HA tag, which would prevent the full-length protein from being made.

So the reason the protein isn't overexpressed is that there's a premature stop codon, causing early termination.

Looking at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early. So the answer would be B.

Another possibility: option D says the tRNA for UAA doesn't exist. But UAA is a stop codon, and all stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs. So D isn't correct because there's no tRNA for stop codons.

So the correct answer is B.


The issue lies in the sequence of the construct provided. The plus strand of the coding sequence starts with the start codon `ATG` but contains a premature stop codon, `TGA`, at the 12th codon. This stop codon is recognized by the ribosome during translation, causing it to terminate prematurely. As a result, the full-length GADD45G protein with the HA tag is not expressed, leading to the observed lack of overexpression.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: A missense mutation in the HA sequence would not prevent translation altogether; it might only affect detection or function. This does not explain the lack of overexpression.
- **Option B**: The presence of the `TGA` stop codon causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing the production of the full-length protein. This aligns with the observation.
- **Option C**: The lack of a linker sequence could theoretically lead to proteolysis, but the primary issue here is the premature stop codon, not post-translational degradation.
- **Option D**: Stop codons like `TGA` are not recognized by tRNAs but are instead decoded by release factors. This makes this option incorrect.

The root cause of the problem is the premature stop codon, which leads to early termination of translation. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: B
