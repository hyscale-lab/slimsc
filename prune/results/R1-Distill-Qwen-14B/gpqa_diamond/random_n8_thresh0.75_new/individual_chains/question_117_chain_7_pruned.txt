Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about which of the given organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Optical isomerism, or optical activity, occurs when a compound has chiral centers, meaning it lacks a plane of symmetry and has non-superimposable mirror images. So, basically, if a compound has a chiral center, it can show optical isomerism.

The options given are four different organic compounds, and we have four choices as answers. Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with this structure, but let's try to break it down. It's a biphenyl compound, meaning two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 6 and 2 on each ring, and they have nitro groups and carboxylate ester groups. So the structure probably has a central single bond between the two benzene rings. Now, in biphenyl structures, the possibility of isomerism arises from the rotation around the central bond. If the substituents on each benzene ring are in such a way that there's a possibility of enantiomers, then they could show optical isomerism. Wait, but for that to happen, the substituents would need to be arranged symmetrically. Let me think. If the two benzene rings each have groups that are mirror images, then the rotation could lead to different conformations. But do these compounds have chiral centers? Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Wait, but if the substituents are in positions that make the entire molecule chiral, then it can have optical isomers. Alternatively, the biphenyl itself can have optical isomerism if there's no plane of symmetry. I'm not entirely sure about this one, but I'll come back to it.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's see. The structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH2-OH? Wait, no. Wait, propanoate would be -OOCR, where R is CH2CH2OH... Wait, no. Let me draw it out. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, propanoic acid is
