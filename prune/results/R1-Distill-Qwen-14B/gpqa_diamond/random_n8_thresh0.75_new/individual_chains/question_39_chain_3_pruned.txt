Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, I remember that wave functions need to be normalized, which probably is key here. 

The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wait a second. The wave function should be a complex function, right? But typically, the normalization involves the integral of the absolute square of the wave function. Oh, right, the absolute square is the wave function multiplied by its complex conjugate.

Wait, in this case, looking at the wave function, it's expressed as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when I take the complex conjugate, it would be (a / sqrt(1+x)) +0.5i. 

But wait, when I take the absolute square, I multiply the wave function by its conjugate. Let me write this out. 

The wave function ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1 + x)] - 0.5i. 

The complex conjugate ψ*(x) = [a / sqrt(1 + x)] + 0.5i.

So ψ*ψ would be [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5i)(-0.5i) + the cross terms. Wait, wait, let me actually compute it properly.

ψ(x) * ψ*(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i] * [a
