Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. Hmm, the question is asking about the energy of RHIC such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li-6? Because lithium typically has 3 protons, and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6, atomic number 3, mass number 6. 

Wait, no, wait. Wait, Li (lithium) has atomic number 3. So if it has 3 neutrons, that's 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So Li-6. So the mass number is 6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus.

Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. So I need to calculate the total energy of the nucleus when it's moving at a speed of 0.96c. But wait, RHIC is a collider, so the energy would be the kinetic energy or the total energy? Wait, the question says, "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." Oh, right, so RHIC accelerates these ions to a certain energy, and here it's at 0.96c. So I think the question is asking for the total energy, which is gamma times the rest energy.

But wait, in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of the collider, sometimes it's the kinetic energy. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no. RHIC's energy is given as the total energy, I think. Wait, maybe no. Wait, let me think. The energy given in the options is in GeV. So I need to figure out the correct formula.

The speed is 0.96c, so I can calculate gamma (Lorentz factor) first. 

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's plug in v=0.96c.

So v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

Taking square root: sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So 1/0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Let me check: 0.28 *3.5714 = 1. So yes.

So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a lithium-6 nucleus is needed. The mass can be found using the atomic mass. Let me think: the atomic mass of a Li-6 atom is approximately... I don't remember exact values, but perhaps I can calculate it. Alternatively, I might find the mass of the nucleus in terms of u (atomic mass units). Li-6 has a mass number of 6, so it's 6 u approximately? But wait, not exactly because of binding energy, but for such rough calculations, perhaps we can approximate it as 6 u.

Wait, but the exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.0121 u. Let me think, because each proton is about 1.007276 u, each neutron is about 1.008665 u. So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So 3*(1.007276 +1.008665) = 3*(2.015941) = 6.047823 u. But wait, the actual isotope mass is slightly less than that due to binding energy. Hmm, but maybe the problem expects us to use the rest mass as 6 u, but perhaps it's better to use exact numbers.

Wait, the exact mass of ^6Li is about 6.01214 amu. Let me confirm that. Yeah, from standard tables, the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.01214 u. So the rest mass energy is m c². Since 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c², so m c² is 6.01214 * 931.5 MeV.

Wait, but calculating that:

6.01214 * 931.5 = let me compute that.

First, 6 * 931.5 = 5589.0 MeV. Then, 0.01214 *931.5≈ 0.01214 *900 =10.926, and the rest is about 0.01214*31.5= ~0.382. So total approximately 11.308 MeV. So 5589 +11.308 = 5600.308 MeV. So approximately 5600.308 MeV, which is 5.6003 GeV.

So the rest energy E_rest = m c² ≈5.6003 GeV.

Then, the total energy E = gamma * E_rest.

Gamma is approximately 3.5714, so E ≈3.5714 *5.6003 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3.5 *5.6 is 19.6. 0.0714 *5.6 is around 0.398. So total is roughly 19.6 +0.398=19.998 GeV, approximately 20 GeV. But wait, looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. Hmm. But wait, perhaps my calculation is a bit rough. Let's do it more accurately.

Compute gamma more precisely. v=0.96c.

v² = (0.96)^2 c² =0.9216 c².

So 1 - v²/c² = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 exactly, because 0.28²=0.0784. So gamma =1/0.28= 3.5714285714...

So E_rest is 5.6003 GeV.

E =3.5714285714 *5.6003 GeV.

Let me compute 3.5714285714 *5.6003.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.6003:

Let me do it step by step.

3.57142857 *5 = 17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6003 = ?

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.14285714.

3.57142857 *0.0003=0.00107143.

So 0.6003 is 0.6 +0.0003, so the product is 2.14285714 + 0.00107143=2.14392857.

So total is 17.85714285 +2.14392857= 20.00107142 GeV.

Wait, that's approximately 20.001 GeV. So about 20.001 GeV. The options don't have exactly that. Let me see the options again:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

Wait, our calculation gives approximately 20.001 GeV, but option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher. Maybe I approximated E_rest too much.

Wait, perhaps I should compute E_rest more accurately.

Earlier, I approximated E_rest as 5.6003 GeV. Let me compute it more precisely.

The exact mass of ^6Li is 6.012142 amu.

So m =6.012142 u.

Each u is 931.494063 MeV/c².

So E_rest =6.012142 *931.494063 MeV.

Compute:

6 *931.494063 =5588.964378 MeV.

0.012142 *931.494063 = let's compute that.

0.01 *931.494063 =9.31494063.

0.002142 *931.494063 = let me compute 0.002 *931.494 =1.862988, and 0.000142 *931.494≈0.13224. So total is 1.862988 +0.13224=1.995228.

So 0.012142 *931.494063=9.31494063 +1.995228≈11.3101686 MeV.

So E_rest =5588.964378 MeV +11.3101686 MeV= 5600.2745466 MeV.

Convert to GeV: 5.6002745466 GeV.

So more precisely, E_rest≈5.6002745 GeV.

Now, compute gamma * E_rest: gamma is 3.5714285714.

So 3.5714285714 *5.6002745.

Let me compute this more accurately.

Compute 3.5714285714 * 5.6002745.

Well, 3.5714285714 is approximately 25/7, since 25/7 is about 3.5714.

So 25/7 *5.6002745 = (25 *5.6002745 ) /7.

25 *5.6002745 = 140.0068625.

Divide by 7: 140.0068625 /7 =20.00098036 GeV.

So about 20.00098 GeV.

But looking at the options, the closest is option C: 20.132 GeV, and option D is 21.419 GeV. Hmm, but my calculation is about 20 GeV. So why isn't there an option near 20 GeV? Wait, the options are A: 18.475, B:23.069, C:20.132, D:21.419.

Hmm, so our calculation is ~20 GeV, but the closest is option C at 20.132. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation because I treated the nucleus as a point particle with rest mass 6.01214 u. But wait, in reality, when you're considering a nucleus moving at high speeds, you have to also account for the binding energy perhaps? Or maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the kinetic energy rather than the total energy. Because sometimes, when people say the energy of the collider, they refer to the kinetic energy, not the total (rest + kinetic). Let me think: RHIC's energy per beam is given as the total energy, but sometimes it's given as the kinetic energy.

Wait, the question says, what is the energy of RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c. So perhaps it's the total energy, but maybe the initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the question is considering the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Let me see. The kinetic energy K is (gamma -1) m c².

So in that case, K = (gamma-1)*E_rest.

Gamma is about 3.5714, so gamma-1 is 2.5714.

Then K=2.5714 *5.6002745 GeV ≈14.398 GeV. But that's not one of the options either. Hmm. So that can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Oh wait, the energy of the collider is usually the kinetic energy per particle, but perhaps Li-6 is a heavy ion, so maybe it's being used as a projectile, but perhaps in the lab frame, but no, RHIC is a collider, so it's colliding two beams.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the total energy, so perhaps the calculation is correct, but perhaps the exact value of gamma is a bit more precise.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me recompute gamma.

v=0.96c.

v²/c² = (0.96)^2 =0.9216.

1 - v²/c² =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28 exactly. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

So no mistake there.

Hmm. So why is option C 20.132? Let me compute more accurately:

E_rest =5.6002745 GeV.

E_total =3.57142857 *5.6002745.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.6002745.

Let me compute this step by step.

Let me write 3.57142857 as 357142857/100000000 to make it precise, but perhaps it's easier to just calculate 3.57142857 *5.6002745.

Compute 3 *5.6002745 =16.8008235.

0.57142857 *5.6002745 = let's compute that.

0.5 *5.6002745 =2.80013725.

0.07142857 *5.6002745 ≈0.07142857 *5.6 ≈0.4011764, but more accurately:

5.6002745 *0.07142857 = let's compute:

5.6002745 *0.07 =0.392019215

5.6002745 *0.00142857≈5.6002745 *0.00142857= approx 0.008000000.

So total ≈0.392019215 +0.008=0.400019215.

So 0.07142857 *5.6002745≈0.4000192.

So 0.5 *5.6002745=2.80013725, plus 0.4000192=3.20015645.

So 3.57142857 *5.6002745=3 *5.6 +0.57142857 *5.6002745 =16.8008235 +3.20015645=20.00097995 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.001 GeV.

But the options don't have 20.001, but option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Wait, perhaps I should check the exact mass.

Wait, the exact mass of ^6Li is 6.012143 amu.

Wait, but I'm using 931.494063 MeV/u.

So E_rest =6.012143 *931.494063 MeV.

Compute this precisely.

6 *931.494063=5588.964378 MeV.

0.012143 *931.494063 = let's compute.

0.01 *931.494063=9.31494063 MeV.

0.002143 *931.494063 = let's compute 0.002 *931.494063=1.862988126 MeV.

0.000143 *931.494063≈0.132975 MeV.

So sum: 1.862988126 +0.132975=1.995963126 MeV.

So 0.002143 part=1.995963126 MeV.

So the total for 0.012143 is 9.31494063 +1.995963126=11.310903756 MeV.

So E_rest =5588.964378 +11.310903756=5600.275281756 MeV.

Which is 5.600275281756 GeV.

So E_rest=5.600275281756 GeV.

Now, gamma=3.5714285714.

So E =gamma * E_rest=3.5714285714 *5.600275281756.

Let me compute this accurately.

3.5714285714 ×5.600275281756

Let me break it down:

3.5714285714 ×5 =17.857142857.

3.5714285714 ×0.600275281756= ?

First, 3.5714285714 ×0.6 =2.1428571428.

3.5714285714 ×0.000275281756= approx 0.00098 (since 3.5714285714 ×0.000275 is about 0.00098).

So 0.600275281756 is approximately 0.6 +0.000275281756.

So the product is 2.1428571428 + (3.5714285714 *0.000275281756).

Compute 3.5714285714 *0.000275281756:

Approximately, 3.5714285714 *0.000275= 0.000980.

So the product is approximately 2.1428571428 +0.000980 ≈2.1438371428 MeV.

So the entire E is 17.857142857 +2.1438371428 =20.0009799998 GeV.

Which is about 20.001 GeV.

So again, around 20.001 GeV. So none of the options is exactly that. The closest option is C:20.132, but that's about 0.13 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait wait, wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Because the speed is 0.96c, so let me compute gamma precisely.

v = 0.96c.

v² = (0.96)^2 c² =0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28.

So gamma =1/0.28=3.571428571428571...

So that's correct.

Hmm. Perhaps I'm missing the fact that the nucleus X is moving at 0.96c, but the energy is in the center-of-mass frame or something else. Or perhaps the problem is considering the kinetic energy, but that leads to lower energy, which doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the total energy, but perhaps the problem is considering the energy per nucleon. Wait, no, because the problem says 'nucleus X', so it's the entire nucleus.

Wait, maybe I should compute the relativistic energy using the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Let me see, perhaps I'm using the wrong mass.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the mass is the sum of the protons and neutrons, without considering binding energy? That would make the mass sum to 3*(1.007276 +1.008665)=3*(2.015941)=6.047823 u. So m=6.047823 u.

So E_rest =6.047823 u *931.494063 MeV/u.

6 *931.494063=5588.964378 MeV.

0.047823 *931.494063 = let's compute:

0.04 *931.494063=37.25976252 MeV.

0.007823 *931.494063≈ 7.3076 MeV (since 0.007 *931.494=6.520458, 0.000823 *931.494≈0.76674, so total ~7.2872).

So total E_rest=5588.964378 +37.25976252 +7.2872=5588.964378 +44.54696252=5633.51134052 MeV=5.63351134 GeV.

So E_rest=5.6335 GeV.

Gamma is 3.5714285714.

So E=3.5714285714 *5.63351134.

Compute that.

3.5714285714 *5=17.857142857.

3.5714285714 *0.63351134 ≈ let me compute:

0.6 *3.5714285714=2.1428571428.

0.03351134 *3.5714285714= approx 0.11946.

So total for 0.63351134: 2.142857 +0.11946 ≈2.262317.

So E=17.857142857 +2.262317=20.119459 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.119 GeV. Which is close to option C:20.132 GeV.

Ah, wait, so perhaps using the sum of individual nucleon masses (without considering binding energy) gives a higher energy, which brings the result closer to option C.

But wait, why would you use the sum of the individual nucleons without considering binding energy? Because the binding energy is the energy that holds the nucleus together, so when you split it, you release that energy. So the rest mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons. So if I use the exact mass of the nucleus (which is lower than the sum), then E_rest is 5.60027 GeV, and E=20.001 GeV.

But if I use the sum of individual masses (without considering binding energy), the E_rest is higher, 5.6335 GeV, leading to a total energy of ~20.119 GeV, which is close to option C:20.132.

But why would the problem expect me to use the sum of individual masses? Because the mass of the nucleus is given as Li with 3 neutrons, which is Li-6. The question states "nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons." So Li-6's exact mass is 6.01214 u.

So perhaps the correct way is to use 6.01214 u, giving E_rest=5.60027 GeV, leading to E=20.001 GeV, but that's not any of the options. Hmm.

But wait, perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Let me compute that:

Kinetic energy K = (gamma -1) * m c².

Gamma is 3.5714285714, so gamma-1=2.5714285714.

E_rest=5.60027 GeV.

So K=2.5714285714 *5.60027≈14.399 GeV.

But that's still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in gamma. Let me recheck the gamma calculation.

v=0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer is 20.001 GeV, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the energy is the total energy including the rest mass, but multiplied by 2, because it's a collider with two beams.

Wait, no, RHIC is a collider where two beams of ions collide. Each beam has energy E, so the total energy in the center of mass frame would be higher, but the question is about the energy per beam. Because the question says, "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So each nucleus is accelerated to 0.96c, so the energy per nucleus is E =gamma m c².

But perhaps I should compute it again, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute gamma*m*c² with m=6.01214 u.

m=6.01214 u ×931.494063 MeV/u =5.60027 GeV.

gamma=3.57142857.

So E=3.57142857 ×5.60027 GeV =20.001 GeV.

Again, same result. So I'm confident that the correct value is about 20.001 GeV.

But the options don't have that. Hmm. The closest option is C:20.132 GeV.

Ah! Wait a minute, perhaps the mistake is that I used the rest mass of the nucleus, but perhaps the nucleus is a composite of particles, and the energy should include the kinetic energy of the constituent particles? But that's not how relativistic energies work; the nucleus as a whole has a total energy, which is gamma m c².

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the energy per nucleon. Let me think: Li-6 has 6 nucleons. So gamma * (m_n c²) *A, but wait, no, that's not right. The total energy of the nucleus is gamma * M * c², where M is the total mass.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the nucleus as composed of protons and neutrons, and each nucleon has its own energy. But no, the nucleus is moving as a whole, so the total energy is gamma M c², as I did before.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_rest. Let me check once more.

m =6.01214 u.

m c² =6.01214 ×931.494063 MeV.

Compute 6 ×931.494063=5588.964378 MeV.

0.01214 ×931.494063= let's compute 0.01 ×931.494063=9.31494063, 0.00214 ×931.494063=0.002 ×931.494063=1.862988126, 0.00014 ×931.494063=0.130409169.

So sum is 9.31494063 +1.862988126=11.17792876 +0.130409169=11.30833793 MeV.

So E_rest =5588.964378 +11.30833793 =5600.272716 MeV=5.600272716 GeV.

So that's accurate.

So E=gamma * E_rest =3.57142857 ×5.600272716.

Compute 3.57142857 ×5.600272716.

Let me compute it precisely:

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.600272716.

Let's compute 3.57142857 ×0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 ×0.000272716 = approx 0.000973.

So 0.600272716 ×3.57142857 ≈ 2.142857142 +0.000973=2.143830142.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.143830142=20.00097299 GeV.

So approximately 20.001 GeV. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest is option C:20.132.

Wait, but that's a significant difference. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation, and the correct gamma is actually higher.

Wait, wait, another approach: perhaps the speed is 0.96c, but perhaps the calculation of gamma is incorrect.

Wait, let me recompute gamma with more precise v.

v=0.96c.

v²= (0.96)^2 c²=0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

Yes, correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. The calculation suggests it's about 20 GeV, but the options don't have that. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV.

Perhaps I should recheck the mass of Li-6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for c or other constants.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the rest mass is taken as 6 u, without considering the exact isotope mass.

If m=6 u, then E_rest=6 ×931.494063 MeV=5588.964378 MeV=5.588964 GeV.

Gamma=3.57142857.

E=3.57142857 ×5.588964 GeV.

Compute:

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.588964= let's compute.

0.5 ×3.57142857=1.785714285.

0.088964 ×3.57142857≈0.3173 (because 0.08 ×3.57=0.2856, 0.008964 ×3.57≈0.0319, sum=0.3175).

So 1.785714285 +0.3175=2.103214285.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.103214285≈19.960357 GeV.

Which is approximately 19.96 GeV, which is closer to option C:20.132? No, but option C is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the error is in the way the question states the speed. Maybe it's not 0.96c but 0.96 times the speed of light in a different unit, but that's unlikely.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. My calculation consistently gives around 20 GeV, but option C is 20.132. Let me see what 3.57142857 ×5.60027528 would be with a calculator.

Wait, perhaps I can compute more accurately:

5.60027528 * 3.57142857.

Let me write it as:

5.60027528 ×3 =16.80082584.

5.60027528 ×0.57142857.

Compute 5.60027528 ×0.5 =2.80013764.

5.60027528 ×0.07142857 ≈0.40000000.

So sum is 2.80013764 +0.40000000=3.20013764.

So total E=16.80082584 +3.20013764=20.00096348 GeV.

So 20.00096 GeV. So the correct answer should be approximately 20.001 GeV, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for c. But no, c is a universal constant.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relativistic energy formula, but perhaps I made a mistake in gamma's calculation.

Wait, let me compute 1 - (0.96)^2 again.

(0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the speed is 0.96c, but the energy is given per nucleon. So the nucleus has 6 nucleons, so the total energy would be 6 ×gamma × m_nucleon c².

Wait, but that would complicate things. The nucleus's total energy is gamma*M c², where M is the total mass. So that approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be approximately 20 GeV, but the options don't have that, so perhaps I made a mistake in the mass.

Wait, let me check another source. The exact mass of ^6Li is 6.012142 u. So E_rest=6.012142 ×931.494 MeV.

Which is 6.012142 ×931.494 = let me compute.

6 ×931.494=5588.964.

0.012142 ×931.494 = let's compute:

0.01 ×931.494=9.31494.

0.002142 ×931.494= approx 0.002 ×931.494=1.862988, 0.000142 ×931.494≈0.132. So total 1.862988 +0.132=1.994988.

So sum is 9.31494 +1.994988=11.309928.

So E_rest=5588.964 +11.309928=5600.273928 MeV=5.600273928 GeV.

So E_rest=5.600273928 GeV.

Gamma=3.5714285714.

E=gamma * E_rest=3.5714285714 ×5.600273928.

Let me compute precisely:

3 ×5.600273928=16.80082178.

0.5714285714 ×5.600273928.

Compute 0.5 ×5.600273928=2.800136964.

0.0714285714 ×5.600273928: let me compute 5.600273928 ×0.0714285714.

5.600273928 ×0.07=0.392019175.

5.600273928 ×0.0014285714= approx 0.008000000.

So sum is 0.392019175 +0.008=0.400019175.

So 0.5714285714 ×5.600273928=2.800136964 +0.400019175=3.200156139.

So total E=16.80082178 +3.200156139=20.00097792 GeV.

So approximately 20.001 GeV.

Again, same result.

Hmm. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, but my calculation doesn't reach it. Or perhaps the problem expects the use of a different approach, like considering the kinetic energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the speed as 0.96 times the speed of light in the lab frame, but in the lab frame, the energy would be different. But RHIC is a collider, so both beams are moving towards each other, so the lab frame is different.

Wait, but the question is about the energy of the collider so that the speed is 0.96c. That would imply that each beam has a speed of 0.96c in the lab frame. But in reality, in a collider, the speeds are opposite and the total energy is higher in the center-of-mass frame. But the question is specifically about the speed of each nucleus, so perhaps it's considering each nucleus moving at 0.96c in the lab frame.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should think that the answer is approximately 20 GeV, but the closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately the product gamma * E_rest.

gamma=3.5714285714.

E_rest=5.600273928 GeV.

So 3.5714285714 *5.600273928.

Let me compute this using a calculator-like approach.

3.5714285714 ×5.600273928.

We can write this as (3 + 0.5 + 0.0714285714) ×5.600273928.

=3×5.600273928 +0.5×5.600273928 +0.0714285714×5.600273928.

3×5.600273928=16.800821784.

0.5×5.600273928=2.800136964.

0.0714285714×5.600273928:

Compute 5.600273928 ×0.07=0.392019175.

5.600273928 ×0.0014285714= approx 0.008000000.

So total is 0.392019175 +0.008=0.400019175.

So sum is 16.800821784 +2.800136964=19.600958748 +0.400019175=20.000977923 GeV.

So precisely 20.000977923 GeV, which rounds to 20.001 GeV.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option C:20.132 GeV, but I can't see why. Unless I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the speed is 0.96 times the speed of light, but in the lab frame, and the energy of the collider is the kinetic energy in the lab frame. But that would be a different approach.

Wait, no. The total energy in the lab frame is gamma m c². For a high-energy accelerator, the kinetic energy is approximately equal to the total energy when the rest mass is small compared to the kinetic energy. But in this case, the rest mass is 5.6 GeV, and the total energy is around 20 GeV, so the kinetic energy would be about 14.4 GeV, which isn't one of the options.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Based on my calculations, the energy should be approximately 20 GeV. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV. Perhaps the exact calculation would yield that, considering more decimal points or a more precise value of gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, v=0.96c.

v²/c² = (0.96)^2 =0.9216.

1 - v²/c²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.571428571428571...

So the exact value is 3.5714285714.

Wait, perhaps in the problem statement, the speed is 0.96c, but the calculation uses more precise gamma. Let me compute E precisely.

E_rest=5.600273928 GeV.

gamma=3.5714285714.

E=gamma * E_rest=3.5714285714 ×5.600273928.

Let me compute this accurately.

E=3.5714285714 ×5.600273928.

Breaking it down:

3.5714285714 ×5=17.857142857.

3.5714285714 ×0.600273928.

Compute 3.5714285714 ×0.6=2.14285714284.

3.5714285714 ×0.000273928=approx 0.000976.

So 0.600273928 ×3.5714285714=2.14285714284 +0.000976=2.14383314284.

So total E=17.857142857 +2.14383314284=20.0009759998 GeV.

So approximately 20.001 GeV. But none of the options match.

Hmm. At this point, perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I'm not seeing where the discrepancy arises. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the use of the sum of the individual nucleon masses, leading to a higher E_rest and thus a higher E.

If I use m=6.047823 u (sum of protons and neutrons), E_rest=6.047823 ×931.494063 MeV=5.6335 GeV.

Gamma=3.5714285714.

E=3.5714285714 ×5.6335=?

3 ×5.6335=16.9005.

0.5714285714 ×5.6335≈3.213 (since 0.5 ×5.6335=2.81675; 0.0714285714 ×5.6335≈0.403).

So 2.81675 +0.403=3.21975.

Total E=16.9005 +3.21975=20.12025 GeV.

That's about 20.120 GeV, which is very close to option C:20.132 GeV.

Ah! So perhaps the problem expects us to use the sum of the individual nucleon masses (without considering binding energy), leading to a higher E_rest and thus a higher total energy.

So the correct calculation using the sum would give approximately 20.12 GeV, which rounds to option C:20.132 GeV.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we calculate the total energy of the nucleus using relativistic mechanics. The total energy is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216
\]
\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
\]
\[
\sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28
\]
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Rest Mass Energy of the Li-6 Nucleus
The rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus is approximately \( 6.01214 \, \text{u} \), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.494063 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). Thus, the rest energy is:

\[
E_{\text{rest}} = 6.01214 \times 931.494063 \, \text{MeV} \approx 5600.274 \, \text{MeV} = 5.6003 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Total Energy of the Nucleus
The total energy is:

\[
E = \gamma E_{\text{rest}} = 3.5714 \times 5.6003 \, \text{GeV} \approx 20.001 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Reassessing the Options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.001 \, \text{GeV} \), but none of the options exactly match this value. The closest option is **C) 20.132 GeV**. To reconcile this discrepancy, it is possible that the problem assumes the sum of the individual nucleon masses (without accounting for binding energy). Using this approach, the rest mass energy is slightly higher, leading to a total energy closer to \( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Conclusion
Based on the calculations and the provided options, the most reasonable answer is:

**Answer: C**
