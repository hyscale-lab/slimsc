Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the mean free path of gas molecules in an electron microscope. Let me read the question again and think through it step by step.

Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) that's operating at 1000 kV. He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, which is less than 10^-9 Torr. The goal is to minimize gas molecules because, in electron microscopy, gas can cause scattering of the electron beam, which reduces image quality. So, he's trying to get rid of as much gas as possible.

Even after creating this ultra-high vacuum, some gas particles are still present. The mass spectrometer detected them. Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. In a vacuum, with low pressure, the mean free path is longer because there are fewer molecules to collide with.

Then, when Mike starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes. It's no longer λ1; it's now λ2. But the temperature in the sample compartment remains the same, so temperature shouldn't be a factor here.

Wait, why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is on? Hmm. So, without the electron beam, the gas molecules are just moving around, colliding with each other and the walls. But when the beam is on, the electrons are moving very fast. The electron beam would interact with the gas molecules, causing them to scatter.

I remember that the mean free path is affected by things like the density of the gas (pressure), temperature, and the cross-sectional area for collisions. But in this case, the pressure and temperature are the same, so why is the mean free path changing?

Wait, maybe the presence of the electron beam affects the gas. The electrons could be ionizing the gas molecules or causing them to move more. Oh, right—in electron microscopy, the electron beam can cause gas molecules to be ionized, creating charged particles. These charged particles might behave differently.

In particular, when a gas is ionized, the charged particles (ions or electrons) can be accelerated by the electric fields in the microscope. So, the ions might be repelled or attracted to certain areas, perhaps the walls or the sample. This could cause them to leave the compartment more quickly, effectively reducing the number of gas molecules in the system over time.

If the gas density decreases because some molecules are being removed (due to ionization and being pumped out), then the mean free path would increase. Because mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the pressure (or density) of the gas. Lower pressure → longer λ. So, initially, λ1 was measured under the vacuum, but when the beam starts, some gas is lost, leading to lower pressure, so λ2 would be longer than λ1. Wait, but the question says he initiated the beam and found that the mean free path changed. So, if the gas density decreases, λ should increase. But wait, the initial λ1 is already under ultra-high vacuum. If the electron beam is causing some gas to be removed (like via sputtering or pumping), then the pressure would drop, leading to a longer mean free path.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to scatter more. Wait, no, if there's lower density, the collisions between gas molecules would be less frequent, so the mean free path would be longer.

But wait, when the beam is on, the electrons might interact with the gas, causing more scattering events. Or maybe it's the other way around. Let me think: the mean free path is determined by the rate at which molecules collide with each other or with the walls. If the beam is on, perhaps the walls are getting bombarded by electrons, but the gas is still in the same compartment.

Wait, another angle: the mean free path without the beam (λ1) is determined by the gas in the chamber. When the beam is on, the electrons may cause the gas to expand or something. Or perhaps the beam's presence changes the effective pressure because the electrons are pushing the gas molecules away.

Wait, actually, the mean free path formula is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d^2*p), where d is the mean collision diameter, p is pressure, and k and T are Boltzmann's constant and temperature. So, if the pressure changes, λ changes. But in the problem, pressure is the same, so λ should be same. Or is the pressure changing because of the beam?

Wait, Mike measures λ1 under the vacuum state, but when the beam is on, perhaps the gas is being ionized and pumped out more efficiently. So the pressure would decrease, making λ longer. So λ2 would be longer than λ1.

Wait, but the question says Mike accurately determined the mean free path as λ1. So perhaps he calculated it using the known pressure, temperature, and volume. But when the beam is on, the pressure might not be the same as before because some gas is being removed. So in reality, the pressure is lower, leading to a longer mean free path.

But wait, the question states that the temperature is the same, but does it say the pressure is the same? Let me check the problem again. It says "the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (<1e-9 Torr) was λ1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature." So, he used the known pressure to calculate λ1.

But when the electron beam is on, does the pressure change? The problem says that when the beam is on, the mean free path is λ2, but the temperature is same. So if the pressure is same, λ should be same. But Mike observes a change.

Hmm. So perhaps his initial calculation (λ1) was based on the pressure before the beam was on, but during the beam operation, the pressure actually decreased. So the actual pressure is lower, so λ2 is larger than λ1.

But why would the pressure decrease? Because the electron beam could cause the gas to become ionized, and the ionized particles (like positive ions) might be repelled by the positively charged regions and get pushed towards the pump, thereby reducing the pressure in the compartment. This process is sometimes called "molecular pumping" or "ion drag." So the beam effectively helps in removing some of the gas, lowering the pressure.

If the pressure decreases, the mean free path increases because mean free path is inversely proportional to pressure. So λ2 is larger than λ1.

But wait, the problem states that the sample compartment has an ultra-high vacuum, so any gas is minimal. But Mike's measurement after the beam is started shows a different mean free path. So if the pressure decreased (because gas is being removed or pumped more effectively), λ2 would be longer than λ1.

So, λ2 is greater than λ1.

Looking at the options:

Option A: λ2 >= 1.22*λ1.

Option C: λ2 < λ1.

So, according to my reasoning, λ2 should be larger than λ1.

Wait, but wait another thought. The mean free path is determined by the density of gas. The electron beam may cause the gas to expand, or perhaps cause some heating? No, the temperature is same.

Alternatively, the scattering of electrons by gas molecules would actually increase the effective cross-section. But that's about electron scattering, not the gas's own collisions.

Wait, another angle: in the presence of the electron beam, the gas molecules may have a higher velocity, either due to heating or because of the beam's energy. If the molecules are moving faster, their mean free path would be longer because they cover more distance before colliding.

Wait, but the temperature is the same. So the root-mean-square speed is the same. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps because the electrons are being scattered by the gas, which affects the electron's path, but the gas's own mean free path is what's being measured. Hmm, but the question is about the mean free path of the gas molecules, not the electrons. So the presence of the electron beam doesn't directly affect the gas's own movement except perhaps through ionization.

So, ionization could cause the gas to be removed, leading to lower pressure and longer mean free path.

So, if the pressure is lower, the mean free path is longer. So λ2 is larger than λ1.

Looking at the options again, option A says λ2 >= 1.22 *λ1. But wait, why 1.22?

Wait, 1.22 is approximately sqrt( (π/2) ), which comes into play in the mean free path equation. Let me think. The mean free path λ is given by λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) * π * d^2 * P), where d is the collision diameter.

But perhaps in the initial calculation, pressure was known and λ1 calculated. But during the beam operation, the pressure drops, so λ2 increases. But how much?

Wait, Mike's observation is that λ2 is no longer λ1. So, λ2 could be either longer or shorter than λ1.

Wait, but Mike's measurement of λ1 was based on the initial conditions (vacuum state, pressure p). When the beam is on, the actual pressure may have changed because the gas is being removed, so the pressure is lower. Lower pressure → higher mean free path.

So, λ2 > λ1.

Looking at the options, option A is λ2 >= 1.22 λ1. But why 1.22? That is about sqrt( (π/2) ) ≈ 1.25, wait, actually 1.22 is approximately sqrt( (1.5) ), but maybe it's the factor from the collision integral.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam increases the effective pressure because the electrons are hitting the gas molecules and causing more scattering. Wait, but that would lower the mean free path.

Wait, no. Think again: When the beam is on, electrons are moving quickly and hitting gas molecules, causing them to scatter. But the gas's own mean free path is about their collisions with each other and the walls. Wait, does the presence of the electron beam affect the gas's own collisions? Or does it just pump gas away?

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Another approach: mean free path depends on the pressure. If the pressure is lower, the mean free path is longer.

In the initial state, when the vacuum is achieved, λ1 is calculated. But when the electron beam is turned on, the gas is being ionized and pumped out more efficiently, so the pressure is lower than before. Therefore, the mean free path λ2 = λ1 * (p_initial / p_final). Since p_final < p_initial, λ2 > λ1.

So, λ2 is greater than λ1. So, looking at the options, which option says λ2 is greater than λ1?

Options:

A) λ2 >= 1.22λ1

C) λ2 < λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 <1.22λ1

So, if λ2 is greater than λ1, then options A or D could apply. But why would it be at least 1.22 times?

Wait, perhaps because when the electron beam is on, the gas is being ionized, creating charged particles that are more effectively removed. So the pressure drops more than expected, leading to a larger increase in mean free path.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial calculation of λ1 didn't account for some factors that are now in play when the beam is on. For example, the electron beam may cause the gas to have more collisions with the walls, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam induces more movement in the gas molecules, effectively increasing the temperature, but the problem states that the temperature remains the same. So that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to have a higher effective pressure because the electrons are bombarding the gas, making the gas expand. But that would reduce the pressure, increasing the mean free path. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the beam is causing the gas to be expelled from the compartment, so the pressure is lower, leading to a higher mean free path. So λ2 is higher than λ1.

So which option is correct? The options are:

A) λ2 >=1.22λ1

C) λ2 <λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 <1.22λ1.

So, if λ2 is greater than λ1, then options A, D are possible.

But why would it be 1.22 times?

Wait, the mean free path equation is:

λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2) * π * d^2 * P )

So P is pressure. If P decreases, λ increases. But from where does 1.22 come?

Wait, perhaps the initial mean free path was calculated assuming a certain pressure, but when the beam is on, the pressure isn't the same. Let's think about the pressure dependence.

If the pressure drops by a factor, say, 1/2, then the mean free path would double.

Wait, but why would the pressure drop by a certain amount? Maybe due to the beam's effect, the pressure is lower.

But the question is, what can we conclude about λ2. The question says that Mike found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1, implying that λ2 is different.

So, the correct answer would be that λ2 is greater than λ1, since the pressure is lower. So, the options that have λ2 > λ1 are A and D.

But why would it be at least 1.22 times? Perhaps because when the beam is on, the effective pressure is lower, thus the mean free path increases beyond 1.22 times. Or perhaps, the problem is implying that the presence of the electron beam causes gas to be removed, so the pressure is lower, so the mean free path is longer.

But the options don't have anything beyond 1.22 except A. So, maybe the answer is C, but that would be if the mean free path decreased, which I don't think is the case.

Wait, perhaps I got the reasoning wrong. Maybe the presence of the beam causes more scattering of electrons, but that wouldn't affect the gas's mean free path. Alternatively, perhaps the beam causes the gas to get heated, increasing velocity, but the problem states temperature is same. So no.

Wait, another thought: maybe the initial calculation (λ1) was done under static conditions, but when the beam is on, the gas molecules are being constantly bombarded by electrons, which might cause them to have more momentum, effectively increasing their speed and thus their mean free path. But that's not possible because the temperature is same, so speed is same.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the beam causes gas molecules to be more likely to collide with the walls, but that would only change the mean free path if the effective pressure is higher. But that would make λ smaller, which contradicts earlier reasoning.

Hmm, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let's think again.

The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. In the absence of the beam, the gas molecules collide with each other and the walls. When the beam is on, the gas molecules also collide with the electrons, but since the electrons are much lighter, each collision would impart more energy to the gas molecule? Or perhaps the gas molecules don't collide with the electrons; the electrons are moving so fast that their collision cross-section is negligible. Alternatively, the electrons could cause the gas to ionize, which changes the dynamics.

Wait, the presence of the electron beam could cause more ionization of the gas. The ionized particles (like positive ions) can have a longer mean free path because they're charged and could be accelerated towards the walls or pumped out. So, the ionized gas leaves the compartment, effectively reducing the pressure. Therefore, the number of neutral gas molecules decreases, reducing the pressure, which increases the mean free path of the remaining gas molecules.

But wait, when the pressure is lower, the mean free path is higher. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

But the problem says that the sample compartment's temperature remains the same, so it doesn't affect the mean speed of the gas molecules. So, if the pressure is lower, λ increases.

So, λ2 > λ1.

Looking at the options, option A says λ2 >= 1.22λ1. Option D suggests that λ2 is between λ1 and 1.22λ1.

But why would it be at least 1.22 times? I'm not exactly sure, but perhaps the presence of the electron beam leads to a pressure lower than the initial, leading to a higher mean free path. So λ2 > λ1, which would mean that options A or D are possibilities.

But the initial mean free path λ1 was calculated, perhaps, based on the initial pressure, but when the beam is on, the pressure is lower, so λ2 is larger.

But the problem doesn't give any specific factors to determine whether λ2 is more or less than 1.22 times λ1. However, the question is asking what we can conclude about λ2. The options suggest that either λ2 is larger or smaller than λ1.

So, according to the reasoning, λ2 is larger than λ1. So, the options that fit are A or D.

But why would the answer be A or D?

Wait, perhaps the answer is C: λ2 < λ1. No, that contradicts my earlier reasoning.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to be more dense in a region, thereby increasing the collision rate and decreasing the mean free path. But that doesn't make sense because the overall pressure is lower.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of it another way. The mean free path is inversely proportional to pressure. So, if the pressure decreases, λ increases.

So, if the pressure is lower when the beam is on, λ2 would be larger than λ1. So, from the options, this would be options A or D.

But without knowing the exact pressure change, we can't say exactly how much larger λ2 is. So, perhaps the correct conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1.

Looking at the options, option A suggests λ2 is >= 1.22λ1, and option D says it's between λ1 and 1.22λ1.

But why would the factor be 1.22? Let me think about the formula. Maybe it's because when the gas is ionized, the effective cross-section changes.

Alternatively, perhaps when the electron beam is on, the effective pressure is lower, so λ2 is longer. So, perhaps λ2 is greater than λ1 by some factor, but the options don't specify exactly.

But the question asks what can we conclude about λ2. The possible conclusions are whether it's larger or smaller.

So, the correct answer is that λ2 is larger than λ1. So, the options are A and D.

But the initial scenario says that Mike accurately determined λ1 based on the vacuum state, which is already ultra-high. When the beam is on, some gas is removed, so the pressure is lower than the initial (which was already ultra-high). Wait, no, the initial state is <1e-9 Torr. If the beam causes some gas to be removed, the pressure would be even lower, which would mean the mean free path increases further.

Wait, but if the initial pressure is already 1e-9 Torr, which is extremely low, and the beam reduces it further, but perhaps not by a huge factor. So, the mean free path would increase, but by how much? Without knowing the exact pressure change, we can't tell if it's more or less than 1.22 times.

But the problem is a multiple-choice question, so perhaps the answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1, making option A a possibility. But why would λ2 be >=1.22λ1? That factor of 1.22 is roughly sqrt( (π/2) ) ≈ 1.25. Wait, perhaps the factor comes from the collision integral in the mean free path equation.

Wait, the mean free path equation uses the collision diameter, but in reality, the exact factor depends on the type of collisions. If the initial calculation (λ1) used a different assumption about the collision mode, perhaps when the beam is on, the collisions are different.

Alternatively, perhaps when the electron beam is on, the gas is in a different state, such as being partially ionized, which changes the effective cross-section. That could lead to a different factor in the mean free path equation.

Alternatively, perhaps the pressure doesn't change much, but the effective mean free path due to scattering with the beam is different. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: In the initial state, the mean free path is determined by the gas molecules colliding with each other and the walls. When the beam is on, the electrons are another source of scattering. So, the gas molecules now have more things to collide with (electrons), which would decrease the mean free path. But electrons are much lighter and moving very fast; would gas molecules collide with them?

Wait, gas molecules are much heavier than electrons, so when an electron hits a gas molecule, it's more like the electron bouncing off. The gas molecule's velocity wouldn't change much because of its much larger mass. So, the collision between the electron and gas molecule might not significantly affect the gas molecule's trajectory, so it wouldn't contribute much to the mean free path calculation.

Therefore, the main effect is that the gas is being removed from the compartment due to ionization, leading to lower pressure and longer mean free path. Hence, λ2 is larger than λ1.

So, the answer would be that λ2 is greater than λ1. Among the options, A and D are possibilities.

But the question is whether λ2 is greater than λ1, regardless of the exact factor. So, perhaps the correct answer is A, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but the options are:

A) λ2 >=1.22λ1

C) λ2 <λ1

So, if the mean free path increases, the correct options are A. But how certain am I that it's at least 1.22 times?

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam doesn't affect the mean free path of the gas molecules, so λ2 is equal to λ1. But the question says Mike found that it's no longer equal to λ1, so B is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the mean free path of the gas is unchanged because the pressure is the same. But earlier reasoning suggested that the pressure might drop, leading to a longer mean free path.

But the problem says Mike accurately determined λ1 based on vacuum state. So perhaps initially, the pressure was p, and when the beam is on, the pressure is still p. But why then would the mean free path change? Because the presence of the beam affects the gas's movement in some other way.

Maybe the electron beam causes the gas to be more ionized, which affects the effective cross-section for collisions. For example, ionized gas molecules may have a larger effective size, leading to more frequent collisions. That would decrease the mean free path.

Wait, if the gas becomes ionized, the ions have a larger size due to their charge cloud, so the collision cross-section increases. That would make the mean free path shorter. So, λ2 < λ1.

Wait, that's an opposite conclusion. So, if ionization increases the collision cross-section (d), then λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d^2*p) would decrease because d is larger.

So, in that case, λ2 would be less than λ1.

But how does ionization affect the collision cross-section? Neutral gas molecules have a certain size, but when ionized, they could have a larger effective size because they're charged, so their electric fields extend further, making them more likely to interact with other molecules.

So, if the collision cross-section increases, the mean free path would decrease.

Therefore, λ2 < λ1.

Which would make option C the correct answer.

Wait, but the problem states that the electron beam is turned on, so the gas is ionized. The ionized gas may have a larger cross-section, so the mean free path would be shorter.

So, in that case, λ2 < λ1.

So, the correct answer would be option C.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Earlier reasoning suggested that λ2 would be longer because pressure is lower, but now I'm thinking that because the collision cross-section increases due to ionization, λ2 is shorter.

Which is more significant?

I think the pressure change might be a bigger factor because in ultra-high vacuum, the pressure is already very low. If the beam causes even a slight drop in pressure, the mean free path would increase.

But if the collision cross-section increases, that would reduce the mean free path.

Which effect dominates?

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the ionized gas affects the mean free path in another way.

Wait, another thought: ionized gas particles could be accelerated by the electric fields in the microscope, which might cause them to leave the compartment more quickly, thereby reducing the pressure. So, the pressure decreases, leading to longer mean free paths.

But if the gas is ionized, the effective cross-section for neutral-neutral collisions increases, leading to shorter mean free paths.

So, two opposing factors: lower pressure (longer λ) and larger cross-section (shorter λ). Which effect is stronger?

I think the pressure might not change much because the initial pressure is already ultra-low. So, the change in cross-section due to ionization might be the dominant factor.

So, with ionization, the collision cross-section increases, leading to a shorter mean free path, so λ2 < λ1.

So, the correct answer would be option C: λ2 < λ1.

But earlier I thought that the pressure would drop, leading to a longer mean free path. But perhaps the effect of ionization on the cross-section is more significant.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to be removed, leading to lower pressure and longer mean free path. So, two factors: (1) lower pressure → longer λ, (2) ionization → larger cross-section → shorter λ. Which effect is stronger depends on the relative magnitudes.

In ultra-high vacuum, the pressure is so low that the mean free path is already very long. So, even a small change in pressure might have a larger impact than a change in cross-section.

But again, without knowing the relative magnitudes, it's hard to say.

But the problem says that upon starting the electron beam, Mike found that the mean free path was no longer λ1. So, perhaps the dominant effect is that the presence of the beam causes the gas to be more ionized, which leads to more frequent collisions (due to larger cross-section), thus reducing the mean free path.

Therefore, λ2 is less than λ1.

So, the correct answer is option C.


The question revolves around the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in an ultra-high vacuum (<10⁻⁹ Torr) within a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM). Initially, Mike determines the mean free path as λ₁ under the vacuum conditions, considering factors like pressure, temperature, and volume. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he observes a change in the mean free path to λ₂. The task is to determine the relationship between λ₂ and λ₁.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mean Free Path Formula**: The mean free path is given by  
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{kT}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \pi \cdot d^2 \cdot p}
   \]  
   where \(d\) is the collision diameter, \(p\) is the pressure, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The mean free path is inversely proportional to pressure and depends on the collision diameter.

2. **Effect of Electron Beam**:
   - When the electron beam is turned on, gas molecules can become ionized. Ionization increases the effective collision diameter (\(d\)) due to the extended charge cloud of the ions, leading to more frequent collisions between gas molecules.
   - Additionally, ionized particles (e.g., ions) may be accelerated by the electric fields in the microscope, causing them to be removed from the sample compartment. This removal reduces the gas density, lowering the pressure and increasing the mean free path.

3. **Competing Effects**:
   - **Lower Pressure**: Reduced pressure due to ionized gas being pumped out increases the mean free path (\(\lambda_2 > \lambda_1\)).
   - **Increased Collision Cross-Section**: Ionization increases the effective collision diameter (\(d\)), which decreases the mean free path (\(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\)).

4. **Dominant Effect**:
   - In ultra-high vacuum conditions, the pressure is already extremely low, so the reduction in pressure due to gas removal may have a smaller impact on the mean free path compared to the increase in collision cross-section caused by ionization.
   - Therefore, the dominant effect is likely the increase in collision cross-section due to ionization, leading to a shorter mean free path (\(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\)).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (\(\lambda_2 \geq 1.22 \lambda_1\))**: This suggests a significant increase in the mean free path, which is inconsistent with the dominant effect of ionization increasing the collision cross-section.
- **Option B (\(\lambda_2 = \lambda_1\))**: This implies no change in the mean free path, but the problem explicitly states that Mike observed a change, making this incorrect.
- **Option C (\(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\))**: This aligns with the reasoning that ionization increases the collision cross-section, leading to a shorter mean free path.
- **Option D (\(\lambda_1 < \lambda_2 < 1.22 \lambda_1\))**: This suggests a moderate increase in the mean free path, which is inconsistent with the dominant effect of ionization.

### Conclusion:
The presence of the electron beam causes ionization, increasing the collision cross-section and reducing the mean free path. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
