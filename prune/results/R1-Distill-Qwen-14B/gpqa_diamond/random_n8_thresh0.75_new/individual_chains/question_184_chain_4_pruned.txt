Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis questions can be tricky. Let's break it down. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, so the benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. 

I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of steps. I remember that when substituting on a benzene ring, the order of reactions matters because activating and deactivating groups can influence the next substitution.

Let me first draw the structure of the target molecule. The numbering is such that the ethoxy is on position 1, tert-butyl on 2, and nitro on 3. Or wait, wait, wait. Benzene numberingâ€”let me make sure. Oh wait, the substituents are attached in such a way that their positions are 1, 2, and 3. So, the ethoxy is at 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. 

So, in the ring, substituents are meta to each other? Or wait, no. Let's see: positions 1,2,3. So, the substituents are adjacent. Wait, no, that's not possible because benzene is a six-membered ring. Wait, maybe I should think about the structure again. Oh wait, no, in benzene, each position is adjacent to the next. So substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3 would be adjacent to each other. Hmm, that seems crowded but perhaps it's possible. But wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in positions that are ortho and para to each other. 

Wait, maybe I should think about the substituents' activating or deactivating nature. Nitro is a strong meta director and deactivating. Ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. The tert-butyl group is an activating, since it's an alkyl group, which is ortho/para-directing.

So, the sequence of adding these substituents must be such that each new group is added in a position that aligns with the directing effects of the existing groups.

Let me consider the synthesis steps. Starting from benzene. We need
