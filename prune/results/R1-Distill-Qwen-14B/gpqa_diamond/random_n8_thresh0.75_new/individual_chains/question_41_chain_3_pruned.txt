Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light passing through moving glass. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties. Oh right, the speed of light in a medium is c divided by the refractive index n. So normally, when the medium isn't moving, the speed would be c/n. But here, the glass is moving, so does that affect the observed speed?

I think when things are moving, you have to consider relative velocities. Like, if the glass is moving towards the observer, does that change how fast the light appears to be moving? I'm a bit confused because light always travels at c in a vacuum, but here it's in a moving medium.

Wait, but the glass is moving at velocity v. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving. The light is moving through the glass, but the glass's motion might affect the observed speed. How do I combine these?

Let me think about reference frames. The speed of light in the glass's frame is c/n. But since the glass is moving, I need to transform that speed into the lab frame. Oh, this is probably a case for the velocity addition formula from special relativity. But wait, v is the velocity of the glass, which might be non-relativistic, but I'm not sure if I should apply classical addition
