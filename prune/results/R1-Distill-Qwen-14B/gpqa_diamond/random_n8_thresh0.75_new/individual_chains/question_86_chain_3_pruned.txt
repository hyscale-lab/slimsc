Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, no, wait. Let me check: Oh, no, actually, the products are the same compound, but with different configurations. Because looking at the question again: A + LiBH4 gives (R)-4-ethyl..., and B + BH3 gives (S)-4-ethyl... So the products are enantiomers of each other.

Hmm, interesting. So the starting materials A and B must be some kind that when reduced with different agents, give opposite configurations. I remember that the choice of reducing agent can influence the stereochemistry in certain reductions, like in ketone reductions. But wait, the products are tetrahydro-pyran-2-ones. Oh, right, that's a cyclic ketone. So maybe the starting material was a cyclic ester, like a lactone, which upon reduction would form the cyclic alcohol, but wait, the product is a ketone. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the product is a tetrahydro-pyran-2-one, which is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else? No, wait. Pyran is a six-membered ring with an oxygen, right? So pyran-2-one would have a ketone group at position 2.

Wait, so when you reduce something to get this product, perhaps the starting material was an epoxide? No, wait. Another possibility is that the starting material was a cyclic ketone with some substituents that, upon reduction, forms a secondary alcohol. Oh, wait, no, but the product is still a ketone. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe the starting material was a cyclic ether with a ketone group, but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, a lactone, which upon reduction gives a diol or something else. Wait, but let's think again. Let me think about the reaction. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the structure would be a six-membered ring with an oxygen, a ketone on carbon 2, and an ethyl group on
