Okay, I'm trying to figure out which of these organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism. I remember that optical isomerism, or enantiomerism, occurs when a compound has a chiral center, meaning it has a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's go through each option one by one.

First, option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, that's a mouthful. So, biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, but does the central single bond allow for free rotation? If the molecule can rotate, then perhaps the substituents on each ring might be arranged in a way that allows for different stereoisomers. But wait, I think in biphenyl systems, sometimes there's a possibility of atropisomerism if the rotation is hindered. Oh, but does this compound have that? Well, the substituents here are nitro groups and ester groups. They are on the 6 and 2 positions. Wait, in this case, the substituents are in positions that might lead to axial chirality because the molecule is symmetrical. Wait, no, because if the substituents are in the same positions on each ring, maybe the molecule is symmetrical? Wait, 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. So in each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6. So each ring has two substituents, but the molecule as a whole is symmetrical. Hmm, perhaps not chiral. Or maybe if the substituents cause the biphenyl to have a certain arrangement that's not superimposable on its mirror image. Wait, but biphenyls with substituents can have optical isomerism if they have a plane of symmetry. Oh, wait, in this case, each substituent is on both rings. So perhaps the molecule is symmetrical along the central axis. So maybe it doesn't have a chiral center or axial chirality. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe this compound doesn't exhibit optical isomerism because of its symmetry. Maybe it's a meso compound? Hmm, perhaps I should move on and come back.

Option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. That's the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol. Let's write the structure. Propanoate would be CH2CH2COO- but wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-C(OH)H-COOMe. So the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Now, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So the second carbon is attached to: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another H? Wait, noâ€”2-hydroxypropanoate is (CH3)CH(OH)COOCH3? Wait, no. Let me think again. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-. No, wait. Wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon: CH2(OH)CH2COO-? No, wait: The carboxylic acid is on the first carbon, so the propanoate is three carbons. So the structure is CH2CH2COO-. The 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COO- but as an ester, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, that's not right. Let's see: propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the middle carbon. So it's CH2(OH)CH2COO-. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, the ester would be where the OH of the acid is replaced by OCH3. Wait, the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: CH3CH(OH)COOH. When it becomes an ester, the -OH of the acid becomes OCH3. So the structure becomes CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the central carbon (the second carbon) has the groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. Wait, the four groups are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. So each is different. That means this carbon is a chiral center. So this compound has a chiral center and therefore can exhibit optical isomerism. So option 2 definitely has optical isomerism.

Option 3: benzophenone. That's a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to a carbonyl group. So the structure is Ph-C(O)-Ph. The central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups, a carbonyl oxygen, and another carbon (the carbonyl). Wait, no, benzophenone is (Ph)2CO. So the carbonyl is R-CO-R', where R and R' are phenyl. So the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O. So the structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. Now, can this molecule have a chiral center? Let's see: the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded, so it's not a chiral center. Are there any other chiral centers? No, because the rest of the molecule is symmetric. So benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers, so it can't exhibit optical isomerism. So option 3 doesn't have it.

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the diethyl ester of maleic acid. Wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is another name for maleic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would be the dimethyl ester of maleic acid. Structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, maleic acid is (Z)-1,2-dihydroxyethylene, but in ester form, it's (Z)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. Wait, the structure is CH2CH2 with two ester groups. Let me think: the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would have the structure CH2=CH-C(COOCH3)2? Wait, perhaps I should visualize it. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait no, that's succinic acid. No, wait, maleic acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? Wait, no. Maleic acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. Oh wait, fumaric acid is the (E) isomer, with the double bond between carbons 2 and 3. So the structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no. Wait, maleic acid is (Z), and fumaric acid is (E). The structure is HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH? No, that's not right because that would be butenedioic acid, but the double bond is between the two middle carbons. So, it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. Maleic acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no, wait. No, no, it's HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So the structure is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So as the dimethyl ester, it would be (CH3O)2C-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3? No, wait, no. Alternatively, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3? Wait, no, perhaps it's better to write it as O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(=O)OCH3 but that's for succinic acid dimethyl ester. Wait, no, fumarate would have a double bond. So, dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate, so it's CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, wait. The correct structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2COOCH3? No, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 and another CH2-COOCH3. No, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH2CH2) with the ester groups on either end. Wait, no. Let me think: dimethyl fumarate would be the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait. Fumaric acid is (E)-1,2-dihydroxyethylene, which is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that's not right. Wait, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, which is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond between the second and third carbon. Oh wait, no, it's HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the dimethyl ester would have the structure CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I should draw it as OMeOOC-CH2-CH2-COO-OMe, but with a double bond. No, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's OMeOC-CH=CH-COOME. Hmm, no. Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3. So here, the central CH=CH is connected to two carbonyl groups, each attached to OCH3. So the molecule has a double bond between the two central carbons, each of which is connected to a carbonyl group. Now, can this molecule have geometric isomerism (cis-trans) because of the double bond? Yes, it definitely does. But does it have optical isomerism? Well, for a compound to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center or some form of chirality such as axial chirality. In this case, the molecule has a double bond, so it's not a chiral center. But could it have a plane of symmetry? Let me see. The molecule is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3. The two ester groups are on either end of the double bond. So the molecule is symmetrical? Wait, no. Because the substituents on each end are the same: both are O=C(OCH3) groups attached to a CH group. So if the groups on each side are the same, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Wait, but wait: the two substituents on the double bond are the same on each side. So the molecule would be symmetrical. So if the substituents are the same on each end, then the enantiomers would be identical. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, if the molecule is symmetrical, like if it's a meso compound, it might not have optical isomers. For example, meso-tartaric acid has two stereocenters but is achiral because of a plane of symmetry. So in this case, if the substituents on each end are the same, then the molecule might not be chiral. So dimethyl fumarate, which has the structure CH2=C(COOCH3)2, I think, but wait, that would mean each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group. So the molecule is symmetrical, so it's a meso compound. So it doesn't have optical isomerism. Wait, but wait another thought: if the substituents are same on each side, then the molecule would be identical to its mirror image, so it wouldn't have optical isomers. So dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism. Wait, but wait, maybe I'm wrong. Because the double bond in fumarate is in the trans configuration. Wait no, because fumarate is the trans form. So the dimethyl ester would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. But regardless, if the substituents on each end are same, the molecule may or may not be chiral. For example, if you have a compound like CH2=CHCl, that's not chiral, but if you have CH3CHCl=CHClCH3, if the substituents are same, it's not chiral. Wait, but in this case, the substituents are two COOCH3 groups on each end of the double bond. So the molecule is symmetrical. So it can't have optical isomerism because it's a meso compound. So option 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another thing. Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Another approach: stereoisomerism includes enantiomerism and diastereomerism. Optical isomerism is about the existence of enantiomers. So, for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must have a non-superimposable mirror image. So, in dimethyl fumarate, if it's symmetrical, it would not have enantiomers. But wait, wait, dimethyl fumarate has the two ester groups on opposite ends of the double bond. But each ester group is same. So the molecule is symmetrical, so it's not chiral. So no optical isomerism. So option 4 doesn't have it.

Wait, but wait another thought: I'm getting confused. Another way: if a molecule has a plane of symmetry, it can't be chiral. So looking at dimethyl fumarate, does it have a plane of symmetry? Let's see: the structure is O=C(OCH3)CH=CHCOOCH3. Wait, no, the structure is OMeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOOMe. No, no, wait: the correct structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3. So the molecule has the two ester groups on either end of the double bond. So imagine looking along the double bond, each side has a carbonyl group. So is there a plane of symmetry? Yes, a plane that bisects the molecule between the two carbonyl groups. So the molecule is symmetrical. Therefore, it's a meso compound and not chiral. So option 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another angle: is there another possibility for chirality? Such as axial chirality or something else? For example, in allenes or certain bicyclic structures. But I don't think dimethyl fumarate has that. So I'll stick with my conclusion that it doesn't have optical isomerism.

So, moving back to option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The structure is a biphenyl with substituents at 6 and 2 positions on each benzene ring. The substituents are nitro groups at 6 and ester groups at 2 on each ring. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. The connection between the two benzene rings is at position 1 of each, so it's a 1,1'-biphenyl.

Now, in such a structure, can the molecule have axial chirality? Because biphenyls can sometimes have axial chirality if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image. For that, the substituents on each ring should be arranged in a way that their arrangement across the central bond isn't symmetrical.

Wait, so if the substituents on each ring are in positions that lead to non-symmetrical arrangement. Let's imagine the two benzene rings connected at position 1. So each ring has substituents at position 2 and 6.

So for a single benzene ring, substituents at 2 and 6 are para to each other. So in the biphenyl, the substituent at 2 on the first ring is adjacent to the connecting bond, and the substituent at 6 is across. But when you have two rings connected, the arrangement could be such that when you swap the substituents, you get a different isomer.

Wait, perhaps the arrangement leads to a situation where the molecule isn't symmetrical, leading to axial chirality. So, for biphenyls, when each ring has two different substituents in positions that don't allow for symmetry, the molecule can exhibit axial chirality.

Wait, but in option 1, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. So substituents are same on each ring. So if the substituents are same on each ring, then perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. So, if each ring has the same substituents, the molecule would be symmetrical upon rotation, making it meso and not chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in such a way that they create a chiral axis. For example, in 1,2-disubstituted biphenyls, the arrangement can lead to axial chirality. But in this case, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So the substituents are in the meta positions relative to the connecting bond.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical because substituents are same on each ring. So the nitro group is on 6, and the ester on 2 of each ring. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So option 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but another thought: when you have two substituents on each ring, if their positions relative to each other create a non-symmetrical arrangement, the biphenyl can have axial chirality. For example, if the substituents are arranged in a way that their positions on each ring lead to a lack of a plane of symmetry. Let's imagine the two rings are connected at position 1. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So on each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 (so opposite each other on the ring). When you look at the biphenyl, the substituents on each ring are in positions that are para to each other on their respective rings. So, the arrangement across the central bond might have some symmetry.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to think in terms of whether the molecule has a center of symmetry. If the molecule has a center of symmetry, it's not chiral. For example, if each substituent on one ring has a corresponding substituent on the other ring in a symmetrical arrangement, then the molecule is achiral.

So in this case, each ring has a nitro at 6 (which is para to position 2 on the same ring) and an ester at 2 (meta to the connecting bond). So maybe the arrangement causes the molecule to have a center of symmetry. So the molecule is symmetrical, hence not chiral. Therefore, option 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, going back to the options:

1. No optical isomerism.

2. Yes.

3. No.

4. No.

So the compounds that show optical isomerism are option 2 and, wait, did I miss any? Let me check again.

Wait, option 2 is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which has a chiral center, so yes.

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate â€” earlier conclusion was no.

Option 4: earlier conclusion was no.

So the compounds that have optical isomerism are option 2. Which options include 2?

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1,2,4 â†’ includes 2.

Option D: 1 and 2 â†’ includes 2.

Wait, but if option 1 doesn't have it, then the only compound with optical isomerism is 2. But looking at the options, option A includes 1,2,4. But if 1 and 4 don't have it, then option A is incorrect. Option D includes 1 and 2. But if 1 doesn't have it, then D is incorrect. Wait, maybe I made a mistake about option 4.

Wait, another thought about option 4: dimethyl fumarate. The structure is (E)-CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, wait, fumarate is the (E) isomer, so it's O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3. So each of the middle carbons is attached to one COOCH3 group. So the structure is symmetric because each substituent on the double bond is the same. So, the molecule is symmetrical, thus it's not chiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but maybe I'm wrong. Another way: for a molecule to have optical activity, it must have a chiral center or be a meso compound that is not symmetrical. Alternatively, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it can't be chiral.

So, in our case, option 2 is the only compound that has a chiral center. So the correct answer would be option 2 only. But looking back at the options, none of the options have only 2. Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2,4

B) 3,4

C) 2,3

D)1,2

So, if the answer is only option 2, but none of the options have only 2, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option 4. Let's re-examine option 4: dimethyl fumarate. The structure is (E)-CH2=C(COOCH3)2? Or is it CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, wait, the correct structure of fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, which is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the dimethyl ester would be (E)-CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3. Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, perhaps it's O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3. So each end of the double bond has an ester group. So the molecule is symmetric. So it's not chiral.

Wait, another approach: maybe I was wrong about option 4. Maybe dimethyl fumarate isn't symmetrical. Let me imagine the structure. Each end of the double bond has a carbonyl group attached to an OMe group. So the substituents on each end are the same, making the molecule symmetrical. So no optical isomerism.

So the only compound that has optical isomerism is option 2. But in the options, none have only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating another compound.

Wait, let me re-examine option 4. What if the substituents are not same on each end? No, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, both ends have the same substituents. So, it's symmetrical.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about option 1. Let's think again. The compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So in biphenyl, the substituents are on 2 and 6 positions of each ring. Now, the question is whether the substituents can be arranged in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry. For example, in 1,2,3-trisubstituted biphenyls, but here it's 2,2',6,6'â€”so four substituents. Wait, but each ring has two substituents, so each ring has a nitro and an ester. So the substituents on each ring are in positions that are para to each other. So when you look at the biphenyl, each substituent on one ring is opposite to another substituent on the same ring. But what about relative to the other ring?

Wait, perhaps the arrangement is such that the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For instance, if the nitro and ester on each ring are aligned in a way that their positions relative to each other are mirrored across the central bond, making the molecule symmetrical. So the molecule would be achiral.

So, after this reevaluation, I think that option 1 doesn't have optical isomerism as well.

Wait, but another thought: biphenyls can have axial chirality when the substituents are arranged such that the molecule isn't symmetrical. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that don't mirror each other, the molecule can be chiral.

In this case, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So, on each ring, the substituents are para to each other. But when connected as a biphenyl, the substituents on each ring are across the central bond. So, substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring would be in positions that are across from each other on the same ring, but when connected as a biphenyl, perhaps their arrangement leads to a lack of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that they are trans in the biphenyl. So, for example, the nitro group on ring A is at position 6, which is on the opposite side of the connecting bond compared to the ester at position 2. Similarly for ring B. This arrangement could lead to a lack of symmetry, making the molecule chiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that they are on the same side, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach. Are there any other possibilities for optical isomerism in the given compounds?

Wait, another compound to consider is option 4: dimethyl fumarate. Earlier, I thought it's symmetrical and hence not chiral. But perhaps I'm wrong. Let me imagine the structure again. The structure is (E)-CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. But since both are same, it's symmetrical. So no chirality.

So, perhaps only option 2 shows optical isomerism.

Wait, but the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. The options are:

A) 1,2,4

B) 3,4

C) 2,3

D)1,2

So, none of the options have only 2. This suggests I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think again. Fumarate is the (E) isomer of maleate. The structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, the correct structure is (E)-butenedioate. So, for the ester, it's CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2COOCH3? No, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-CH2-C(COOCH3)2=CH2. No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps it's O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3. So, each of the middle carbons (the ones in the double bond) has a carbonyl group attached. So, the structure is symmetrical, so no chirality.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about option 4. Maybe it has a chiral center. Wait, but no, because it doesn't have any carbon attached to four different groups.

Hmm, I'm stuck. So, to recap: only option 2 has a chiral center, so the correct answer must include only option 2. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating another option.

Wait, another thing: option 4 is dimethyl fumarate. Suppose the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(=O)OCH3. Wait, no, that would be succinate dimethyl ester, which is a straight-chain molecule and definitely not chiral. So that can't be.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck because I'm not visualizing the structures correctly. Let me try to think about each compound again.

Option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. The central carbon is attached to:

- CH3 (from the left),

- OH,

- COOCH3 (from the right),

- and H.

So four different groups, which makes it a chiral center. So this compound definitely has optical isomerism.

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate. Structure has a double bond, so it's not a chiral center. No chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So, looking at the biphenyl, substituents are arranged symmetrically. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. No optical isomerism.

Option 3: benzophenone. No chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

So, only option 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But none of the options include only option 2. So perhaps the answer is only option 2, but the options don't have that. Wait, looking back at the options:

Option A) 1,2,4

Option D) 1 and 2

Wait, but if 1 doesn't have it, then option D is incorrect. Unless I made a mistake about option 1.

Wait, perhaps option 1 does have optical isomerism. Let me reevaluate option 1.

In option 1: the structure is a biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring. Each substituent is a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2.

If the substituents are in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then it can have axial chirality. Axial chirality occurs when the two rings are connected in a way that their substituents are arranged asymmetrically around the central bond.

So, in the biphenyl, substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring: the 2 position is adjacent to the connecting bond, and the 6 position is opposite the connecting bond.

So, for each ring, the substituents are at positions that are meta relative to the connecting bond. So, the arrangement would be such that on each ring, the nitro is opposite the connecting bond, and the ester is adjacent.

If the substituents are arranged in a way that they are trans across the central bond, then the molecule would not be symmetrical and would have axial chirality.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that they are on the same face, leading to a lack of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the two rings have substituents that are not aligned symmetrically, leading to a chiral molecule.

In other words, if the nitro groups on each ring are on the same face, and the ester groups are on the same face, but their arrangement causes the molecule to lack a plane of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps this is similar to the concept of cis and trans in biphenyls. If the substituents are in a way that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, it can be chiral.

So, in option 1, if the substituents are arranged such that the nitro groups are on the same side of the central bond and the ester groups are on the same side, then the molecule could be chiral.

But wait, each ring has a nitro and an ester. So, in the biphenyl, each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So looking along the central bond, each ring has substituents in positions that are para to each other (2 and 6 are opposite each other on the ring). So, when connected as a biphenyl, the substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement leads to the molecule being chiral. I'm getting stuck again.

Wait, perhaps the positions are such that the substituents on each ring are in positions that are not symmetrical. For example, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image.

I think I'm going in circles here. To make progress, I'll summarize:

- Only option 2 definitely has a chiral center and shows optical isomerism.

- The other options (1,3,4) don't have optical isomerism.

But the options don't include an option with only 2. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option 4.

Wait, another thought: dimethyl fumarate. If the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3, then the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same. So the molecule is symmetrical. Hence, no chirality.

Another possibility: perhaps option 4 is a diastereomer, but that's not about optical isomerism. So, no.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake about option 1. Perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry, leading to optical isomerism.

In that case, if option 1 and 2 are correct, then the answer would be option D: 1 and 2.

But earlier I thought option 1 doesn't have optical isomerism. So, perhaps I should go with that.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think about the possible correct answer.

The options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2

If I think option 2 is correct, which option includes 2? Options A and D. But I thought option 1 isn't correct, so D would be incorrect. So, perhaps option 4 is also correct, which would make option A correct.

But earlier I thought option 4 isn't correct. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake about option 4. Let's think differently: does dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center? No, because all carbons are either double-bonded or connected to two same groups. So, no chiral centers. Therefore, no optical isomerism. So, option 4 isn't correct.

So, the only correct compound is option 2. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question contains an error. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another thought: perhaps option 1 has a chiral center somewhere else. For example, perhaps the central carbon in the biphenyl is a chiral center. But in a biphenyl, the central bond is a single bond, and each ring is connected via a sigma bond. The carbons in the rings are aromatic and don't have four different substituents. So, no chiral centers there.

Wait, perhaps the ester groups have chiral centers. Let me see. Each ester group is OCOOCH3. The ester carbonyl is connected to OMe, but the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic rings. So, the ester groups are at position 2 on each benzene ring. The structure is OMeOOC-C6H4-NO2-C6H4-COOOMe.

Wait, no, the ester groups are at position 2 on each ring. So, the structure is OMeOOC-Ph-NO2-Ph-COOOMe? No, the structure is a biphenyl, so each benzene ring is connected at position 1. So, substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring.

Wait, perhaps the ester groups are at position 2, which is adjacent to the connecting bond. So, for each ring, position 2 is ortho to the connecting bond, and position 6 is para to the connecting bond.

But again, the substituents on each ring are same (nitro and ester), so the molecule is symmetrical.

I think I'm stuck again. Perhaps I should conclude that only option 2 is correct, but since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is option A (which includes 2 and 4). But I don't think 4 is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake about option 4. Maybe dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. Let me think again.

In dimethyl fumarate, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3. Each of the carbons in the double bond is connected to two carbonyl groups and two other groups. Wait, each carbon in the double bond is connected to a carbonyl group and a CH group. No, wait, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So each carbon in the double bond is connected to:

- For the left carbon: CH2 and C=.

- For the right carbon: C= and CH2.

Wait, no, wait. The correct structure of fumarate is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So each of the middle carbons (in the double bond) is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups. Wait, no, that's not correct. The structure should be CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, that's not possible. Let me think again.

Fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So the structure is (E)-CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So each of the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is connected to:

- The left carbon: CH2 and the double bond.

- The right carbon: CH2 and the double bond.

Wait, no. The structure would be CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2COOCH3. No, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, perhaps it's O=C(OCH3)CH=CHCOOCH3. So each of the middle carbons is connected to a carbonyl group and a CH group.

Wait, perhaps in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3.

In this case, each of the central carbons in the double bond is connected to:

- One carbonyl group (O=C(OCH3)),

- One CH group,

- And one double bond.

Wait, that can't be, because each carbon in the double bond is connected to two groups. So, the left carbon in the double bond is connected to O=C(OCH3) and the right carbon, and the right is connected to another O=C(OCH3) and the left. So, each carbon in the double bond is connected to two O=C(OCH3) groups. So, each has two same substituents.

Therefore, the molecule is symmetrical, so it's not chiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Thus, I'm back to the conclusion that only option 2 is correct. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is option A) 1,2,4. But earlier I thought 1 and 4 don't have optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake about option 1. Let me think again: if the substituents on each ring are in positions that create a chiral axis, leading to axial chirality.

In biphenyls, if the substituents on each ring are in ortho positions relative to the connecting bond, and their arrangement leads to a non-symmetrical structure, axial chirality can occur.

But in this case, the substituents are at meta positions (2 and 6) relative to the connecting bond. So, perhaps the arrangement allows for axial chirality.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should refer to the concept of biphenyls and axial chirality.

In biphenyls, axial chirality occurs when the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in the same relative positions, but their arrangement across the central bond doesn't mirror, leading to a chiral molecule.

In this case, each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So, substituents are in positions that are para to each other on each ring. But when connected as a biphenyl, their arrangement across the central bond would be such that they create a symmetrical structure, making the molecule achiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that their positions on each ring don't mirror, the molecule could be chiral.

I'm not entirely sure, but I think that if both substituents on each ring are the same, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry and thus be achiral. So, option 1 doesn't have optical isomerism.

In conclusion, after all this thinking, I believe that only option 2 exhibits optical isomerism. However, since none of the provided options include only option 2, I must have made a mistake somewhere. Perhaps the intended answer is option A, which includes option 4, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I missed something about option 4.

Wait, another idea: perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a center of symmetry, making it a meso compound. So, even though it has stereocenters, the overall molecule is achiral. But in reality, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers because all substituents are same on each end.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has no chiral centers and thus no optical isomerism.

So, I'll proceed with the conclusion that only option 2 is correct. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4. But I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: looking for which compounds have stereocenters.

Option 2: has a stereocenter.

Option 4: no stereocenters.

Options 1 and 3: no stereocenters.

So, only option 2 has a stereocenter. So the answer is option A) 1,2,4? No, that includes 4, which I don't think is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D) 1 and 2. But I don't think option 1 is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is option A) 1,2,4.

But I'm not confident. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed to choose option A.


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each option based on the presence of chirality, which requires a carbon atom bonded to four different groups (a chiral center) or a lack of symmetry leading to axial chirality.

### Analysis of Each Option:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of a biphenyl structure with substituents at the 2 and 6 positions on each ring. Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. The molecule is symmetrical due to the identical substituents on each ring, which creates a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure is CHâ‚ƒ-C(OH)H-COOCHâ‚ƒ. The second carbon (C(OH)H) is bonded to four different groups: CHâ‚ƒ, OH, COOCHâ‚ƒ, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   The structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and does not serve as a chiral center. Additionally, the molecule is symmetrical, so it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   The structure is (E)-O=C(OCHâ‚ƒ)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCHâ‚ƒ. The double-bonded carbons are each bonded to two identical ester groups (COOCHâ‚ƒ), making the molecule symmetrical. Since there are no chiral centers or axial chirality, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
Only **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (option 2) exhibits optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center. None of the other compounds (1, 3, or 4) exhibit optical isomerism. However, the provided options do not include an option with only 2. Based on the reasoning, the closest match to the intended answer is **A) 1, 2, and 4**, though this includes compounds (1 and 4) that do not exhibit optical isomerism.
