The data shows the resistance levels of single and double mutants, with 100% representing wild-type resistance. The key findings are:\n\n- **g1**: 75% resistance\n- **g2**: 0% resistance\n- **g3**: 50% resistance\n- **g1g3**: 10% resistance\n- **g2g3**: 0% resistance\n- **g1g2**: 0% resistance\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **G2 as the transcription factor**:  \n   - The single mutant **g2** shows 0% resistance, indicating that G2 is critical for resistance.  \n   - The double mutants **g1g2** and **g2g3** also show 0% resistance, the same as **g2**. This demonstrates that G2 is **epistatic to both G1 and G3**, meaning its loss masks the effects of mutations in G1 or G3.  \n\n2. **Relationship between G1 and G3**:  \n   - The double mutant **g1g3** shows 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant. This suggests that G1 and G3 are **redundant**, meaning they can compensate for each other's function. When both are knocked out, resistance is significantly reduced because their contributions are no longer additive.  \n\n3. **Epistatic hierarchy**:  \n   - G2 is the transcription factor and acts upstream of G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are downstream and likely regulate resistance-related pathways.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nG2 is the transcription factor, G1 and G3 are redundant, and their combined loss results in a more severe phenotype. This aligns with the data and the description in Option D.  \n\nANSWER: D"
