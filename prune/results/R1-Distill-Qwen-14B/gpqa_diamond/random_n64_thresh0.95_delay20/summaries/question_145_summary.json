This gives two possible configurations (R and S).\n\n### 2. **Geometric Isomerism from Double Bonds**\n- **Double bond at 3,4**: Carbon 3 is bonded to a methyl group (CH(CH\u2083)) and a CH\u2082 group, while carbon 4 is bonded to a CH\u2082 group and a CH(OH) group. Both carbons have different substituents, allowing for cis and trans configurations.\n- **Double bond at 7,8**: Carbon 7 is bonded to a chlorine atom (Cl) and a CH\u2082 group, while carbon 8 is bonded to a CH\u2082 group and another CH\u2082 group. Both carbons have different substituents, allowing for cis and trans configurations.\n\nEach double bond contributes a factor of 2 (cis or trans), and with two double bonds, there are \\( 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\) possible combinations.\n\n### 3. **Total Number of Stereoisomers**\nThe total number of stereoisomers is the product of the contributions from the stereogenic center and the double bonds:\n\\[\n\\text{Total stereoisomers} = 2 \\, (\\text{from stereogenic center}) \\times 4 \\, (\\text{from double bonds}) = 8.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe compound has **8 stereoisomers**.\n\nANSWER: D"
