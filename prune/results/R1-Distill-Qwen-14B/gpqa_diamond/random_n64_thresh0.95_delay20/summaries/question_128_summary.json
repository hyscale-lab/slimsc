Translating this into amino acids matches the given sequence: **Met, Glu, Glu, Pro, Gln, Ser, Asp, Pro, Ser, Val, Pro, Leu**. This option appears correct.\n   - **Option B**: The DNA sequence starts with **ATG GAG GAG CCG CAG TCA GAT CCT AGC GTC GAG CCCC TC...**. The 13th codon (**CTC**) translates to **Leu**, which does not match the given sequence (**Pro** at this position). This option is incorrect.\n   - **Option C**: The DNA sequence is much shorter than the others and does not appear to encode the full-length P53 protein. This option is incorrect.\n   - **Option D**: The DNA sequence starts with **ATG GAG GAG CCG CAG TCA GAT CCT AGC GTC GAG CCCC TC...**, which is identical to Option B. Since Option B is incorrect, Option D is also incorrect.\n\n3. **Stop Codon**:\n   - The correct plasmid should end with a stop codon (**TGA, TAG, or TAA**) in the DNA sequence. All options except Option C appear to include a stop codon at the end of their sequences.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOption A is the only plasmid that matches the given amino acid sequence in its entirety, including the correct start codon, initial sequence, and proper reading frame. Options B and D are incorrect due to a mismatch in the 13th codon, and Option C is incomplete.\n\n**Answer: A**"
