Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. 

So, the question involves two reactions with (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on both standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns. We need to find out how many peaks each chromatogram would show.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation of alkenes typically forms an epoxide. The reaction is stereospecific, meaning the geometry of the starting alkene affects the product.

Let me think about each reaction separately.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA. Epoxidation should occur. Since mCPBA adds an oxygen across the double bond, creating an epoxide. The E geometry would lead to a specific stereochemistry in the epoxide. Wait, when the alkene is E, the two substituents are opposite each other. So when epoxidized, will the oxygen add in a certain way?

I think mCPBA causes an epoxidation via a cyclic transition state. The reaction leads to the formation of an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. Wait, noâ€”wait, in the epoxidation, the two new bonds form with the same stereochemistry as the starting double bond. So the E and Z alkenes would form different epoxides.

Wait, no. Let me think again. When you have an E-alkene, the two substituents are on opposite sides. When mCPBA adds the epoxide group, it adds from the same face, right? So the endo transition state leads to the epoxide group being formed on the same face. So the (E) and (Z) starting alkenes would give different epoxide diastereomers.

Wait, maybe I should draw it. For oct-4-ene, the double bond is between C4 and C5. If the starting alkene is E, the groups on
