Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super familiar with all the concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the question is about the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, and the same goes for their masses. But wait, does mass really matter here? Hmm, the question is about luminosity, which I think mainly depends on radius and temperature. Oh, right, because for stars, luminosity is often calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴. So maybe the mass isn't super relevant here, except perhaps for affecting the temperature somehow? Or maybe it's a red herring.

The question says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is given by Wien's law, λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if their λ_max is the same, their temperatures would be the same, since T is inversely proportional. So both stars have the same temperature? Interesting. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but then the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm. Radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Oh right, the Doppler shift. So the observed wavelength λ_observed is different from the emitted λ_emitted. But the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So the actual emitted λ_max would be different because of their velocities.

Wait, but if both are moving, we have to account for that. Let me think: The wavelength we observe is affected by their radial velocities. Star_1 has zero velocity, so λ1_emitted = λ1_observed. But Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, so its observed wavelength would be longer due to redshift. But the question says that the observed λ_max for both is the same. So Star_2's emitted λ_max must be shorter than Star_1's, because when you Doppler shift it, you get the same observed
