Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule transitioning between energy states. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Okay, the molecule is made up of atoms X and Y. Their masses are given as Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The question is about the momentum a photon should have when absorbed so that the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state from its fundamental state.

Hmm, I remember that in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized. But wait, the question specifies the fundamental state. Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So the molecule is in its lowest vibrational state and the lowest rotational state.

Wait, but if it's absorbing a photon, it's probably going to a higher energy state. Now, the next state with the lowest possible energy... So I'm guessing that the molecule transitions to the next higher energy level, which would be the next state in either vibration or rotation, but which one is the next lowest?

In the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions. The fundamental state would have the lowest quantum numbers for both. So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can either increase its vibrational quantum number, its rotational, or maybe change both. But the next lowest energy state would be the next higher state in the energy level ordering.

Wait, the rotational and vibrational energies have different quantum numbers. The vibrational energy is quantized with quantum number v, and rotational with J. The fundamental state is v=0 and J=0.

When you absorb a photon, the molecule can move to a higher state. But I think the energy transitions typically involve either a change in vibration or rotation. But the problem states it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the one with the least energy increase. Which transition gives that?

Let me think about the energy levels. The vibrational energy levels are given by Ev = (v + 1/2) ħω. So the first transition (v=0 → v=1) would require an energy of ħω. The rotational energy levels are Er = B (J(J+1)), where B is the rotational constant. For J=0, the next state is J=1, which would be Er = B*(1*2) = 2B.

Now, comparing the energies of these transitions. The vibrational transition requires ħω, and the rotational one requires 2B. Which is smaller?

Wait, B is related to the moment of inertia. B = ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. I is μ R², and μ is the reduced mass.

So the energy of the rotational transition is 2B = 2*(ħ²/(2I)) ) = ħ²/I.

But I is μ R², so substituting that in: ħ²/(μ R²).

The vibrational transition energy is ħω.

Which one is smaller depends on the values of ω and the other constants.

Hmm, let me compute B and the energy for the rotational transition.

First, calculate the reduced mass μ. μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Let's compute that.

Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu.

So μ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 = 1.818... amu. Wait, but I need to convert that into kilograms for SI units.

1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So 1.818 amu = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

Bond length R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R=2e-10 meters.

So I = μ R² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

Calculating that: (2e-10)^2 is 4e-20 m², so multiply by 3.02e-27 kg: 3.02e-27 *4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg m².

Now, B is ħ²/(2I). Let me compute ħ first. Planck's constant h is approx 6.626e-34 J s. ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.054e-34 J s.

So ħ² is (1.054e-34)^2 ≈ 1.11e-68 J² s².

B = (1.11e-68) / (2 * 1.208e-46) ) → denominator is 2.416e-46.

So 1.11e-68 / 2.416e-46 ≈ 4.60e-23 J.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because the rotational energy is Er = B J (J+1). Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 J² s².

So B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.208e-46) )

Wait, 2 *1.208e-46 is 2.416e-46.

So 1.112e-68 / 2.416e-46 = (1.112 / 2.416) * 1e-22 → approx 0.46 * 1e-22 = 4.6e-23 J.

So B is about 4.6e-23 J.

Now, the energy required for a rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is 2B, since Er = B J(J+1). At J=1, it's 2B. So 2 *4.6e-23 = 9.2e-23 J.

What about the vibrational energy? The first vibrational transition (v=0 → v=1) requires energy ħω.

Given ω is 4e14 rad/s. So ħω = (1.054e-34 J s) * (4e14 rad/s) ) = 4.216e-20 J.

Wait, but wait: ħ has units of J s. ω is 1/s. So their product is J. So yes, 4e14 * 1.05e-34 = about 4.2e-20 J.

Comparing the two energies: rotational transition requires ~9.2e-23 J, vibrational requires ~4.2e-20 J. So the rotational transition is much lower in energy.

Ah, so the next state with the lowest possible energy is the J=1 state, with energy 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but wait, in the quantum model, the energy levels are a combination of rotation and vibration. So the fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next state could be either v=0, J=1 or v=1, J=0. Which of these is lower in energy?

The vibrational state v=1 has energy Ev = (1 + ½) ħω = 1.5 ħω ≈ 6.32e-20 J. The rotational state J=1 has Er=2B=9.2e-23 J. So the rotational transition is lower in energy.

So for the molecule to transition to the next lowest energy state, it would be the rotational transition, not the vibrational one. So the photon's energy must match the rotational energy difference.

So the photon's energy should be equal to 2B, which is 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but wait. Momentum of the photon. Because the question is about the momentum of the absorbed photon, not the energy directly.

Photons carry energy E = pc, where p is momentum and c is speed of light. So p = E/(c).

So the momentum is E/c.

Wait, E is 9.2e-23 J.

Speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s.

p = (9.2e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = (9.2e-23) / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but none of the options are close to that. The options are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range. Hmm, that's way off.

Wait, did I mess up the energy calculation? Let me recheck.

Wait, when the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is v=0 and J=0. If it absorbs a photon, the next possible state is either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. We determined that the energy for J=1 is lower. So the photon's energy should match the energy difference between J=0 and J=1, which is 2B.

Wait, but another possibility: maybe the transition is allowed via the selection rules. For rotation, the selection rule is ΔJ=±1. So if J=0, it can go to J=1. So that's allowed.

As for vibration, the selection rule is Δv=±1. So from v=0, it can go to v=1.

So the energy needed is either 2B or ħω. As the energy for 2B is lower, that's the next state.

Wait, but another thought: maybe the question refers to the rigid rotor, but the problem states the non-rigid rotor model. Hmm, the non-rigid rotor, also known as the rotation-vibration coupling model, which allows for some stretching, but I'm not sure if that affects the energy levels significantly in this context.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next higher state, which might involve both a vibrational and rotational transition, but that would be a higher energy than either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy. Let me recalculate.

Calculating B again:

I = μ R².

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert μ to kg:

1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 = let's compute that.

1.8 * 1.6605 is about 2.989e-27 kg. So I = 2.989e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10 m)^2 = 4e-20 m².

So I = 2.989e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.1956e-46 kg m².

Then B = ħ²/(2I).

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s.

ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 = approximately 1.112e-68 (J s)^2.

So B = 1.112e-68 / (2 * 1.1956e-46) ) → denominator is 2.391e-46.

1.112e-68 / 2.391e-46 ≈ (1.112 / 2.391) * 1e-22 → approx 0.465e-22 = 4.65e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.3e-23 J.

Now, the photon's energy E_photon = 9.3e-23 J.

Then, the momentum p_photon = E_photon / c.

E_photon = 9.3e-23 J.

c = 3e8 m/s.

p = (9.3e-23) / (3e8) = 3.1e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, that's 3.1e-31 kg m/s. But looking at the options:

Options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns
B) 2.3e-27 Ns
C) 1.1e-27 Ns
D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, Ns is the same as kg m/s. So the options are in 1e-27 to 1e-28 kg m/s. But my calculation gave 3e-31 kg m/s, which is way smaller than any of the options.

Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the energy for the vibrational transition, not the rotational. Because the options are in the 1e-27 range.

Wait, let me compute the photon's momentum if the energy was ħω.

E_photon = ħω = 1.0545718e-34 * 4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

p = E/c = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg m/s.

Which is approximately 1.4e-28 kg m/s. Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, which matches this.

Wait, but earlier I thought the rotational transition was lower in energy. But that would give a smaller momentum (since E is smaller, p=E/c is smaller). However, the options don't have anything in the 3e-31 range. So maybe the correct approach is to consider the vibrational transition.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the model. The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. So the energy levels are a combination of both. But when the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational (v=0) and lowest rotational (J=0) state.

If it absorbs a photon, it can transition to either v=1 (with J=0), or J=1 (with v=0). The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one with the smallest energy increase.

Wait, but the energy for J=1 is 2B = 9.3e-23 J. The energy for v=1 is 1.5 ħω = 6.32e-20 J. So 9.3e-23 is much smaller than 6.3e-20. So the rotational transition is lower in energy.

But the problem is with the options. If the correct answer is to absorb a photon with energy 9.3e-23 J, which would correspond to p = 3e-31 kg m/s, but none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the transition that changes both the rotational and vibrational states. But that would be a higher energy, so not the next lowest.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the fundamental state to the next possible state, which is a combination of rotation and vibration. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. For a diatomic molecule, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state and the lowest rotational state. The next state could be either the next vibrational state or the next rotational state.

But the problem is about the photon's momentum. So perhaps we need to calculate the photon's momentum based on the energy difference between these two states.

Wait, maybe the question is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited state, which could be (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). The lowest energy transition would be the one with the least energy difference.

We have:

ΔE_rot = 2B ≈ 9.3e-23 J.

ΔE_vib = ħω ≈ 4.2e-20 J.

So ΔE_rot is smaller, so the next state would be J=1, v=0.

But then the photon's momentum would be ΔE/c ≈ 9.3e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.1e-31 kg m/s ≈ 3.1e-31 Ns.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in calculating B.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of B.

Let me re-calculate B.

B = (ħ²)/(2I)

I = μ R².

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

μ in kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms: 2e-10 m.

So I = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 → (2e-10)^2 is 4e-20 m².

I = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg m².

Now B = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.208e-46) → (1.112e-68) / (2.416e-46) = 4.6e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.2e-23 J. Correct.

Hmm. So the photon's momentum is 3.1e-31 Ns, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from J=0 to J=1, but the vibrational state also increases? Like (v=1, J=1). But that would be higher energy, so not the next state.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a misunderstanding, and the correct approach is to calculate the photon's momentum based on the vibrational transition, because that's higher in energy but perhaps the only possible choice given the options.

Wait, the options include 1.4e-28 Ns, which is 1.4e-28 kg m/s.

Which would correspond to E_photon = p*c = 1.4e-28 * 3e8 = 4.2e-20 J. Which is exactly ħω (1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J). So option D is 1.4e-28 Ns, which matches this calculation.

But earlier I thought the rotational transition is lower. But perhaps the question is expecting the vibrational transition, perhaps because the non-rigid rotor model includes vibration and the question is referring to the fundamental vibrational state's first transition.

Wait, the question states that the molecule can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. So perhaps the energy levels are a combination of both rotation and vibration. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational and rotational state.

When a photon is absorbed, the molecule can transition to either higher vibrational or higher rotational states.

But the next state with the lowest possible energy would be whichever transition requires the least energy.

In this case, the rotational transition requires 9.2e-23 J, while the vibrational transition requires 4.2e-20 J. So the rotational transition is lower. Therefore, the correct photon energy is 9.2e-23 J, which would give p=3.1e-31 Ns, but that's not any of the options.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the selection rules. For the vibration, the transition requires the photon's energy to match the vibrational energy difference. For rotation, the energy is much lower, but perhaps the selection rules don't allow that transition. Or perhaps in the rigid rotor model, the rotational states are quantized, but in the non-rigid rotor, there's coupling between vibration and rotation.

Wait, but the problem says the model is the rotation-vibration model, which is also called the non-rigid rotor model. In such models, the vibrational energy and rotational energy are coupled, and the energy levels are a product of both, but transitions can involve changes in both. However, for the fundamental state, the next state might involve either a vibrational or rotational change, whichever is lower.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the next state in either vibrational or rotational, but the next state in the overall energy ordering, which is a combination of both. The overall energy would be Ev = (v + ½) ħω and Er = B J (J+1). So the first excited state would be the one with the smallest energy increase, regardless of whether it's a vibrational or rotational change.

The energy for J=1, v=0 is Er = 2B ≈9.2e-23 J.

The energy for v=1, J=0 is Ev = (1 + ½) ħω = 1.5 * 4.218e-20 J = 6.327e-20 J.

Which is much larger than 9.2e-23 J. So the next state is J=1, v=0, which requires a photon energy of 9.2e-23 J, which would correspond to p=3.1e-31 Ns. But that's not one of the options.

Hmm, now I'm confused because none of the options match this. But the options include D) 1.4e-28 Ns, which is exactly ħω / c.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between the fundamental state and the first excited state. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state in the energy ladder would be the next higher state, which is either J=1 or v=1. As J=1 has lower energy, that's the next state.

But why is the answer matching the vibrational transition?

Wait, perhaps the question is about the rigid rotor model, not the rotation-vibration model. Because in the rigid rotor, the rotational transitions are considered. But the problem states the rotation-vibration model, which includes both.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a mistake, and the intended correct option is D) 1.4e-28 Ns, which corresponds to the vibrational transition.

But why would that be the case? Because when the molecule is in the fundamental state, the next state with the lowest energy is the rotational one, requiring lower energy. But since the options do not include that, I must be making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the model considers the molecule as a rigid rotor, but that's not the case because the question specifically mentions the rotation-vibration model.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state in the rotational-vibrational coupling, which could involve both a change in vibration and rotation. But that would require higher energy.

Wait, maybe I should think about the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state, which might be a combination of both. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the transition from v=0, J=0 to v=0, J=1, which requires energy 2B. But that would still give a very small p.

Wait, maybe I should compute the energy again. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I.

Let me recompute I.

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 + 2) amu.

Which is (40)/(22) amu = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Convert μ to kg:

1 amu = 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So 1.81818 amu = 1.81818 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

Calculating that:

1.81818 * 1.66053906660 ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 *4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg m².

B = ħ²/(2I) → ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68 J²s².

So B = 1.112e-68 / (2 * 1.208e-46) ) → 1.112e-68 / 2.416e-46 = 4.603e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.206e-23 J.

So photon energy is 9.206e-23 J.

Momentum p = E/c = 9.206e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options don't have this. So what's going on?

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next state in the vibrational energy, even though it's higher. But why would the next state be higher? Because maybe the rotational transitions are forbidden, or the question is considering only vibrational transitions.

But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So if the rotational transition is possible but requires lower energy, that should be the next state.

Hmm. Since none of the options match the calculated 3.07e-31 kg m/s, and the closest option is D) 1.4e-28 kg m/s, which corresponds to the vibrational transition.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited vibrational state (v=1, J=0), and the question is about this photon's momentum. Because that would match option D.

But why would that be the next state? Because the rotational transition is lower in energy, so that's the next state.

Wait, perhaps the question is incorrect, or perhaps I made a mistake in considering the energy levels. Alternatively, perhaps the model used in the problem doesn't account for rotational transitions, but that's unlikely because it's the rotation-vibration model.

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me re-read it.

The question says: what momentum should an absorbed photon have, in order for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy?

If the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational and rotational state, it can transition to either the next vibrational state (v=1) or the next rotational state (J=1). The energy required for the rotational transition is lower, so that's the next state.

But according to my calculations, the rotational transition requires a much lower energy, and thus a much lower momentum. But none of the options match that. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the model assumes that the molecule is a rigid rotor, and the transition is only rotational. In that case, the energy would be 2B, and the momentum is 3e-31 kg m/s, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is a rigid rotor with only rotational transitions considered, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the photon's momentum based on the vibrational energy, which is 4.2e-20 J, giving p=1.4e-28 kg m/s, which is option D.

But why would that be the next state? Because the rotational transition is lower in energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the energy difference between the ground state and the first vibrational state, assuming that the rotational transitions are not allowed. But I don't see why that would be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the transition to the next possible state, which is a combination of both, but that would require a higher energy. 

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. The calculations point to the rotational transition being the next state, but the options don't have that. The only option that matches a calculation I've done is option D, which corresponds to the vibrational transition. But according to the energy, the rotational transition should be lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B. Let me compute B again.

B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.05457e-34)^2/(2 * 1.208e-46).

Calculating numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 2 *1.208e-46 = 2.416e-46.

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.416e-46 = 4.6e-23 J.

Yes, that's correct. So 2B is 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but maybe the model is different. For a diatomic molecule, the energy levels are given by the sum of rotational and vibrational energies. So the ground state is v=0, J=0. The first excited state is either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1.

The energy for v=1, J=0 is 1.5 ħω = 6.32e-20 J.

The energy for v=0, J=1 is 2B = 9.2e-23 J.

Which is smaller? 9.2e-23 is much smaller than 6.3e-20.

So the next state should be J=1, v=0. But that requires a photon of energy 9.2e-23 J, which gives p=3.1e-31 kg m/s. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the rigid rotor model, which doesn't include vibration. If that's the case, then the energy is 2B, but again, no option matches.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question and expects the photon to have the momentum corresponding to the vibrational transition, even though the rotational transition is lower.

But why would that be the case? The question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, which should be the one requiring the least energy, which is the rotational transition.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. But given the options, the only one that matches an energy I calculate is option D, which corresponds to the vibrational transition. So perhaps the intended answer is D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required for the diatomic molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy levels in the rotation-vibration model. The molecule is initially in the fundamental state, which corresponds to the lowest vibrational state (\(v=0\)) and the lowest rotational state (\(J=0\)). The next possible states are either \(v=1, J=0\) (vibrational transition) or \(v=0, J=1\) (rotational transition). The energy required for each transition is compared to identify the next state with the lowest energy.

   B = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \cdot 1.208 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.6 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   The energy required for the rotational transition (\(J=0 \to J=1\)) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \cdot 4.6 \times 10^{-23} = 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

4. **Vibrational Transition Energy (\(\Delta E_{\text{vib}}\)):**
   The vibrational energy levels are given by:
   \[
   E_v = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right) \hbar \omega, \quad \text{where } \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}.
   \]
   For \(v=0 \to v=1\):
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega = (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
   \]

5. **Comparison of Energies:**
   - \(\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\),
   - \(\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}\).

   The rotational transition requires significantly less energy than the vibrational transition. Therefore, the next state with the lowest possible energy is \(v=0, J=1\), and the photon energy should match \(\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\).

6. **Photon Momentum (\(p\)):**
   The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by:
   \[
   p = \frac{E}{c}, \quad \text{where } c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
   \]
   Substituting \(\Delta E_{\text{rot}}\):
   \[
   p = \frac{9.2 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A:** \(1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}\) (\(1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s}\)) — This is much larger than the calculated momentum.
- **Option B:** \(2.3 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{N·s}\) (\(2.3 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg·m/s}\)) — This is also much larger than the calculated momentum.
- **Option C:** \(1.1 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{N·s}\) (\(1.1 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg·m/s}\)) — This is larger than the calculated momentum.
- **Option D:** \(1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}\) (\(1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s}\)) — This corresponds to the vibrational transition (\(\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}\)) and is not the correct answer for the rotational transition.

### Conclusion:
The calculated momentum for the rotational transition (\(3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s}\)) does not match any of the options. However, the only option that aligns with the vibrational transition is **Option D**, which corresponds to \(p = 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}\). Given the discrepancy, the intended answer appears to be the vibrational transition.
