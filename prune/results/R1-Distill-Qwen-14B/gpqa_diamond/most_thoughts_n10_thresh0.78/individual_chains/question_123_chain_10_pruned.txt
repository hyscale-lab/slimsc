Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about supernovae and reference frames. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's see.

The problem says that a supernova occurred, and part of its ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames, which means no acceleration involvedâ€”so we can probably use special relativity here.

From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, but in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at that speed, right? Because in relativity, the speed observed is reciprocal in different frames, but wait, no, that's not exactly correct. Actually, in the case of relative motion, if one frame is moving at v relative to another, the other frame appears to move at v in the opposite direction. So here, if the ejecta is moving at v towards the Galaxy, the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at the same v. So that makes sense.

The question is asking: what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So we have time in one frame and need to find distance in another.

Wait, I think time dilation might come into play here. Because the two frames are moving relative to each other, the time experienced in each frame isn't the same. So the time given is in the ejecta's frame. We need to find the corresponding time in the Galaxy's frame, or maybe use the Lorentz transformation to find the distance.

Let me get the variables clear. Let's denote:

v = 60,000 km/s = 6e4 km/s. Wait, but the speed of light is about 3e5 km/s, so 6e4 is 60,000 km/s, which is 0.2c (since 0.2 * 3e5 = 6e4). So v = 0.2c.

In the ejecta's frame (let's call it S'), the Galaxy is approaching at v. So in the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving at v towards the center.

We are told that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame (S'). We need to find how much distance the ejecta has moved in the Galaxy's frame (S) during that time.

Wait, no. Actually, the question says, "what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?" So in the Galaxy's frame, how much distance is covered by the ejecta in the time that corresponds to 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, but the time experienced in each frame isn't the same because of time dilation. So we'll have to calculate the time in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the Lorentz transformation to find the distance.

Let me think about the Lorentz transformation. The distance moved in the Galaxy's frame (let's say x) is related to the distance in the ejecta's frame (x').

Wait, but in the ejecta's frame, the ejecta is stationary. So in S' (ejecta's frame), the distance the ejecta travels is zero. Because the ejecta isn't moving in its own frame. So perhaps I should think about the position of the center of the Galaxy in the ejecta's frame, and then transform that to the Galaxy's frame.

Hmm, maybe another approach. The problem is about relative motion and how distances and times transform between frames.

In the ejecta's frame, the time is t' = 50 seconds. We need to find the corresponding time in the Galaxy's frame, t, so that we can compute distance = v * t in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, but that might not be correct, because the time isn't directly just t = gamma * t' because the events might not be simultaneous or something.

Wait, let's clarify: the question is asking, when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame, how much distance has the ejecta (from the Galaxy's perspective) traveled. So the ejecta is moving at v in the Galaxy's frame, but the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer than 50 seconds because of time dilation.

Wait, no. Time dilation works such that the moving clock (ejecta's frame) runs slower. So the time t in the Galaxy's frame is longer, so t = gamma * t'.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the direction. If the ejecta's frame is moving at v relative to the Galaxy, then according to the Galaxy, the ejecta's clock is
