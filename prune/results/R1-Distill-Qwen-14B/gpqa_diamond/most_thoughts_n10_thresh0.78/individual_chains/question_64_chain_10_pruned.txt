Okay, let's try to solve this chemistry problem. Hmm, it's a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step.

So, the problem says we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B that weighs 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without air. When heated, they form a mixture of gases. Then, these gases are passed through several tubes.

The tubes are filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (number 1), then Ca(OH)2 solution (number 2), and red-hot copper (number 3). The results are:

- Tube 1 gains 3.60 g.
- Tube 3 gains 0.80 g, forming CuO.
- Tube 2's weight doesn't change.
- Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure.

Our goal is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

First, I need to figure out what each of these tubes does to the gases. Let me think about each chemical.

Tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant. I remember that when it's anhydrous, it can trap water molecules, especially from gases. So maybe the gas that reacts here is water vapor. So as the gas mixture passes through, any water vapor would be absorbed by Mg(ClO4)2, increasing its weight by the mass of the water. So the increase of 3.60 grams is likely the mass of water vapor, H2O.

Wait, but water isn't a gas at 200°C without air? Wait, no, when you heat salts, they can decompose into gases. Oh, right, the decomposition might produce water vapor if the salts have hydroxide or something that can release H2O.

So, from tube 1: 3.60 g of H2O. Let's calculate moles of H2O. The molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol. 3.60 /18 = 0.2 mol. So, 0.2 moles of H2O.

Next, tube 2: Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas doesn't react with it, then the incoming gas doesn't have any acidic gases like CO2 or SO2. Because Ca(OH)2 is a base, it would react with CO2 to form CaCO3 and water. But since the weight didn't change, maybe there's no CO2 in the gas mixture. Or perhaps the gas is something else that doesn't react with Ca(OH)2. Alternatively, maybe the gas is a neutral one, like N2 or something inert, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the final gas after all these tubes is 2.24 L at STP. STP is 22.4 L per mole, so 2.24 L is 0.1 moles. So gas C is 0.1 moles.

Hmm. Let's think about the sequence. The gases are first passed through Mg(ClO4)2, which traps H2O. Then, Ca(OH)2 solution—so any acidic gases (like CO2 or SO3) would react here. But since the weight of the second tube didn't change, maybe there's no CO2 in the gas. So perhaps the gas is something else.

Wait, but what about other possibilities? Maybe the gas is a neutral gas, like NH3? Wait, no, because NH3 is a base and would react with Ca(OH)2. Hmm. Oh wait, maybe the gas is a noble gas? Or maybe it's a gas that doesn't react with Ca(OH)2, like H2 or O2. Alternatively, maybe the gas is a hydrocarbon, but that's less likely. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is a neutral one like CO, but CO is a neutral gas. Wait, but CO would not react with Ca(OH)2 either. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is nitrogen? Or perhaps the gas is a noble gas, but I think noble gases are unreactive, so that's possible.

But maybe we should consider that the gas after the second tube is something else. Let's think about the third tube: red-hot copper. So any gases that are oxidizing in nature would react with copper. For instance, SO3 or CO2 would react with copper when heated, but perhaps in this case, the gas that passed through tube 2 is something that reacts with copper. The weight gain in tube 3 is 0.80 grams. Since it's CuO formed, the mass increase is due to the oxygen from the gas.

So, for each mole of CuO formed, how much oxygen is added? Let's calculate. The molar mass of CuO is 80 g/mol (63.55 for Cu and 16 for O). So each mole of CuO has one mole of O. So 0.80 grams of O: 0.80 /16 = 0.05 mol O. So, 0.05 moles of O came from the gas.

But wait, that's the oxygen in the CuO. So the gas must have provided the oxygen. So perhaps the gas is O2? But if O2 was present, it would have reacted with the copper. However, in that case, oxygen would combine with copper to form CuO. But wait, O2 is a diatomic gas, O2, so each mole of O2 contributes 2 moles of O. So if 0.05 moles of O were added, that would require 0.025 moles of O2.

But then, the reaction would be 2 Cu + O2 → 2 CuO. So for each mole of O2, two moles of CuO are formed. So, 0.025 moles of O2 would produce 0.05 moles of CuO? Wait, no. Let me think again. If you have 1 mole of O2, it reacts with 4 moles of Cu to form 4 moles of CuO. Each mole of CuO has one O, so 4 moles of O come from 1 mole of O2. Alternatively, for each mole of O2, you get 2 moles of CuO, each with one O, so 2 moles O in total. So 0.05 moles O would come from 0.025 moles of O2. Because each O2 gives two O atoms, so 0.025 * 2 = 0.05 O atoms. So that's correct.

But wait, what was the gas that passed through tube 2 and then reacted with copper in tube 3? It must have been O2. Because after tube 2, there's still some gas left, and that gas was O2, which then reacted with copper.

But wait, the initial gas after decomposition (before any tubes) is a mixture. So we have H2O vapor, which is trapped in tube 1. Then, any CO2 or other acidic gases would be absorbed by tube 2, but if tube 2's weight didn't change, that suggests that there were no such gases. So perhaps the only gas that passed through tube 2 was O2, which then was reacted with copper in tube 3.

Wait, but let's think about the initial gas mixture. The salts A and B decompose into some gases. Let's consider that the decomposition produces H2O, and possibly some O2 and another gas.

Wait, but the final gas is 2.24 L (0.1 moles) of gas C. So maybe that's the O2? Because if the O2 didn't fully react, but that seems unlikely because the copper is red-hot, which would promote the reaction.

Wait, but the initial decomposition may have produced H2O and another gas. Let me think about what else could be present.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are nitrates. Upon heating, nitrates often decompose into NO2, O2, and other products. But wait, Mg(ClO4)2 would trap any H2O. So perhaps the decomposition is of something like NH4Cl? No, that would produce NH3 and HCl, but then in tube 2, which is Ca(OH)2 solution.

Wait, let's think about the decomposition of nitrates. For example, when nitrates decompose, they can produce NO2, O2, and other products. But let's say salts A and B are nitrates. Upon heating, they decompose:

For example, perhaps (NH4)NO3 decomposes into N2O and H2O.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider that the initial decomposition produces H2O, O2, and another gas.

So, let's consider that salts A and B are copper nitrate or something similar. But perhaps they're nitrates of metals that, upon heating, release O2 and form some other products.

But maybe a better approach is to do some stoichiometry.

So let's outline the data:

- Mass of salts A and B: 7.20 g, equimolar. Let's say each is n moles, so total moles are 2n.

After heating:

Gases formed are passed through:

1. Mg(ClO4)2: gains 3.60 g H2O. So moles H2O = 3.60 / 18 = 0.2 mol.

2. Ca(OH)2 solution: no change. So no CO2 or other acidic gases.

3. Cu: gains 0.80 g. So moles O: 0.80 /16 = 0.05 mol. So O comes from the gas that passed through, which is O2.

Wait, but after tube 3, gas C is left. But the reaction in tube 3 would have consumed any O2, unless some didn't react. But the problem says that after all, 2.24 L (0.1 moles) of gas C remained. So gas C is something else. Maybe it's N2 or another inert gas.

Wait, let's think again. Let's model the process.

The decomposition of salts A and B produces gases, which include H2O (trapped in tube 1), O2 (trapped in tube 3), and some other gas (gas C) that didn't react in any of the tubes.

So, in the initial gas mixture:

Moles of H2O: 0.2 mol.

Moles of O2: let's say x.

Moles of gas C: y.

After passing through tube 1, the H2O is removed, so the remaining gases are O2 and gas C.

In tube 2, if there's no change, perhaps there's no CO2, so the remaining gases are O2 and gas C.

In tube 3, O2 reacts with Cu. The reaction is: 2 Cu + O2 → 2 CuO.

The amount of O in CuO is 0.05 mol. So moles of O2 consumed is 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 mol. Because each O2 gives 2 O atoms.

So, moles O2 consumed: 0.025 mol. So, if the initial O2 from decomposition was 0.025 mol, all of it would have been consumed, leaving no O2 to exit. But wait, the problem states that after tube 3, 2.24 L (0.1 mol) of gas C remained. So, that suggests that gas C is not O2, because O2 would have been consumed in the reaction. So perhaps gas C is something else, like N2, which doesn't react with Cu.

Wait, but then why did O2 only contribute 0.05 mol of O in CuO. So the O2 must have been 0.025 mol. So the initial O2 moles were 0.025. But then, what about the rest?

Wait, let's model the entire process:

After heating, the gases are H2O, O2, and gas C.

Then, H2O is absorbed by tube 1 (0.2 mol).

The remaining gases are O2 and gas C. These pass through tube 2, which shows no change. So gas C must be something that doesn't react with Ca(OH)2. Maybe N2 or a noble gas.

In tube 3, O2 reacts with copper. So moles of O2 that reacted: 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 mol. So all the O2 present (0.025) reacts, and gas C passes through without reacting.

After tube 3, the volume of gas C is 2.24 L at STP, which is 0.1 mol
