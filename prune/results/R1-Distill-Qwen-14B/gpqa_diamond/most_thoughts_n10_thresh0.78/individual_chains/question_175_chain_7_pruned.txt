Okay, I'm going to try to tackle this physics problem. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electromagnetism, but let's see. The question is about the radiation from an oscillating charge distribution.

So, the setup is an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid with the symmetry axis along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and θ, the angle with the z-axis.

The question is asking two things: what fraction of the maximum power A is radiated at θ = 30 degrees, and what form f(λ) has. The options give various possibilities.

First, I think about the radiation pattern of an oscillating charge, especially a dipole. Wait, a spheroid—maybe it's a dipole radiator. Dipole radiation typically has a radiation pattern that depends on cos²θ, right? So the power radiated in a particular direction would fall off with cos²θ. But wait, the dipole pattern is actually proportional to (sinθ)^2 for the radiation intensity. Or wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Dipole radiation emits more strongly along the equatorial plane (θ=90 degrees) and less along the axial directions (θ=0 and 180). The radiation pattern for a dipole is symmetric around the z-axis, and the intensity is proportional to (sinθ)^2. So the maximum intensity is at θ=90 degrees. That makes sense because the dipole's radiation is strongest perpendicular to its axis.

Wait, but the question asks about θ=30 degrees. So I need to find the fraction of the maximum power radiated there.

Wait, the maximum power A is the maximum of the function f. So the maximum would occur where (dP/dθ) is zero, and f is maximum. For dipole radiation, the maximum is at θ=90 degrees, where sinθ=1, so sin²θ=1. So the intensity at θ=30 degrees would be sin²(30) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So the intensity is 1/4 of the maximum. But wait, the power per unit solid angle is proportional to sin²θ. So the
