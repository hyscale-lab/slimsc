Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator H. The Hamiltonian is given as H = εσ·n, where ε is an energy constant, n is a unit vector, and σ are the Pauli spin matrices.

Hmm, I remember the Pauli matrices are these 2x2 matrices that describe the spin of particles in quantum mechanics. Each σ is a vector component: σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So when you see σ·n, that's the dot product, right? So it's σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z.

Wait, the dot product with a unit vector. So n is a direction, and σ·n is a matrix in that direction. Since n is a unit vector, the coefficients are n_x, n_y, n_z each squared adding up to 1, so (n_x)^2 + (n_y)^2 + (n_z)^2 =1.

I think the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix σ·n would be important here. Because the Hamiltonian is a multiple of this matrix. So the eigenvalues of H should be ε times the eigenvalues of σ·n.

So what are the eigenvalues of σ·n? Well, I remember that each Pauli matrix (like σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) has eigenvalues ±1. But when you have a linear combination like σ·n, which is a sum of the Pauli matrices multiplied by the components of n, what are its eigenvalues?

Wait, I think that for any unit vector n, the operator σ·n is a Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues ±1. Because each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, and the direction doesn't change the magnitude of the eigenvalues. It's just the direction of the spin, but the magnitude is the same. So the eigenvalues should still be 1 and -1, regardless of the direction of n.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. For example, take σ_z. Its eigenvalues are +1 and -1. If n is in the z-direction, then σ·n is σ_z, so eigenvalues ±1. If n is in the x-direction, σ·n is σ_x, which also has eigenvalues ±1. Same for y. What if n is in some arbitrary direction? Like (1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3). Then σ·n would be (σ_x + σ_y + σ_z)/√3. But when you diagonalize that, what are the eigenvalues?

Wait, I think the eigenvalues are still ±1. Because σ·n is a unit vector in the space of spin, so the magnitude is 1. The eigenvalues would be the magnitude times some factor. Wait, wait, no. Wait, wait, the Pauli matrices have trace zero and determinant -1. So their eigenvalues would be 1 and -1, because for a 2x2 matrix, if the trace is zero, the sum of eigenvalues is zero, and the product is determinant. So the product is (1)(-1) = -1. So yes, each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1. 

So if σ·n is a linear combination of Pauli matrices, but scaled by n's components, but n is a unit vector, so the matrix σ·n has the same eigenvalues as any Pauli matrix, because the direction doesn't affect the magnitude of the eigen
