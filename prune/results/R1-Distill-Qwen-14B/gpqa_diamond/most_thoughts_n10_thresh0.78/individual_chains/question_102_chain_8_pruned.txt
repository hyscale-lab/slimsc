Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about a genetics experiment, and honestly, it's a bit complex for me. Let me break it down step by step.

So, the question involves a ligand-receptor pair in neural crest cells. The setup uses a bicistronic lox-Cre vector, which I remember means it has two genes in one construct. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor's ORF is at the 3' end and fused to eGFP at its C-terminus.

The promoters and regulatory elements are important here. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor has an IRES upstream. Hmm, I think IRES elements allow for internal ribosome entry, so they can support the translation of the downstream gene, even if the upstream gene isn't expressed. So maybe the receptor is expressed regardless of the ligand's promoter? Or maybe not, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Looking at the stops: between the ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between the receptor and eGFP, there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. Oh wait, loxP is a site recognized by Cre recombinase, right? Lox2272 is a variant, perhaps. So when Cre is present, it would recombine the lox sites and remove the stop cassettes, allowing the genes to be expressed.

So the vector is designed so that in the absence of Cre, both the ligand and receptor are not expressed because the stops are in place. But when Cre is introduced, like in the presence of Cre-expressing mice, the stops are removed, and both genes are expressed.

Wait, but the setup here is a bit more detailed. The ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter, I think. The receptor is after an IRES. So in normal conditions, without Cre, the ligand's ORF would be under CBA, but the stop after would prevent mCherry from being expressed. Similarly, the receptor is after the IRES, but the stop before eGFP would prevent its expression unless the Cre is present to remove the stops.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The vector has two cassettes: one for the ligand and another for the receptor. The ligand's ORF is fused to mCherry, but there's a stop in between, which is flanked by loxP sites. So without Cre, the stop remains, so the ligand is expressed (since it's under CBA) but mCherry isn't. The receptor is under the control of the IRES, which is after the ligand's stop cassette. Then the receptor ORF is followed by a stop cassette flanked by lox2272 sites. So without Cre, the receptor's expression is blocked because the stop is present before eGFP.

Wait, noâ€”the IRES is upstream of the receptor? Or is
