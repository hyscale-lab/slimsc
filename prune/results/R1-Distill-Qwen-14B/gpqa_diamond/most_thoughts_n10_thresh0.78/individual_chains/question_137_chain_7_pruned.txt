Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember a cyclotron is a particle accelerator that uses a magnetic field and an electric field to accelerate charged particles. But wait, a synchrocyclotron is a special type, right? Maybe it's similar but has some adjustments for higher energies or something.

The problem says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is approximately zero. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy T1 of 950 MeV. Oh wait, no, wait. The question is about how many revolutions the proton makes in the synchrocyclotron. Hmm, okay.

The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The data given are Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV. The options are four numbers, all around thousands or so.

Wait, but wait. Synchrocyclotrons are different from regular cyclotrons because they have a varying magnetic field, right? Oh wait, no. Wait, cyclotrons use a constant magnetic field and a varying electric field. Synchrocyclotrons, or is it the other way around? Oh right, no—wait, the regular cyclotron's magnetic field is constant, while the electric field is oscillating. Synchrocyclotrons, I think, have a magnetic field that's varied over time to keep the particles in phase with
