Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to its distance from the star, right? And Kepler's third law relates the orbital period to the distance and the mass of the star. Oh wait, but the problem doesn't mention the star's mass. Maybe I can assume it's similar to the Sun or something? Or perhaps it cancels out in the ratio.

The problem says the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4. And between Planet2 and Planet3, it's 2.3, so T2/T3=2.3. So I can find the temperature ratios for all three.

Wait, I think the equilibrium temperature formula is T = [(L*(1 - a))/(16 * pi * sigma * D^2)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, and D is the distance. Since all planets have the same albedo, a=0.3, that cancels out in the ratio. Also, the star's luminosity L is the same for all planets, so when taking the ratio of temperatures, L will cancel.

So T is proportional to (1/(D^2))^(1/4) )= (1/D^(1/2)). So T is proportional to 1/sqrt(D). So the ratio of T1 to T2 is sqrt(D2/D1) ) inverse? Wait, let me think again. If T prop 1/sqrt(D), then T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1). Because T1 = k / sqrt(D1), T2 = k / sqrt(D2). So T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1) = (D2/D1)^(1/2).

Wait, let's calculate. Let me write the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1). So if T1/T2 is 1.4, then 1.4 = sqrt(D2/D1). Squaring both sides, D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So D2 = 1.96 * D1.

Similarly, for T2 and T3: T2/T3 = sqrt(D3
