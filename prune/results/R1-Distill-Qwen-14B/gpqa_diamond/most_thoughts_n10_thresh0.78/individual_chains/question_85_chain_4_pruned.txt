Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember the formulas.

The question involves two planets orbiting a star. Both have been detected using transit and radial velocity methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. 

Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and a radius of 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 has 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both are in circular orbits, which probably means we don't have to worry about eccentricity affecting the temperature. 

They mention something about shifts in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å, and Planet2 causes 0.04 Å. I'm not entirely sure how this relates to the Doppler shift and the RV method, but I think that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull, causing the star to wobble. The shift in the line would indicate the velocity of the star towards or away from us. 

Wait, the shift is in the forbidden line, which is probably used for determining the star's velocity. But how does that relate to the mass or the distance of the planet? Oh, right. The radial velocity method gives us the mass of the planet (or at least a lower limit) based on the Doppler shift. The formula for RV semi-amplitude K is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) )) 

Wait, but since the planets are much less massive than the star, M_planet << M_star, so we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So K ≈ ( (G * M_planet * sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(1 + ...)) but maybe a better approach is to think about the formula in terms of the known parameters.

Alternatively, another approach is that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (v) ) = ( ( (P * G )^(1/3) * M_planet sin i ) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )

But since e=0 (circular orbits), and M_planet is much less than M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( ( (P)^(1/3) * (G)^(1/3) ) * M_planet ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) )

But I'm not sure if that's directly needed here, because the question seems to ask about the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, not their masses or orbital periods. Hmm.

Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on several factors. The formula for equilibrium temperature (Teq) is usually given by:

Teq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) / ( (1 + sqrt( (R_planet)/(a) )) )

Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The star emits flux F at the planet's distance, and the planet absorbs some of it and radiates as a blackbody. The equilibrium temperature is when the absorbed energy equals the emitted energy.

So the star's flux at the planet's orbital distance a is
