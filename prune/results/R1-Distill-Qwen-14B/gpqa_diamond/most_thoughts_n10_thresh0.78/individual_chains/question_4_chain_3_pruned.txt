Okay, so I've got this physics question here about Maxwell's equations in a universe where magnets can have isolated north or south poles. Hmm, that's a bit tricky, but let me think through it.

Wait, in our universe, magnets always have both north and south poles. Like, you can't just have a single pole. But in this parallel universe, they can. So that must mean something about the magnetic field is different there.

Maxwell's equations... There are four of them, right? Let me recall each one. The first one is about the divergence of the electric field being proportional to the charge density. The second is Faraday's law, which deals with the curl of the electric field and changing magnetic flux. The third is Gauss's law for magnetism, which says the divergence of B is zero. And the fourth is Ampère's law, which involves the curl of B and the current plus the displacement current.

So in our universe, because magnetic monopoles don't exist, the divergence of B is zero. That's the third equation. But if this universe allows for isolated north or south poles, that means there's a magnetic charge. So the magnetic Gauss's law would change.

Wait, right, because if you have a magnetic monopole, like an isolated north pole, the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. It would be proportional to the magnetic charge density. So the third equation would be different.

But what about the other equations? Let me think. The first equation (Gauss's law for E) is about electric charges, so it shouldn't change because magnetic monopoles don't affect electric charge. The second equation is Faraday's law; I think that still holds because it's about the relation between changing B and E fields. The fourth equation, Ampère's, also deals with currents and displacement currents, which are electric in nature, so maybe that's unchanged.

Wait, but wait a second. There's another equation that's sometimes considered if magnetic monopoles exist. The Maxwell-Faraday equation (the second one) would remain the same, but the source terms in the other equations would change. Oh, but in this question, the options are about which equations are different.

In our universe, the divergence of B is zero (third equation). If magnetic monopoles exist, that equation changes—so the third equation is different. What about the others? Let me check each option.

Looking back at the question: which equations are different?

Option A says the one related to the divergence of B. So that's the third equation. But could another equation change too?

Wait, another point. If magnetic monopoles exist, then perhaps Ampère's law (the fourth equation) would also have a magnetic current term, similar to how the displacement current appears because of Maxwell's correction. Wait, no, Ampère's law in our universe is about the
