Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident about all the reactions involved. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a four-fused cyclohexane rings or something like that. So dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms attached. Since it's 1,3-dibromo, they're probably on adjacent carbons or something?

First step: heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination reaction. When vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base, they typically undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules and form an alkene. But wait, 1,3 positions... Wait, in an adamantane structure, the positions 1 and 3 might not be adjacent. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a β-hydrogen leading to the formation of a double bond.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a double elimination. So each Br is on a carbon, and the base removes H from each adjacent carbon, leading to the formation of a double bond. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr and form an alkene. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene or something like that. Or maybe 1,3-diene? Or perhaps it's a diene in the adamantane structure.

Looking at the NMR data for product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a triplet. Hmm, 4.79 is a region where -OCH2- groups or maybe -CH2-O- appear. Wait, but after KOH, maybe it's an alcohol or an epoxide? Wait, but the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that suggests a ketone or maybe an ester. Wait, but 1720 is lower than a typical ketone (which is around 1715-1740). Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or a lactone? Or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, let me think again. Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Another possibility is that it's a substitution reaction, but with excess KOH, it's more likely elimination. But wait, if it's elimination, the product would be an alkene. But then the product's IR shows a carbonyl, which doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong about the reaction.

Wait, maybe the reaction is not elimination. Let's think about possible alternative reactions. KOH can act as a base and a nucleophile. If it's a vicinal dihalide, perhaps it would form a diol via hydrolysis. But that would require two OH groups, but the IR doesn't show broad peaks around 3300 (O-H stretch). Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. Hydrolysis of dihalides usually gives diols, but maybe under strongly basic conditions, something else happens.

Another angle: the IR has 1720, which is a carbonyl. So maybe after KOH, there's a ketone formed. How? Maybe elimination followed by some rearrangement.

Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, and then further reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts protons
