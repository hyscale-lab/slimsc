Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric fields and conductors. Let me take it step by step. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll think it through.

Alright, let's read the problem again. There's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity of radius r. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the conductor's center. The conductor has a positive charge +q placed inside the cavity. I need to find the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor, which is a distance L from the conductor's center. The point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center, and the angle between l and s is θ.

Hmm, what do I remember about conductors and electric fields? Oh right, when a conductor is neutral and has a cavity with a charge inside, the charge induces charges on the conductor's inner and outer surfaces. Wait, but the conductor was initially uncharged, so the total charge on the conductor is zero. Oh right, the charges inside the cavity will induce an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor itself was neutral, the outer surface must have a charge equal to the induced charge on the inner surface but opposite. Or wait, no. Let me think again. The conductor is neutral. The cavity has +q. Therefore, the inner surface of the conductor (the one facing the cavity) must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then the outer surface must have +q, because the conductor's total charge is zero, so the outer surface is +q. 

But wait, the conductor itself was initially uncharged. So when a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity wall) must have -q induced on it. The conductor's material can't have a net charge because it was neutral, so the outer surface must have +q to balance the -q on the inner surface. So the outer surface has +q. 

Now, the question is about the electric field at a point outside the conductor. So point P is outside the conductor, which means the field at P depends on the charge on the outer surface. Because the outer surface behaves as if all its charge is concentrated at the center, due to the shell theorem. So the field outside a spherical shell is the same as if all the charge were at the center. 

Wait, but wait a second. The conductor has a cavity that's not concentric. The cavity's center is a distance s from the conductor's center, and the charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity. So the charge distribution may not be symmetric around the center of the conductor. Does that affect the induced charges? 

Hmm, right. If the cavity is not concentric, the induced charges on the conductor might not be uniform. But wait, the conductor is a conductor, so the charges will redistribute themselves in such a way that the electric field inside the conductor material is zero. So the charges on the inner surface will arrange to shield the conductor's interior. But the presence of the cavity with a non-concentric charge complicates things. 

Wait, but the charge +q is inside the cavity. The conductor's inner surface must have an induced charge -q, but since the cavity's center is displaced, the induced charges on the inner surface won't be uniformly distributed. So the inner surface will have a dipole or some other distribution, perhaps. But wait, because the conductor is a conductor, the inner surface's induced charge will arrange itself such that the electric field inside the conductor (the material) is zero. 

But for the outer surface, the conductor is a spherical shell (even if the cavity isn't), so the outer surface's charge distribution must be spherically symmetric. Because any non-symmetrical charge distribution on the outer surface would create an internal field in the conductor material, which can't happen. So the outer surface must have a uniform charge distribution because the conductor is a sphere. So the outer surface's charge is +q, and it acts as if it's at the center for points outside. 

Wait, but then what about the inner surface? If the charge inside the cavity is not at the center of the conductor, the inner surface's charge distribution would be non-uniform. But as long as the conductor is a conductor, the inner surface's induced charge would arrange such that the field inside the conductor is zero. So the electric field just outside the conductor's surface (but inside the conductor) would be due to the inner and outer induced charges. But for points outside the conductor, the field depends only on the outer induced charge, which is +q. 

Wait, but the problem is about the electric field at a point outside the conductor. So for that point, the field is as if all the charge on the outer surface is at the center of the conductor. So the field would be due to the +q charge on the outer surface, located at the center of the conductor. 

But wait, the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The charge is at the conductor's center, so the electric field at P is (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²). 

Looking at the options, option B is (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²). That would be the case if the charge were at the center and P is outside. But wait, the conductor's outer surface has +q, so yes. So the field should be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²), which is option B.

But wait, the problem says the point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center, and the distance from the conductor's center is L. The angle between l and s is θ. So the displacement from the cavity's center to the conductor's center is s. So the vector from the cavity's center to P is l, and the displacement from the conductor's center to P is L. So l, s, and L form a triangle with angle θ between s and l. 

Wait a second, perhaps I'm missing something. If the conductor's outer surface has +q, then the field due to that charge at P would be as if the charge were at the conductor's center. So the field would be (1/(4πε₀)) q / L², regardless of l and s and θ. Because in the conductor's frame, the outer charge is at the center, and P is outside, so the distance is L. So option B is correct. 

Wait, but why are the other options there? Let me think again. Could it be that the field isn't just due to the outer charge? No, because the conductor's inner and outer charges are such that the field inside the conductor is zero. So outside, the field is due to the outer charge. 

So the answer should be option B. E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²). So the correct option is B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius \( R \) with a small spherical cavity of radius \( r \) inside. The cavity's center is displaced from the conductor's center by a distance \( s \), and a small positive charge \( +q \) is placed inside the cavity. The goal is to determine the electric field \( \vec{E} \) at a point \( P \) outside the conductor, which is at a distance \( L \) from the conductor's center and \( l \) from the cavity's center. The angle between \( l \) and \( s \) is \( \theta \).

When a charge \( +q \) is placed inside the cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge \( -q \) on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is initially neutral, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge \( +q \) to maintain charge conservation. The outer surface behaves as a spherical shell, and by the shell theorem, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface, as if it were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

For a point \( P \) outside the conductor, the electric field is determined solely by the charge \( +q \) on the outer surface, located at the center of the conductor. The distance from the center of the conductor to \( P \) is \( L \), so the electric field at \( P \) is given by:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

This result is independent of the displacement \( s \), the distance \( l \), or the angle \( \theta \), as the field outside the conductor depends only on the charge on the outer surface and the distance \( L \) from the conductor's center.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A** and **Option C** involve terms like \( (l \pm s \cos\theta)^2 \), which are irrelevant because the field outside the conductor depends only on the outer surface charge and \( L \).
- **Option D** assumes the field depends on \( l^2 \), which is incorrect for the same reason.
- **Option B** correctly gives the field as \( \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2} \), which matches the derived result.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
