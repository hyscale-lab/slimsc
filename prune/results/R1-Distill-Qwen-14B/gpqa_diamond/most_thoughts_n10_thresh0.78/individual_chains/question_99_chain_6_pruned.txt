Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound is the correct one based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that a broad peak around there usually indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Then there's a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, which is around the range for a carbonyl group (C=O). So the compound probably has a carboxylic acid group because that would explain both the O-H and the C=O stretches. Alternatively, it could be an ester or ketone, but the broad peak suggests it's more likely a carboxylic acid since alcohols (like O-H in -OH) are usually less broad. Wait, no, wait—alcohol O-H is broad too, but carboxylic acids have even broader and maybe more intense O-H because they're more acidic. So the 1700 cm⁻¹ is probably a C=O from a carboxylic acid.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR data: several peaks, none corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. That means there are no double bonds in the molecule, right? Because vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the structure doesn't have any double bonds or aromatic rings—so maybe it's a branched carboxylic acid.

The NMR signals: One is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm. That's a bit complex, but let's think about splitting. Each of these signals must be split by neighboring protons.

Wait, maybe the splitting can help determine the structure. Let's think about possible structures.

Looking at the options:

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH
That would be (CH3CH2)(CH(CH3)2)COOH. Wait no, structure is CH3CH2 - C(H)(CH3) - C(H)(CH3) - COOH. So the two central carbons each have a hydrogen and two methyl groups attached. So each CH is attached to two CH3 groups. That would lead to symmetry.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So each CH has a C2H5 group. Wait, C2H5 is ethyl. So the structure would be (CH2CH3)2 attached to each of the central CH groups. So that's two ethyl groups on each of the two central carbons.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5) connected to another C(H)(C2H5), then CH2COOH. So the two middle carbons each have an ethyl group, a CH
