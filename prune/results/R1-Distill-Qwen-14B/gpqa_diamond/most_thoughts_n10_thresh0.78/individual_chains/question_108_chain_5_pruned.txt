Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about paramagnetic coupling and the hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me try to think it through. Alright, the question is asking me to compare the order of magnitude between the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The options are about whether one is much bigger or smaller than the other.

Right, so first, I should probably figure out what each term represents. The paramagnetic coupling term relates to the interaction between the magnetic moment of an electron and an external magnetic field. I remember that the magnetic moment μ is given by the Bohr magneton multiplied by the magnetic quantum number m. But wait, the problem says m is small, so maybe m is on the order of 1 or maybe something like that.

The transition energy ΔE is for hydrogen, and the wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers. Oh wait, that's the wavelength for the Balmer series, specifically the H-alpha line, which is about 656 nm, but wait, wait, no—the given is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nm. Oh, that's the Balmer series as well, but wait no, 486 nm is actually the H-alpha line. Or wait, no, I think the Balmer-alpha line is 486 nm. Yeah, that's right.

So the energy ΔE is the energy difference between two energy levels in hydrogen. The formula for energy levels in hydrogen is E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So if the transition is from n=2 to n=1, for example, the energy would be the difference between E_2 and E_1. Let's compute that.

E_1 is -13.6 eV, E_2 is -13.6 /4 = -3.4 eV. So ΔE is E_2 - E_1 = (-3.4) - (-13.6) = 10.2 eV. Wait, but wait, the transition energy is the energy of the photon emitted, which is E = hc/λ. So maybe the ΔE is actually the energy of the photon, which is equal to hc/λ.

Wait, I should calculate that. Let's compute ΔE using the wavelength given, which is λ = 0.4861 μm = 486.1 nm. So using E = hc/λ. Let me get the constants: h is Planck's constant, about 6.626e-34 J·s. c is speed of light, around 3e8 m/s. So hc is approximately 1.986e-25 J·m. Then λ is 486.1e-9 meters.

So E = (1.986e-25 J·m) / (486.1e-9 m) = approximately (1.986e-25) / (4.861e-7) ≈ 4.085e-19 J. To convert that into electron volts, since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so E = (4.085e-19 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 2.55 eV. So that's the ΔE due to the transition.

Wait, but earlier I thought about the energy levels and got 10.2 eV for n=2 to n=1. That's a big discrepancy. Oh wait, I must have mixed up the series. Maybe the given wavelength corresponds to a different transition. Let me think: the Balmer series is transitions ending at n=2. So if the transition is from n=3 to n=2, the energy would be E_3 - E_2 = (-1.51) - (-3.4) = 1.89 eV. Hmm, but that doesn't match the 2.55 eV I calculated from the wavelength.

Wait, maybe the transition is from n=4 to n=3? Let me compute that. E_4 = -13.6/16 = -0.85 eV, E_3 is -1.51. So ΔE is -0.85 - (-1.51) = 0.66 eV. Hmm, that's not matching either. Alternatively, perhaps the given wavelength is for a different transition. Let me compute what transition corresponds to λ=486.1 nm.

The formula is 1/λ (in meters) = (E_upper - E_lower)/hc. Or wait, 1/λ = (E_upper - E_lower)/(hc), but since E_upper is lower in energy (more negative), I think it's E_upper - E_lower = negative, but the photon emitted has energy E_lower - E_upper. So 1/λ = (E_lower - E_upper)/(hc).

Wait, perhaps I should just compute the energy from the wavelength. As I did before, E=2.55 eV. So that's the ΔE for this transition.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term. The paramagnetic term is the energy due to the interaction of the magnetic moment with the magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for the paramagnetic term is H_p = -μ·B. μ is the magnetic moment, which is given by μ = g * (eħ/(2m_e)) * m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor, but for hydrogen, I think the g-factor is about 2 for the electron. But wait, the paramagnetic coupling is typically considered as the spin-orbit interaction, but maybe in this case, it's the Zeeman effect without spin-orbit coupling? Or is it the spin part? Hmm.

Alternatively, the paramagnetic term could be the Zeeman term, which is H = -μ·B. For an electron, μ = -g_s * μ_B * m_s, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. So the energy would be H = g_s * μ_B * m_s * B.

Wait, but the problem states that m is small, so m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, which for electrons in the hydrogen atom can be -l, ... , +l. So for l=1, m can be -1,0,+1. So the maximum m
