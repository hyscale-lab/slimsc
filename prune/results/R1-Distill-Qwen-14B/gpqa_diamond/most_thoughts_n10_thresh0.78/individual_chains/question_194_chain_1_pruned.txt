Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. 

Wait, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-beta E), right? Beta is 1/(kT), but I don't think I need to worry about the exact expression for beta since it's a given parameter.

First, I should figure out all the possible states of the system. Each spin has two possible states, so for three spins, that's 2^3 = 8 possible configurations. Each configuration is a combination of S1, S2, S3 being +1 or -1.

But wait, calculating each state's energy individually might be time-consuming. Maybe there's a smarter way to group states based on their energies. Because some states will have the same energy, so I can compute the energy once for each group and multiply by the number of states in that group.

So let me think about the energy expression again. E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me compute the product terms for each state. Each product S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. Because if both are +1 or both are -1, the product is +1. If one is +1 and the other is -1, product is -1.

So for each pair (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), each contributes either +1 or -1.

But wait, the sum is S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let me denote this sum as H. So E = -J H. So each term in the sum H is either +1 or -1.

Hmm, so H can take different values based on the configuration. Let me find all possible values of H and how many states correspond to each H.

Let me list all
