Okay, so I have this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the CMB photons. Hmm, I remember that the CMB is this radiation leftover from the Big Bang, and it's everywhere in the universe. The question is about when a high-energy gamma-ray interacts with a CMB photon to produce an electron-positron pair. 

The process is gamma-gamma -> e+ e-. I think this is a type of photon-photon annihilation. So, the gamma-ray has a certain energy, and the CMB photon is much lower energy since the average is given as 1e-3 eV. 

The question is asking, from what energy gamma-rays would their lifetimes be limited by this process. Oh right, because if the gamma-rays can annihilate with CMB photons, that would limit how long they can exist in the universe. So we're looking for the energy where this annihilation becomes significant, affecting the gamma-ray's lifetime.

I remember that for photon-photon interactions, the cross-section (which is like the probability of interaction) depends on the energy of the photons. The cross-section for producing electron-positron pairs probably peaks when the combined energy of the two photons is just enough to create the rest mass of the electron-positron pair. 

Wait, but wait, the energy of the gamma-ray is much higher than the CMB photon. Let me think. The electron mass is about 0.511 MeV, so 2 * 0.511 MeV is about 1.022 MeV. But that's the threshold for pair production. However, I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here because the CMB photon's energy is 1e-3 eV, which is way lower than 1 MeV.

So, the gamma-ray has energy E, and the CMB photon has energy E_cmb = 1e-3 eV. For pair production to happen, the combined energy in the center of mass frame must be at least the rest mass of the electron-positron pair. So the condition is sqrt(s) >= m_e c^2 * 2? Wait, no, because each photon contributes energy in the center of mass frame. Let me clarify.

In the lab frame, suppose the gamma-ray is moving with energy E and the CMB photon is moving in some direction, perhaps opposite. The total energy in the center of mass (CM) frame would need to be at least 2m_e c^2 for pair production. 

The invariant quantity s is the square of the total energy in the CM frame. s = (E_gamma + E_cmb)^2 - (p_gamma c + p_cmb c)^2. For photons, since E = pc, it's s = (E_gamma + E_cmb)^2 - (E_gamma - E_cmb)^2 if they are moving opposite. Let me compute that.

Expanding (E + e)^2 - (E - e)^2, where e is the CMB energy. So (E^2 + 2 E e + e^2) - (E^2 - 2 E e + e^2) = 4 E e. So s = 4 E E_cmb. 

We need the square root of s to be greater than or equal to (2 m_e c^2)^2. Wait, wait, no. The invariant s must be greater than or equal to (sum of rest masses)^2, which for e+ e- pair is (2 m_e c^2)^2. So sqrt(s) >= 2 m_e c^2.

So sqrt(s) = sqrt(4 E E_cmb) = 2 sqrt(E E_cmb). So the condition is 2 sqrt(E E_cmb) >= 2 m_e c^2. Divide both sides by 2: sqrt(E E_cmb) >= m_e c^2.

Then square both sides: E E_cmb >= (m_e c^2)^2.

So E >= (m_e c^2)^2 / E_cmb.

Compute that. Let's see, m_e c^2 is about 0.511 MeV, which is 0.511e6 eV. So (m_e c^2)^2 is (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 eV². E_cmb is 1e-3 eV. So E >= (0.511e6)^2 * eV² / (1e-3 eV) ) 

Wait, let me compute that: (0.511e6)^2 is approximately (5.11e5)^2 = 2.61e11 eV². Divided by 1e-3 eV gives 2.61e14 eV. 

Wait, 2.61e14 eV is equal to 2.61e8 GeV because 1 GeV = 1e9 eV. Wait, no, wait, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. So 2.61e14 eV is 2.61e5 GeV. Because 2.61e14 / 1e9 = 2.61e5. So 2.61e5 GeV.

Looking at the options: Option C is 2.6e5 GeV, but let me check the options again.

Options:
A) 9.5e4 GeV
B) 1.8e5 GeV
C) 2.6e5 GeV
D) 3.9e5 GeV

So is it option C? But wait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake. Let me recheck.

Compute (m_e c^2)^2: (0.511 MeV)^2 = (0.511 * 1e6 eV)^2 = (5.11e5 eV)^2 = approx 2.61e11 eV².

E_cmb is 1e-3 eV.

So E = (2.61e11) / (1e-3) ) eV² / eV = 2.61e14 eV.

Convert eV to GeV: 1 GeV = 1e9 eV. So 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e5 GeV.

So the gamma-ray energy E must be >= 2.61e5 GeV. So the correct answer is option C: 2.6e5 GeV.

Wait a second, but in the calculation, I have sqrt(s) >= 2 m_e c^2, which gives E >= (m_e c^2)^2 / E_cmb. So it's correct. So the answer should be option C. But wait, let me think again about the process.

The annihilation rate would depend on the cross-section and the photon density. The cross-section for photon-photon pair production increases as the photon energies increase. So the condition is that the product of photon energies is sufficient to make the pair. So, the calculation seems right.

Another way: The critical energy is when E_gamma * E_cmb = (m_e c^2)^2. So E_gamma = (m_e c^2)^2 / E_cmb.

Yes, that's the same as before. So option C is the correct answer.


To determine the energy of gamma-rays for which their lifetimes in the universe are limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$ with CMB photons, we analyze the energy threshold for this interaction. The key condition is that the combined energy in the center-of-mass (CM) frame must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair, $2m_e c^2$. 

The invariant quantity $s$ in this process is given by:

\[
s = (E_\gamma + E_{\text{CMB}})^2 - (p_\gamma c + p_{\text{CMB}} c)^2.
\]

For photons, $E = pc$, so in the lab frame where the CMB photon is moving oppositely to the gamma-ray, $s$ simplifies to:

\[
s = (E_\gamma + E_{\text{CMB}})^2 - (E_\gamma - E_{\text{CMB}})^2 = 4E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}}.
\]

The threshold condition for pair production is $\sqrt{s} \geq 2m_e c^2$. Substituting $s = 4E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}}$, we get:

\[
\sqrt{4E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}}} \geq 2m_e c^2.
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
2\sqrt{E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}}} \geq 2m_e c^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sqrt{E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}}} \geq m_e c^2.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}} \geq (m_e c^2)^2.
\]

Rearranging for $E_\gamma$:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{\text{CMB}}}.
\]

Substituting the known values:
- $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}$,
- $E_{\text{CMB}} = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$,

we compute:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6)^2}{10^{-3}} = \frac{0.261 \times 10^{12}}{10^{-3}} = 0.261 \times 10^{15} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Converting to GeV ($1 \, \text{GeV} = 10^9 \, \text{eV}$):

\[
E_\gamma \geq 0.261 \times 10^6 \, \text{GeV} = 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Thus, the energy of gamma-rays for which their lifetimes are limited by this process is approximately $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$. Comparing with the options:

- A) $9.5 \times 10^4 \, \text{GeV}$ (too low),
- B) $1.8 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$ (too low),
- C) $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$ (correct),
- D) $3.9 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$ (too high).

The correct answer is **C**.
