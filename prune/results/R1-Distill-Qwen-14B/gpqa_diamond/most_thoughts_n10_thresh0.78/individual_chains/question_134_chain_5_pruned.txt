Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I've studied some thermochemistry before, but I'm a bit rusty, so I need to remember the key concepts.

The problem states: Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed.

Wait, neutralization reactions usually involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy of neutralization is the energy change when one mole of acid reacts with one mole of base. But wait, in this case, there are three solutions being mixed. So I need to figure out which acids and bases are reacting and in what amounts.

First, I'll list out the reactants:

- HCl: strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.
- H2SO4: sulfuric acid. It's a strong acid as well, but wait, sulfuric is diprotic. The first dissociation is complete (H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-?), no, wait, actually, wait, I think the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Or wait, no. First, H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^- (completely), and then HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2- (this is only about 1% dissociated, so for dilute solutions, we can approximate it as 2 H+ per H2SO4). But in this case, since we're dealing with concentrations and molar amounts, perhaps we can treat H2SO4 as providing 2 moles of H+ per mole of acid. Because even though the second H+ isn't fully dissociated, for the sake of neutralization, assuming 2 H+ is correct.

Wait, but wait, no. Neutralization reactions are typically between an acid (providing H+) and a base (providing OH-). The H+ from H2SO4 will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right? So it dissociates completely. Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^- per formula unit. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.

So I need to calculate the total moles of H+ from both HCl and H2SO4, and the total moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2.

The neutralization will involve H+ and OH- combining to form water: H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat. But wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is usually considered per mole of
