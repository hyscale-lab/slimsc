Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see, it's about spin-1/2 particles and magnetic moments. Hmm. I remember that spin is a form of angular momentum, and the magnetic moment is related to it through some constant gamma.

The problem says there's a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu equals gamma times Sz. Oh wait, right, Sz is the spin component along the z-axis. So mu = Î³ S_z. And the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. Suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. Then, the average of the z-component of the particle's moment starts oscillating. The question is about the oscillation frequency.

Hmm. So initially, the particle is in a magnetic field along Z. The magnetic moment mu would align with B because that's the lowest energy state. But when the field is turned off, the particle's magnetic moment is no longer subject to that field. Then, the field is applied along Y. So the new field will influence the spin.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. When the magnetic field is along Z, the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_z. So the energy levels are quantized. But when the field is suddenly switched off, the spin state remains the same, right? Because if the system was in an eigenstate, and the Hamiltonian changes, the state doesn't change instantaneously. But wait, when the field is turned off, what happens? The system's state doesn't change immediately, so the spin is still aligned along Z. Then, the magnetic field is turned on along Y. So now the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y.

Wait, but the spin state is still in the eigenstate of S_z. So the state is |+z> or |-z>? Let's say it was in the eigenstate |+z> before the field switched. Now, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y. So the energy levels will depend on S_y now.

I think this situation is about a spin state in a magnetic field that's suddenly changed direction. So the system is no longer in an eigenstate of the
