Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let me see what it's asking. The question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle X⁰. 

Alright, breaking down the problem. The decay process is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻, and the proper lifetime τ₀ is given as 8e-16 seconds. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are various resolutions, which I think refers to the precision of the detector, like the minimum distance it can resolve.

Wait, so the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, its lifetime appears longer due to time dilation. So we need to calculate the lifetime in the lab frame, which is the frame of the bubble chamber.

Right, time dilation formula is τ = γ * τ₀. But wait, gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E/(m c²) because for a relativistic particle, the energy E is the total energy and equals gamma m c². So, gamma = E/(m c²). But wait, the units here are in GeV. Oh, but when calculating gamma, since E and m are in the same units (GeV), and c² is in (GeV/c²)², I think the units would work out as gamma being unitless. Let me think: E = gamma m c² → gamma = E/(m c²). But because E is in GeV and m is in GeV/c², when I compute E/(m c²), the c² would cancel out the denominator, but wait, perhaps not. Let me get the units right.

Wait, m c² is (GeV/c²) * (c²) = GeV. So E is GeV, m c² is GeV → so gamma is E/(m c²) = (27 GeV) / (3.41 GeV) ) = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.91, approximately 7.91.

So gamma is around 7.91. Therefore, the lifetime in the lab frame is τ = gamma * τ₀ = 7.91 * 8e-16 s. Let me calculate that. 7.91 *8 is about 63.28, so 63.28e-16 s. So τ ≈ 6.328e-15 seconds.

Wait, what's the purpose of this calculation? Oh right, the decay length. The particle X⁰ travels some distance before decaying. The average decay length L is c * tau. Because the lifetime is tau, the average distance it travels at the speed of light is c multiplied by tau.

So L = c * tau. Let me compute that. c is approximately 3e8 meters per second. So L = 3e8 m/s * 6.328e-15 s. Let me multiply that:
