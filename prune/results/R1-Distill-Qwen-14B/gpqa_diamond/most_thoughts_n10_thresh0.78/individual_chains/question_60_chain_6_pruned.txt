Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. 

The question is about an alien astronaut traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth in a super fast spacecraft. Their speed is 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip will take from their point of view. The options are A through D, with A saying the astronaut dies before reaching Earth.

Hmm, I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation comes into play. Time dilation is a concept from Einstein's theory of relativity. So, from the astronaut's perspective, less time would pass compared to someone observing from Earth.

Wait, but wait. The problem asks for the time the astronaut experiences, which is their proper time. So I need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut during the journey.

First, I should probably figure out how far the Large Magellanic Cloud is from Earth. I think the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away. Oh wait, but I'm not sure about the exact distance. Does the problem provide it? Let me check the question again. Oh, no, it doesn't. Hmm. Maybe I'm supposed to know the distance, or perhaps it's a standard figure used in such problems.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think. The problem says the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987c. That's extremely close to the speed of light. So, from Earth's frame, the distance is L, and the time taken would be L divided by the speed. But from the astronaut's frame, the distance would be length-contracted.

Right, so from Earth's perspective, the distance is D light-years. Let's say D = 163,000 light-years because I remember that's approximately how far the LMC is. But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe we can assume it's around 160,000 light years.

Wait, no, maybe I should think about the problem differently. Let me see. The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c. Let's calculate the Lorentz factor gamma first. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So v is 0.99999987c. Let me compute that.

Calculating v²/c²: (0.99999987)^2 = approximately (1 - (1.23e-7))^2. Wait, let me calculate it more accurately.

Wait, 0.99999987 is 1 minus 0.00000013. So (1 - 0.00000013)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00000013 + (0.00000013)^2. The square term is negligible. So approximately 1 - 0.00000026. So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 0.00000026.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ sqrt(2.6e-7). Let me compute sqrt(2.6e-7). Well, sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612, and sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5= approx 3.16e-4. So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4.

So gamma is 1 / 5.09e-4 ≈ 1968. So gamma is approximately 1968.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Let me think: 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. So v = c (1 - 1.3e-7). Then, v² = c² (1 - 2.6e-7). So 1 - v²/c² = 2.6e-7. So gamma is 1 / sqrt(2.6e-7). Let's compute sqrt(2.6e-7).

sqrt(2.6) = approx 1.612, sqrt(1e-7)=1e-3.5, which is about 3.16e-4. So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 = approx 5.08e-4. So gamma is 1/(5.08e-4) ≈ 1968. So yes, gamma is about 1968.

So, from Earth's frame, the distance is D light years. Let's say D is approximately 163,000 light-years. Wait, but the problem doesn't give the distance, so maybe I should use the given data differently. Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the distance is such that the time from Earth's frame is more than the astronaut's lifespan, but the time experienced by the astronaut is less due to time dilation.

Wait, wait, the question says that the aliens have an average lifetime of 150 solar years. So perhaps the time experienced by the astronaut is less than 150 years, meaning they survive.

Wait, but the astronaut is 22 years old. So if the trip takes T years from Earth's perspective, then the astronaut's experienced time is T divided by gamma.

Wait no, wait. Proper time is the time experienced by the traveler. Proper time tau is equal to T multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²), which is 1/gamma. So tau = T_earth * (1/gamma).

Wait, wait, that's correct. So from Earth's frame, the time taken is T_earth = D / v. Since v is 0.99999987c, which is almost c, so T_earth ≈ D / (0.99999987) ≈ D * (1.00000013). So for a distance D of 163,000 light years, T_earth is approximately 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 * (1.00000013) ≈ 163,000 + 212 ≈ 163,212 years.

Wait, but that's from Earth's perspective. So the time experienced by the astronaut is tau = T_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ T_earth / gamma. Since gamma is about 1968, tau ≈ 163,212 / 1968 ≈ Let me compute that.

163,212 divided by 1968. Let me see: 1968 * 80 = 157,440. 163,212 - 157,440 = 5,772. 1968 * 2.93 ≈ 5,772. So approximately 80 + 2.93 = 82.93 years. Wait, but wait, because 1968 * 83 = 1968*(80+3) = 157,440 + 5,904 = 163,344. But our T_earth is 163,212, which is less than that. So 82.93 would give 82.93 * 1968 ≈ 163,000. So perhaps around 82 years.

Wait, but the astronaut is 22 years old. If the trip takes about 82 years from their perspective, they would be 104 years old when arriving, which is within the 150-year average lifespan. So they would survive.

But wait, the options are A to D. Let me check the options again:

A) The astronaut will die before reaching Earth.

B) 72 years

C)81 years

D)77 years.

Wait, but according to my rough calculation, the time experienced is about 82 years. So the closest option would be C) 81 years.

But wait, I made some approximations. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me recompute gamma accurately.

v = 0.99999987c.

So v = 1 - 0.00000013 in terms of c. So v ≈ 0.99999987.

v² = (0.99999987)^2. Let's compute this accurately.

(0.99999987)^2 = (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14 ≈ approximately 0.99999974.

So 1 - v² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 2.6e-7.

So sqrt(1 - v²) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5 ≈ 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4.

So gamma = 1 / 5.09e-4 ≈ 1968.

So that's accurate.

Now, the distance D is about 163,000 light-years. So T_earth = D / v = 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 * (1.00000013) ≈ 163,000 + 163,000 * 0.00000013.

Wait, 0.00000013 is 1.3e-7. So 163,000 * 1.3e-7 = approximately 163,000 * 1.3e-7 = (1.63e5) * (1.3e-7) ) = (1.63 * 1.3 )e-2 = 2.119e-2 ≈ 0.02119.

So T_earth ≈ 163,000 + 0.02119 ≈ 163,000.0212 years.

So the time from Earth's perspective is about 163,000 years.

Tau, the proper time experienced by the astronaut, is T_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 163,000 * 5.09e-4 ≈ 163,000 * 0.000509 ≈ Let's compute that.

163,000 * 0.0005 = 81.5 years. 163,000 * 0.000009 = 1.467. So 81.5 + 1.467 = 82.967 years.

So approximately 83 years. But looking at the options, the closest is C) 81 years.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the time from Earth's frame is T = D/(v/c). Since v is 0.99999987c, T = D/(0.999
