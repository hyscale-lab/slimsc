Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams and glass moving. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my optics and relativity, but let me think this through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are given, and I have to pick the right one.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is c/n, where c is the vacuum speed of light. But here, the glass is moving. So it's a question of how relative velocities add up when the medium itself is moving.

I think this is a case where I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just add velocities normally. But wait, does this apply here? The problem doesn't specify that v is close to c, but I guess I have to proceed with relativity in case.

The standard formula for adding velocities in relativity is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/cÂ²). But wait, in this case, u would be the speed of the light in the glass as measured in the glass's rest frame. Wait, no. Let me think again.

In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed v_light = c/n. So, the observer in the lab sees the glass moving at velocity v towards them. So, the light in the glass's frame is moving at v_light = c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion.

So to find the speed observed in the lab frame, I need to use the velocity addition formula. Let me set up the variables:

In the glass frame (S'), the light speed is u' = c/n. The glass is moving at velocity V = v (since the glass is moving towards the observer, but I think I need to get the sign right). Wait, the direction matters. If the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is going in the same direction as the glass, then in the lab frame, the light is moving faster than the glass.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify the scenario. The glass is moving towards the observer, and the light beam is moving in the same direction as the glass, so the light is moving towards the observer but the glass is also moving towards the observer. So, from the lab's
