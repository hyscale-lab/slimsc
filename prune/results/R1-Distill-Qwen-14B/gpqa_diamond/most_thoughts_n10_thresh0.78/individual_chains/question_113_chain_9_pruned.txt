Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and jot down the details.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are four different chemical formulas, so I need to match the spectral data to one of these.

Starting with the FTIR data. They mentioned a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in FTIR usually indicate O-H stretches. For example, alcohols or carboxylic acids have broad O-H absorptions because of hydrogen bonding. But wait, in the problem, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, 1700 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. What about 1650? That might be another carbonyl or perhaps an aromatic ring, like C=C in conjugation or something like that.

So, the FTIR suggests the presence of O-H groups and possibly two carbonyl groups. Wait, but 1700 and 1650 might be two different carbonyls. Or maybe one of them isn't a carbonyl. Let me think. 1700 is often for esters, ketones, aldehydes, etc. 1650 could be an aromatic ring (like C=O in an aromatic ester?), or maybe a conjugated carbonyl group. Alternatively, it could be a C=C stretch. Wait, but in some cases, like conjugated carbonyls or aromatic rings, the peak positions shift. For example, conjugated double bonds can lower the wavenumber. So perhaps 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl group or an aromatic ring with substituents.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. They mention peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So that suggests the compound has a double bond, maybe in an alkene group. So the structure must have a double bond elsewhere, perhaps an alkene and a carbonyl group.

Then the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. I need to think about what fragments give m/z 45. Let's see, molecular ions could break down into smaller fragments. 45 is the molecular weight of something like CH3CO (which is 45: 12+16+16=44? Wait, wait, 12*(1) + 1*3 +16*2 = 12+3+32=47? No. Wait, CH3CO is (12+3*1) + (12+16) â†’ wait, no. Wait, CH3CO is a two carbon group. Wait, CH3CO has molecular weight of 45? Let's calculate: carbon is 12, hydrogen is 1, oxygen is 16. So CH3CO is (12*2) + (3*1) + 16 = 24 +3 +16=43? Hmm, maybe not. Or perhaps it's another
