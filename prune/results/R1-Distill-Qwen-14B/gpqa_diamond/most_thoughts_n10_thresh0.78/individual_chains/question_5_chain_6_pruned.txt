Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again carefully.

The question is asking about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue corresponding to this eigenvector is +ħ/2. We're given the components P_x, P_y, and P_z as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. The task is to determine the elements of the normalized eigenvector.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators often correspond to observables, and their eigenvectors represent the states with definite values. Since the operator P is being considered along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, I think P is the projection operator along that direction. So the operator P would be a combination of P_x, P_y, and P_z.

Wait, but wait. The operator in question isn't directly given; instead, each component (P_x, P_y, P_z) is provided. So I think the operator P is the sum of these components multiplied by the direction vector components. So if the direction is along a unit vector n = (nx, ny, nz), then the operator P should be P = nx P_x + ny P_y + nz P_z.

Right, because the total momentum operator P would be the sum of each component multiplied by their respective direction components. So for a direction n, the operator is P · n̂, where n̂ is the unit vector in the direction of n.

But the question says that n lies in the x-z plane, so ny must be zero. Because any direction in the x-z plane would have the y-component as zero. So n = (nx, 0, nz), and since it's a unit vector, nx² + nz² = 1.

Wait, but the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so I can represent it using polar coordinates. Let me think: in spherical coordinates, any direction can be represented by angles theta and phi, but since it's in the x-z plane, the phi angle (the azimuthal angle) would be zero. Because if you're in the x-z plane, you're along the direction where the angle phi around the z-axis is zero. So maybe theta is the angle from the z-axis? Or wait, sometimes theta is from the x-axis, but I need to be careful.

Alternatively, another approach: since the direction is in the x-z plane, I can parametrize it using just one angle. Let's say theta is the angle between the direction vector and the z-axis. So, n would be (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) — but wait, no, because if it's in the x-z plane, then phi is zero, so n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but wait, no, that's for when you're in the x-y plane. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of spherical coordinates where the polar angle theta is measured from the z-axis. So for a vector in the x-z plane, its direction can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because the y-component is zero. So, the unit vector n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

Wait no, because the z-component is cosθ and the x-component is sinθ. So, for example, when theta is 0, the direction is along +z, and when theta is 90 degrees, it's along +x. So that makes sense.

So putting it all together, the operator P is given by P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z), that is, P = nx P_x + nz P_z, since ny is zero.

Wait, no, no. Wait, the operator is P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n
