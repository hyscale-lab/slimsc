Okay, so I've got this NMR question in front of me. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my NMR interpretation, but let's try to work through this step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are all different types of propenyl or butenyl acetates, either cis or trans.

The NMR data given is:
- 7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J=16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 ppm (1H, doublet of quadruplets)
- 2.1 ppm (3H, singlet)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, doublet)

Alright, I remember that acetates have an ester group, so the structure would be something like R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, no, acetate is the ester where the acid is acetic acid. So it's more like R-O-COCH3. Oh wait, no, wait. Acetate would be where the acetic acid's -OH is replaced by an OR group. So the structure is OAc-O-R, where R is an alkene group because the options are propenyl and butenyl acetates.

So the compound is an acetate ester with an allyl group. The options are about whether it's cis or trans in the double bond.

Let me think about the NMR signals. The 2.1 ppm singlet is likely the methyl group attached to the carbonyl in the acetate. Because acetate's methyl (COOCH2CH3?) Wait, no, wait. Acetate is CH3COO-. So in the ester, it would be OAc-O-R. So the methyl is attached to the carbonyl carbon. So that would be a singlet because it's three equivalent protons on a carbon adjacent to an electronegative group (the carbonyl). So that's the 2.1 ppm peak.

Now, the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz. High coupling constants usually indicate double bonds. So this must be a vinyl proton. Wait, but in an ester group, the adjacent protons would be on the oxygen-bearing carbon. So if it's an allyl group, like CH2CH2CH2O-CO-CH3? No, wait. Let's think about the structure.

Wait, the structure for propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3? Or wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, but in the ester form, it's O-CO-O-R. So for propenyl acetate, it's CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3. Similarly, butenyl would be similar but with four carbons in the chain.

Wait, no. Wait, propenyl is CH2CH2CH3, but with a double bond. Wait, no: propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. So the actual structure would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3. But depending on whether it's cis or trans, the arrangement of the substituents around the double bond changes.

Wait, but wait. The substituents in the double bond in the propenyl group would be the R-O- group and another CH2. So, for example, if the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, then the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But if it's butenyl, maybe the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, like CH2CH2CH=CH-OAc? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about each option's structure.

The options are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate.

So, let me think about the structures:

1. Cis-propenyl acetate: The structure would be CH2CH2CH2-OAc with a double bond in the propenyl group. Wait, no. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. In the cis case, the substituents on either side of the double bond would be on the same side. So the OAc group and the CH2 would be on the same side of the double bond.

Similarly, trans would have them on opposite sides.

For the butenyl acetates, the structure is longer. For example, CH2CH2CH2CH2-OAc with a double bond somewhere else. Wait, but butenyl would be four carbons. So the double bond could be between C1 and C2 (cis or trans) or C2 and C3. Wait, but butenyl groups are usually CH2CH=CHCH2- or maybe CH3CH2CH=CH-.

Wait, perhaps I'm complic
