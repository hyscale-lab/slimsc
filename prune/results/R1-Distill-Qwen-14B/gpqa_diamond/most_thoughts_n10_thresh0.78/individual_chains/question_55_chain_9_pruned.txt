Okay, so I've got this NMR question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound based on its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are different forms of propenyl and butenyl acetates, either cis or trans.

First, let me recall what these structures look like. Acetate esters generally have the structure R-O-CO-OCH3, wait no, wait. No, acetate is OAc, which is O-CO-CH3. So the ester would be R-O-CO-CH3. So when the question mentions propenyl or butenyl acetates, the R group is an allyl or similar.

Let me think about each structure:

1. Cis-propenyl acetate: The propenyl group would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3, but wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- or CH2CH2CH2? Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- but in the case of being a substituent on the oxygen, it would be O-CH2-CH2-CH2- but with a double bond. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's clarify: propenyl is an allyl group, which is CH2=CHCH2-. So propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3. But wait, the double bond's position matters for cis or trans.

Wait no, for propenyl, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So propenyl has CH2=CHCH2OAc. Now, the term 'cis' and 'trans' in this context would refer to the arrangement around the double bond. Wait, but propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so it's a three-carbon chain with a double bond between C1 and C2. So the substituents on the double bond are CH2OAc on one side and CH2 on the other? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the propenyl group is CH2CH=CH2? No, because propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-.

Wait, perhaps I should think of each option's structure.

Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate. Butenyl is a four-carbon chain
