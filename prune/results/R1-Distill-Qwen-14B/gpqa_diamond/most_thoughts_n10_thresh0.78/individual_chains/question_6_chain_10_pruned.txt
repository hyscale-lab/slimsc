Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to wrap my head around it. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, potentials can sometimes be solved by separation of variables or by recognizing them as known potentials. Let's see what this potential looks like. The first term is (1/2)k r², which reminds me of a harmonic oscillator in two dimensions. But wait, the second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, how does that factor in?

Wait, maybe I can express this potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates instead of polar. Because sometimes it's easier that way. Let's try that. In polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So, cos²θ is (x²)/(r²) = (x²)/(x² + y²). But I'm not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be rewritten in terms of x and y.

Let me see: V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. So factor out (1/2)k r²: that's (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Wait, 1 + 3 cos²θ. Hmm, can I write this differently in terms of x and y?

Wait, cos²θ is (x²)/(x² + y²). So 1 + 3 cos²θ is 1 + 3x²/(x² + y²). Let me combine the terms: [ (x² + y²) + 3x² ] / (x² + y²) ) → (4x² + y²) / (x² + y²). Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can express the potential
