Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's see.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, it's probably something like benzene with two substituents. Wait, di-substituted means two groups attached to the benzene ring. The FTIR shows an ester group. Oh right, esters have carbonyl groups, which absorb around 1700 cm-1. So the compound has an ester functional group somewhere.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there are six signals. Let me break that down. Two signals are aromatic-H. So the substitution pattern on the benzene ring must be such that the aromatic protons are split into two sets. Maybe para and ortho positions? Wait, no, if it's di-substituted, depending on the substituents, the protons could be in different environments. For example, if the substituents are in para positions, the two sets of aromatic protons would each be equivalent. But wait, the question says two signals for aromatic-H. That suggests two distinct sets, each with a different environment. So perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the ring has two distinct sets of aromatic protons.

Then there are two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are the ones on a double bond, like in an alkene or an aromatic ring. Wait, but in an aromatic ring, the protons are part of the ring and typically show up around 7 ppm. But here, the vinyl-H are separate. So maybe the substituents include a vinyl group, like a styryl group or something else with a double bond adjacent to the ring.

So, the two vinyl-H signals: one is a doublet, the other is a doublet of quartets. Hmm, that suggests coupling. A doublet would be coupling with one neighbor, maybe a double bond. A doublet of quartets implies coupling with two sets of protons, perhaps in a trans or cis arrangement relative to another group.

Then, two signals for –CH3 groups. So there are two methyl groups in the molecule, each giving a singlet? Or perhaps in different environments. Wait, but the question says two signals, so each has a different environment. That makes sense if the two methyl groups are attached to different atoms, like one attached to an oxygen (like in an ester) and another maybe in a different position.

No signals for –CH2 groups. So the molecule doesn't have any methylene groups. That suggests that any chains are either single bonds without adjacent CH2 or perhaps they're not present, like if the substituents are small groups.

Now, putting this together. The aromatic ring has two substituents. One is an ester group, which is R-O-CO-O-R' or something similar? Wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R. So if there's an ester, perhaps one substituent is an ester group (like O-CO-O-R), but wait, actually, the
