Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about black holes and their entropy. Hmm, I remember that black holes have entropy, which is related to their area. But wait, how exactly does that work?

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is θ = 1e-17 degrees. The galaxy is at a distance d = 1e10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole. The options are A to D, with different exponents.

First, to find the entropy, I think I need the area of the event horizon. I remember that the entropy S of a black hole is given by the formula S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ k_B), where A is the area, c is the speed of light, G is Newton's constant, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and k_B is Boltzmann's constant.

So my first step is to find the radius of the event horizon, then compute the area from that.

The event horizon radius R of a black hole is given by R = 2 G M / c^2. But wait, how do I get M from the given information?

The angular size θ is related to the actual size (diameter, maybe) and the distance d. The formula for angular size is θ ≈ diameter / distance if θ is small, which it is here. But wait, θ is in degrees, I think I need to convert that to radians for the calculation.

Wait, yes, because in physics formulas, angles are usually in radians. So to convert degrees to radians, multiply by π/180.

So θ (radians) = 1e-17 degrees * (π/180) ≈ 1e-17 * 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Hmm, but wait, the angular size would be θ = (event horizon diameter) / d. So the diameter D is approximately θ * d. So D ≈ θ * d.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused about whether θ is the angular diameter. So, for small angles, the angular diameter θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the actual diameter divided by the distance. So yes, D ≈ θ * d.

So the diameter would be D = θ * d.

But wait, the event horizon's
