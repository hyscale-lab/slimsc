Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The question says that a chemist did two reactions. Each reaction used a different reducing agent. The products from both are (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one respectively. So, I need to find the starting materials A and B that would give these products when treated with LiBH4 and BH3 respectively.

Wait, wait. Let me get this straight. The first reaction is A + LiBH4 + H+ gives R product. The second is B + BH3 + H+ gives S product. So, we have two different starting materials reacting with different reducing agents to give enantiomers of the same ketone.

I remember that LiBH4 and BH3 (with maybe something else like THF?) are used for different reductions. Oh right, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce esters, ketones, maybe even amides under certain conditions. BH3, on the other hand, is used for hydroboration reactions, which usually lead to the formation of alcohols with anti-Markovnikov addition.

Wait, but wait... In this case, the product is a tetrahydro-pyran-2-one. So, that's a cyclic hemiacetal or something? Or maybe it's a cyclic ketone. Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-oneâ€”so pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen, right? So, pyranone is a cyclic ester or lactone, but in this case, it's the tetrahydro version, which would be a six-membered ring with an oxygen, a ketone group (the 2-one), and maybe some substituents.

Looking at the product, 4-ethyl-tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the substituent is on carbon 4, which is an ethyl group. So, the ring has five carbons and one oxygen, making six members. The ketone is at position 2, and ethyl is at position 4.

So, the product is a cyclic ketone, a lactone perhaps? Or a cyclic hemiacetal? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's formed from a cyclic hemiacetal of a diol and a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, but the reaction is a reduction. So, perhaps the starting materials are carbonyl compounds, which upon reduction give these ketones? Hmm, but the product is a ketone, so starting from a carbonyl group, perhaps.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are esters or something else. Let me think. If you have a ketone and reduce it, you get an alcohol. But the product is a ketone. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a carbonyl compound that upon reduction forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form a lactone or a cyclic hemiacetal.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, like a lactone, which upon reduction would open up. But no, LiBH4 typically reduces esters to alcohols. Let me think.

Alternatively, let's think about the reagents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. BH3 is used for hydroboration, which is a type of addition to alkenes. Oh wait, but in this question, the product is a ketone, so perhaps the starting material is an aldehyde or ketone. If you reduce an aldehyde or ketone, you get an alcohol.

Wait, no, because the product is a ketone. So maybe the starting material is a different kind of compound. Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal that, when reduced, becomes the ketone. No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are cyclic ketals. Wait, reducing a cyclic ketal? But I don't think LiBH4 would reduce that. Maybe the starting materials are something else, like an ester which, when reduced, becomes a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone.

Wait, let's think about the product structure. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, it's a six-membered ring with O, and a ketone at position 2. So, the ring is tetrahydro-pyran, which is a five-membered ring? Wait, no, pyran is six-membered. So, the ring has six atoms: five carbons and one oxygen.

The ring is in a chair-like conformation because it's tetrahydro. Wait, no, wait. Wait, tetrahydro-pyran would have four single bonds and one double bond? Or is it a fully saturated ring? Wait, the formula is tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the ring is pyran with four hydrogen atoms added, meaning the ring is saturated with single bonds except for the position of the double bond in pyran.

Wait, pyran is an oxygen-containing six-membered ring with one double bond. So, tetrahydro-2H-pyran would have a double bond at position 2-3, perhaps, making it a five-membered ring? No, no, six-membered. So, the ring is fully saturated except for the double bond in the 2H position. So, the ring is a saturated five-membered ring? No, wait, 2H-pyran would have the double bond at position 2, so the ring is cyclohexene-like, but with an oxygen.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible starting materials. The options given are A and B, which are (S) or (R) forms of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, the starting materials are pentanoic acid derivatives with substituents. For example, structure would be something like CH2-COOH with certain substituents. Let me try to draw it mentally.

The formula is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but with substituents.

Wait, the formula is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. But substituents:

At position 3: ethyl group.

At position 5: isobutoxy and oxo (keto) groups.

Wait, let me number the pentanoic acid from the COOH end.

So, position 1: COOH.

Position 2: CH2.

Position 3: CH(CH2CH2CH3?), no, wait. Wait, 3-ethyl would be at the third carbon.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CO-O-R? Hmm, not exactly. Wait, let me think again.

Pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. So, the chain is five carbons, with the COOH at the end.

But the substituents are at positions 3 (ethyl) and 5 (isobutoxy and oxo).

Wait, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5. So, position 3 is the third carbon from the COOH.

So, the molecule would be:

COOH - CH2 - C(ethyl)(something) - CH2 - O(isobutyl) - (probably a ketone at same carbon)

Wait, but wait, 5-oxo would be a ketone at position 5, which is the fifth carbon. But pentanoic acid only has five carbons. So, the fifth carbon is the COOH carbon. So, that can't be.

Wait, maybe I got the numbering wrong. Let me think about the substituents.

The compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Pentanoic acid: COOH-(CH2)4-CH3 ?

Wait, no. Wait, pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH, but that's five carbons in total. So, the substituents are on carbons 3 and 5.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

Position 1: COOH

Position 2: CH2

Position 3: CH(CH2CH2CH3)

Position 4: CH2

Position 5: C(=O)O- (isobutyl group?)

Wait, but the substituent at position 5 is isobutoxy and oxo. So, perhaps it's:

At position 5 (which is the fifth carbon, but wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, so the substituents may be on the third and fifth carbons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CO-O-CH(CH2CH2CH3) ?

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the 5-oxo is a ketone on the same carbon as the isobutoxy group. So, the fifth carbon (which is the COOH carbon) can't have a ketone. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are on the same carbon. So, position 5 has both an isobutoxy group and a keto group. So, that would be a geminal di-substitution.

Wait, but how? Let me think. The formula is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, the parent chain is pentanoic acid, which is five carbons. So, position 5 is the COOH group. So, that can't have a substituent. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps the substituent positions are based on the numbering starting from the other end. Maybe the substituents are on the other side.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the structure, so perhaps I should think about the mechanism of the reactions.

The products are 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a cyclic ketone. So, perhaps the starting material undergoes a reduction that forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form the cyclic ketone. Or perhaps the starting material is an ester that upon reduction forms a diol, which then forms the cyclic hemiacetal.

Wait, another possibility: the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone), which upon reduction would open to form a diol. But then, how would that form a cyclic ketone?

Hmm, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone which, upon reduction, forms something else. Wait, no, if you reduce a ketone, you get a secondary alcohol.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-hydroxy ester. When reduced, the ester would become an alcohol, and if it cyclizes, it forms a cyclic hemiacetal or lactone.

Wait, let's think about the reagents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It can reduce esters to alcohols. BH3, typically in hydroboration reactions, adds to double bonds. So, perhaps the starting material has an ester group, which upon reduction with LiBH4 would form a diol, which then cyclizes to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, which is an ester-like structure. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, another approach: the product is a cyclic hemiacetal, perhaps. So, the starting material would have a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group in the correct positions to form the cyclic structure upon elimination of water.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diol with a carbonyl group. But wait, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an alpha-hydroxy ketone. When reduced, it would form something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketal. No, because ketals are resistant to LiBH4.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester, and upon reduction, it becomes a diol, which then cyclizes to form a cyclic ketone. Wait, that might make sense.

Wait, let's think about the product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The structure is a six-membered ring with O, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4. So, the ring is something like O connected to two CH2 groups and a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diketone or a molecule that can form a cyclic ketone upon reduction.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal of a diol and a carbonyl compound. But I'm not making progress here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the problem in terms of the reagents and the stereochemistry of the products.

The first reaction uses LiBH4, which is a strong reducing agent. The second uses BH3, which is a hydroboration agent. But wait, in this case, both reactions are producing a ketone. Hmm, but LiBH4 is used for reductions, while BH3 is for addition reactions. So perhaps the starting materials are different types of compounds.

Wait, another thought: LiBH4 can reduce esters to alcohols. So, if the starting material is an ester, then upon reduction, it would form a diol, which could cyclize into a cyclic hemiacetal or lactone.

Wait, for example, if the starting material is an ester of (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. When LiBH4 is added, the ester is reduced to a diol. Then, under certain conditions, the diol could cyclize to form a cyclic hemiacetal, which would be the product.

Similarly, if starting material B is a different stereoisomer, perhaps it would form the S enantiomer of the product when treated with BH3. Wait, but BH3 is involved in hydroboration, which is a different reaction.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are alpha-hydroxy esters. Because when you reduce an alpha-hydroxy ester with LiBH4, you get an alcohol, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketals or acetals, which upon reduction would form something else. Or perhaps it's a case of ketone reduction leading to diols.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options given. The options are all A and B being (S) or (R) forms of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, pentanoic acid with ethyl at 3 and isobutoxy and oxo at 5.

Wait, so the structure is:

COOH - CH2 - CH(CH2CH2CH3) - CO - O - (CH2)2CH(CH3) ?

Wait, no, perhaps the substituents are on the same carbon. So, the 5-oxo is a keto group on the same carbon as the isobutoxy.

Wait, so the structure is at position 5: a carbonyl group and an isobutoxy group attached.

Wait, but 5 is the fifth carbon, which is the COOH. So, that can't be. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are on adjacent carbons. Another approach is to think about the mechanism of the reaction.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester. When treated with LiBH4, it's reduced to the corresponding alcohol. Then, under acidic conditions, it cyclizes to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, for example, if the starting material is an ester of the form R-O-CO-R', then LiBH4 would reduce the ester to R-O-CH2-OH, which upon acid work-up would form a diol. Then, maybe this diol could cyclize to form the cyclic hemiacetal.

Wait, but the product is a ketone, so perhaps the starting material has a carbonyl group that, upon reduction, forms an alcohol which then eliminates to form the ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone ester. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The product is a cyclic hemiacetal. So, maybe the starting material is a diol and a carbonyl compound that can react to form the cyclic hemiacetal. But that doesn't directly involve a reducing agent.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the stereochemistry of the product. The first reaction gives (R) configuration, and the second gives (S). So, the starting materials A and B must be enantiomers because the product enantiomers are formed based on the starting material's configuration.

So, if the starting materials are enantiomers, then the products would be enantiomers as well. But wait, the reagents are different: LiBH4 and BH3. So, perhaps the configuration of the starting material determines the configuration of the product, and the reducing agent affects the pathway of the reaction, leading to either retention or inversion.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction leads to the formation of an alcohol, and then cyclization occurs, with the configuration determining the final product's configuration.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are esters. Let's consider that. If the starting material is an ester, like R-O-CO-O-R', and when reduced, it becomes R-O-CH2-OH. Then, under certain conditions, this could cyclize to form a cyclic hemiacetal.

Wait, but the product is a pyranone, which suggests a six-membered ring with a ketone. So, maybe the diol formed upon reduction has two hydroxyl groups in positions that can form a six-membered ring upon cyclization.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone), which upon reduction with LiBH4 forms a diol, which then rearranges to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, another approach: The product has an ethyl group and a ketone. So, perhaps the starting material has an ethyl group and a ketone or ester group that, upon reduction, forms an alcohol which then cyclizes.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Let's approach this differently. The options are about the configuration of the starting materials, whether they are R or S.

The product is (R) when treated with LiBH4 and (S) when treated with BH3. So, the two reactions with different reducing agents are giving enantiomers. The starting materials must be enantiomers because the configuration of the product depends on the starting material's configuration.

So, if A is R, and B is S, or vice versa. Then, the reaction with LiBH4 gives R product, and with BH3 gives S.

Wait, but how does the reducing agent affect the configuration? If the starting material is R, and the reduction proceeds in a certain way, leading to the R product.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-hydroxy ester. When reduced, the ester becomes an alcohol, and the alpha-hydroxy group is involved in the cyclization.

Wait, more accurately, perhaps the starting material is a diastereomer of an alpha-hydroxy ester. When treated with LiBH4, which is a strong reducing agent, it reduces the ester to a diol, which then cyclizes to form the cyclic hemiacetal or lactone.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, not an ester. So, maybe the diol cyclizes and eliminates a water molecule to form the ketone.

Hmm, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. For example, an ester with a ketone group at the gamma position. When LiBH4 is used, it reduces the ester to a gamma-hydroxy alcohol. Then, perhaps under certain conditions, the gamma-hydroxy alcohol undergoes cyclization to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, that makes sense. For example, if the starting material is an ester with a ketone group, like RCOOR', then upon reduction with LiBH4, it would become RCH2OH and R'OH. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, LiBH4 reduces esters to glycols. Wait, no, I think esters are reduced to alcohols. For example, an ester RCOOR' would be reduced to RCH2OH and R'OH. Wait, no, LiBH4 would reduce the ester to a primary alcohol, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto ester. So, RCOCOOR'. When reduced, the alpha-keto ester would become RCH2COOR', but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, such as a lactone. Upon reduction with LiBH4, the lactone would open to form a diol, which could then cyclize to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck on the specifics. Let me think about the options again.

Options are:

A) Both A and B are (S) configuration.

B) Both A and B are (R) configuration.

C) A is S, B is R.

D) A is R, B is S.

So, if starting material A is R and B is S, then when A is treated with LiBH4, it gives R product, and B treated with BH3 gives S product.

So, the key is that the configuration of A and B affects the product configuration. So, the starting materials must be enantiomers, and the reagents cause the same or opposite configuration in the product.

But wait, why would the reagent change the configuration? Because one reagent is LiBH4 and the other is BH3.

Wait, perhaps the reaction mechanism is different for the two reagents, leading to different stereochemistry.

Wait, LiBH4 is a hydride source and typically leads to reductions that proceed via a two-step mechanism. In contrast, BH3 is used in hydroboration reactions, which follow anti-Markovnikov and have a certain stereochemical outcome.

Wait, but in this problem, the product is a ketone, which suggests that the reaction isn't a simple hydride reduction but perhaps a different process, like a ketone formation from an alcohol.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic acetals or ketals, which upon reduction form alcohols that rearrange to form the cyclic ketone.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possibility that the starting materials are cyclic acetals. LiBH4 can reduce acetals to diols, which could then cyclize.

Wait, no, I'm not getting anywhere. Let me take a different approach.

The product is a cyclic ketone, so the starting material must have a carbonyl group. When reduced, it forms an alcohol, which then cyclizes to form the cyclic ketone.

So, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-hydroxy ketone. When LiBH4 is used, it could reduce the ketone to an alcohol, but the alpha-hydroxy group is already an alcohol. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) that, upon reduction, opens to form a diol which then cyclizes with the carbonyl group to form the cyclic ketone.

But how does the reduction lead to the diol? LiBH4 reduces esters to alcohols, so a lactone (cyclic ester) would open to form a diol.

Wait, for example, if the starting material is a five-membered lactone, reduction with LiBH4 would open it to form a diol with four adjacent hydroxyl groups, which could then eliminate water to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, but the product is six-membered. Maybe the lactone is a six-membered ring.

Wait, for example, the lactone is a six-membered ring, and upon reduction, it becomes a diol with two adjacent hydroxyl groups. Then, under acidic conditions, this diol could lose water, forming a double bond, and then undergo cyclization to form the cyclic ketone.

So, the starting material is a lactone. When reduced, it becomes a diol, which then undergoes elimination and cyclization to form the product.

But the starting materials are given as 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which suggests that the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative with substituents.

Wait, another angle: the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the ethyl is on carbon 4, and the ketone is on carbon 2. The ring is six-membered.

So, perhaps the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative which, upon reduction and cyclization, forms the six-membered ring.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a gamma-keto acid. For example, if the starting material is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, then when reduced, the keto group becomes a hydroxyl group, and the ester (if present) becomes an alcohol. Then, cyclization occurs to form the ring.

Wait, but the starting materials don't have ester groups, they're acids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reduction of an alpha-keto ester. When alpha-keto esters are reduced, they form secondary alcohols.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto ester with the structure RCOCH2COOR'. When reduced, it becomes RCH2CH2COOR', which upon cyclization could form the cyclic ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone ester. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone which, upon reduction, becomes an alcohol and then cyclizes again. But that doesn't directly lead to the product.

Another thought: The product is a cyclic hemiacetal. So, perhaps the starting material is a diol and a carbonyl group that can form the cyclic hemiacetal upon reaction. But the reduction part is unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal that, upon reduction, opens and forms something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are gamma-keto esters. For example, an ester with a ketone at the gamma position. When reduced by LiBH4, the ester becomes a diol, which then cyclizes to form the cyclic ketone.

So, if the starting material is an alpha-keto ester, like CH3COCH2COOR, then LiBH4 would reduce the ketone to an alcohol, but wait, LiBH4 reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. Wait, but the starting material is a gamma-keto ester.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an alpha-hydroxy ester, which upon reduction gives a diol, which can cyclize into the ring.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the reaction steps.

Assume the starting material is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Let's say this is a gamma-keto acid.

When treated with LiBH4, which is a strong reducing agent, it would likely reduce the ester (if present) or the ketone. Wait, but in this case, the starting material is an acid, not an ester.

Wait, perhaps the acid is first converted to an ester before reduction. But the problem states that the starting material is the acid, so that's probably not the case.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto acid. Then, LiBH4 would reduce the alpha-keto group to a primary alcohol, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto ester, and upon reduction, the ester is reduced to a primary alcohol, and the keto group is reduced to a secondary alcohol. Wait, but the product is a ketone.

Hmm.

Wait, another angle: The product is a cyclic ketone, which suggests that the starting material had both a carbonyl group and a leaving group (like an ester or a tosylate) that allowed cyclization after reduction.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has a carbonyl group and an adjacent leaving group. Upon reduction, the carbonyl becomes a hydroxyl, and the leaving group departs, leading to a cyclization.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto ester. Upon reduction with LiBH4, the ester becomes a primary alcohol, and the ketone becomes a secondary alcohol. Then, under certain conditions, the two alcohols could lose a water molecule and form a double bond, leading to cyclization. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the diol loses water to form a double bond, which then undergoes some rearrangement.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the configurations.

The product is (R) when A is treated with LiBH4 and (S) when B is treated with BH3. So, perhaps the configuration of the starting material determines the product's configuration.

Assuming that the starting materials are enantiomers (A is R, B is S), then when reduced with LiBH4 and BH3 respectively, they would give the R and S products.

But why would the reagents affect the configuration? Because LiBH4 and BH3 are different in their reactions.

Wait, perhaps the reaction with BH3 involves hydroboration, which has anti-Markovnikov addition and follows a certain stereochemistry, like the BH3 adds to the less substituted end, and the hydrogen adds to the more substituted end, leading to the formation of the alcohol with a certain configuration.

But in this case, the product is a ketone, so perhaps the reaction is different.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with an ester group. When reduced, the ester group becomes an alcohol, and the ether opens to form a diol, which then cyclizes to form the cyclic ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketal, which upon reduction forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, another thought: The reaction could be a Claisen or Dieckmann condensation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester. When reduced, it becomes a beta-hydroxy ester, which then undergoes elimination to form an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, which can cyclize to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, let me think. If the starting material is a beta-keto ester, then LiBH4 would reduce the ester to an alcohol, but the beta-keto group would remain. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what each reagent does.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that reduces esters, ketones, aldehydes to alcohols. BH3 is used in hydroboration reactions, adding across double bonds in a way that follows anti-Markovnikov addition, with BH3 adding to the less substituted end, and the hydrogen adding to the more substituted end.

Wait, but the product is a ketone. So, perhaps the starting material for reaction B is an alkene. BH3 would add across the double bond, then upon protonation, form an alcohol. Then, perhaps the alcohol would undergo oxidation or elimination to form the ketone.

But the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps after hydroboration and subsequent steps, the molecule cyclizes to form the ring.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'm going in circles.

Let me try to sum up.

The starting materials A and B are given as 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, with configurations S or R.

The product from A is (R), and the product from B is (S).

So, the configuration of the starting material determines the configuration of the product.

Assuming that the reaction proceeds with retention of configuration, then A must be R to give R product, and B must be S to give S product.

Wait, but in that case, options D would have A as R and B as S, which would fit.

Alternatively, if the reaction proceeds with inversion, then A would be S to give R product, and B as R to give S product. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option D) A = (R), B = (S).

So, if the starting material's configuration (R or S) leads directly to the product's configuration, then option D would be correct.

But why would the reagents matter? Because LiBH4 and BH3 are different reagents. Oh, perhaps the reagents affect the way the reduction happens, which in turn affects the configuration.

Wait, perhaps LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and would proceed through a different mechanism than BH3, which is used in hydroboration.

But I'm not sure how that would affect the configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and the reduction leads to the formation of an alcohol with a certain configuration, which then cyclizes to form the ketone with the same configuration.

So, if the starting material is R, the product is R, and if the starting material is S, the product is S.

In that case, the reagents may not affect the configuration, but the starting material's configuration does.

Thus, if A is R and B is S, then the products would be R and S, respectively.

So, looking at the options, option D is A=R, B=S.

Wait, but in the question, the reaction with A is with LiBH4 and gives R, and the reaction with B is with BH3 and gives S.

So, if the configuration of the product depends solely on the starting material, then the reagents wouldn't matter, which seems odd.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents determine whether the product is R or S based on the starting material's configuration.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction with LiBH4 leads to retention of configuration, whereas the reaction with BH3 leads to inversion. So, if A is R and treated with LiBH4, the product is R. If B is R and treated with BH3, the product is S. But that would require B to be R, which isn't the case in the options.

Alternatively, if the starting material A is R and treated with LiBH4 gives R, and starting material B is S and treated with BH3 gives S.

That would fit option D, where A is R and B is S.

So, putting that together, the correct answer is option D.


The problem involves determining the correct starting materials (A and B) for two reactions that yield enantiomeric products: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The reactions use different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3. The starting materials are given as (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, and the task is to match them to the correct reagents to form the enantiomeric products.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reagents and Reaction Types**:
   - **LiBH4** is a strong reducing agent that reduces esters, ketones, and aldehydes to alcohols.
   - **BH3** is typically used in hydroboration reactions, which follow anti-Markovnikov addition and involve stereochemical outcomes.

2. **Product Formation**:
   - The product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, is a cyclic ketone. This suggests that the starting material undergoes reduction and subsequent cyclization to form the cyclic structure.

3. **Configuration of Starting Materials**:
   - The starting materials are enantiomers: (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. The configuration of the starting material determines the configuration of the product.

4. **Matching Reagents to Starting Materials**:
   - If the starting material is (R), the product formed with LiBH4 will also be (R).
   - If the starting material is (S), the product formed with BH3 will be (S).

5. **Correct Option**:
   - For the reaction with LiBH4 to yield the (R)-product, the starting material A must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.
   - For the reaction with BH3 to yield the (S)-product, the starting material B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

### Conclusion:
The correct pairing is **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid** and **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**, which corresponds to **Option D**.
