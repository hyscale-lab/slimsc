Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous about it, but let's try to break it down step by step. The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of a product after a reaction. Hmm, I remember that IHD helps determine the degree of unsaturation in a molecule, which is the number of rings plus double bonds (each double bond or ring counts as one, and each triple bond counts as two). So the product here must have a certain number of these features.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me try to visualize this structure. So, it's a cyclohexene ring. The positions are numbered, so position 3 has a double bond. Then, at position 2, there's a formyl group (which is a CHO group). At position 5, there's a vinyl group. Vinyl is like a CH2CH2 group, but wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH, so the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, so the structure: cyclohexene ring with double bond at position 3. Then at position 2, a formyl (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH2=CH-). So the ring has three substituents: a formyl at 2, a vinyl at 5, and the carboxylic acid group? Wait, wait, wait. Wait the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the parent is cyclohexene carboxylic acid, meaning the carboxylic acid is at position 1, perhaps? Or is the numbering such that the carboxylic acid is at position 1, and substituents at 2 and 5. Let me think: the formula is cyclohexene, so that's a six-membered ring with one double bond. The double bond is at position 3, so between C3 and C4, I suppose.

Then, the substituents: at position 2 is the formyl group (CHO), at position 5 is the vinyl group (CH2=CH2 but attached as CH2-CH2?), no, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so the substituent is attached to the ring as CH2-CH2? No, wait, the vinyl group is a substituent that's CH2=CH-. So attached to the ring as a CH2-CH2 group but with a double bond. So, the vinyl group is -CH2-CH2- but that can't be right because that would be a single bond. Oh wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH- as a substituent. So the structure would have the cyclohexene ring, with a double bond between C3 and C4. Then, substituent groups at C2 (CHO) and C5 (CH2=CH-).

Wait, but wait, carboxylic acid is usually at the end. So the name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So that would mean the ring has a carboxylic acid group at position 1, perhaps
