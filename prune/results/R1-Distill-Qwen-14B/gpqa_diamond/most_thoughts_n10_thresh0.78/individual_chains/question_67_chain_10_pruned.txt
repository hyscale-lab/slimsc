Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. The question involves two electrons in p orbitals and their angular momentum states. Hmm, I remember that p orbitals have a quantum number l equal to 1, right? Because s is 0, p is 1, d is 2, etc.

The state given is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, so each electron has l1=1 and l2=1, and the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, with m being -1. Oh, right, because when you couple two angular momenta, the possible total l values range from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2. So 1 + 1 is 2, and the minimum is 0, so l can be 0, 1, or 2. But in this case, it's 2.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for both electrons. We're to find the joint probability that both measurements give -ħ. So, each electron's Lz is measured and both are -ħ. I think I need to figure out the possible states that make L1z = -ħ and L2z = -ħ, and then find the probability amplitude in the given state.

Wait, orbital angular momentum states are eigenstates of Lz, right? So for each electron, the eigenvalue is mħ, where m is the magnetic quantum number. So the first electron has m1, the second has m2. Their individual Lz eigenvalues are m1ħ and m2ħ.

In the coupled state |l1, l2, l, m>, what's the relation between the individual m's and the total m? The total m is m = m1 + m2. So in this case, m is -1. So m1 + m2 = -1.

But we're looking for the case where both L1z and L2z are -ħ. So that would mean m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, because L1z = m1 ħ, L2z = m2 ħ. So for both to be -ħ, m1 and m2 must each be -1. Then m1 + m2 = -2. But wait, the given state has m = -1. That's a problem because in that state, the sum m1 + m2 is -1, but we're looking for a situation where their sum is -2. Hmm, that might mean that the state we are considering (m1=-1, m2=-1) is not part of the given coupled state.

Wait, but the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> is a superposition of different m1 and m2 states. So perhaps the state |m1=-1, m2=-1> is part of the |l=2, m=-1> multiplet. Let me think about how the coupling works. When you couple two angular momenta with l1=1 and l2=1, you get states with l=2, 1, 0. For each l, the m can range from -l to +l in integer steps.

So for the coupled state l=2 and m=-1, it's a linear combination of the product states |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1. So possible (m1, m2) pairs are (-2, +1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-2). Wait, no, wait: l1 is 1, so m1 can be -1, 0, +1. Same for m2. So for l=2, m=-1, the possible m1 and m2 pairs would be where m1 + m2 = -1.

Let me list all possible (m1, m2) combinations that add up to m=-1. They would be:

- m1 = -1, m2 = 0
- m1 = 0, m2 = -1
- m1 = -2, m2 = 1 → but wait, m1 can't be -2 because l1 is 1, so m1 can only be -1, 0, +1. Similarly for m2. So the possible pairs are:

m1 can be -1, 0, +1, same for m2.

So the pairs where m1 + m2 = -1 are:

(-1, 0), (0, -1). That's it. Because if m1 is +1, m2 would have to be -2, which isn't allowed. Similarly, if m1 is -2, which isn't allowed. So the only possible (m1, m2) pairs contributing to the state |l=2, m=-1> are (-1,0) and (0, -1).

So the state |l=2, m=-1> is a linear combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Wait, but isn't there another component? Maybe I forgot something. Let me think. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients come into play here, right? The expansion coefficients for the coupled states.

The general formula for coupling two angular momenta l1 and l2 is:

|l, m> = sum_{m1 + m2 = m} [ coefficients ] |l1, m1> |l2, m2>.

In our case, l=2, m=-1. So sum over m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = -1. As before, the allowed (m1, m2) are (-1,0),
