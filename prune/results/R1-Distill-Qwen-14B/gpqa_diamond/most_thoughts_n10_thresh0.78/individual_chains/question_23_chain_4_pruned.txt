Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's see what the question is about. The question involves an experiment where a researcher reacts a specific compound with hydrogen bromide (HBr), and then checks the reaction progress using TLC. The TLC shows that the reactant spot has diminished, and two new spots have formed. I need to determine which of the options A, B, C, or D are the possible products.

First, I should probably draw the structure of the starting material to get a better idea. The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me break this down. The benzene ring has an ether group (oxy) attached. The substituent on the oxygen is a but-3-en-1-yl group. Wait, but with 2,2-dimethyl substitution. So, the butenyl group is CH2CH(C(CH3)2)CH2? Hmm, maybe I should draw it more accurately.

But-3-en-1-yl is a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at position 3. So, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-O- attached to benzene? Wait no, but that's not right. Let me think again.

But-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but starting from the first carbon. Wait, no. Wait, buten-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, but but is four carbons, so positions 1,2,3,4. So but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH=CH. Wait, no, but that's not possible because but-3-enyl would be 1- and 3 positions. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify.

The structure is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So the butenyl group is attached to the oxygen. Let's build it step by step.

Butenyl is four carbons. Numbering from the point
