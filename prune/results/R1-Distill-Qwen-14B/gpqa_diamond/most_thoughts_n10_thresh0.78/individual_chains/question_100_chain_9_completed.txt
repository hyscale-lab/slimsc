Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. I know that C3H6 is propene because propene has the molecular formula C3H6 (since it's an alkene, and the formula for alkenes is CnH2n). Propene is CH2=CH2CH3, I think.

Then, Compound A undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Bromination of alkenes usually adds bromine across the double bond. So propene would react with Br2 to form 1,2-dibromopropane, right? Or wait, wait. Let me think. Propene has the double bond between C1 and C2. When bromine adds, it adds across the double bond, so the product would be 1,2-dibromopropane. So that's Compound B.

Next, Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base, which usually leads to elimination reactions. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane. When that reacts with KOH in alcohol, it should undergo elimination. Since there are two adjacent bromine atoms, the base will abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of an alkene again. Wait, but which alkene? Since the starting material is 1,2-dibromopropane, when we eliminate H and Br from adjacent carbons, we can form either 1-propene (propene) again, but more likely, considering the possible structures, maybe a different structure?

Wait, wait. Let me think. 1,2-dibromopropane has bromines on carbons 1 and 2. When KOH in alcohol is used, it's an E2 elimination. The hydrogen removed is from carbon 2, adjacent to the Br on carbon 1. So the H on C2 is abstracted, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2. But wait, that's the same as the starting material. Hmm, that seems redundant. Alternatively, could it have formed a different structure? Or perhaps there's another possibility. Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane could also eliminate to form 2-bromopropane, but I don't think that's the case. No, elimination forms an alkene. So after elimination, we get 1-propene again, which is the same as compound A. So that would make compound C as propene again. But wait, that doesn't make sense because then what's the point of the reaction. Maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the bromination isn't adding across the double bond but is a substitution? No, because carbon tetrachloride is a solvent for addition reactions, not substitution. So the initial reaction is definitely addition of bromine.

Wait, perhaps the structure I'm thinking is wrong. Let me reevaluate. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. When bromine adds to it, it would add across the double bond. So the product would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. Wait, no. Wait, propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, wait, wait: Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So when bromine adds, it would add across the double bond, so the product would be BrCH2CHBrCH3. Alternatively, wait, maybe 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3. When it adds Br2, each Br adds to the double bond carbons. So the product would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3? No, wait, that would be 1,2-dibromopropane if the double bond is between C1 and C2. So yes, the structure is CH2BrCHBrCH3? Or wait, wait, no. The formula is C3H6, so adding Br2 (which is Br-Br) would add across the double bond, so each Br attaches to a carbon that was part of the double bond. So for propene, CH2=CHCH3, adding Br2 would give CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So yes, that's 1,2-dibromopropane.

Then, treatment with alcoholic KOH. E2 elimination. So the adjacent Br would leave, and a hydrogen is abstracted, leading to the formation of a double bond. Wait, but CH2BrCHBrCH3 eliminating would have two possible ways. Because each Br is on adjacent carbons, perhaps the elimination leads to forming 1-propene or 2-propene. Wait, 2-propene is actually the same as 1-propene because propene is symmetric. Wait, no, 2-propene would have the double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, let's number the carbons. For 1,2-dibromopropane, the structure is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. When eliminating, the H is abstracted from a carbon adjacent to a Br. So for example, the H on C2 could be abstracted, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2, or the H on C3 could be abstracted, leading to a double bond between C2 and C3.

Wait, elimination would typically form the most stable alkene, which in this case would be 1-propene (CH2=CHCH3) or 2-propene (CH2CH2CH2Br?), no, wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the possible alkenes after elimination would be either 1-propene (CH2=CHCH3) or 2-propene (CH3CH=CH2), but wait, that's actually the same as 1-propene because propene is CH2=CHCH3. Wait, no, wait. 1-propene is CH2=CHCH3 (double bond between C1 and C2), and 2-propene would be CH2CH2CH3 with a double bond between C2 and C3, but that's impossible because that would be CH3CH=CH2, which is the same structure as CH2=CHCH3 but just the position of the double bond is different. Wait, no, wait. Wait, propene can have the double bond at the end or the middle, but for three carbons, the middle isn't possible. Because propene is CH2=CHCH3; there's only one position for the double bond in three carbons. So when you eliminate from 1,2-dibromopropane, you can form that same propene, but maybe in a different position. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to cyclopropane? No, that's unlikely because cyclopropane would require the formation of a ring, and with three carbons, that's cyclopropane, but the reaction conditions (alkoholic KOH) are for elimination, not ring formation.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. When 1,2-dibromopropane reacts with alcoholic KOH, E2 elimination occurs. The base abstracts a β-hydrogen, and the adjacent Br leaves, forming a double bond. So the two possible eliminations would position the double bond between C1-C2 or C2-C3. But in propene, those are the same because the molecule is symmetric. So the product would be propene again. That would make compound C as propene, same as compound A.

Wait, but then the next reaction is passing through a red-hot iron tube to produce compound D. I think that's a dehydrohalogenation or some elimination, but wait, if C is propene, then passing through red-hot iron would do what? Red-hot iron is often used for catalytic hydrogenation, but if C is an alkene, propene, then passing through red-hot iron would hydrogenate it. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but if C is propene, then perhaps it's being dehydrohalogenated further, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about what C is.

Wait, maybe the initial assumption is incorrect. Let me re-examine the initial steps.

Compound A is C3H6. So that's an alkene. So when brominated, it becomes 1,2-dibromopropane. Then, with alcoholic KOH, elimination occurs. But perhaps, wait, 1,2-dibromopropane could undergo dehydrohalogenation, but in this case, both Brs are on adjacent carbons. So when KOH is present, perhaps it would eliminate two HBr molecules, giving an alkene. So the product would be propene again.

So then, compound C is propene. Then, passing through a red-hot iron tube. Red-hot iron is used in catalytic hydrogenation. So propene (an alkene) would react with H2 in the presence of a catalyst to form propane. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. Because the question says "passing compound C through a red-hot iron tube produces compound D." So maybe it's hydrogenation. So propene would become propane, which is an alkane. So D would be propane (C3H8).

Then, Compound D (propane) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form compound E. Hmm. Two strong acids. Possible candidates could be H2SO4 and HNO3, or perhaps HCl and H2SO4. But if D is propane, how would two acids react with it? Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Wait, perhaps D is something else. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me think again. Let me go back. Step by step.

Compound A: C3H6 → Propene (CH2=CHCH3).

Bromination in CCl4 → dibromide: CH2Br-CHBr-CH3.

Reaction with alcoholic KOH → elimination. So which product would that give? The main product would be propene again, I think. So C is propene.

Then, passing through a red-hot iron tube. If C is propene and it's passed through a red-hot iron, maybe it's a catalytic hydrogenation, adding H2 to the double bond. Propane is the product. So D is propane (C3H8).

Now, D is propane. Reacting with two strong acids to form E. Hmm. What reactions can occur when propane reacts with strong acids? Well, perhaps it's a sulfonation reaction, but I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe it's a halogenation, but propane is an alkane, so it's not very reactive. Wait, but under certain conditions, alkanes can undergo substitution reactions with HX, like HCl. So if you have a mixture of two strong acids, perhaps one is HCl and another is H2SO4. Then, perhaps the reaction is the formation of chlorides.

Wait, but how? Maybe, if D is propane, under strong acid conditions, perhaps it's a free radical substitution. But free radical substitution usually requires light, not strong acid. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that requires an aromatic ring, which D doesn't have. Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, maybe D is not propane. Let me think again. What if the reaction after elimination isn't propene but something else. Wait, when we eliminate from 1,2-dibromopropane, perhaps the structure of the alkene is different. Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. Eliminating H from either end would form either CH2=CHCH3 (same as A) or perhaps something else. Wait, no, because the central carbon is CHBr, so elimination would form CH2=CH2CH3? But wait, that's impossible because that would require the double bond between C2 and C3, but with three carbons, that's the same as CH2=CHCH3, the same as propene.

So perhaps D is not propane. Then, maybe the reaction through the iron tube is something else. Wait, maybe the compound is being dehydrohalogenated again, but it's already an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps the iron tube is a catalyst for a different reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination step produces a different compound. Wait, maybe when the dibromide is treated with alcoholic KOH, it forms 1-propanol and another product. No, wait, elimination is supposed to form an alkene. Wait, maybe the initial bromination isn't across the double bond but in a different position. Wait, but propene has only one position for the double bond, so bromine would add across that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the elimination step. Let me think: 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3) reacts with alcoholic KOH.

In such a scenario, the base (OH-) would abstract a β-hydrogen. The adjacent Br would leave as Br-.

So which H is abstracted? Let's say the H is on the same carbon as one of the Brs. Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to forming 1,2-dibromopropane again? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to forming 1-bromopropane and another product. No, elimination should form an alkene. So perhaps the correct product is 1-propene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the elimination forms 1,2-dibromopropane again, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the reaction isn't a simple elimination but a substitution. But no, substitution would require a good leaving group, and Br is a good leaving group. So it should be elimination, not substitution.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Maybe the starting material is different. Wait, C3H6 could be cyclopropane, but cyclopropane's formula is C3H6, yes. If that's the case, then bromination would be different. Wait, but bromination of cyclopropane would be via ring-opening, perhaps adding Br across adjacent carbons. Alternatively, maybe cyclopropane bromination adds Br in a different way. Hmm, but I'm more confident that the starting compound is propene, not cyclopropane.

Wait, let's try to move forward. Let's assume that D is propane. Then, D (propane) reacts with two strong acids to form E. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the two acids are H2SO4 and HNO3, leading to some kind of nitration, but that's typically for aromatic compounds. Since propane is an alkane, that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrohalogenation, but that usually requires HX in presence of a catalyst.

Wait, another possibility: maybe D is not propane. Let me think again about the reaction after elimination. Perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of 1-propene, which is C3H6. Then, passing through a red-hot iron tube could be a hydrogenation, leading to propane (C3H8).

So D is propane. Then, when D reacts with two strong acids, perhaps it's a sulfonation reaction, but alkanes aren't typically sulfonated. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitration, but again, alkanes don't get nitrated easily. Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong about D's structure.

Wait, maybe the reaction after elimination isn't a hydrogenation. Let me think again. So, after elimination, compound C is propene. Then, passing through a red-hot iron tube. Another possibility is that the iron tube is a catalyst for dehydrogenation, but that's more for aromatics. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but C is already an alkene.

Wait, another thought: perhaps in the presence of a red-hot iron, an alkene is hydrogenated. So propene (C) becomes propane (D) via hydrogenation.

Then, D (propane) reacts with two strong acids to form E. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HNO3, and they're used in a nitrating mixture. But as I said earlier, alkanes don't typically undergo nitration. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrohalogenation, but that would require HCl, not two acids.

Wait, maybe the two strong acids are something else. Alternatively, perhaps D isn't propane. Let me see: another possibility is that the elimination from 1,2-dibromopropane gives 2-bromopropane. Wait, how?

Wait, if the initial structure is CH2BrCHBrCH3. When KOH in alcohol is added, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from one of the end carbons, leading to the elimination of Br from the adjacent carbon.

Wait, for instance, abstracting a hydrogen from CH2Br group: the H on CH2Br would be adjacent to the Br on the central carbon. So elimination would lead to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2, forming CH2=CHCH3 (propene again). Alternatively, abstracting a hydrogen from CH3Br (if it's CH2BrCHBrCH3, the central carbon is CHBr, so the CH3 is on the third carbon. Wait, no, the structure is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3, so the third carbon is CH3. So, the base could abstract a hydrogen from the CH3 group, but that's not adjacent to a Br. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of 1-bromopropene? No, I'm not sure.

Maybe I'm stuck here. Let's think about the next steps and see if that helps.

After D reacts with two strong acids to form E, then E is treated with iron scrap and HCl to form F. Then F reacts with nitrous acid to form G, which upon reaction with NaOH forms H.

So, let's think about each step. If D is propane, and E is formed by reaction with two strong acids, perhaps E is something like HCl or another acid, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe D is another compound.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong, and after elimination, the product isn't propene. Let me think about the structure again. When 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3) reacts with alcoholic KOH, perhaps the elimination leads to forming 1-bromopropene instead of propene. No, that's not possible because 1-bromopropene would have a Br on an alkene, which would be more substituted. Alternatively, perhaps the product is 1,2-dibromopropane eliminating to form 1-bromopropane and HBr, but I don't think that's correct because elimination typically forms alkenes, not alkanes.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the elimination leads to a different product. Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to forming 2-bromopropane, but that would require a different starting structure. Hmm, I'm not making progress here, so perhaps I should look for another approach.

Let me try to think about the possible products in the options and see if that can help.

Option C says: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.

If D is propane, its structure is CH3CH2CH3. The NMR would show a singlet for the CH3 groups, but since both ends are equivalent, it would be a single peak. So the NMR would have one singlet, not two. So option C would be incorrect if D is propane, but if D is something else with two different sets of equivalent protons, then it would have two singlets.

Wait, another possibility: if D is cyclopropane, then its structure is a ring of three CH2 groups. But that's not possible because cyclopropane is C3H6, but D is supposed to be the product after hydrogenation, which would add H's, increasing the number of H's. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, cyclopropane is C3H6, same as propene. So if D were cyclopropane, but how would that form from propene via a red-hot iron tube? Maybe the iron is causing some kind of ring closure, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe D isn't propane but another alkene. Let me think: if removing the double bond in propene via hydrogenation gives propane, as I thought earlier.

But then, in the NMR, if D is propane, it's a singlet for the CH3 groups, so option C's statement would be incorrect, because it says two singlets. So perhaps option C is incorrect.

Wait, but the question is to find the incorrect statement among the options. So if D is propane, option C claiming two singlets is incorrect. But I'm not certain yet.

Let's proceed further. Let's assume that D is propane, then E is formed by reacting with two strong acids. If E is then reacted with Fe and HCl to form F, which is perhaps a benzene ring compound, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps E is a nitro compound. Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something in the reactions. Let's think of another approach. Maybe the sequence is different.

Let me try to think of each step again, perhaps I made a mistake.

1. A is C3H6 → Propene.

2. Bromination in CCl4 → 1,2-dibromopropane.

3. Reaction with alcoholic KOH → elimination, giving propene (same as A), so C is propene.

4. Passing through red-hot iron → hydrogenation to propane (D).

5. D (propane) reacts with two strong acids → perhaps it's a sulfonation, but alkanes don't usually undergo that. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitration, but that's for aromatic compounds. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HNO3, and they're used in a nitration mixture. But since D is propane, which isn't aromatic, perhaps this approach isn't correct. Therefore, maybe D isn't propane. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the elimination step produces a different product. Let's say that when 1,2-dibromopropane is treated with alcoholic KOH, it undergoes elimination to form 1-bromopropene. Wait, but then the product would have a Br on the double bond, which would be 1-bromo-1-propene, which is CH2=CHBrCH3. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to 2-bromopropene, which would be CH2BrCH=CH2. Then, when that's passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's hydrogenated to CH2BrCH2CH3, which is 1-bromopropane. Then, D would be 1-bromopropane.

Wait, but then the next step is D reacts with two strong acids. If D is 1-bromopropane, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis, but under strong acidic conditions, perhaps it's a substitution. So 1-bromopropane with H2SO4 and another acid (maybe HNO3) could undergo hydrolysis to form propanol. But then E would be 1-propanol.

Then, E reacts with Fe and HCl to form F. Hmm. Iron and HCl usually reduce certain functional groups. Alternatively, perhaps it's a catalytic hydrogenation. 1-propanol is an alcohol; under certain conditions, it could be dehydrogenated to form propene again, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a nitro compound. Wait, but how would 1-bromopropane form a nitro compound with two strong acids? I'm really stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is:

A: Propene → B: 1,2-dibromopropane → C: Propene again.

Then, C (propene) is passed through red-hot iron (which is a catalyst for hydrogenation), so D becomes propane.

D (propane) reacts with two strong acids. Wait, perhaps the two acids are H2SO4 and H2O, leading to some kind of hydration, but propane is already an alkane and doesn't react easily under such conditions.

Wait, perhaps the two strong acids are HCl and H2SO4, and they're used for hydrohalogenation. Propane (D) reacts with HCl (from H2SO4 and HCl) to form 1-chloropropane. Then, E would be 1-chloropropane.

Then, E (1-chloropropane) reacts with iron and HCl. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps E is 1-chloropropane, and when treated with Fe and HCl, it undergoes elimination to form propene again. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe E is something else. Let me think: if E is 1-chloropropane, and then treated with Fe and HCl, perhaps it's a reduction. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is an alkyne. But I can't see how that would form from propane.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and should look at the options again. Let me read the options:

Option A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.

Option B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.

Option C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.

Option D) C is a flammable gas.

So, let's analyze each option.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. C is propene, which is a gas and highly flammable. So option D is correct.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. I'm not exactly sure, but some compounds like aniline derivatives are used in dyes. But F is the product after E reacts with Fe and HCl. If E is 1-chloropropane and F is propane again, then F wouldn't be used for dyes. Alternatively, if E is a nitro compound and F is an amine, then amines can be used in dye synthesis. So perhaps option A is correct.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. Ferric chloride is used to test for phenols, which give a reddish-brown precipitate. So if H is a phenol, then option B would be correct. Alternatively, if H is something else, maybe a ketone or an aldehyde, it might not react with ferric chloride.

Option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. If D is propane (CH3CH2CH3), the NMR would show a single peak (singlet) because all the CH3 groups are equivalent. So option C is incorrect if D is propane. But if D is something else, like a compound with two different sets of equivalent protons, then it would have two singlets.

Wait, but earlier steps don't seem to lead to that. So perhaps option C is incorrect.

But let's proceed to see what the other steps might produce.

Assuming D is propane:

E is formed by reacting D (propane) with two strong acids. Maybe E is a dihalide. For example, HCl and H2SO4 could protonate propane, but that's not typical. Alternatively, perhaps E is a nitration product, but as I thought before, that's unlikely.

Wait, another thought: maybe D is propane, and E is formed by sulfonation, but alkanes don't react with concentrated H2SO4 under normal conditions. So perhaps E is not formed, which suggests that my earlier assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps D is something else. Let me think again. If after elimination, C is 1-bromopropene (CH2=CHBrCH3), then passing through a red-hot iron would hydrogenate the double bond to form 1-bromopropane (CH2BrCH2CH3). Then D would be 1-bromopropane.

Then, D reacts with two strong acids. Perhaps the two acids are H2SO4 and HNO3. In the presence of H2SO4, 1-bromopropane could undergo nitration, but alkanes aren't typically nitrated. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction, but that would require a base, not strong acids. Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track again.

Alternatively, perhaps D is 1-bromopropane, and E is formed through a substitution reaction, such as with aqueous NaOH, but again, the problem states two strong acids. So I'm not making progress here.

Given the time I've spent and the uncertainty, perhaps I should look for the incorrect statement among the options, assuming some of the steps.

If option C is incorrect because D is propane (which gives one singlet), then option C is the incorrect statement. But I'm not entirely sure.

Another possibility: perhaps D is cyclopropane. Then, the NMR would show a singlet for all the CH2 groups, so only one singlet, making option C's statement incorrect. But I don't see how cyclopropane would form from the given steps.

Wait, another angle: if D is propene (C is propene, D is perhaps after another reaction), but that doesn't fit with the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps D is 1-bromopropene. Then, the NMR would have a doublet for the CH2Br group and a triplet for the adjacent CH2, but that's not two singlets.

Alternatively, if D is 1,2-dibromopropane, but that's the same as compound B, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure for D is 1,2-dibromopropane, but that doesn't make sense with the steps.

I think I'm stuck, but given the options, I'll proceed to evaluate each.

If option C is incorrect because D's NMR shows only one singlet, then option C is the incorrect statement.

Alternatively, perhaps D is something else.

Wait, another thought: if the elimination in step 3 leads to a different product. Suppose, for example, that the elimination forms 1-bromopropene, which is CH2Br-CH2-CH2Br? No, that can't be. Wait, no, elimination leads to formation of a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the elimination forms a different structure. Maybe the product is 1-bromopropene, which would have a Br on one end of the double bond.

Then, passing through red-hot iron would hydrogenate the double bond, giving 1-bromopropane as D.

Then, D (1-bromopropane) reacts with two strong acids. Maybe HCl and H2SO4. In the presence of H2SO4, perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction, but that would be more likely in a basic environment. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction, leading to 1-chloropropane as E.

Then, E (1-chloropropane) is treated with iron and HCl. Iron in HCl might be a reducing agent. So, perhaps 1-chloropropane undergoes elimination to form propene again. But that's speculative.

Then, F would be propene. Then, F reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2) to form G. But propene doesn't react with nitrous acid. Alternatively, if F is an amine, then nitrous acid would react to form a diazonium salt, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps F is benzene, but I can't see how that would form from 1-chloropropane.

I think I'm stuck again. Let me try to think about each option again.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is aniline, then yes, it's used in dyes. But I don't see how F would be aniline based on the steps.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. That suggests H is a phenol, which would react with FeCl3 to form a precipitate. But how would H be a phenol?

Option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. If D is propane, only one singlet. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. C is propene, which is a gas and flammable. So option D is correct.

So, the incorrect statement would be option C, because D is propane, which gives one singlet. Therefore, option C is incorrect.


The reaction sequence begins with Compound A, which is identified as propene (C3H6). Bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride adds bromine across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane (Compound B). When Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, an elimination reaction occurs, leading to the formation of propene (Compound C), the same as Compound A. 

Passing Compound C (propene) through a red-hot iron tube results in catalytic hydrogenation, where the double bond is reduced, forming propane (Compound D). Propane (C3H8) has two equivalent methyl groups, and its 1H NMR spectrum would show a single singlet, not two singlets. This makes Option C incorrect.

Compound D (propane) reacts with two strong acids. While the exact identity of Compound E is unclear, it is likely a halogenated derivative, such as 1-chloropropane, formed via hydrohalogenation. Compound E then reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, potentially undergoing reduction or elimination to form Compound F. 

Compound F reacts with nitrous acid to form Compound G, and Compound G reacts with sodium hydroxide to form Compound H. Based on the options provided:

- **Option A**: If F is aniline or a related compound, it could be used for dye synthesis, making this statement plausible.
- **Option B**: If H is a phenol, it would react with ferric chloride to give a yellow precipitate, making this statement plausible.
- **Option C**: Propane (Compound D) gives only one singlet in its 1H NMR spectrum, not two, making this statement incorrect.
- **Option D**: Compound C (propene) is a flammable gas, making this statement correct.

Thus, the incorrect statement is **Option C**.

Answer: C
