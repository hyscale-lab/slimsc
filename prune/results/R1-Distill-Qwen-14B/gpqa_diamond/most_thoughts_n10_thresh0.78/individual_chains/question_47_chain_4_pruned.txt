Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully. The question is about identifying a compound with the formula C9H11NO2 using the provided spectroscopic data. The options are A, B, C, D. 

The given data includes IR and 1H NMR spectra. Let's start by analyzing the IR first. The IR shows medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are usually indicative of N-H stretches, maybe from an amine or amide. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like an ester, amide, or ketone. 

Looking at the options, all of them have a carbonyl group except maybe C, but I'll check each. Option A is 3-ethoxybenzamide, which has an amide group. B is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, also an amide. C is 4-aminophenyl propionate, which is an amide as well because it's a propionylamine. D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which is an ester. 

So the 1720 cm-1 in IR could be an ester carbonyl (maybe around 1720-1740) or an amide (weaker, perhaps lower? Or maybe similar). Wait, amide carbonyls are usually lower than esters. Esters are typically around 1720-1750, while amides are lower, like 1640-1680. So the 1720 strong band is more likely an ester. Hmm, but wait, let me think again. Wait, some amides can have higher carbonyl peaks, but generally, esters are higher. So if the compound has an ester, that would fit. So looking at the options, D is the only ester. The others are amides.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an aromatic ring with the carbonyl. For example, a benzoate ester would have a carbonyl around 1700-1725. So the 1720 is right in that range, so D could fit here.

Now, let's look at the NMR. The 1H NMR shows:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is a triplet, likely a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group. So maybe an ethyl ester, which would be in D, or part of another group.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, which could be an NH2 group, but wait. But wait, in the IR, the N-H stretches are at 3420 and 3325, so maybe it's an NH2 or NH group. But a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm... Alternatively, it could be a -OCH2- group, but then the splitting would be different.
