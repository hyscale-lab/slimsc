Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law, right? So the probability isn't linear; it depends on time. Let me think about what the question is asking.

The problem says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So after 100 minutes, 32% of the atoms would have decayed on average. Wait, but they're asking about a single atom, so it's about the probability of decay over time.

Wait, the question says that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed yet. So now, we want to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Oh, wait no, the next 150 minutes after the current time? Or is it 150 minutes in total? Let me read the question again.

Ah, right. So 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. We need to find the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes. So that's 50 + 150 = 200 minutes from the start, but wait, no. Wait, the initial 100 minutes is the time frame given for the 32% probability. Hmm, maybe I should model it using the decay equation.

The decay probability is given as 32% in 100 minutes. Radioactive decay follows the formula N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where N(t) is the number remaining after time t, N0 is the initial amount, λ is the decay constant, and t is time.

Wait, but the probability that the atom has decayed by time t is 1 - N(t)/N0. So the decay probability by time t is 1 - e^(-λt).

Given that at t=100, the probability is 32%, which is 0.32. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100). Let me solve for λ.

Rearranging: e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.

Take natural log on both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = - ln(0.68)/100.

Calculating ln(0.68)... I think ln(1) is 0, ln(e) is 1. 0.68 is less than 1, so ln(0.68) is negative. Let me compute: ln(0.68) ≈ ln(68/100)≈ ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566. So λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the question is, given that 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed, what's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes. So the question is about the conditional probability.

Wait, in radioactive decay, the process is memoryless. Oh right! The probability that it decays in the next time interval doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So if the atom hasn't decayed yet, the probability for the next 150 minutes is the same as starting fresh for a 150-minute period.

Wait, no. Because the time already passed is 50 minutes, but the question is about the next 150, which would be up to 200 minutes total. Wait, no, no. Wait, no. Because the decay process is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability it hasn't decayed by 50 minutes, but now I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The probability that the atom has not decayed
