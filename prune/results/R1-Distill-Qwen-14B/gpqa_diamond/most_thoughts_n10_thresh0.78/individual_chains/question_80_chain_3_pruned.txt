Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out what the algorithm does to a DNA sequence to produce a number. Let's see, the problem gives me two examples:

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

And I need to find out what ACAGTGACC gives. The options are A)315, B)185, C)333, D)351.

Hmm, I remember that DNA sequences are made of four nucleotides: A, T, C, G. Each has a specific weight in some contexts. Oh wait! I think this might relate to their molecular weights. So maybe each nucleotide adds a certain value to the total.

Let me list the possible weights each nucleotide could contribute. I think the molecular weights are roughly:
A: about 330 g/mol (adenine)
T: 304 g/mol (thymine)
C: 289 g/mol (cytosine)
G: 329 g/mol (guanine)

Wait, but sometimes I've heard that sometimes people approximate these. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a simpler system where each nucleotide has a certain point value, maybe like A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4 or something like that. Let me think about the given examples.

First example: AGG -> 115. Let's see, if each nucleotide is summed individually. So A is 1, G is 4, G is 4. So 1 +4 +4 =9. But the output is 115. That's way higher than 9. So the sum of individual values isn't the way.

Alternatively, maybe each nucleotide contributes a certain number, and their sum is multiplied by the length or something. Let me check.

Wait, another thought: perhaps each base's contribution is based on its position in the sequence. Like, each position is valued at 10^something, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe the entire sequence is converted into numbers and then summed. Like, A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4. So for AGG, that's 1 + 4 +4 =9. But in the first example, the output is 115, which is much larger. So that might not be it.

Wait, perhaps each
