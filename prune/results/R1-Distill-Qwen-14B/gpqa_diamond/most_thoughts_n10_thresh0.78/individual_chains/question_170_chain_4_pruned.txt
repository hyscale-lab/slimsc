Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). I need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. The options are given as A to D.

Wait, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|Ô|ψ⟩, where Ô is the operator. In this case, the operator is S_y. But wait, I think S is the spin operator. Oh right, for spin-1/2 particles like electrons, the spin operators are S_x, S_y, S_z, and they are proportional to the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Oh right, the relation is S = (ħ/2) σ, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So S_y would be (ħ/2) σ_y.

The given σ_y matrix is:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

So S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix.

The state vector given is (3i, 4). Hmm, I think this is a two-component spinor. So it's written as ψ = [3i, 4]^T. Wait, but I should probably represent it as a column vector. So ψ is a column vector with first element 3i and second 4.

To find the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩, I need to compute ψ† S_y ψ. Wait, wait, no, because S_y is an operator, so the expectation value is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩.

But wait, let me get the order right. The state is a column vector, so ψ is a column vector. The bra vector ⟨ψ| is the conjugate transpose of ψ. So first, I'll compute ⟨ψ|, which is the row vector [3i*, 4*], where * denotes complex conjugate. So 3i becomes -3i, and 4 remains 4.

So ⟨ψ| is [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by the σ_y matrix. So let me compute each part step by step.

First, let me compute
