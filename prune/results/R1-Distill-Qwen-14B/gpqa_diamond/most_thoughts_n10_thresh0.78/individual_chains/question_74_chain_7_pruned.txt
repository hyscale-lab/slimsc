Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. The basic idea is that the probability of a nucleus decaying doesn't depend on how much time has already passed, right? So it's memoryless. But wait, let me think through this.

The question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that must mean the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 0.32, or 32%. Now, they've observed the atom for 50 minutes and it hasn't decayed. Now, they're asking what the probability is that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, but 150 minutes is more than the initial 100. Do I add the 50 and 150, making it 200 minutes total? Or do I consider the remaining time?

Wait, no. Radioactive decay is a continuous process. The key point is that the decay process is memoryless. So the probability of it decaying in the next t minutes doesn't depend on how long it's already been around. So whether 50 minutes have passed or not, the probability from now on is still based on the same decay constant.

Wait, but the initial statement says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that's the probability over 100 minutes. But now, the time
