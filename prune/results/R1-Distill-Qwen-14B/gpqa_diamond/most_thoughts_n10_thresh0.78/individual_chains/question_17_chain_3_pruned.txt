Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me read the question again.

The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The problem is about finding the concentration of free calcium ions in solution when the EDTA is present. 

Wait, so the solution has the Ca-EDTA complex at 0.02 M. But I'm supposed to find [Ca²+], the free calcium ion concentration. I think that the presence of EDTA will cause the calcium ions to form a complex, so the free calcium concentration should be low. That makes sense because EDTA is a strong chelator.

I recall the formula involving the formation constant. The formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The general reaction is: Ca²+ + EDTA⁴- ↔ CaEDTA²−. The Kf is given as 5e10, which is a very large number, indicating that the reaction strongly favors the formation of the complex.

So the Kf expression should be [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴-]) = Kf.

In this problem, the concentration of the CaEDTA²− complex is 0.02 M because that's what's given. But wait, in solution, the EDTA could be in different forms because of pH. Oh, but the problem states that the pH is ideal, which probably means that EDTA is in its Y^4- form. So I can assume that all the EDTA is in the Y^4- form, making the solution have enough free EDTA.

Wait, no. Wait a minute. If the Ca-EDTA complex is at 0.02 M, and the solution is at equilibrium, then the total EDTA comes from both the free EDTA and the complex. But wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the complex. That might be the total concentration of the complex, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is prepared with 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, and we're to find the free [Ca²+] in solution. So the initial step is to set up the equilibrium expression.

Let me think. Let's denote the concentration of the complex as [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M. The equilibrium equation is:

Kf = [CaEDTA²−] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA⁴−] )

But I need to find [Ca²+]. However, I don't know [EDTA⁴−], the concentration of free EDTA in solution. Hmmm.

Wait, but in this scenario, the solution is in a state where the complex is 0.02 M. So, perhaps the total EDTA concentration is the sum of the free EDTA and the EDTA in the complex. The total EDTA (T_EDTA) would be [EDTA⁴−] + [CaEDTA²−] = [EDTA⁴−] + 0.02 M.

But without knowing the amount of free EDTA, this seems tricky. Alternatively, maybe the solution is such that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, but the total EDTA is much higher, but I'm not sure.
