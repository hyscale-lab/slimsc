Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the incorrect statement about the reaction sequence. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The starting compound is A, which is C3H6. Hmm, C3H6 could be either propene or cyclopropane. Wait, but under bromination conditions, propene is more likely because cyclopropane is pretty stable and might not brominate easily. Wait, no, wait. Another thought: C3H6 is also the formula for propene, yes. So compound A is propene.

Bromination of propene in the presence of CCl4. Oh, right! That's a bromination reaction where propene adds bromine. Since propene is an alkene, it undergoes addition reaction with bromine. So compound B would be 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, but wait, actually, when propene (CH2=CH2CH3) reacts with bromine (Br2) in CCl4, it adds across the double bond. So the product would be 1,2-dibromopropane: BrCH2CHBrCH3.

Then compound B (1,2-dibromopropane) reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So this is probably an elimination reaction, E2 mechanism. When a dibromide like that reacts with a base, it usually undergoes dehydrohalogenation. Since there are two bromines on adjacent carbons, eliminating two HBr molecules to form an alkene. Wait, but since it's a vicinal dihalide (two Br on adjacent C), the reaction with KOH (alcohol) would eliminate two HBr molecules to form an alkene.

So let's think about the structure. The starting dihalide is BrCH2CHBrCH3. When eliminating two HBr, we can lose from either end. So possible al
