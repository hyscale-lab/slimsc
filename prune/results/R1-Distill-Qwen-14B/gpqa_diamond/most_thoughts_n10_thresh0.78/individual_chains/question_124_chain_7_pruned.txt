Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it carefully and think through it step by step. 

The problem says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. 

Hmm, I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). At ultra-relativistic speeds, v is very close to the speed of light c. So gamma is large. 

But wait, how does the Lorentz factor relate to the particles reaching the detector walls? Oh right, it's probably about the time it takes for the particles to decay versus the time it takes them to reach the wall. 

When a particle is moving at a high speed, from the lab frame's perspective, its lifetime is dilated due to time dilation. So the particle's lifetime is longer, allowing it to travel a greater distance before decaying. 

So the key here is the proper time of the particle's lifetime. The proper time tau (τ) is the lifetime according to the particle's rest frame. From our lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. 

The particles are produced at the center of the detector, so the maximum distance they can travel before decaying is the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. The time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is the distance divided by its speed. 

In the lab frame, the speed v is approximately c, since it's ultra-relativistic. So time t = R / v ≈ R / c. 

The particle will reach the wall only if its lifetime (dilated) is longer than this time. So the condition is gamma * tau >= R / c. 

Wait, but in the given problem, only a fraction of the particles reach the wall. So the fraction depends on whether their lifetime in the lab frame is greater than the time it takes to reach the wall. 

Wait, actually, perhaps it's a probability thing. Like, if the lifetime is longer, the chance of decaying before reaching the wall is lower. Hmm, maybe it's an exponential decay problem. 

The probability that a particle decays before reaching the wall is P = 1 - e^(-t/tau_lab), where tau_lab is gamma * tau. So the probability that it survives (reaches the wall) is P_survive = e^(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, perhaps that's the case. So when the lifetime is longer, the probability increases. So the number that survive depends on e^(-t/(gamma tau)).

In the initial scenario, the Lorentz factor is 20. One third survive, so P_survive = 1/3. 

So 1/3 = e
