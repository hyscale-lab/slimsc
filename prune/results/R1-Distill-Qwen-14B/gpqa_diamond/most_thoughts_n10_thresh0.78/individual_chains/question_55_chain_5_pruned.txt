Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see, the compound is either an acetate with propenyl or butenyl groups, and whether it's cis or trans. The options are Cis or Trans for propenyl and butenyl acetates.

The NMR data given is:
- 7.0 ppm, 1H, doublet (d), J = 16.0 Hz
- 5.5 ppm, 1H, doublet of quadruplets (dq)
- 2.1 ppm, 3H, singlet (s)
- 1.6 ppm, 3H, doublet (d)

Hmm. Let's break this down. I remember that in acetates, the structure is something like R-O-CO-R', where the R groups are the substituents. Since the options are propenyl or butenyl, the ester is likely an allyl ester. Wait, but wait. Let me think about the structure.

Wait, propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2- and butenyl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- or CH3CH=CHCH2-, depending on the position. But in acetates, the ester is R-OAc. So for example, propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Similarly, butenyl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc or CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc, but I need to check the structure.

But wait, looking at the NMR data. Let's think about the protons on the carbonyl group. The acetate (OAc) has a methyl group (COOCH2CH3?), wait no, the acetate is OAc which is O(CO)OCH3. Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, acetate is OAc, so the ester is R-O-CO-OCH3? Wait no, no. Wait, acetate is the ester of acetic acid. So the structure is R-O-CO-CH3, because acetic acid is CH3COOH. So the ester would be R-O-CO-CH3.

So the structure is R-O-CO-CH3. So, the
