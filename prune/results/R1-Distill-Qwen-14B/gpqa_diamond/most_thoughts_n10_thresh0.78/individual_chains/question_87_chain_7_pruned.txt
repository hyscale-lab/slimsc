Okay, so I have this question about identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbons in total. The FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring, which means there are two substituents on the benzene. The total carbons are 8, so the benzene has 6 carbons, so the substituents should add up to 2 carbons. Wait, no, wait, the substituents could be groups that contribute to the total count. For example, if one substituent is a carbonyl group like an acetyl (COCH3), that's 2 more carbons (the CO is part of the substituent, so maybe the acetyl group would add 2 carbons beyond the benzene). Wait, benzene is 6 carbons, so substituents must add up to 2 more carbons?

Wait, no. Wait, the molecular formula: the compound has 8 carbons. Benzene is 6, so the two substituents add 2 carbons. So each substituent is probably one carbon each, but maybe one substituent is a two-carbon group. Let me think.

The FTIR has a carbonyl peak, which suggests a C=O group. And an aromatic-halogen bond, so maybe a halogen like Cl or Br attached to the ring.

So the substituents on the benzene are a carbonyl group and a halogen? But wait, each substituent is a single group. Or maybe the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen.

Wait, let me think. The substituents could be things like a carbonyl group (like an acetyl, -COCH3) and a halogen (like -Cl or
