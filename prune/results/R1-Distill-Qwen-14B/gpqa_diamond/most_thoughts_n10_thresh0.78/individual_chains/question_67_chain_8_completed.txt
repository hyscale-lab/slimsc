Okay, so I've got this question about angular momentum states and electrons. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So, the question says there are two electrons in p orbitals, and we're ignoring their spin for this problem. The state of the system is given as |1,1,2,-1>. I remember that each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l, so in this case, both are l1=1 and l2=1. Then, the total angular momentum quantum numbers are l=2 and m=-1.

Wait, the question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for each electron. We need to find the joint probability that both L1z and L2z have eigenvalues of -ħ. Oh right, the eigenvalues for orbital angular momentum are m multiplied by ħ. So for each electron, m can be -l, ..., l. So for each, m1 and m2 can be -1, 0, +1.

The state is |1,1,2,-1>. I think this is a coupled angular momentum state, meaning it's a product of the individual states combined into a total. But wait, how does that expansion work? I remember that |l, m> states can be expressed as linear combinations of |l1 m1>|l2 m2> states. So the given state must be a sum of all possible |m1, m2> combinations that add up to the total m=-1, with the total l=2.

So Lz is the sum of L1z and L2z. The total m is m1 + m2. Since the state is |l=2, m=-1>, the total m is -1. So m1 + m2 = -1. But each mi can be -1, 0, +1.

So let's think about the possible (m1, m2) pairs that add up to -1. The possible pairs are:

(-1,0) → m1=-1, m2=0 → sum -1
(0,-1) → same as above, but reversed.

Wait, but wait. Because the initial state is |1,1,2,-1>, which is a combination of all possible m1 and m2 states that sum to m=-1, with the correct coefficients to form the l=2 state.

But the question is about the probability of both L1z and L2z being -ħ. That would mean m1=-1 and m2=-1 because Lzi has eigenvalues mi*ħ. So m1=-1 implies L1z=-ħ, and m2=-1 implies L2z=-ħ.

Wait, but the sum of m1 and m2 would be (-1) + (-1) = -2. But the total m is -1. So that's impossible. Because in the state |2,-1>, the sum m1 + m2 must be -1.

So if both m1 and m2 are -1, their sum is -2, which doesn't match the total m of -1. Therefore, the state |m1=-1, m2=-1> is not part of the |2,-1> state. So the coefficient for this combination must be zero in the expansion.

Therefore, the probability of both m1 and m2 being -1 is zero.

So the joint probability is zero. So the answer should be D) 0.

Wait, let me double-check. The coupled state |l=2, m=-1> is expressed as a linear combination of the product states |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1. The possible (m1, m2) pairs are:

(-1, 0), (0, -1), (-2,1) but wait no, wait, wait. Wait l1 and l2 are 1 each, so m1 can be -1,0,+1, same for m2. So possible m1 + m2 = -1:

m1 can be -1 → m2 = 0
m1 can be 0 → m2 = -1
m1 can be +1 → m2 = -2 → but m2 can't be -2 because l2 is 1, so m2 can't be -2. So only two possibilities: m1=-1 and m2=0, or m1=0 and m2=-1.

So the state |2,-1> should be a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Therefore, the state doesn't include |m1=-1, m2=-1>, so the coefficient is zero. So the amplitude for that specific state is zero, so the probability is zero.

Therefore, the correct answer is D) 0.


The problem involves two electrons in a p orbital angular momentum state, with the coupled angular momentum state of the system given as $|1,1,2,-1>$. Here, $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, while $l=2$ and $m=-1$ are the total angular momentum quantum numbers. The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$, which corresponds to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.

The eigenvalues of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ are given by $m_1 \hbar$ and $m_2 \hbar$, respectively. For both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to have eigenvalues of $-\hbar$, we must have $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. The total $m$ of the system is $m_1 + m_2 = -2$, but the given state $|1,1,2,-1>$ has a total $m = -1$. This means that the combination $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ is not part of the state $|1,1,2,-1>$.

The state $|1,1,2,-1>$ is a linear combination of product states $|m_1, m_2>$ where $m_1 + m_2 = -1$. The valid combinations are:

1. $m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0$
2. $m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1$

The combination $m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1$ does not satisfy $m_1 + m_2 = -1$ and is therefore not included in the expansion of $|1,1,2,-1>$. This implies that the coefficient of the $|m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1>$ state is zero in the coupled state. Consequently, the probability of measuring $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ is zero.

Thus, the joint probability of obtaining $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$ is zero.
