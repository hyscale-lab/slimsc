Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read it again and see what's going on.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, so both the radius and mass are 1.5 times bigger. Hmm, not sure how that plays in yet, but let's note it.

The astronomers used spectroscopy and found that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's radiation is given by Wien's Law. Wien's Law is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So, if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because lambda is the same, T must be the same. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but the problem says they computed the luminosities using black body radiation. So I think I'll need to use the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which says that the luminosity L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power. Because L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So, L is proportional to R² T⁴. Since both stars have the same T, the ratio of their luminosities depends on the ratio of their radii squared.

Wait, let me get that straight. So L1 / L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴). But T1 = T2, so T terms cancel out. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2.

Given that R1 is 1.5 times R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. Thus, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2. So the factor is 2.25, which is option A.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does that come into play?

Hmm, I remember that when a star is moving towards or away from us, there's a Doppler shift. But wait, the peak wavelengths are the same as observed. So if Star_2 is moving towards us or away, its emitted wavelength would be shifted. But in the problem, the observed peak wavelengths are the same.

Wait, let's think. The star emits light with a certain peak wavelength. If the star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength would be shorter (blue shifted), and if moving away, longer (red shifted). But in this problem, the observed wavelengths are the same for both stars. So for Star_2, which is moving at 700 km/s, perhaps that affects the observed wavelength. But because the observed lambda is the same as
