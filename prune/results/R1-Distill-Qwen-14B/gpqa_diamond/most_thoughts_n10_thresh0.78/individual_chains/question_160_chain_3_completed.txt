Okay, so I have this physics problem here about diffraction. Let me try to understand what it's asking. The question is about an aperture shaped like a regular N-sided polygon, and all apothems are the same length a. When a monochromatic light of wavelength λ falls on it, it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. We need to find the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Also, we can approximate tanθ as θ because the angles are small.

Hmm, right. I remember that when dealing with diffraction, the pattern depends on the shape of the aperture. For a circular aperture, the first minimum is at a certain angle, but this is a polygon, which when N becomes very large, approaches a circle. So maybe the answer relates to the circular case?

Wait, but the question says N is infinite, so the polygon becomes a circle. So I should think about the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture. In that case, the first minimum occurs at an angle θ where sinθ equals λ/(π a), because for a circular aperture, the first minimum is at θ = λ/(π a). Or wait, no, wait, wait. I might be mixing things up. Let me think again.

The formula for the minima in circular diffraction is when the path difference leads to destructive interference. The condition for the minima is that the path difference is (m + 1/2)λ, where m is an integer starting from 0. Oh, wait, no, I think it's that the condition for the minima in a circular aperture (like a circle) is given by sinθ = (λ / (π a)) * (m + 1/2), where m is 0,1,2,... So for the first minimum, m would be 0, leading to sinθ = λ/(2π a). Wait, no, wait. Let me check.

Wait, no. I'm getting confused between single slit and circular. Single slit is when you have a slit of width d, and the minima are at d sinθ = m λ, but for a circular aperture, it's different. The primary maxima are at θ=0, then the minima occur when the path difference around the circumference is such that the waves interfere destructively.

Wait, I think the formula for the minima in a circular aperture is given by sinθ = (m + 1/2) λ/(π a), where a is the radius. For the first minimum, m=0, so sinθ = (1/2) λ/(π a) → sinθ = λ/(2π a). But since the angles are small, sinθ ≈ θ, so θ ≈ λ/(2π a). Then, the first minimum is at θ=λ/(2π a). But wait, no, wait. I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should approach this from the basics. The problem states that the aperture is a regular N-gon with apothems of length a. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, the apothem a is related to the side length and the number of sides. But when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius a, because the apothem becomes the radius. So a is the radius of the circular aperture.

Wait, no! Wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the side, which for a regular polygon is given by a = (s / (2 tan(π/N))), where s is the side length. But as N becomes large, the regular polygon becomes a circle, and the apothem a approaches the radius of the circle. So when N is infinite, the shape is a circle with radius a.

Wait, but the problem says all apothems are of the same length a. So perhaps the polygon is inscribed in a circle of radius R, and the apothems are a. Since for a regular polygon with N sides, the apothem a = R cos(π/N). So as N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so a approaches R. So in the limit N→∞, the apothem a is equal to the radius R. So the circular aperture has radius a.

So the problem reduces to finding the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field for a circular aperture of radius a. The far field implies Fraunhofer diffraction.

In Fraunhofer diffraction, the intensity pattern for a circular aperture is given by the Bessel function squared. The zeros of the Bessel function J_1 determine the minima. The first minimum occurs at the first zero of J_1, which is at approximately θ = 1.837 λ/(π a)? Wait, no, wait. Let me think.

The diffraction minima for a circular aperture occur where the argument of the Bessel function J_1 is equal to its zeros. The first minimum is at θ where J_1(k a sinθ) = 0. The first zero of J_1 is at approximately 3.832, but wait, no, J_1's first zero is at around 3.83? Or wait, J_1 has zeros at x = 3.8317, 7.0156, etc. So the condition is x = (π a) sinθ / λ. So for the first minimum, x is 3.8317.

So for the first minimum, (π a sinθ)/λ = 3.8317 → sinθ = (3.8317 λ)/(π a). But when N is large, we can approximate θ as small, so sinθ ≈ θ, so θ ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(π a). Wait, but wait, I thought the first minimum for a circular aperture is at θ=1.22 λ/(a), which is approximately 1.22 λ/a.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the formula wrong. Let me recall the formula for the minima positions. The m-th minimum in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is given by sinθ = (u_m) λ/(π a), where u_m is the m-th root of J_1. The first minimum would be at u_1 = 3.8317, so sinθ = (3.8317 λ)/(π a) ≈ (3.8317/3.1416) λ/a ≈ 1.220 λ/a.

Wait, that's the first minimum, right? Because 3.8317 is the first zero of J_1. So the first minimum occurs at θ where sinθ= (3.8317 λ)/(π a) → θ ≈ 1.220 λ/a, assuming small angles where sinθ≈θ.

So the first minimum is at θ1 ≈ 1.220 λ/(a). So the angular distance between the first two minima would be the difference between the first minimum and the second minimum. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the first, second, third minima — we need the distance between the first and the second minimum.

Wait, but wait. The problem says "the first two minima". So the first minima after the central maximum. So the first minima would be the first one, then the second, and the angular distance between the first and the second.

So for that, I need the positions of the first two minima. The first minima is at θ1 = (u1 λ)/(π a), where u1 is the first zero of J1, which is 3.8317. The second minima is at θ2 = (u2 λ)/(π a), where u2 is the second zero, which is approximately 7.0156.

Wait, so the angular distance between the first two minima would be θ2 - θ1.

So compute θ2 - θ1 = (7.0156 -3.8317) λ/(π a) = (3.1839) λ/(π a) ≈ (3.1839 / 3.1416 ) λ/a ≈ 1.013 λ/a.

But wait, that's for the angular positions. But the options given are in terms of lambda over a, and the options are 0.5, 0.506, 0.610, 1.220.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 1.220 λ/a, which is the first minimum. But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So I think the first two minima are at θ1 and θ2, and the difference is θ2 - θ1.

Wait, but wait, what if N is infinite, but the polygon is a circle, so the pattern is the same as a circular aperture, right? So the first minimum is at θ1 and the second at θ2.

But the problem asks for the angular distance between the first two minima. So the distance would be the angle between the first and the second minima, which is θ2 - θ1.

Wait, but when N is infinite, the polygon becomes a circle. So the intensity pattern is the same as a circular aperture. So the minima positions are given by the zeros of the Bessel function. The first zero is at approximately 3.8317, the second at 7.0156.

So the angle between the first and second minimum is (7.0156 - 3.8317) λ/(π a) ≈ (3.1839) λ/(π a) ≈ (3.1839/3.1416) ≈ 1.013, so 1.013 λ/a. But that's not one of the options. The options are 0.5, 0.506, etc.

Hmm, so perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the first minimum beyond the central maximum, so the first minimum is θ1, and the question is asking for the angular distance between the first and second minima, but perhaps the problem refers to the angle from the center to the first minimum, which would be θ1.

Wait, but the question says "the first two minima", which would be the first and second minima after the central maximum. So the first minima is at θ1, the second at θ2, so the angular separation between them is θ2 - θ1.

Wait, but none of the options match 1.013. The options don't have that. Let me check the options again. Option D is 0.506 λ/a, option C is 1.220 λ/a.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem isn't a circular aperture but a different shape. Wait, the question states it's a N-sided polygon with all apothems a. When N is infinite, the polygon becomes a circle, but perhaps the apothem is different from the radius.

Wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, the radius R is related to the apothem a by R = a / cos(π/N). So as N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so R approaches a. Therefore, in the limit, the radius is a. So the circular aperture has radius a.

So the first minima is at θ = 1.220 λ/a, as I thought earlier. So the angular distance between the first and second minima is about 1.013, which isn't any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about a circular aperture but about a square or another polygon? No, wait, N is approaching infinity, so it's a circle.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the positions of the minima. Let me think again. The condition for minima in a circular aperture is that the path difference around the circumference equals (m + 1/2) λ, where m is an integer starting from 0.

Wait, another approach: The diffraction pattern of a circular aperture can be derived using the Fraunhofer diffraction formula. The intensity is given by the square of the Bessel function. The minima occur where the Bessel function J_1 (π a sinθ / λ) equals zero. The zeros of J_1 are at x=3.8317, 7.0156, etc.

So for the first minimum,

sinθ = (3.8317 λ)/(π a)

Since θ is small, sinθ ≈ θ. So θ1 ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(π a) ≈ (3.8317 / 3.1416) λ/a ≈ 1.220 λ/a.

For the second minimum,

sinθ2 = (7.0156 λ)/(π a)

θ2 ≈ 7.0156 λ/(π a) ≈ 2.234 λ/a.

Wait, so the angular separation between the first and second minima is θ2 - θ1 = (2.234 - 1.220) λ/a = 1.014 λ/a. But again, none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the angular distance between the first minima and the central maximum? No, that would be θ1, which is 1.220 λ/a. But that's option C. But the question says between the first two minima.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something about the setup. Maybe the apothem is not the radius. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says all apothems are of length a. So for a regular polygon, the apothem a is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. The radius R (distance from center to a vertex) is given by R = a / cos(π/N). So for a polygon with a very large N (approaching a circle), cos(π/N) approaches 1, so R ≈ a. So the radius of the circular aperture is a. So the first minima is at θ1 = 1.220 λ/a.

Wait, but the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So perhaps the question is incorrect, or I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a different shape, like a square, but with N approaching infinity. Wait, no, the question says N is infinitely large, so it's a circle.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the first two minima on either side of the central maximum. So the first minima is at θ = 1.220 λ/a, and the second is at θ = 1.220 λ/a on the other side. But that would imply that the angular separation between the two minima is 2 * 1.220 λ/a = 2.44 λ/a, which isn't any of the options either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Wait, maybe the question is not about circular diffraction but about a different scenario, like a single slit.

Wait, in a single slit, the minima are at d sinθ = m λ, where m is an integer. The first minimum is at m=1, so sinθ = λ/d. So θ ≈ λ/d, assuming small angles.

But in this problem, the shape is a polygon that becomes a circle when N is infinite. So it's a circular aperture, not a single slit. So perhaps the answer is the first minima, which is 1.220 λ/a, which is option C.

Wait, but the question is about the distance between the first two minima. So perhaps the first minima is at θ1, and the second is at θ2, so the difference is θ2 - θ1, which is about 1.013 λ/a. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the first minima as the one at 1.220, and the second minima is the next one, but the problem is asking for the angular distance between the first and second minima. Since the options don't include 1.013, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the two minima closest to the central maximum, which for a polygon with very large N, the pattern becomes similar to a circular aperture. So the first minima is at θ1=1.220 λ/a. The next minima would be at θ2=2.450 λ/a (approx), so the difference is about 1.23 lambda/a. That's not an option either.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the first minimum and the next minima as the first two minima, perhaps the first and the second minima are not the first and second zeros of the Bessel function. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about a polygon but a different shape, but that's what it says. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the polygon's apothem is the same as the radius of a single slit, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the problem is about a rectangular aperture, but that doesn't make sense with a polygon.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the diffraction pattern of a polygon, but when N is infinite, it's a circle.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as a single slit. But a single slit is a rectangle of width d and infinite height. For a single slit, the minima are at d sinθ = m λ, m=1,2,...

The first minimum is at θ=λ/d. But in this problem, if the apothem is a, perhaps d is 2a, since the apothem for a polygon is from the center to the side. For a single slit, the width is d, so perhaps in this case, d=2a.

Wait, but wait, for a polygon with N sides, the apothem a is the distance from the center to the side. If N→∞, the polygon becomes a circle of radius a, so the diameter is 2a. But a single slit's width would be 2a, so the first minimum would be at θ=λ/(2a). But that's a different scenario.

Wait, but the problem says the light is falling on the polygon, which when N→∞ becomes a circle. So for a circular aperture, the first minimum is at θ=1.220 λ/a.

Wait, but I'm stuck because none of the options match what I'm calculating. Let me look at the options again.

Options:
A) 0.610 λ/a
B) 0.500 λ/a
C) 1.220 λ/a
D) 0.506 λ/a

Wait, option D is 0.506, which is approximately 1.220 / 2. So maybe it's half of the first minimum angle.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the angle between the first minima on either side of the central maximum. So if the first minima is at θ1=1.220 λ/a, then on the other side, it's at -θ1, so the angular distance between them is 2θ1=2.440 λ/a, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the distance between the first and second minima as the angle from the center to the first minima, which is 1.220 λ/a, option C. But the question says the distance between the first two minima, which would be the difference between the first and second minima.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, and it's asking for the first minima's angular position, which would be option C.

Wait, but the question definitely says "the angular distance between the first two minima". So perhaps I'm missing something.

Another approach: when the aperture is a circle, the diffraction pattern has a central maximum and then alternating rings of minima and maxima. The first minimum is at θ1=1.220 λ/a. The second minimum is at θ2=2.234 λ/a. So the angular separation is θ2 - θ1= 2.234 -1.220 = 1.014 λ/a. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the angle between the first minima on opposite sides of the central maximum, which would be 2θ1=2*(1.220 λ/a)=2.440 λ/a. Not an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about a circular aperture but a different shape, like a square, but when N is infinite, it's a circle. So no.

Wait, maybe the polygon is not a regular polygon but something else. No, it's a regular N-sided polygon.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the single-slit formula by mistake, thinking that the apothem a is the width in some way. For a single slit, the first minimum is at θ=λ/(2a), where a is the slit width. So the angular position would be θ= λ/(2a), which is 0.5 λ/a. That's option B.

Wait a minute, but the problem states that the polygon becomes a circle when N is infinite. So perhaps the confusion is whether the apothem a is the radius or something else.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon's width as 2a, making the width of the slit as 2a, so the first minimum would be at θ=λ/(2a) * 1. That would give θ=λ/(2a), which is 0.5 λ/a. That's option B.

Wait, but why would the polygon's width be 2a when N approaches infinity? The apothem a is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. In the case of a circle, that's the radius. So the diameter is 2a. If the light is passing through a circular aperture of diameter 2a, then the width of the slit is 2a, but that's not a single slit—it's a circular aperture.

Wait, perhaps the problem is mixing up the apothem with the radius. So if the apothem a is the radius, then the diameter is 2a, and using the single-slit formula, the first minimum is at θ=λ/(2a). Which would be 0.5 λ/a, option B.

But earlier I thought that when N is infinite, the polygon is a circle of radius a. So diameter 2a.

Wait, but in a single-slit, the width is d. So for a single-slit of width d, the first minimum is at θ=λ/d. If d=2a (the diameter of the circle), then θ=λ/(2a) = 0.5 λ/a, which is option B.

But that's for a single-slit, not a circular aperture. So I'm getting conflicting approaches.

Wait, the problem says it's a polygon. When N is infinite, it's a circle. So the diffraction pattern is that of a circular aperture. So the first minimum is at 1.220 λ/a, option C.

But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima, which would be the difference between θ2 and θ1. As computed earlier, that's about 1.013 λ/a, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the first and second minima as the two minima on either side of the central maximum, but that doesn't make sense because the first minima is the first after the central maximum.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the angular position of the first minima, which is option C, 1.220 λ/a. But the question says "angular distance between the first two minima".

So I'm stuck. Let me look for a different approach. Maybe the problem is using a different formula.

Wait, another thought: when the number of sides N is very large, the polygon can be approximated as a rectangle of width 2a and height much larger than the width. But that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the minima of a rectangular aperture, but that's getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of Fraunhofer diffraction for a circle. The intensity minima occur where the argument of J_1 is at its zeros. So the first minima is at x=3.8317, which is the first zero of J_1.

So sinθ = (3.8317 λ)/(π a). For small angles, θ ≈ 3.8317 λ/(π a) ≈ 1.220 λ/a. So θ1 is about 1.220 λ/a. The second zero is at x=7.0156, so sinθ2 = 7.0156 λ/(π a) → θ2 ≈ 7.0156 λ/(π a) ≈ 2.234 λ/a.

So the angular separation between the first and second minima is θ2 - θ1 = 2.234 -1.220 = 1.014 λ/a. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem is considering something else.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the distance from the center to the first minima, which is 1.220 λ/a, option C. But the question is about the distance between the first two minima, so that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the first minima as the first diffraction minimum, which is 1.220 λ/a, but the question is asking for the angular distance, which is the angle itself.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon's apothem as being the radius of a single-slit. So for a single-slit, the first minimum is at θ=λ/(2a), which is 0.5 λ/a, option B.

But I'm getting confused here. I think I'm stuck between two possibilities: either the problem is considering a single-slit scenario, leading to option B, or a circular aperture, leading to option C.

Wait, let me think about the definitions again. The apothem is the distance from the center to the side. For a regular polygon, the apothem a is related to the side length s by a = s/(2 tan(π/N)). As N approaches infinity, tan(π/N) approaches π/N, so a ≈ s/(2*(π/N)) )= (s N)/(2π). So s≈ (2π a)/N. But when N is very large, s becomes very small. So the polygon becomes a circle with radius R = a / cos(π/N) ≈ a (since cos(0) is 1).

So the radius of the circle is a, making the diameter 2a.

In the single-slit diffraction, the width is d. So if the diameter is 2a, then d=2a. So the first minimum is at θ=λ/d = λ/(2a) = 0.5 λ/a, option B.

But wait, in the case of a circular aperture, the first minimum is at θ=1.220 λ/a. So why the discrepancy?

Ah, perhaps the key is in how the problem defines the apothem. In a polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. In a circle, the apothem is equal to the radius. So for a circular aperture, a is the radius. So then, the diameter is 2a. So for single-slit, d=2a, and the first minimum is at θ=λ/(2a) = 0.5 λ/a, option B.

But wait, why would the circular aperture's first minimum be determined by single-slit formula? No, because a circular aperture isn't a single slit. So I'm getting conflicting info here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the circular case but a polygon with a very large number of sides but not infinite. But the question states N is infinitely large.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. I think I'll have to make a decision based on the options given.

The options are:

A) 0.610 λ/a

B) 0.500 λ/a

C) 1.220 λ/a 

D) 0.506 λ/a

From earlier, I know that the first minima for a circular aperture is at 1.220 λ/a. So if the question is about that, the answer is option C.

But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So I think that's not the correct approach.

Alternatively, if the problem is considering the single-slit scenario where the width is 2a, then the first minimum is at 0.5 λ/a, option B.

But I'm not confident. Another approach: perhaps the problem is using the formula for the first minima in a polygonal aperture, which might be similar to a single slit.

Alternatively, perhaps the angular separation between the first and second minima is (7.0156 -3.8317 )/(π a) λ → (3.1839)/(3.1416 ) λ/a ≈ 1.013 λ/a. But again, that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the first two minima are the same as the first minimum (the first and second minima of the Bessel function). So the angular separation is (7.0156 -3.8317)/(π a) λ ≈ 3.1839/(3.1416) λ/a ≈ 1.013 λ/a. But the options don't have that.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.506, which is roughly half of 1.013. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, like considering the polygon as a rectangular aperture, but that's not likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the angle between the first and second minima in a polygon that's approximated as a circle, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the angular separation between the first minimum and the central maximum, but that's θ1=1.220 λ/a, which is option C.

But the question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which would be the angle between the first and second minima. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the zeros of the Bessel function. Let me double-check the zeros. J_1(x) has zeros at x ≈3.8317, 7.0156, 10.1735, etc.

So the first two minima are at x1=3.8317 and x2=7.0156.

So the angular separation is (7.0156 -3.8317) λ/(π a) ≈3.1839 λ/(π a) ≈1.013 λ/a.

But no option matches. So perhaps I'm missing a factor. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the circular case but a different one.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a single slit of width 2a, so the first minima is at λ/(2a)=0.5 λ/a, option B.

But I'm not confident. Given the options, and considering that option C is 1.220 λ/a which is the first minima for a circular aperture, I think the intended answer is option C, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but the question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima. So perhaps the answer is option D, 0.506 λ/a, which is approximately half of 1.013.

Wait, 1.013 is about 2 times 0.506. So perhaps the angular separation is 0.506 λ/a, which is option D. How?

Wait, perhaps the angular separation is (x2 -x1)/(2 π a) λ. Because for a circular aperture, the formula is sinθ = x λ/(π a), so θ = x λ/(π a). So the separation is (x2 -x1) λ/(π a) = (7.0156-3.8317) λ/(π a)= 3.1839 λ/(π a) ≈1.013 λ/a. But none of the options match that.

Hmm. So after all this, I'm not entirely confident, but the most likely intended answer is option C, 1.220 λ/a, which is the first minima. But the question is about the distance between the first two minima, so maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the angular separation as (x2 - x1) λ/(2 π a). Let me compute that: (7.0156-3.8317) λ/(2 π a) =3.1839 λ/(6.2832 a)≈0.506 λ/a. That's option D.

Ah! So perhaps the formula is θ= x λ/(2 π a). Because for small angles, θ≈x λ/(2 π a). So for the first minima, x=3.8317, θ=3.8317 λ/(2 π a) ≈ 1.220 λ/(2 a) → 0.610 λ/a, which is option A. But that doesn't match.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute for x=3.8317: θ1=3.8317 λ/(2 π a)= (3.8317)/(6.2832) λ/a ≈0.610 λ/a. For x=7.0156: θ2=7.0156 λ/(2 π a)=7.0156/(6.2832) λ/a≈1.116 λ/a. So the separation is 1.116-0.610=0.506 λ/a. Which is option D.

Aha! So perhaps the formula being used is θ= x λ/(2 π a), not θ= x λ/(π a). So the angular separation is (x2 -x1) λ/(2 π a) → 3.1839 λ/(6.2832 a) ≈0.506 λ/a, which is option D.

But why would the formula be θ= x λ/(2 π a)? Because for a circular aperture, the formula is sinθ= x λ/(π a), not 2 π a. Because the argument of the Bessel function is (π a sinθ)/λ.

So perhaps the correct formula is θ= x λ/(π a), not 2 π a. So perhaps the correct approach is to use θ= x λ/(π a), leading to a separation of 1.013 λ/a, which isn't an option. But the problem says to approximate tanθ as θ, so perhaps sinθ is approximated as θ, but the formula for θ is still x λ/(π a).

Hmm. I'm getting confused, but perhaps the intended approach is to consider the angular separation as (x2 -x1) λ/(2 π a), which gives option D.

So putting it all together, the answer is option D, 0.506 λ/a.


The problem involves a regular N-sided polygon aperture with all apothems of length \(a\). When \(N\) approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius \(a\). Monochromatic light of wavelength \(\lambda\) falls vertically on this aperture, creating a diffraction pattern. The task is to determine the angular distance between the first two minima in the far-field diffraction pattern.

For a circular aperture, the diffraction minima are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function \(J_1(x)\). The condition for the \(m\)-th minimum is given by:

\[
\sin\theta = \frac{x_m \lambda}{\pi a},
\]

where \(x_m\) is the \(m\)-th root of \(J_1(x)\). The first two zeros of \(J_1(x)\) are approximately \(x_1 = 3.8317\) and \(x_2 = 7.0156\). For small angles, \(\sin\theta \approx \theta\), so the angular positions of the first and second minima are:

\[
\theta_1 \approx \frac{x_1 \lambda}{\pi a}, \quad \theta_2 \approx \frac{x_2 \lambda}{\pi a}.
\]

The angular distance between the first two minima is:

\[
\Delta\theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = \frac{(x_2 - x_1) \lambda}{\pi a}.
\]

Substituting \(x_2 - x_1 = 7.0156 - 3.8317 = 3.1839\), we find:

\[
\Delta\theta \approx \frac{3.1839 \lambda}{\pi a} \approx \frac{3.1839}{3.1416} \frac{\lambda}{a} \approx 1.013 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
\]

However, none of the provided options match this value directly. Upon further consideration, the problem may involve an alternative interpretation of the formula for \(\theta\), where \(\theta = \frac{x \lambda}{2\pi a}\) instead of \(\frac{x \lambda}{\pi a}\). Using this alternative formula, the angular separation becomes:

\[
\Delta\theta = \frac{(x_2 - x_1) \lambda}{2\pi a} = \frac{3.1839 \lambda}{2\pi a} \approx \frac{3.1839}{6.2832} \frac{\lambda}{a} \approx 0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
\]

This matches option D. Given the ambiguity in the problem's phrasing and the provided options, the most reasonable conclusion is that the intended answer corresponds to this alternative interpretation.
