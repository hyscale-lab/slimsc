Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments done with GFP-tagged proteins. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that inner capsid proteins of rotavirus were tagged with GFP and given to mice orally. Then, in vivo imaging showed some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid and some entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. They found fluorescent Peyer's patches and isolated proliferating cells. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes showed high variability.

Wait, so what's happening here. Rotavirus is a virus that infects the small intestine, right? The Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), which is where a lot of immune responses happen, especially for enteric pathogens.

When they delivered the GFP-tagged proteins, some didn't make it beyond the stomach because of acid, others got stuck in mucus. But some did reach the Peyer's patches. Once there, the cells are proliferating, and their variable heavy chain genes are showing a lot of variation. High variability in variable regions usually suggests something like an immune response where diversification is happening.

Looking at the options:

A) Somatic hypermutation: This process occurs in B cells after they've been activated, leading to mutations in the variable regions of the antibody genes. This increases diversity, which fits with the high variability seen. Because this happens during the immune response, especially in germinal centers where B cells proliferate.

B) Complement activation: That's part of the immune response, but it doesn't directly cause variability in the variable regions. It's more about marking pathogens for destruction by phagocytes or causing lysis.

C) Class switching recombination: This is when B cells change the class of antibody they produce (like from IgM to IgG), but it doesn't increase the variability of the variable regions themselves. It's more about function after the antigen is bound.

D) VDJ recombination: This happens during the generation of the initial B cell receptor in the bone marrow. It's the process that creates the diversity of the V, D, and J segments. But if the cells are already proliferating and the variable regions are highly variable, wouldn't this have already happened in the bone marrow? Unless the question is about ongoing processes.

Wait, but waitâ€”the GFP proteins are from the virus. So when the mice take them in, the immune system is likely responding to them. The Peyer's patches are where these antigens would be processed, and B cells would be activated. Once activated, B cells undergo proliferation in places like the germinal centers, where somatic hypermutation occurs. That's when the variable regions get more diverse, allowing for better antigen binding.

So the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests that somatic hypermutation is taking place, which is an ongoing process after the initial VDJ recombination during B cell development.

So the process happening here is somatic hypermutation. That would fit with option A.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is lost due to stomach acid or entanglement in intestinal mucus, but fluorescent Peyer's patches are identified, indicating that some tagged proteins reached the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). The proliferating cell population in the Peyer's patches shows high variability in the variable heavy chain genes after sequencing.

This high variability is characteristic of an immune response, where B cells diversify their antigen receptors. Among the processes listed:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers, leading to mutations in the variable regions of antibody genes, increasing diversity. This matches the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **B) Complement activation**: This process involves marking pathogens for destruction but does not directly cause variability in the variable regions of antibodies.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This changes the class of antibody produced but does not increase variability in the variable regions themselves.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This generates initial diversity during B cell development in the bone marrow but does not explain the ongoing variability observed in the experiment.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests that somatic hypermutation is occurring in the activated B cells within the Peyer's patches. This process is consistent with the immune response to the tagged rotavirus proteins.

Answer: A
