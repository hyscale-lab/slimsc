Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating non-Gaussianity in a SchrÃ¶dinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The state given is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. N is the normalization constant, which they've provided as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)). The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

Wait, the non-Gaussianity is calculated using the relative entropy measure, del_b. The formula is [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the reference Gaussian state. So I need to compute this difference.

But wait, what's the reference Gaussian state here? Because the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity (NG) would involve comparing the given state to some Gaussian state. I remember that Gaussian states are those whose Wigner functions are Gaussian, like coherent states, squeezed states, etc. But I'm not sure exactly which Gaussian state we should take as the reference here. Oh, wait, maybe it's the closest Gaussian approximation to the given state. Or perhaps it's the state that has the same first and second moments as the given state, making it the best Gaussian approximation in terms of moments up to second order.

Alternatively, another approach I've heard about is that the relative entropy between the given state and the closest Gaussian state is the measure of non-Gaussianity. So perhaps the reference tau is the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as |psi>, making it the best Gaussian approximation.

Wait, but wait a second. Another possibility is that for the relative entropy, the reference Gaussian might be the thermal state or something else. Hmm, but without more context, I think the standard approach is to compare against the closest Gaussian state in terms of moments.

So first, perhaps I should compute rho, the density matrix of the given state. Then, find tau, the Gaussian state that best approximates it, and then compute the relative entropy difference.

Wait, but maybe there's a shortcut. Because the state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states, |alpha> and |-alpha>. Coherent states are Gaussian. So the state |psi> is a superposition, making it non-Gaussian. The question is, how much non-Gaussianity is there?

But how do I compute the relative entropy measure? Let
