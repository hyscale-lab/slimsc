Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see what the question is about.

The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. Hmm. I remember that the uncertainty principle relates the uncertainties of two observables, especially if they don't commute. Since P_x and P_z are different components of the momentum operator, they probably don't commute, so the uncertainty principle would apply here.

Wait, but the state is an eigenstate of P_x. So if the state is an eigenstate of P_x, then the expectation value of P_x would be well-defined. But since we're being asked about the uncertainty of P_z, maybe that's where the problem comes in.

Let me recap the setup. The operators P_x, P_y, P_z are given as matrices. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So, the eigenstates of P_z are the basis here. The given state is the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Wait, does that mean each component is a coefficient in the P_z basis?

I think so. Since the basis is the eigenvectors of P_z, any state can be written as a linear combination of those basis vectors. So our state is already in this basis.

The question is to find ΔP_z, the uncertainty in P_z. To find the uncertainty, I remember the formula: ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩, then take the square root of their difference.

But wait, since the state is in an eigenstate of P_x, but not necessarily of P_z. So the expectation value of P_z in this state might not be zero? Or is there some symmetry?

Let me think about the matrices. Let's write down the matrix for P_z. The given matrix for P_z has first row (ħ, 0, 0), second row (0, 0, 0), third row (0, 0, -ħ). So P_z is a diagonal matrix with entries ħ, 0, -ħ along the diagonal.

So the basis vectors are |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩, corresponding to eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ. So any state can be written as a linear combination of |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩.

The state given is ( -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 )^T. So in this basis, the state is a combination of |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩.

Wait, but when we compute ⟨P_z⟩, we can just take the inner product with P_z. Because in the basis of P_z's eigenstates, applying P_z is easy. The expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ would be the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues.

Let me think: The state |ψ⟩ has components a, b, c, where a = -1/2, b = 1/√2, c = -1/2.

So the probability of being in state |1⟩ is |a|^2, which is (1/2)^2 =
