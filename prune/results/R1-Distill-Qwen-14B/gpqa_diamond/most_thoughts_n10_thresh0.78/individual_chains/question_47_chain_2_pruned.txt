Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about identifying a compound using spectroscopic data. The compound has the formula C9H11NO2. The options are four different organic compounds. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, let's look at the IR data. The IR shows strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm^-1. Those are typically indicative of N-H stretches, which are usually in that region. Also, the strong band at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group (C=O), which could be from an amide, ester, or maybe a ketone, but given the formula, probably an amide or ester.

Next, the 1H NMR data. Let's break it down.

1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H: That's a typical ethyl group, where the CH2CH3 group is next to another CH2. So maybe an ethyl ester or an ethyl group attached to something else.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H: Broad singlet could be an N-H, but wait, in NMR, broad signals are often from exchange processes or when the protons are in an environment that's not very rigid. Alternatively, it might be an -OCH2- group, but the integration is 2H. Wait, if it's a CH2 adjacent to an electronegative atom like O or N, maybe an ethoxy group or something else.

4.5 ppm, quartet (q), 2H: Quartet with 2H. Quartet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, so maybe a CH2 group next to another CH2. Like in ethyl groups, perhaps. So maybe the ethyl ester's CH2 which is next to the O.

7.0 ppm, doublet (d), 2H: Aromatic protons, probably two equivalent protons in a para-substituted ring. Similarly, 8.0 ppm, another doublet (d), 2H: So that's likely a pair of protons ortho to substituents on the benzene ring. Wait, but the two doublets with 2H each would imply a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, or perhaps a substituent with two protons ortho and para positions.

Wait, but in a benzene ring, if it's para-substituted with another group, the protons adjacent to the substituent would be two each. Hmm, perhaps a substituent like -OEt (ethoxy) at the para position, leaving the adjacent protons as two doublets.

Alternatively, maybe it's an amide or something else on the benzene.

Looking back at the formula, C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation formula: Degrees = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X=0. So (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees. That could be a benzene ring (3 double bonds, 3 degrees) plus two more, which might be from a carbonyl and a double bond or another ring. Wait, but wait, the formula has O2 and N, so probably a benzene ring plus a carbonyl group, and maybe an amide or ester linkage.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be a benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. So the benzamide part is a benzene ring with a CONH2 group. But wait, benzamide is C7H7NO. But the formula here is C9H11NO2. So perhaps if it's 3-ethoxy, the substituents are OCH2CH3 and CONH2. Wait, but then the formula would be C9H11NO2? Let me check:

Benzamide has C7H7NO. Adding an ethoxy group (C2H5O) would add 2 carbons and 5 hydrogens (since O is already counted), but wait, the formula would be C7 + C2 = C9, H7 (from benzamide) plus H5 (from ethoxy) but the benzamide has a substituent, so maybe the H count is different. Let me think, benzamide is C6H5CONH2: that's 8 carbons? Wait, no. C6H5 is 6 carbons, CONH2 is two more, so total 8. Oh wait, the compound here is C9H11NO2. So the
