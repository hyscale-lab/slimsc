Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, that's like benzene with two substituents or maybe a ring similar to benzene but with substitutions. The FTIR shows an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O), so I'm thinking maybe there's an ester substituent on the ring.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: six signals. Let's break them down.

Two aromatic H signals. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the ring could have two substituents in a certain position. If the substituents are in positions that cause some symmetry, the number of unique aromatic H environments might be fewer. Two signals mean perhaps two equivalent sets of aromatic protons. For example, in para-substitution, the two substituents are opposite each other, which would split the ring into two equivalent pairs of H. Wait, no—wait, para substitution on benzene would result in two sets of equivalent H: two H adjacent to each substituent and two opposite. But that's assuming substituents are the same. Wait, but if it's di-substituted, and the substituents are different, then the symmetry is lower. Hmm, but in this case, maybe the substituents are same, or arranged such that the aromatic Hs are in two sets. Alternatively, perhaps it's not a benzene ring but another aromatic system like naphthalene. Wait, but the question says 6-membered, so probably benzene.

Next, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. Vinyl groups have protons on a double bond. So one of the substituents could be a vinyl group, like an ester with a vinyl substituent. Wait, but the ester group is OCOOR. Wait, maybe the substituent is an ester linked to a vinyl group, like an acrylate or something. Alternatively, perhaps one of the substituents is a vinyl group attached to the ring, and another is an ester.

Wait, the two vinyl H signals: one is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm. Vinyl protons are usually split by adjacent protons. For example, in a trans double bond, the two Hs are on opposite sides, so each would couple with each other. So each would be a doublet. But in a cis configuration, they might couple more, but still result in doublets. Alternatively, perhaps one of the vinyl H is coupled with another group.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is an ester and the other is a vinyl group. So if it's a di-substituted benzene with one substituent as an ester group (like OCOOR) and another as a vinyl group (like CH2CH2?), but wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-. Or wait, maybe it's a substituent like CH2CH2-O-CO-O- something. No, maybe the substituent is an ester group and a vinyl ether or something else.

Wait, but the ester group is an OCOOR group. So if one substituent is an ester, then the other substituent could be a vinyl group, like CH2CH2- but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has an ester substituent and another substituent that's a vinyl group attached. Like, benzene

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully and think through what it's asking.

The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The clues come from the FTIR and 1H NMR spectra provided. 

First, the FTIR shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group. Ester groups have characteristic IR absorptions, especially around the carbonyl region (C=O stretch). So the compound must have an ester functional group, which would contribute to the oxygen count in the formula.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR data. There are six signals:

1. Two aromatic H signals. Wait, why two? A di-substituted benzene ring typically has different substitution patterns. If the substituents are in the para positions, we might see a singlet for each set, but maybe they split each other. Alternatively, if the substituents are ortho and para, or meta, the splitting can vary. But in this case, the aromatic region has two signals. That suggests that the substituents are such that the aromatic protons are split into two distinct environments. For example, if the ring has two substituents that are in positions that cause the aromatic Hs to split into two sets. Maybe one substituent is meta to another, but wait, it's a di-substituted aromatic ring. Oh, wait, it's 6-membered, so benzene. Di-substituted benzene can be either ortho, meta, or para. Para substitution would lead to two sets of equivalent Hs. For example, if the substituents are para, the aromatic Hs might split into two doublets, each integrating to two H each. Or perhaps in some other pattern.

2. Two vinyl H signals: One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically on double bonds, so maybe the substituents include a double bond, like an ester group attached to a double bond. Wait, the ester group is O-C-O, but if the substituent is something like an acyl group attached via a double bond, perhaps as part of a substituted vinyl group. Or maybe the substituent is an ester group with a vinyl component.

3. Two signals for –CH3 groups. So there are two sets of methyl groups. That suggests either two different methyl groups attached, maybe in different environments. For example, one methyl from an ester group (like R-O-CO-O-R?), no, wait, ester is R-O-CO-R'. So perhaps the ester has two different R groups, one of which is a methyl. Or perhaps the substituents include two methyl groups attached in different positions.

Wait, but the substituents on the benzene ring would be the ester group and another group. Let me think. A di-substituted benzene with two substituents. One could be an ester group, perhaps as an O-acyl group attached to the ring. So, for example, the substituents could be an ester (like OAc, where Ac is an acetyl group) and another group. Alternatively, maybe the ester is part of a larger substituent.

Wait, maybe the substituents are two ester groups? But the question says it's di-substituted, so only two substituents. So each substituent could be an ester group? Or perhaps one substituent is an ester, and the other is something else. Hmm.

Wait, but I should think about the structure. Let's consider the NMR data again. The aromatic Hs are split into two signals. That would happen, for example, in the case of a para-substituted benzene. Wait, no. For a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, if the substituents are in the para positions, then the Hs would be in two sets: two Hs adjacent to substituent A and two Hs adjacent to substituent B. Wait, perhaps. Let me imagine substituents at positions 1 and 3. No, that's meta. Wait, wait, the numbering might be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are meta to each other. Or perhaps one substituent is an ester and the other is something else, like a vinyl group. Wait, no, the vinyl Hs are separate.

Wait, the vinyl protons are part of a substituent. So perhaps the substituents include a vinyl group (like CH2=CH-), but wait, that's a CH2 group. The NMR says there are no signals for CH2 groups. Hmm, but wait, the vinyl Hs are either on a double bond, which doesn't have CH2 groups. So maybe the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached, like an acrylate ester or something.

Let me think about the ester structure. An ester is R-O-CO-R'. So if R is a methyl group (CH3O), and R' is something else. Alternatively, R could be a larger group. The NMR has two CH3 signals, so maybe the ester has two methyl groups attached. For example, maybe it's an ester where one part is methyl and the other is a larger group. Or perhaps the substituents include a methyl group and another group that also has a methyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like this: The benzene ring has two substituents. One is an ester group (like OAc), and the other is a vinyl group attached to another ester. Hmm, that's getting complicated.

Wait, another approach: Let's count the number of Hs from each type.

The NMR has:

- Aromatic Hs: two signals. Each aromatic substituent in a di-substituted benzene would typically lead to two distinct sets of Hs. For example, if benzene has substituents X and Y in the para positions. The Hs adjacent to X would be one set, and those adjacent to Y would be another. So, each would have two Hs (assuming X and Y are such that the remaining positions are symmetric).

Wait, but for di-substituted benzene, the number of signals depends on the substitution pattern.

Para-substituted: the two substituents are across from each other. The Hs adjacent to each substituent would be equivalent, but if the substituents are different, then the two sets of Hs (ortho and meta to each substituent) would be non-equivalent. Wait, no, in para substitution, the substituents are opposite. So the Hs adjacent to substituent A are in positions 2 and 6, and substituent B is in position 4 and 8? Wait, no, benzene is a six-membered ring, so substituents at positions 1 and 4 would be para.

Wait, substituent A is at position 1, substituent B at position 4. Then the Hs at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to A) would be equivalent and form one set. The Hs at positions 3 and 5 (meta to A) would be another set. But substituent B at position 4, so the Hs at 3 and 5 are ortho to B? So in that case, the Hs at 3 and 5 would be adjacent to substituent B. So in this scenario, each substituent leads to two distinct sets of Hs, but if substituents A and B are different, then the Hs ortho to A (positions 2 and 6) and ortho to B (positions 3 and 5) would all be different. Wait, but that would mean three different signals. Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, if the substituents are in para positions and are different, then the Hs at 2 and 6 (ortho to A) would be a set, and the Hs at 3 and 5 (ortho to B) would be another set. So that gives two signals for aromatic Hs, each integrating to 2 H each. But wait, in a para-substituted benzene with two different substituents, would the Hs at positions 2,6 and 3,5 be equivalent? No, because substituent A is at 1 and substituent B is at 4. So positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to A, and positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to B. If A and B are different, the Hs at 2 and 6 are in a different environment than those at 3 and 5. So that gives two signals for the aromatic Hs, each integrating to 2 H. That fits with the NMR data.

So, aromatic Hs: 4 H (two signals, each 2 H). 

Vinyl Hs: two signals. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm. So perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group, like CH2=CH-O-CO-R or something. Wait, but then the vinyl Hs would be adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps. Or maybe the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group like CH2=CH2 attached via oxygen as an ether, but that might not fit.

Wait, no. If the substituent is an ester group, such as OAc (OAc is O-CO-Me), but that's a single group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like CH2=CHCOO-R. Hmm. Or maybe the substituent is an ester with a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is an ester, and the other is a vinyl group. So, the benzene has two substituents: O-CO-O-R (maybe an ester) and a vinyl group attached. But wait,
