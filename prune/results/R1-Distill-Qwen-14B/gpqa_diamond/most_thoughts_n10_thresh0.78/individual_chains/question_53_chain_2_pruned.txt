Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, that's like benzene with two substituents or maybe a ring similar to benzene but with substitutions. The FTIR shows an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O), so I'm thinking maybe there's an ester substituent on the ring.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: six signals. Let's break them down.

Two aromatic H signals. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the ring could have two substituents in a certain position. If the substituents are in positions that cause some symmetry, the number of unique aromatic H environments might be fewer. Two signals mean perhaps two equivalent sets of aromatic protons. For example, in para-substitution, the two substituents are opposite each other, which would split the ring into two equivalent pairs of H. Wait, noâ€”wait, para substitution on benzene would result in two sets of equivalent H: two H adjacent to each substituent and two opposite. But that's assuming substituents are the same. Wait, but if it's di-substituted, and the substituents are different, then the symmetry is lower. Hmm, but in this case, maybe the substituents are same, or arranged such that the aromatic Hs are in two sets. Alternatively, perhaps it's not a benzene ring but another aromatic system like naphthalene. Wait, but the question says 6-membered, so probably benzene.

Next, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. Vinyl groups have protons on a double bond. So one of the substituents could be a vinyl group, like an ester with a vinyl substituent. Wait, but the ester group is OCOOR. Wait, maybe the substituent is an ester linked to a vinyl group, like an acrylate or something. Alternatively, perhaps one of the substituents is a vinyl group attached to the ring, and another is an ester.

Wait, the two vinyl H signals: one is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm. Vinyl protons are usually split by adjacent protons. For example, in a trans double bond, the two Hs are on opposite sides, so each would couple with each other. So each would be a doublet. But in a cis configuration, they might couple more, but still result in doublets. Alternatively, perhaps one of the vinyl H is coupled with another group.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is an ester and the other is a vinyl group. So if it's a di-substituted benzene with one substituent as an ester group (like OCOOR) and another as a vinyl group (like CH2CH2?), but wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-. Or wait, maybe it's a substituent like CH2CH2-O-CO-O- something. No, maybe the substituent is an ester group and a vinyl ether or something else.

Wait, but the ester group is an OCOOR group. So if one substituent is an ester, then the other substituent could be a vinyl group, like CH2CH2- but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has an ester substituent and another substituent that's a vinyl group attached. Like, benzene
