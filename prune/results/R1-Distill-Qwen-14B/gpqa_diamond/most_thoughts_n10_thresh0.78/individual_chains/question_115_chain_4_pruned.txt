Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron and a positron colliding and producing photons. Hmm, I remember that when particles like electrons and positrons annihilate, they produce photons. But wait, this is a bit tricky. Let me think through it step by step.

So, the setup is: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, both annihilate and produce two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are such that one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right.

The question is asking for the angle between the two photons. The options are A)74, B)172, C)138, D)96 degrees.

Alright, let's start by recalling some physics concepts. First, Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = E/(m c²), where E is the total energy. For an electron and positron, their rest mass is the same, so m_e for both. But their velocities and energies are different because their Lorentz factors are different.

Wait, but since the electron is moving left and the positron right, their momenta might have opposite directions. Let me think about their momenta. The momentum p is gamma * m_e * v, but since they're moving towards each other, their momenta would be in opposite directions.

Wait, but the positron has a positive charge, and the electron negative, but since they're annihilating, maybe their charges don't directly affect the momentum here. Hmm, but the problem is about momentum conservation because the photons carry momentum. So, the total momentum before annihilation must equal the total after.

Right, so the total energy and momentum before must equal the total after. So the system's initial energy is the sum of the electron's and positron's energies. Similarly, the total momentum is the sum of their momenta, considering direction.

Let me calculate the initial energy and momentum.

Electron: Lorentz factor gamma1 =4. Its energy E1 = gamma1 * m_e c². Momentum p1 = gamma1 * m_e v. But v can be expressed in terms of gamma. Alternatively, since p = gamma m_e v, and v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²), but maybe a better approach is to use p = gamma m_e v = (gamma m_e c) * (v/c). And v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Alternatively, since for an electron, p = gamma m_e v, and gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). There's a relation between gamma and p: p = gamma m_e v = gamma m_e c * (v/c) = gamma m_e c * sqrt(
