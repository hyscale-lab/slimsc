Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about potential energy between a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. We need to find the net potential energy of the system. The options are A through D, each with a different formula.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with conducting spheres and charges, image charges come into play. Oh right, the method of images is used for problems involving conductors. Since the sphere is grounded, it must be an equipotential at zero potential. Or wait, no, wait. Grounded means that the conductor is connected to the Earth, so its potential is zero. So any charge induced on the sphere can be thought of as an image charge.

Let me recall: when a charge q is placed outside a conducting sphere, the sphere's induced charges can be modeled as an image charge inside the sphere. For a sphere of radius R, the image charge q' would be located at a distance of (R²/d) from the center, but on the opposite side of the charge q. So the distance between q and q' would be d - R²/d. Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of the image location.

Alternatively, the image charge for a point charge outside a sphere is given by q' = - (R²/d) * q, but wait, that doesn't sound right. Wait, let me get this straight. The image method for a conducting sphere: when a charge q is placed outside the sphere at a distance d from the center (d > R), the sphere can be considered as having an image charge q' located at a point such that the distance from the center is R²/d. So the image charge is inside the sphere, right?

Wait, no, I think that's when the sphere is uncharged. But since the sphere is grounded, any induced charges must reside on the sphere, and the sphere's potential is zero. So the image charge approach might still hold, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: the potential energy of the system is the work required to bring the charge q from infinity to its position d away from the sphere. But when you bring a charge near a conductor, the conductor's induced charges affect the potential.

But since the sphere is grounded, it's at zero potential. So the potential at the point where we place q would be due to the sphere and any other charges. Wait, but the sphere's potential is zero, so the potential at the point d away must be due to the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, perhaps the potential at a point outside a conducting sphere is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So for a grounded sphere, the potential is zero. So the potential at the point where q is placed is due to the image charge, perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe the potential energy is the work done in assembling the charges. So when you bring the charge q into place, the sphere's induced charges contribute to the potential energy.

Wait, here's another approach. The potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. But in this case, the sphere is conducting, so the induced charges are on the
