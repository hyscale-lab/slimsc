Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. 

Let me first read the problem again carefully. The state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2alpha²)). The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. The relative entropy measure is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where tau is a Gaussian reference state and rho is the state's density matrix.

Hmm, right. So non-Gaussianity measures how non-Gaussian a state is. Gaussian states are like coherent states or squeezed states, and non-Gaussian states are like cat states or Fock states. The relative entropy method is one way to quantify this.

Wait, so the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is calculated using the given formula. The idea is that it compares the entropy of the non-Gaussian state's density matrix (rho) with a Gaussian state's (tau). So the del_b value tells us how different the non-Gaussian state is from an ideal Gaussian.

Now, the problem is to calculate this del_b for the given parameters. Let me think about the steps involved. 

First, I need to construct the state |psi> and find its density matrix rho. Then, I need a reference Gaussian state tau. But wait, is tau any Gaussian state, or a specific one like the thermal state or coherent state? The problem says it's a reference Gaussian state, but maybe it's a coherent state, since coherent states are Gaussian and often used as reference points.

But wait, the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is often calculated with respect to the maximally mixed Gaussian state, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, sometimes the reference is a coherent state. I might need to assume something here. Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the vacuum state, but wait, the state given is a cat state, which is superpositions of coherent states. Hmm.

Wait, but the question says the relative entropy is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So this is the difference in von Neumann entropies between rho and tau. The relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is
