Okay, so I've got this genetics problem in front of me. Let me try to understand what's going on here. So, the question is about some genes in white lupine related to resistance against a fungal disease called anthracnose. 

The setup is that they found three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. Then they made knock-out mutants for each—g1, g2, g3—and also double mutants. They're testing these mutants to see how resistant they are to the pathogen. The control is the wild-type with 100% resistance. The lower the percentage, the more susceptible the plant is.

The results are:
- g1: 75% resistance → so it's less resistant than wild-type. That means knocking out G1 reduces resistance.
- g2: 0% → completely susceptible. So G2 is really important because without it, the plant can't resist the pathogen at all.
- g3: 50% → so knocking out G3 reduces resistance but not as much as G2.
Now the double mutants:
- g1g3: 10% → very susceptible. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, resistance is even worse than either alone.
- g2g3: 0% → same as g2. So adding g3 to g2 doesn't change the outcome, because it's already at 0.
- g1g2: 0% → same as g2. So knocking out G1 along with G2 also gives 0% resistance.

Wait, so when G2 is knocked out, whether you also knock out G1 or G3, the resistance is zero. That suggests that G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3. Because if you have a double mutant including G2, the resistance is zero, which is the same as just G2 being knocked out. So in the double mutants involving G2, the resistance doesn't decrease further, meaning G2's effect is already masking any effect the other gene might have.

Now, the question says that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of another. So the TF would be the gene that's higher in the pathway, regulating others.

Looking at the data, G2 seems crucial because without it, there's no resistance. Also, the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 are as bad as g2 alone. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3 because when G2 is knocked out, the status of G1 or G3 doesn't matter anymore; the resistance is already gone.

So the hierarchy is probably G2 is upstream. Let's think: if G2 is a transcription factor, it might activate G1 and G3. So without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can function because they're downstream.

Looking at the single mutants:
- g1 is at 75% → so G1 contributes, but G2 is more critical.
- g3 is at 50% → less than G2 but more than the double mutants.

In the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either g1 or g3 alone. So when both are knocked out, the effect is additive or synergistic. That suggests that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway but perhaps act in a redundant or additive way. Alternatively, maybe they're both downstream of G2, but their functions are additive.

Wait, but when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is zero. So the function of G2 must be necessary for any resistance. So the rest of the genes (G1 and G3) are downstream of G2.

So the data points are:
G2 is the most critical. Without G2, the other genes don't matter. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, but we thought G2 is the transcription factor. So option A says G1 is the TF, which may not fit. Because G2's knockout completely abolishes resistance, which suggests G2 is the TF.

Option B: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Hmm, same promoter? That's a possibility but I'm not sure. Also, if G3 is epistatic, meaning G3's pathway is downstream of G1. But in the data, when G1 and G3 are both knocked out, the resistance is lower than either alone. So that suggests that their effects are additive, which is more like a linear pathway
