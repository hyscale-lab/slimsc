Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and it's being reacted through a series of reagents. I need to figure out the final product from the given options.

First, I think I should look at the NMR data to determine the structure of the starting compound. The 1H-NMR shows peaks at 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), and 3.66 (d, 2H). Let me try to interpret these signals.

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's pretty upfield for an aldehyde proton, but wait, I remember that aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. So maybe that's an aldehyde group. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic proton, but that's less likely because aromatic protons are typically lower than 9 ppm. So I'm leaning towards an aldehyde proton.

Looking at the other peaks: 6.98 and 6.51 are both doublets, each integrating for 2H. Those are probably from aromatic rings. The 6.98 (d) could be para-substituted aromatic protons, maybe on a benzene ring with substituents. Similarly, 6.51 (d) could be another set of aromatic protons, perhaps on a different ring or the same one.

The peak at 6.27 is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad signals can be from alcohols (like OH) or maybe some kind of conjugated protons. Wait, but in an aldehyde, maybe that's something else. Alternatively, it might be an enol proton, but I'm not sure.

The 3.66 ppm peak is a doublet for 2H. That's a region where CH2 groups next to an oxygen (like an ether or an ester) usually show up. So perhaps that's a -CH2-O- group, like in an allyl ether or something similar.

Putting this together, maybe the molecule has an aldehyde group, two aromatic rings, and an oxygen-containing group. Let's consider the molecular formula: C8H9NO. The degrees of unsaturation can be calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5 degrees. So five rings or double bonds. Since there are two aromatic rings (each with 4 degrees), that accounts for 8. Wait, no, each benzene ring is three degrees (each double bond is one). So two benzene rings contribute 6 degrees (3 each), and the aldehyde is a double bond (1), so that's 7. Hmm. Oh wait, wait. Wait, I think I messed up the calculation.

Let me recalculate. The formula is C8H9NO. Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) = (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 => (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5.

Each benzene ring contributes 4 degrees (since benzene is three double bonds, so 3, but wait, the formula for DoU: each ring or double bond is one degree. So benzene has three double bonds, which is three DoU. So two benzene rings would be 6 DoU. But the total is 5. Hmm, that doesn't add up. So maybe there's another way.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is not two benzene rings. Let me think again. Maybe it's one benzene ring and another structure. So, for example, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. If one benzene ring (6 carbons), then the remaining 2 carbons plus the N and O.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's see: if it's an aromatic aldehyde with substituents. Alternatively, maybe the structure is something like benzaldehyde with substituents.

But let me get back to the NMR. The triplet at 9.72 for 1H suggests an aldehyde. Then, the two doublets at 6.98 and 6.51 for 2H each might be substituents on the benzene ring. Wait, but if it's a single benzene ring, how to get two doublets each integrating for 2H?

Ah, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with another substituent that's causing splitting. Alternatively, perhaps it's a biphenyl structure, two benzene rings connected by a chain. But the formula is C8H9NO, which is 8 carbons. So two benzene rings (6 carbons) plus two more, which might form a chain with N and O.

Wait, maybe it's an aromatic aldehyde with substituents. Let me think: for example, a benzaldehyde with some substituents. But the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. So adding another group with C1H3NO.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is an aromatic aldehyde with an amino group or an amide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a cinnamaldehyde derivative. Cinnamaldehyde is an aldehyde with a propenyl group attached to a benzene ring. Let me see: cinnamaldehyde is C9H8O. But our compound is C8H9NO, so maybe a substituted cinn
