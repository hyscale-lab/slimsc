Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum states. We're supposed to ignore their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Here, l1 and l2 are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for each electron. Then l is the total angular momentum, and m is its z-component.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z of both electrons. We need to find the joint probability that both measurements give eigenvalues of -ħ.

Hmm. So, each electron's orbital angular momentum L is quantized, and for a p orbital, l=1. So each electron has Lz eigenvalues of -ħ, 0, or +ħ.

But wait, the state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because for two electrons with l1=1 and l2=1, the possible total l can be l1 + l2, l1 + l2 -1, down to |l1 - l2|. So 1+1=2, then 1, then 0. So the possible l's are 2,1,0.

The state given is |1,1,2,-1>. So l=2 and m=-1. Wait, but for l=2, the possible m values are -2, -1, 0, +1, +2. So m=-1 is allowed.

But the question is about the individual L1z and L2z. Each has possible values of -ħ, 0, +ħ. So when we measure both, we want both to be -ħ. So the product state would be | -1, -1 >, right? Because the eigenvalues are each -ħ, so m1 = -1, m2 = -1. But wait, wait, the total state is |1,1,2,-1>, which is a coupled state. So how do I find the probability of a specific product state in the uncoupled basis?

Oh right, I think this involves the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Because the coupled state |l1 l2; L M> can be expressed in terms of the product states |l1 m1> |l2 m2>.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> can be written as a linear combination of |m1, m2> terms. The possible m1 and m2 values add up to M=-1.

So the possible (m1, m2) pairs are (-1,0), (0,-1), (0,0), (1,-2), (-2,1)... Wait, wait, but each individual m can only be -1, 0, +1, because l=1.

Wait, let's list all possible (m1, m2) such that m1 + m2 = M = -1.

Possible m1 values: -1, 0, +1.

So m2 must be (-1) - m1. So:

If m1 = -1, m2 = 0. Because -1 + 0 = -1.

If m1 = 0, m2 = -1.

If m1 = +1, m2 = -2. But wait, m2 can't be -2 because l2 is 1, so m2 can only be -1,0,+1. So that combination isn't allowed.

So the only allowed (m1, m2) pairs that contribute to M=-1 are (-1, 0) and (0, -1).

So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a linear combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

But wait, what about the coefficients? The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The expansion is:

|1,1,2,-1> = sqrt( (2*(1) +1)/(2*(2)+1) ) [ ... ] ?

Wait, no. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two l=1 states into L=2, M=-1.

I think the general formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients when combining two angular momenta l1 and l2 into L.

For L = l1 + l2, the coefficients depend on the specific cases.

Wait, another approach: The state |1,1,2,-1> can be expressed in terms of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

From what I remember, for two p orbitals (l=1 each), combining to L=2, M=-1, the state is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

But what are the coefficients? Let me think.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients can be determined using recursion or by knowing the pattern. For L=2, M=-1, combining two l=1s.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is symmetric or antisymmetric in some way.

Wait, but since both particles are electrons and identical fermions, but wait wait, the problem says to ignore spin, so perhaps we don't have to worry about antisymmetry. So the state is just the coupled angular momentum state, without considering spin or any antisymmetry.

So the expansion is:

|1,1,2,-1> = sqrt( (something) ) [ |m1=-1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1> ]

Wait, but I'm not sure of the exact coefficients. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient is 1/sqrt(2), because there are two terms.
