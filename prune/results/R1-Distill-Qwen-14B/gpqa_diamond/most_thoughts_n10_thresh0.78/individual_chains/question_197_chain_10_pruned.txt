Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question involves identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product it forms after reacting with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, red phosphorus and HI usually indicate a substitution reaction, maybe a nucleophilic substitution or something involving elimination. Wait, I think that's the条件 for the Hunsdiecker reaction or maybe a halogen substitution. Oh wait, no, I remember red phosphorus is used in the Clemmensen reduction. No, wait, Clemmensen is for reducing ketones to alkanes using Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI might be used in the substitution of a hydroxyl group. Oh right! When an alcohol reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it typically undergoes an SN2 reaction if it's a primary or secondary alcohol. Or maybe, wait, if it's a secondary alcohol, it could form a phosphorus intermediate and then substitute with HI to form a good leaving group. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh wait, red phosphorus with HI is used to convert alcohols to iodides, especially in the case of tertiary alcohols which undergo the substitution via the phosphorus ylide mechanism. Or perhaps for primary alcohols, it's a direct substitution. Hmm.

But wait, the question is about the initial compound X. Let me first figure out what compound X is using the IR and NMR data provided.

IR data: 3400–2500 cm-1 suggests an O-H stretch, maybe. But wait, that's a broad region, which could be from an alcohol, carboxylic acid, or maybe an amine. Then, 1720 cm-1 is likely a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 could be aromatic C=C stretching. So putting that together: an aromatic ring with substituents, a carbonyl group, and maybe an OH group.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H NMR:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, possibly an -OH proton from a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe an -OH in a phenol, but phenol protons are usually around 7-10 ppm. Wait, but in some cases, like if it's part of an aromatic ring but as a substituent, maybe. But 10.5 is higher, so more likely a carboxylic acid, which has a broad peak due to hydrogen bonding.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Aromatic protons, perhaps para-substituted. Because two protons as a doublet, maybe para to another group. Wait, in a para-substituted benzene, the protons would be as two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So maybe a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Or perhaps one substituent with two protons each.

Wait, let
