Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with pH calculations, especially when multiple acids and bases are involved. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, so I remember that when you mix acids and bases, you have to consider the neutralization reactions. But wait, these are different acids and a base. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I think I should calculate the moles of each component because that will help determine how they react with each other.

Starting with CH3COOH, which is acetic acid. It's a weak acid. The formula for moles is Molarity × Volume (in liters).

Molarity of CH3COOH is 0.1 M, and volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. So moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

Next, HCl. That's a strong acid. Molarity is 0.2 M, volume is 400 mL = 0.4 L. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH^- because the formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2OH^-.

Molarity of Ba(OH)2 is 0.3 M, volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. So moles of OH^- would be 2 * 0.09 = 0.18 moles.

Now, I think the OH^- from Ba(OH)2 will react with the H+ from the acids (both HCl and CH3COOH). But wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it will completely dissociate, but CH3COOH is weak, so it won't dissociate completely. Hmm, but how do I handle that?

Wait, perhaps I should first figure out the total H+ and OH- in the solution before any reactions.

Wait, no—when you mix them, first they'll neutralize each other. So, the strong base (Ba(OH)2) will provide OH^- ions, and the strong acid (HCl) will provide H+ ions. The weak acid (CH3COOH) will also contribute H+ ions, but since it's weak, maybe it's better to account for the neutralization first and then see what remains.

But wait, maybe I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and see which is in excess.

Wait, but strong acids and bases will completely dissociate, so their H+ and OH- can be calculated directly. For weak acids, like acetic acid, only a small amount will dissociate, but in the presence of a strong base, perhaps the OH- will react with the H+ from the strong acid first, and then any remaining OH- will react with the weak acid's H+.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the neutralization between H+ (from HCl) and OH- (from Ba(OH)2), and then see if there's any excess, and then account for the remaining H+ or OH-.

Wait, let's proceed step by step.

First, let's calculate the total moles of H+ from HCl.

HCl is a strong acid, so each mole gives one H+. So moles H+ from HCl = 0.08 moles.

Next, moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 = 0.18 moles.

So when H+ and OH- react, they form water. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, moles of H+ available: 0.08

Moles of OH-: 0.18

They will neutralize each other. Let's see how much each is left after reaction.

The OH- is in excess because 0.18 > 0.08.

So, H+ will be fully neutralized, and the remaining OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

Wait, no, wait. Because OH- is 0.18, H+ is 0.08. So the OH- will take all the H+ and have 0.10 left.

Wait, but wait, what about the CH3COOH? Because the strong base may also react with the H+ from the weak acid.

Hmm, but how? Because CH3COOH is a weak acid, it doesn't fully dissociate. But in the presence of a strong base, the OH- will deprotonate the acetic acid.

Wait, perhaps I should model this. So after neutralizing the HCl's H+, the remaining OH- (0.10 moles) will react with the CH3COOH.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it can donate H+ (but only slightly). But when OH- is present, the OH- will take protons from the acetic acid.

So, the reaction is: OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, each mole of OH- can react with one mole of CH3COOH to produce one mole of acetate ion.

So, initial moles of CH3COOH are 0.05 moles.

And the OH- left after reacting with HCl is 0.10 moles.

So, the OH- will react with CH3COOH. Let's see how much CH3COOH is left after reaction.

Moles of OH- available: 0.10

So, OH- will react with 0.10 moles of CH3COOH, if there's enough.

But CH3COOH has 0.05 moles. So, all of the CH3COOH will be neutralized by OH- because 0.10 > 0.05.

So, CH3COOH (0.05 moles) will be completely converted to CH3COO^- (acetate), and the remaining OH- will be 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

Wait, that's important. So after the reactions, we have 0.05 moles of OH- left, and all the HCl and CH3COOH have been consumed.

Wait, let me write this down in steps:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

2. Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.

3. Neutralize H+ and OH-: 0.08 H+ + 0.08 OH- → 0.08 H2O. Remaining OH-: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

4. Next, this remaining OH- (0.10) will react with CH3COOH (0.05 moles). Since OH- is
