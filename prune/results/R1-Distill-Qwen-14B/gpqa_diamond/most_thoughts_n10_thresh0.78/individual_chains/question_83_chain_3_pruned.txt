Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration and pH calculations. But let's take it step by step.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D with different pairs of pH values.

First, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When you titrate a weak acid with a strong base, the equivalence point will be a solution of the salt (in this case, sodium acetate) where the acetate ion is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so the solution will be basic. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let's break it down.

Step 1: Calculate the concentration after dilution.

We start with 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume is 40 cm³. The dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2.

So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, V2 is 40 cm³.

M2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40 = (1) /40 = 0.025 M. Oh wait, no, wait: 0.05 *20=1 millimole, then divided by 40 gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, wait, wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So acetic acid moles = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Then the total volume is 0.04 L, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Step 2: Determine the equivalence point.

The titration is with 0.1 M NaOH. At equivalence point, moles of NaOH will equal moles of acetic acid initially.

Initial moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence: 0.001 mol.

Volume of NaOH needed: moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added. But wait, the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of equivalence would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH
