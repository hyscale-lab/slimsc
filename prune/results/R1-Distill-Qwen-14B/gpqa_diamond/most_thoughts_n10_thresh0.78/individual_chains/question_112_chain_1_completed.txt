Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. Alright, let's read the question again.

The problem is about an electron described by the state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. We need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator, whose matrix representation is given by Aij. The Aij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and zero otherwise. Then, find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, okay. So first, let me break down what I know.

The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So it's a linear combination of |up> and |down>, which are the standard spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis. Since the state is proportional to that, I need to normalize it, right?

Wait, actually, the question says "proportional to" but doesn't specify the normalization. So I guess I have to normalize that vector first. Because probabilities require the sum of the squares (or the squares of the magnitudes) to be 1.

So let's compute the normalization factor. The state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let me write that as a vector in the |up>, |down> basis.

So the vector is [1+i, 2 - i]^T. The normalization factor is the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of each component.

The magnitude of 1+i is sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2). The magnitude of 2-i is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4+1) = sqrt(5).

So the squared norm is (sqrt(2))^2 + (sqrt(5))^2 = 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the actual state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait, but actually, in quantum mechanics, when calculating the norm, it's the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components. So yeah, each component is a complex number, and the norm is |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 +1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 2 +5=7. So normalization is 1/sqrt(7).

Alright, so now the state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ].

Now, the next part is about the operator whose matrix A has elements Aij = hbar/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. So the matrix A is a 2x2 matrix where the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2.

So the matrix A looks like:

[ 0, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

Wait, is that right? Because if i != j, Aij is hbar/2. So for i=1, j=2 and i=2, j=1, which are the off-diagonal elements, we have A12 = A21 = hbar/2. The diagonal A11 and A22 are zero.

So the operator is represented by this matrix. Now, the eigenstates of this operator are what we're interested in because the question asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator.

So first, I think I need to find the eigenstates of the operator A. Because the measurement probabilities depend on the projection of |alpha> onto each eigenstate of A.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to diagonalize A. Let me try that.

The matrix A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. Let me find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

The eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0.

So:

| -λ     (hbar/2) |
| (hbar/2)  -λ     | = 0

The determinant is λ^2 - (hbar^2 /4) =0 → λ^2 = hbar^2 /4 → λ = ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are +hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Now, the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

For λ = hbar/2:

(A - (hbar/2) I ) v = 0

Which gives:

[ -(hbar/2)   hbar/2 ] [v1]   = 0
[ hbar/2    -(hbar/2) ] [v2]

Equation 1: -(hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 =0 → -v1 + v2 =0 → v2 =v1.

So the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, v1). Let's choose v1 =1, v2=1. So the eigenvector is [1, 1]^T. But we can normalize it.

Wait, but the eigenvectors are in the same basis as the operator's matrix. So the eigenstates of A are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Wait, is that right? Because when I have the matrix [[0, a],[a, 0]], the eigenvectors are (1,1) and (1,-1), which correspond to symmetric and antisymmetric superpositions.

Yes, exactly, so the eigenstates of A are the symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of |up> and |down>.

So, we can write the eigenstates as:

|+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)

|-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. When A is (0, a; a, 0), the eigenstates are indeed the symmetric and antisymmetric combinations. So yes, that's correct.

So, I'll denote these as |+> and |->.

Now, the state |alpha> is expressed in terms of |up> and |down>. I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->, because the measurement probabilities are the squares of the coefficients of |+> and |-> in this expansion.

So, first, I need to write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+> and |->.

Let me define:

|alpha> = c1 |+> + c2 |->

We can solve for c1 and c2.

But since we know |alpha> is in the |up>, |down> basis, let's express |+> and |-> in terms of |up> and |down>.

|+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)

|-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, substituting into |alpha>:

|alpha> = c1 (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + c2 (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Combine terms:

= [ (c1 + c2)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (c1 - c2)/sqrt(2) ] |down>

But we also have the expression for |alpha> as (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So equating the coefficients:

( c1 + c2 ) / sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7)

( c1 - c2 ) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

Hmm, so now I have a system of two equations with two variables, c1 and c2.

Let me write:

Equation 1: (c1 + c2) = (1+i) * sqrt(2/7)

Equation 2: (c1 - c2) = (2 - i) * sqrt(2/7)

Wait, because (1+i)/sqrt(7) multiplied by sqrt(2) gives (1+i)*sqrt(2/7). So yeah.

Now, adding Equation 1 and Equation 2:

2 c1 = [ (1+i) + (2-i) ] * sqrt(2/7) 

= (3) * sqrt(2/7)

So c1 = [3 * sqrt(2/7) ] / 2

Similarly, subtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1:

2 c2 = [ (1+i) - (2-i) ] * sqrt(2/7)

= ( -1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2/7 )

So c2= [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7) ] / 2

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to solve for c1 and c2.

Alternatively, let me write the two equations:

c1 + c2 = (1+i) * sqrt(2/7)

c1 - c2 = (2 - i) * sqrt(2/7)

Let me add these two equations:

2 c1 = (1+i + 2 - i) * sqrt(2/7) = 3 * sqrt(2/7) → c1 = (3/2) sqrt(2/7)

Subtracting the two equations:

2 c2 = (1+i - (2-i)) * sqrt(2/7) = ( -1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2/7) → c2 = ( (-1 +2i ) * sqrt(2/7) ) /2

So now, we have c1 and c2.

The probabilities of measuring the eigenvalues +hbar/2 and -hbar/2 are |c1|^2 and |c2|^2, respectively.

So let's compute |c1|^2 and |c2|^2.

First, c1 = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7) = (3) * sqrt(2) / (2 * sqrt(7)) )

Wait, but maybe it's better to compute |c1|^2 directly.

|c1|^2 = ( (3/2)^2 ) * (2/7 ) = (9/4) * (2/7) )= (9 * 2) / (4*7) )= 18/(28) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Hmm, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857. So that's about 0.64.

Now, |c2|^2 = [ ( (-1 + 2i) / 2 ) * sqrt(2/7) ]^2.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute |c2|^2 as ( ( (-1 +2i)/2 )^2 * (2/7) )

Wait, no, let me think. The magnitude squared of a complex number a + bi is a^2 + b^2.

So for c2, which is [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7) ] / 2.

So, the coefficient is ( (-1 +2i) ) / 2 multiplied by sqrt(2/7).

So the magnitude squared is | (-1+2i)/2 |^2 multiplied by (2/7).

Because |c2|^2 = | [ (-1+2i) * sqrt(2/7) ] / 2 |^2.

So let me compute | (-1 +2i) / 2 |^2:

= [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / (2^2) ) = (1 +4)/4 = 5/4.

So |c2|^2 = (5/4) * (2/7) )= (5 * 2 ) / (4 *7 ) = 10/28 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357.

Wait, but wait, because:

Wait, sqrt(2/7) is a real number. So, when you have [ (-1+2i) * sqrt(2/7) ] /2, the magnitude squared is | (-1+2i)/2 |^2 multiplied by (sqrt(2/7))^2.

Because |a * b|^2 = |a|^2 * |b|^2.

So, | (-1+2i) / 2 |^2 is (1^2 + 2^2)/4 =5/4. The | sqrt(2/7) |^2 is (2/7).

So |c2|^2 = (5/4) * (2/7) )= (5 * 2) / (4 *7 )=10/28=5/14 ≈ 0.357.

Wait, but 5/14 is about 0.357.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357. So the probabilities would be approximately 64.28% and 35.71%.

But looking at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7. So that's close to 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but let me check the calculations again because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which rounds to 0.64. 5/14 is approximately 0.3571, which is 0.36 when rounded to two decimal places.

But let me compute |c2|^2 again.

Wait, I think I may have miscalculated. Let me re-express c2.

c2 = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7) ] / 2.

So the magnitude squared is [ ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) * (2/7) ) ] / (2^2).

Which is [ (1 +4) * (2/7) ) ] /4.

Because |a + bi|^2 is (a^2 + b^2). So here, a is (-1), b is 2. So a^2 + b^2 is 1 +4=5. Multiply by 2/7, and divide by 4.

So (5 * 2/7) /4 = (10/7)/4 = 10/(28) =5/14.

Yes, same as before. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.642857 and 0.3571.

So the first part of the question, the probabilities, are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. Let's look at the options.

Option A says 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7. Option C has 0.28 and 0.72. Hmm, but wait, no, the probabilities sum to 1, so 0.64 +0.36=1, which is correct.

But wait, let me check the average value of the operator A.

The average value <A> is the expectation value of A in the state |alpha>.

The expectation value is given by <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since we have |alpha> expressed in terms of the eigenstates of A, the expectation value can be calculated as |c1|^2 * (hbar/2) + |c2|^2 * (-hbar/2).

Because the eigenstates are |+> with eigenvalue +hbar/2 and |-> with eigenvalue -hbar/2.

So <A> = |c1|^2*(hbar/2) + |c2|^2*(-hbar/2).

We have |c1|^2 =9/14, |c2|^2=5/14.

So,

<A> = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)( - hbar/2 )

= [9/14 -5/14 ] * (hbar/2 )

= (4/14) * (hbar/2 )

= (2/7) * (hbar/2 )

Wait, 4/14 is 2/7, and 2/7 multiplied by 1/2 is 1/7.

So <A> = (1/7) hbar.

Wait, that's hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

So looking back at the options.

Option A: probabilities 0.64, 0.36, average hbar/7.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is '0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7', which matches. So that's possible.

But wait, let me recheck the average value.

Wait, <A> = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) 

= [ (9*(hbar/2) ) + (5*(-hbar/2) ) ] /14 

Wait, wait, no, because |c1|^2 is 9/14, so that's:

= (9/14)*(hbar/2) + (5/14)*(-hbar/2)

= [9*(hbar/2) -5*(hbar/2) ] /14

= [ (9 -5) * hbar/2 ] /14

= (4 * hbar/2) /14

Which is (2 hbar) /14 = hbar/7.

Yes, that's correct. So the average is hbar/7.

So according to this, option A is the correct one. But wait, looking at the options, let me check:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

Yes, that's exactly what we have.

Wait, but let me think again. Because the operator A is given as a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere.

Wait, another approach to compute the expectation value is to directly compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Given that |alpha> is (1+i, 2-i)/sqrt(7), so the bra vector is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ].

So let's compute <alpha| A |alpha>:

A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

So A |alpha> is:

First component: 0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (hbar/2)*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) = (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Second component: (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) = (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7).

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> is (1-i)/sqrt(7) * [ (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * [ (hbar/2)(1 +i)/sqrt(7) ].

Let me compute each term.

First term: (1 -i)(2 -i) * (hbar/2) /7.

Multiply (1 -i)(2 -i) = (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i)

= 2 -i -2i + i^2

= 2 -3i -1 (since i^2 = -1)

= 1 -3i.

So first term becomes (1-3i) * (hbar/2) /7.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) * (hbar/2)/7.

Compute (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i = 2 +2i +i +i^2 = 2+3i -1= 1+3i.

So second term is (1 +3i) * (hbar/2)/7.

Adding the two terms:

[ (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) ] * (hbar/2)/7 

= (2) * (hbar/2)/7 

= (hbar) * (1/7).

So <A>= hbar/7.

Which matches our previous result.

So the average value is indeed hbar/7.

So looking at the options, option A says average is hbar/7, and the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, which align with our calculation.

But wait, let me check the other options just to make sure.

Option D has average 2 hbar / sqrt(7), which is larger than our result, so probably not. Option C has average hbar/sqrt(7), which is about 2.6458 times hbar, which seems too large because our result is about 0.1429 hbar.

Wait, no, because 1/sqrt(7) is approximately 0.37796, which is about 0.38, but our average is 1/7, which is about 0.142857. Hmm, so option A's average is 1/7 hbar, which is correct.

Wait, but looking at the other options, perhaps another approach would give a different result. Let me think, did I make any mistake in the expectation value calculation?

Wait, the other approach is to compute the expectation value using the state's components.

But both methods gave me <A> = hbar/7, so that's correct.

Now, looking at the probabilities, in our calculation, the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.642857 and 0.357143.

So when rounded to two decimal places, that's 0.64 and 0.36. So that matches option A.

Now, let me check the other options:

Option B: 0.54, 0.46 → sum to 1. Average is 3 hbar/sqrt(7). Hmm, but our average is hbar/7, which is much smaller. So it's unlikely.

Option C: 0.28, 0.72 → sum to 1. Average is hbar/sqrt(7), which is about 0.377 hbar, which is larger than our result. So no.

Option D: 0.61, 0.29 → sum to 1. Average is 2 hbar/sqrt(7), which is about 0.7559 hbar. Doesn't match.

So the only option that matches all three is option A.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization factor is determined by the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the components:

\[
|1+i|^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 5, \quad \text{so the squared norm is } 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \) with matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\ 
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), and the corresponding eigenstates are:

\[
|+\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \). Substituting \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \) into \( |\alpha\rangle \), we solve for the coefficients \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) such that:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = c_1 |+\rangle + c_2 |-\rangle.
\]

Equating coefficients, we find:

\[
c_1 = \frac{3}{2\sqrt{7}}, \quad c_2 = \frac{-1 + 2i}{2\sqrt{7}}.
\]

The probabilities of measuring \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \) are the squared magnitudes of \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \), respectively:

\[
|c_1|^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2\sqrt{7}}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad |c_2|^2 = \left(\frac{-1 + 2i}{2\sqrt{7}}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Finally, the average value of \( A \) is calculated as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = |c_1|^2 \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + |c_2|^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Substituting \( |c_1|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \) and \( |c_2|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \), we get:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
