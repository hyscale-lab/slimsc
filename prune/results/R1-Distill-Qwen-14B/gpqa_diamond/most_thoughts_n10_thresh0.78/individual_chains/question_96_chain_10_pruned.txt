Okay, so I've got this problem about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I remember from my studies that black holes have entropy, and it's related to the area of their event horizon. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, so I'll have to think that through.

The question gives me the angular size θ of the event horizon as 10^-17 degrees, and the distance d is 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy.

First, I should probably start by figuring out the radius of the event horizon. Oh right, the formula for the radius of a Schwarzschild black hole is R = 2GM/c², but that might come into play later. Alternatively, since I'm given the angular size, I can calculate the actual size using trigonometry.

Wait, the angular size θ is very small, so I can use the approximation that the tangent of θ is approximately equal to θ in radians. That would make things easier. So, θ (in radians) ≈ opposite side / adjacent = R / d.

So R ≈ d * θ. But I need to make sure all the units are consistent. Let me convert θ from degrees to radians first. 

θ in radians is θ_deg * (π/180). So θ = 1e-17 degrees * (π/180) = (1e-17) * π / 180 radians. Let me compute that. 1e-17 times π is about 3.14e-17, divided by 180 is about 1.745e-19 radians.

Distance d is 1e10 parsecs. Oh, but I need to convert parsecs to meters because when we’re dealing with physics formulas, meters are the standard unit. I remember that 1 parsec is approximately 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

Now, R ≈ d * θ. So R = 3.086e26 m * 1.745e-19 rad. Let me calculate that. 3e26 * 1.7e-19 is about 5.1e7 meters? Wait, let's do it more accurately. 3.086e26 * 1.745e-19 = (3.086 * 1.745) e7. 3.086 * 1.745 is roughly 5.38. So R ≈ 5.38e7 meters. Wait, 5.38e7 meters is 5.38 x 10^7 meters. That's 53.8 million meters, which is 5.38e4 kilometers. Hmm, that seems a bit small for a supermassive black hole, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the exponent somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check the distance conversion. 1 parsec is 3.086e16 meters. So 1e10 parsecs is 1e10 * 3.086e16 = 3.086e26 meters. That part seems right. Then, R is d * θ, which is 3.086e26 * 1.745e-19. So 3.086e26 * 1.745e-19 = (3.086 * 1.745) * 1e7. Wait, 3.086 * 1.745 is around 5.38. So 5.38e7 meters. So R is about 5.38e7 meters. Yes, that seems correct.

Wait, supermassive black holes have event horizons on the order of millions of kilometers. Let me see: 1 AU is about 1.5e11 meters. So 5e7 meters is about 0.033 AU. Hmm, but wait, the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy, like Sag A*, has an event horizon radius of about 2e6 km, which is 2e9 meters. Wait, 2e9 meters is 2e9 = 2e9, but our calculation here came up with 5e7 meters, which is 5e7 = 50 million meters, which is 50,000 km. That's way smaller than Sag A*. Hmm, so perhaps I messed up some unit conversion.

Wait, maybe the distance given is 1e10 parsecs
