Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and mean free paths of gas molecules. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

So, the scenario is Mike is designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using a very high accelerating voltage, 1000 kV, which probably means it's a TEM with a lot of power. He connected vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment, like less than 1e-9 Torr. That's really low pressure, right? Because in ultra-high vacuum, there are very few gas molecules.

Even so, some gas particles are still there, as detected by a mass spectrometer. Mike calculated the mean free path (λ1) of these gas molecules based on the compartment's volume, pressure, and temperature. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, I remember. The formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2) * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the molecular diameter, and P is pressure. So in the initial state, λ1 is the mean free path before the electron beam is on.

But then, when Mike turns on the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes. Now it's λ2. The question is asking what we can conclude about λ2 compared to λ1. The options are A to D.

Wait, why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is on? Let me think about the physics here. In a vacuum, the electron beam travels through the sample compartment. Those gas molecules in the compartment will interact with the electrons. But how?

I remember that electrons can cause gas molecules to ionize. When an electron with high energy (like 1000 kV is a lot) passes through a gas, it can collide with the gas atoms or molecules, causing ionization. So, the gas molecules might get charged.

In the initial state, without the electron beam, the gas molecules are neutral. When the beam is on, the gas molecules become ions. Now, charged particles in a vacuum experience forces from the electric fields, right? So these ions could be accelerated by the electric fields in the microscope, perhaps being drawn towards the charged plates or the beam itself.

Wait, but how does this affect the mean free path? The mean free path depends on the pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules. But the pressure hasn't changed, because the pumps are still running, and the temperature is the same. So why is the mean free path λ2 different from λ1?

Oh, maybe the presence of the electron beam affects the gas in another way. Let's think about the electron scattering. The electrons from the beam collide with the gas molecules. These collisions can transfer energy and momentum to the gas molecules.

But wait, the mean free path is about how far a gas molecule travels before colliding with another molecule. So if the electrons are causing additional collisions, perhaps the effective mean free path changes.

Wait, but the electrons are moving much faster than the gas molecules, I think. Because in an electron microscope, the electrons are accelerated to a high speed. So when an electron hits a gas molecule, it's a collision between a fast-moving electron and a much slower (in comparison) gas molecule.

But how does that affect the gas molecule's movement? Well, the collision could transfer some kinetic energy or momentum to the gas molecule. But wait, the gas molecules are already in the vacuum, so their mean free path is determined by their own interactions, not necessarily by the electron beam.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about electron scattering. The electron beam is being scattered by the gas molecules. So the presence of gas molecules shortens the mean free path of the electrons, making the electron beam less collimated. But the question is about the gas molecules' mean free path, not the electrons'.

Wait, the question says that Mike determined the mean free path of the gas molecules. So initially, without the electron beam, the gas molecules have a mean free path λ1. But when the electron beam is on, the mean free path becomes λ2. So what's causing λ2 to be different?

Maybe the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to move more, or changing their effective cross-sectional area for collisions. Or perhaps the gas molecules are being heated by the electron beam, which would increase their thermal motion and thus decrease their mean free path. Because higher temperature increases λ, wait, no— actually, the mean free path depends inversely on pressure as well as the square root of temperature. Wait, no, from the formula λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d²*P). So if temperature increases, λ increases. But the problem states that the sample compartment's temperature remained the same, so T is the same.

Wait, but the presence of the electron beam might cause local heating of the gas molecules. Let me think: high-energy electrons can transfer energy to the gas molecules through collisions. If the gas molecules get heated, their temperature increases locally. But the problem says the overall temperature remained the same. Hmm, perhaps the temperature of the entire compartment is controlled, so the gas's average temperature doesn't change. But maybe the electrons cause some other effect.

Wait another angle: in the presence of the electron beam, the gas molecules may become ionized. Ions have an electric charge, which could affect their behavior. So charged particles (ions) would experience electric forces. But in the vacuum of the TEM, there are electric fields due to the lenses and other components that focus the electron beam. So maybe the ions are accelerated by these fields, moving them around more. That could cause the gas ions to have a different mean free path.

Alternatively, the presence of the electron beam might cause the gas to become a plasma. But with ultra-high vacuum, the density is so low that the plasma effects are minimal, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be knocked out of the compartment. Wait, but the vacuum pumps are running, so gas is being pumped out. But if the electron beam is somehow causing gas to be released or something else, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to be more mobile. Like, the collisions with the electrons give them enough energy to move more, perhaps even causing them to be removed from the compartment. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the mean free path of the gas molecules is calculated based on their own interactions. So if the gas molecules are now charged, does that affect how often they collide with each other?

Wait, when gas molecules are neutral, their collisions are based on their neutral cross-sections. But when they become ions, perhaps their cross-sectional area for collisions changes. If the ions have an electric charge, their cross-section might be different because they could interact with each other through Coulomb forces rather than just via elastic collisions.

Wait, but Coulomb interactions are long-range compared to the van der Waals forces for neutral molecules. So in a gas at very low pressure, the mean free path is determined by the average distance between molecules. So if the ions are repelling each other, maybe the effective cross-section for collisions decreases. Because the ions might be less likely to collide because they repel each other. Alternatively, maybe the cross-section increases because the charged particles have a larger effective size due to their charge cloud.

Hmm, not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ionization causes the gas to become a plasma, which affects the mean free path.

Wait, another approach: the mean free path λ is inversely proportional to pressure. Since the pressure is the same, and temperature is the same, λ should remain the same. But in this case, Mike observes λ2, which is different from λ1. So why?

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam affects the pressure of the gas in the compartment. Because the electron beam is causing gas molecules to be ionized and perhaps pumped away more efficiently. But if the vacuum pumps are already working, maybe the pumping rate is so efficient that the pressure doesn't change much, but the beam's effect could cause a slight change.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be more likely to scatter electrons, which might increase the rate at which the gas is being pumped out. But I'm not sure how that would affect the gas's own mean free path.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam is causing the gas to become a charged gas, which affects the way the vacuum pumps work. But that seems a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to be more mobile, leading to a higher effective pressure in the compartment. But wait, the pressure is already ultra-low. If the gas's own movement is altered, but the pressure is the same, λ should stay the same. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to be heated. For instance, the gas molecules might be absorbing energy from the electron beam, which would increase their kinetic energy. But wait, the problem states that the sample compartment's temperature remained the same. So perhaps the temperature of the gas molecules isn't changing, but the beam's energy is being absorbed elsewhere.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible options and see if I can reason which would make sense.

The options are:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1

B) λ2 = λ1, discrepancy

C) λ2 < λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1

So, what's the relationship between λ1 and λ2?

In the initial condition (no beam), the gas is neutral. With the beam on, gas becomes ionized.

Wait, when the gas is ionized, the mean free path could change. Because ions have different properties. But why would that affect their mean free path?

Wait, perhaps when the gas is ionized, the ions interact with the vacuum chamber walls. But the vacuum is ultra-high, so the walls are probably at a high temperature and the ions might not stick. Or perhaps the ions are repelled from the walls, leading to a longer mean free path.

Alternatively, maybe the ionized gas has a higher cross-section for collisions because the ions can attract or repel each other more than neutral molecules, leading to more frequent collisions and thus a shorter mean free path.

Wait, but in a plasma, the mean free path can be longer because the charged particles can move more freely. But that's in a plasma where the electrons are free to move, but in this case, it's a very low pressure, so the plasma is weak.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be more likely to collide with the walls of the sample compartment, thus reducing their mean free path. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another angle: the mean free path of the gas is λ1. But when the electron beam is on, the electrons are scattering off the gas molecules. The presence of these scattering events might cause the gas molecules to move in a different way, or perhaps the gas's distribution is altered.

Alternatively, maybe the electrons cause the gas molecules to be accelerated, so their average speed increases. Because the mean free path λ = (average speed) * (mean time between collisions). So if the average speed increases, λ would increase, assuming the time between collisions stays the same.

Wait, but the average speed is related to temperature. If the temperature is the same, the average speed shouldn't change. So that's probably not the case.

Wait, but if the gas is ionized, the ions might have a different effective mass or different speed distribution. Because ionized gas might have a higher mass or different way of moving.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to become more rarified in some regions, effectively reducing the pressure locally, thereby increasing λ. But if the overall pressure is the same, maybe that's not the case.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the ions are being accelerated by the electric fields, causing them to move faster, effectively increasing their mean speed and thus their mean free path. But I'm not sure if the overall pressure would change.

Wait, but the pressure is a measure of the number of particles per unit volume multiplied by their average kinetic energy. If the ions are moving faster due to being accelerated by the beam's electric fields, their kinetic energy increases, which would require a decrease in the number density to keep the same pressure. But if the number density decreases, that would increase the mean free path.

But wait, the mean free path formula is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d²*P). Let's see, if P is pressure, and T increases, λ increases. But in our case, T remains the same. However, if the ions are moving faster due to acceleration, their kinetic energy is higher, so T would increase. But the problem states that the sample compartment's temperature remains the same, so perhaps the overall T doesn't change. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ions are more mobile and thus have a longer mean free path. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

But that would make option A or D.

Wait, another thought: the presence of the electron beam could cause gas molecules to be more ionized, leading to a reduction in the mean free path because the ions might interact more with the walls or other structures, perhaps. Or perhaps the ions have a lower mean free path because of Coulomb interactions, causing more frequent collisions and thus a shorter λ.

But I'm not certain. Let me think about the mean free path equation again.

The formula is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) * π * d² * P). So at a given T and P, λ depends on d, the molecular diameter. If ionization causes the effective diameter to change, that would change λ.

Wait, when a gas is ionized, the ions have an effective diameter that's larger than neutral molecules because of their charge. Or maybe it's the same? I'm not sure. Alternatively, the ions could have a larger cross-sectional area for collisions because of their charge cloud. So if d increases, λ decreases.

Because λ is inversely proportional to d squared. So if d increases, λ drops. So if the gas becomes ionized and d becomes larger, λ2 would be less than λ1.

So in that case, λ2 < λ1, which would make option C the answer.

But why would the diameter increase upon ionization? Well, ions have an electron charge, so their effective cross-section could be larger because of the electric field around them. So when two ions come close, the electric repulsion would cause them to have a larger effective diameter for collisions. So each collision is more likely to happen because the cross-section is larger, leading to shorter mean free path.

Wait, no. Wait, the cross-section is the area that a molecule presents for collisions. If the molecule is charged, the effective cross-section could be larger because the ions would interact at a longer range. So the same number of molecules in a given volume would lead to more frequent collisions, hence a shorter mean free path. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

So in that case, the correct answer would be option C: λ2 < λ1.

Alternatively, perhaps the ionization doesn't significantly change the cross-section, so λ remains about the same. But the problem states that Mike noticed a change, so option B is incorrect.

Another possibility: the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to be more ionized, leading to more frequent collisions between ions and electrons, but that might not affect the gas's own mean free path.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes gas molecules to be more likely to stick to the walls, thus effectively reducing the pressure in the compartment, leading to a longer mean free path. But the problem says the pressure remained the same, as detected by the mass spectrometer. Hmm.

Wait, if the mass spectrometer detects the same pressure, then the number density hasn't changed. So if the pressure is the same, and temperature is same, the mean free path should remain λ1. But Mike observed a different mean free path, which suggests that his method of calculation might have changed. But the question says he accurately determined λ1, so the change must be real.

Hmm, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to break down into smaller molecules or fragments. So if the gas molecules are smaller, their diameter d is smaller, leading to a larger mean free path. So λ2 would be greater than λ1, making option A or D the answer.

But the problem doesn't mention any decomposition of the gas molecules, so that might not be the case.

Wait, another angle: in the presence of the electron beam, the gas molecules are being bombarded and perhaps are more likely to undergo elastic or inelastic collisions with each other. But how would that affect the mean free path?

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam causes the gas to become a plasma, which has a different behavior. In a plasma, the mean free path can be longer because the electrons are free to move, so the ions might have longer paths. But in a low-density plasma, the mean free path could be longer.

But I'm not certain. Another thought: perhaps the electrons are causing the gas to become a better conductor, which affects the way the gas molecules move. But the main point is the mean free path of the gas molecules, which depends on their own density and how often they collide.

Wait, another possibility: the electron beam may cause the gas molecules to be accelerated, leading to a higher average speed. If speed increases, the mean free path λ would increase because λ = (average speed) * (mean time between collisions). So if speed goes up, λ increases.

But wait, the mean time between collisions depends on the pressure and temperature. If the pressure is the same, and temperature is same, the mean time between collisions would be the same. So if average speed goes up, λ increases.

But why would the average speed of the gas molecules increase? The electron beam has a high energy. When it collides with a gas molecule, perhaps it imparts some of its kinetic energy to the gas molecule, making it move faster. But in an ultra-high vacuum, the gas molecules are already moving at thermal speeds determined by the temperature.

Wait, but in the presence of the electron beam, the gas molecules could be gaining energy from the beam, thus increasing their kinetic energy. But if that's the case, the temperature of the gas would increase, which would require that the mean free path increases (since λ increases with T). However, the problem says the sample's temperature remains the same. So perhaps the gas's temperature doesn't change enough to affect λ, but the beam adds energy in a way that affects their motion.

Alternatively, maybe the ionized gas molecules have a different effective mass, which would change their speed at the same temperature. But I'm not certain about that.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to summarize:

- Initially, λ1 is based on P, T, and d.
- With the electron beam, gas becomes ionized, leading to possible changes in d (effective diameter), or other factors.

If ionization causes d to increase, λ decreases → λ2 < λ1 (option C).

If ionization causes d to decrease, λ increases → λ2 > λ1.

But which is more likely? I think ionization leads to larger effective cross-sections because of the charge. So d would be effectively larger, making λ2 smaller.

Alternatively, perhaps the ionization leads to a change in the types of collisions. Neutral molecules collide elastically, but ions might have different collision dynamics, possibly leading to more frequent collisions and a shorter λ.

So that would point to option C: λ2 < λ1.


The question involves understanding the effect of an electron beam on the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environment. Initially, Mike calculates the mean free path, λ1, based on the pressure, temperature, and molecular diameter of the gas. However, upon activating the electron beam, he observes a new mean free path, λ2, which differs from λ1.

The mean free path, λ, is determined by the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{k T}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 P}
\]

where \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, \(T\) is the temperature, \(d\) is the molecular diameter, and \(P\) is the pressure. In this scenario, the pressure (\(P\)) and temperature (\(T\)) remain constant, so any change in λ must arise from a change in the effective molecular diameter (\(d\)) or other factors influenced by the electron beam.

When the electron beam is activated, the gas molecules become ionized. Ionization alters the effective cross-sectional area of the molecules due to the electric fields surrounding the ions. This increase in effective diameter (\(d\)) leads to more frequent collisions between gas molecules, thereby reducing the mean free path. As a result, λ2 becomes smaller than λ1.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A (\(λ2 \geq 1.22λ1\))**: This implies that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1, which is inconsistent with the reasoning that ionization reduces the mean free path.
- **Option B (\(λ2 = λ1\))**: This suggests no change in the mean free path, but the problem explicitly states that Mike observed a change, making this option incorrect.
- **Option C (\(λ2 < λ1\))**: This aligns with the reasoning that ionization increases the effective molecular diameter, leading to more frequent collisions and a shorter mean free path.
- **Option D (\(λ1 < λ2 < 1.22λ1\))**: This implies an increase in the mean free path, which contradicts the expected effect of ionization.

Thus, the correct conclusion is that λ2 is smaller than λ1 due to the ionization of gas molecules and the resulting increase in their effective diameter.

Answer: C
