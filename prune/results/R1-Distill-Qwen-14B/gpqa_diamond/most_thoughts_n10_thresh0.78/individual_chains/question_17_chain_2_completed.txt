Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

The problem says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The temperature is 25°C, and the pH is ideal, so I don't think I have to worry about pH affecting the EDTA's protonation state. 

Wait, what's the formula for the formation constant? Oh right, the formation constant K_f is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−, and K_f is [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). 

But wait, the problem gives me K_Ca-EDTA as 5e10. I think that's the same as K_f. So in this case, the complex is at 0.02 M. Since the solution is stoichiometric, that means the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. 

Now, I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions. So the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−, but because K_f is so large, the dissociation is minimal. So the concentration of free Ca²+ should be very low. 

Let me denote the concentration of Ca²+ as 'x'. Similarly, the concentration of EDTA^4− would also be 'x' because the reaction is 1:1. 

So using the formation constant expression:

K_f = [CaEDTA²−] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]) 

Plugging in the numbers:

5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x) 

So 5e10 = 0.02 / x² 

Solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) 

Calculating that, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/(5))e-12, which is 0.4e-12, or 4e-13. 

So x squared is 4e-13, which means x is the square root of that. The square root of 4e-13 is 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, let me compute that correctly. 

Wait, sqrt(4e-13) = sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) → 2 * 1e-6.5. Hmm, but 1e-6.5 is the same as 1e-6 * 1e-0.5. Because 1e-6.5 = 1e-6 * sqrt(1e-1) → 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7. 

Wait, that doesn't match any of the options. Let me double-check. Oh wait, looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That seems to fit. 

Wait, but wait a second. Let me recheck the arithmetic. 

x² = (0.02) / (5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12. Square root of 0.4e-12 → sqrt(0.4) is about 0.632. So 0.632e-6, which is 6.32e-7 M. Yeah, so that's option C. 

I think I got that right. So the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The equilibrium constant expression is:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Let the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions be \(x\). Since the dissociation is minimal, the concentration of \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) is also \(x\), and the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]\) is approximately 0.02 M. Substituting these values into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{0.4 \times 10^{-12}} = \sqrt{0.4} \times 10^{-6} \approx 0.632 \times 10^{-6} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.
