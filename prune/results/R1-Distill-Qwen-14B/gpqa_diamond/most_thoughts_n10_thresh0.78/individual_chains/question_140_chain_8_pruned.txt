Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read through it again and see what I can figure out. 

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons, which probably means it's something like H2O or CO2, but wait, H2O has 2 H and 1 O. For that, the molecule's total would be 2+ (1 O with 8 protons and 8 neutrons?), wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

The reaction also forms a precipitate G, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K. Hmm, 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. What substances have a melting point near there? Maybe something like ice, but no, ice melts at 273 K. Wait, 277 is a bit higher. Maybe another compound, like maybe something that's a solid but melts just above that. Alternatively, maybe B is something else. Let me think.

The other part mentions a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. Keto acids are like ketones with a carboxylic acid group, so maybe something like acetoacetic acid. When they react with X, which might be a base or something else.

Wait, X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope. So perhaps X is a compound where one element is replaced by a heavier isotope. Maybe like Cl being replaced by a heavier one, but I'm not sure yet.

So the first part of the reaction: X reacts with Y to give W and G. G is a precipitate, so it's probably an insoluble compound. When G is heated, it releases B. I'm thinking that G might be a carbonate, which upon heating (like decomposing) would release CO2 and maybe a metal oxide. Wait, but if W is a gas, that could be CO2. Because CO2 has 12 (for C) + 16*2 = 44 g/mol. Wait, but the question says W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Let me calculate that.

Each atom in W has the same number of protons and neutrons. So each atom has p = n. So for example, hydrogen (p=1, n=0?), no, wait, hydrogen has one proton and usually a neutron only if it's deuterium. Wait, no, H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons for H-1. So each atom's protons and neutrons are equal. So possible atoms could be something like carbon-12 (p=6, n=6), oxygen-16 (p=8, n=8), nitrogen-14 (p=7, n=7), etc. But the molecule could be made up of these atoms.

Wait, if W is a molecule where each atom has equal protons and neutrons, then possible options are CO2? Wait, no. Let's think: For CO2, each C atom has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (if it's C-12), and each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (O-16). So each atom in CO2 satisfies p = n. So the molecule is CO2, which has 1 C and 2 O atoms. So that's a possibility. So gas W is CO2.

So if gas W is CO2, then reaction between X and Y produces CO2 and precipitate G. So what's Y? Y is a liquid. Common liquids that react to produce CO2 include water, maybe acids, or perhaps something else.

Wait, another possibility is that Y is sulfuric acid, but that might produce SO2 or something else. Alternatively, if Y is a carbonate, maybe reacting with an acid. Wait, but then if X is a metal, perhaps X is reacting with an acid to produce CO2, but that seems a bit unclear.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the precipitate G. When heated, it releases B, whose melting point is near 277 K. What's 277 K in Celsius? Approximately 4°C. So what solid has a melting point around there? Maybe something like ammonium chloride? No, that's higher. Ice melts at 273 K, which is 0°C. Wait, 277 is about 4°C. Could B be something that's
