Okay, so I have this chemistry question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about two chemists talking, and one says his compounds are "on top of each other." I need to figure out what that means in a chemistry context.

Hmm, the options are A, B, C, D. Let me think about what each option implies.

Option A says the compounds have similar polarities. Well, similar polarity would mean they might mix well together in a solvent, but how does that make them "on top of each other"? Maybe if they have similar polarities, they could have stronger interactions, but I'm not sure.

Option B is about non-covalent or van der Waals interactions. Non-covalent interactions include things like hydrogen bonds, dipole-dipole interactions, and London dispersion forces. If compounds have such interactions, they might stick together. So if the compounds are sticking to each other, that could cause them to be on top of each other, perhaps not separating properly in a reaction or during purification.

Option C refers to similar boiling points. If the compounds have similar boiling points, it might affect their separation during distillation. But the question is about the compounds being "on top of each other," which sounds more like a physical sticking together rather than a separation issue.

Option D is about similar optical rotations. Optical rotation relates to how compounds rotate plane-polarized light. Similar optical rotations don't directly cause physical sticking; it's more about their chirality and how they affect light.

Wait, the phrase "on top of each other" probably refers to the compounds physically sticking together. Like, maybe in a column chromatography or during crystallization, if the compounds have strong interactions, they might not separate and instead form a single layer or pile up.

So why would they stick together? Non-covalent interactions would cause that. Like, maybe they have hydrogen bonding or dipole-dipole interactions, causing them to aggregate. So the second chemist's compounds are sticking together because of such interactions. That would lead to them not separating as intended, perhaps leading to poor separation in a chromatography setup or difficulty in isolating them.

So looking back at the options, B seems to fit. The compounds are bonding through non-covalent or van der Waals interactions, which are weaker than covalent bonds but can cause molecules to stick together. That would explain the 'on top of each other' situation.

Wait, but van der Waals includes London dispersion, dipole-dipole, and hydrogen bonds. So if the compounds have these interactions, they might not separate easily, leading to being on top.

So the correct answer should be B. The compounds are interacting through non-covalent forces, making them stick together.


The phrase "my compounds are on top of each other" suggests that the compounds are physically sticking together, likely due to interactions between them. Among the options, non-covalent or van der Waals interactions (Option B) are the most plausible explanation. These interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, dipole-dipole interactions, or London dispersion forces, can cause molecules to aggregate and stick together, preventing proper separation. This aligns with the idea of compounds being "on top of each other." Other options, like similar polarities (Option A), similar boiling points (Option C), or similar optical rotations (Option D), do not directly explain the physical sticking behavior described.

Answer: B
