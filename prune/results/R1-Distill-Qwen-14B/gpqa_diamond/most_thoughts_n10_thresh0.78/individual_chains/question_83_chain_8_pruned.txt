Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again.

The question says we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and we have to choose the right one.

Wait, I remember that when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes because the volume increases. So the initial step is to find the new concentration of acetic acid after dilution.

Okay, the initial volume is 20 cm³, and the concentration is 0.05 M. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the new concentration (C2) can be found using M1V1 = M2V2.

So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2. Plugging in the numbers, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, and V2 is 40 cm³. So 0.05 * 20 = 1 mmol, and 1 mmol /40 cm³ is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. At equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid initially.

Wait, but for the equivalence point, we have to calculate the moles. Let me think. The diluted solution is 0.025 M in acetic acid, and the volume is 40 cm³. So moles of acetic acid = 0.025 * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

Since the NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed to reach equivalence would be (moles NaOH) = 0.001 mol. So volume V = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. Hmm, but wait, the question is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. So 25% of the way to equivalence.

Wait, 25% of the equivalence volume. Since equivalence is 10 cm³, 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So at 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

So first, let's tackle the 25% titration point. At this point, part of the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate.

The initial concentration after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid in 40 cm³. Then, adding 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M
