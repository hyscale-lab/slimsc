Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me see if I can work through it step by step.

The problem has three reactions, A, B, and C, and I need to figure out what each product is from the given options. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different possibilities for A, B, and C.

First, I'll tackle each part one by one. Let's start with reaction A.

Reaction A: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol in the presence of H+ and heat. Hmm, okay. I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements often involve the shift of a pi bond to a sigma bond, and these are usually pericyclic reactions, like electrocyclic or sigmatropic shifts.

Wait, but what's 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine? Its structure is an ethanamine where the nitrogen is attached to two methoxy groups. So it's like CH2-N(OCH3)2. And but-3-en-2-ol is an allylic alcohol; the structure is CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2? Wait, no. But-3-en-2-ol: the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3? Let me draw it. The molecule is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2=CH-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, wait. But-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, but-3-en-2-ol: the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, no, buten- has four carbons. Oh wait, but-3-en-2-ol: that would be CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2? No, maybe it's CH2=CHCH(OH
