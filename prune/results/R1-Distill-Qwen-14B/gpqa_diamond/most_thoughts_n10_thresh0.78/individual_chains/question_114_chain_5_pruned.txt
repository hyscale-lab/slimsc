Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question involves two reactions, and I need to choose the correct reagents from the options given. The reactions are:

1. Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.
2. The product from the first reaction, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, reacts with reagent B and water to produce 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are combinations of reagents A and B, and I need to pick the correct pair.

First, I'll try to understand each reaction separately.

Starting with the first reaction: Butan-2-one (which is methylacetone, (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)C(O)CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So it's (CH3)2C=O. When that reacts with NaCN, which is a nucleophile, I think it's a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group. So the mechanism would be the ketone reacting with cyanide.

Wait, but wait. When ketones react with HCN, they form cyanohydrins. But here, the reagent is NaCN. So NaCN in some conditions, perhaps with acid or base.

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write the structure. The nitrile group (-CN) is on a carbon that also has a hydroxyl (-OH) and a methyl group, and another group. Wait, the structure would be CH2-C(OH)(CN)-CH2CH3? Or maybe (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Wait, let me see.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Reacting with CN- would add to the carbonyl. So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but butanenitrile would have four carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the nitrile is on carbon 1? No, wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the structure would be something like CH2CH(OH)CH2CN? Or maybe (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. Wait, but the name is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the nitrile is on carbon 1, hydroxyl and methyl on carbon 2, and then two more carbons? Wait, but butanenitrile is four carbons, right? So the structure would be CH2CH(CH2CN)OH? No, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give a cyanohydrin. The general reaction is ketone + HCN â†’ cyanohydrin. But here, the reagent is NaCN, which is a source of CN- ions. So perhaps the reaction is in an acidic or basic condition.

Wait, but when you add HCN to a ketone, it forms a cyanohydrin. The reaction is typically done under acidic conditions. So maybe the reagent A is H3O+ (acid). Alternatively, if the reaction is under basic conditions, perhaps with some other reagent.

Wait, but in the first reaction, the product is a cyanohydrin. So butan-2-one reacting with NaCN (which provides CN-) in the presence of acid
