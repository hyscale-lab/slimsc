Okay, so I've got this problem about spins and partition functions. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So, the system has three spins, S1, S2, S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. 

Wait, partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-beta E), right? Beta is 1/(kT). So, each state contributes a term based on its energy.

But how many possible states are there? Since each spin has two options, the total number should be 2^3 = 8. Right, so there are 8 possible states. I'll need to calculate the energy for each state and then compute Z as the sum of e^(-beta E) for each.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states. Let me think about the possible values of the energy expression.

The energy E is -J times the sum of the products of spins. Let me denote the sum as S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. So E = -J * S. 

Each term S1S2 can be either +1 or -1. Wait, but maybe I can find the possible values of S. Let's see.

Alternatively, since each spin is Â±1, S1S2 will be 1 if S1 and S2 are the same, and -1 otherwise. So the sum S is the sum of all three pairs. 

But wait, for three spins, how does the sum S behave? Let me think about different cases.

Another approach: perhaps find the possible values of S and how many states correspond to each S. That way, I can multiply each e^(-beta E) by the number of states with that energy.

So E = -J S, so the exponent in the partition function becomes beta J S, because e^(-beta E) = e^{beta J S}.

Wait, because E is -J S. So -beta E = beta J S. So each term is e^{beta J S}.

So for each possible value of S, compute how many states have that S, then multiply each by e^{beta J S} and sum them all.

So what are the possible values of S?

Let me think: when all three spins are the same. Let's say all +1: S1=S2=S3=+1.

Then S1S2 = 1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. So S = 3.

If two are +1 and one is -1: let's say S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
