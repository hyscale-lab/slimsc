Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. But let's try to break it down step by step. 

Alright, the problem is about some mixtures undergoing reactions, and I need to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X. The options are A to D, so I guess I'll have to figure out which one is correct.

Let me read the problem again carefully.

So, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Hmm, when something decolorizes bromine water, it usually means it's reacting with it, like an addition reaction. Substances that can do that are typically alkenes (unsaturated) because they have double bonds which react with bromine. Alternatively, maybe something like benzene rings with multiple bonds could also cause this, but I'm not sure.

Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum when heated, a new mixture Y forms through a disproportionation reaction. Disproportionation is when an element in a compound is both oxidized and reduced. So, for example, maybe something like H2O turning into O2 and H2 in some conditions. But in this case, it's a mixture Y of two liquids that don't decolorize bromine water. So, Y's components don't have double bonds anymore? Or maybe they're saturated.

Hydrogenation of both X and Y with platinum under severe conditions gives only one substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon. Z's mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. I remember that mass percent is (mass of H / molar mass) * 100. So let me compute that first.

Wait, 14.28% is roughly 1/7, because 14.28 is about 100/7 (since 100/7 ≈14.2857). So 14.28% is approximately 1/7. So the mass percent of H is 1/7. Let me think: the molecule would have a formula where the ratio of H to the rest is 1/6, because if mass of H is 1/7, the rest is 6/7, which is C and other atoms. But wait, since it's a hydrocarbon, it's only C and H.

So, the formula would be CHn. The mass of H is (n/(12 + n)) * 100 = 14.28% approximately.

Wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let's set up the equation. Let the formula be CxHy. The mass fraction of H is (y * 1) / (12x + y) * 100 = 14.28.

So, (y) / (12x + y) = 0.1428. Let's solve for this.

Multiply both sides by denominator: y = 0.1428*(12x + y)
y = 0.1428*12x + 0.1428*y
y - 0.1428 y = 1.7136 x
y (0.8572) = 1.7136 x
y = (1.7136 / 0.8572) x
Calculating 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2 (because 0.8572 * 2 ≈ 1.7144, which is close to 1.7136). So y ≈ 2x.

So the formula is approximately CxH2x. So it's of the form CH2, CH4, C2H4, etc. But wait, the problem states that Z is a constituent of mixture Y and is widely used as a solvent. Hmm, that makes me think of something like hexane or heptane, but wait, hexane's hydrogen mass is (14)/(86) ≈16.27%, which is higher than 14.28%. Alternatively, let's think about ethane.

Wait, ethane is CH2CH3, but that's C2H6. Let's compute its hydrogen mass. (6 * 1)/(24 +6) =6/30=0.2 → 20%. That's higher than 14.28. So not that. How about butane: C4H10. H mass is 10/(58) ≈17.24%, still higher.

Wait, maybe it's cyclohexane? C6H12. 12/(78) ≈15.38% → 15.38%, which is close to 14.28 but not exact. Hmm, maybe it's another structure.

Wait, maybe the calculation is more precise. Let me re-do the calculation.

We have (y / (12x + y)) = 0.1428 → y = 0.1428 * (12x + y)

y = 1.7136 x + 0.1428 y → y - 0.1428 y =1.7136 x → y (0.8572) =1.7136 x → y = (1.7136/0.8572 )x ≈ (2.0 x). Hmm, so 2.0 x. So y=2x. So maybe exactly 2x. So the formula is C_x H_{2x}.

Which hydrocarbons have H: 2x? Let's see:

For x=1: CH2 → but that's not possible; CH2 can't exist as a molecule. Maybe x=2: C2H4. Let's compute H%. (4)/(24 +4) =4/28=14.2857% → exactly 14.28%!

Oh! So that's it. So the formula is C2H4, but wait, C2H4 is ethylene, which is an alkene. But the problem says that Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. But ethylene would react with hydrogen in hydrogenation. Wait, but wait, the problem says hydrogenation of both X and Y gives only Z. So, perhaps Z is ethane? Because ethane is C2H6.

Wait, but earlier calculation gave that Z is C2H4, but that gives H% of 14.28, which matches, but ethane (C2H6) has H% of (6)/(30)=20%. That doesn't match. So maybe Z is C2H4? But why then would hydrogenation give only Z?

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says that Z is a constituent of mixture Y. So, Y is a mixture resulting from the disproportionation of X. So, X is a mixture of two alkenes, perhaps, and Y is a mixture that includes Z. But when X is hydrogenated, it gives Z. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because hydrogenation usually adds H2 across double bonds, turning alkenes into alkanes. So if X is a mixture of alkenes, hydrogenation would give alkanes.

Wait, let me try to figure out what's happening here.

Mixture X: equimolar two liquids that decolorize bromine → likely alkenes.

When X is treated with Pt and heated → undergoes disproportionation to form Y, which is a mixture of two liquids that don't decolorize bromine. So Y's components are saturated (no double bonds) because they don't react with bromine anymore.

Hydrogenation of X and Y under severe conditions gives only Z. So both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give the same product Z.

So, what's Z?

Z is a hydrocarbon with 14.28% H, which we determined is C2H4. Wait, but wait, that's an alkene, but then if X is a mixture of alkenes, hydrogenation would give alkanes. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, maybe Z is an alkane. Let me compute again. Suppose Z is C2H6.

Then, H mass is (6)/(30) = 20%, which doesn't fit
