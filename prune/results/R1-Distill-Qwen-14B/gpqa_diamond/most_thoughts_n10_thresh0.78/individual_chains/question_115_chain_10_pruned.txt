Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrons and positrons annihilating and producing photons. Hmm, I remember that when matter and antimatter particles annihilate, they produce photons. So in this case, an electron and a positron collide and produce two photons. 

The setup is: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate, producing two photons. The energies of both photons are the same, and their directions are such that one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Wait, Lorentz factors... Lorentz factor gamma is equal to 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for the electron, gamma_e is 4, and for the positron, gamma_p is 2.

I think I should calculate the total energy and momentum before and after the collision because energy and momentum must be conserved.

So before collision, the system consists of the electron and the positron. Let me model them as moving along the same line, but opposite directions. So the electron is moving to the right when considering the positron's frame, or maybe it's better to consider the lab frame where one is moving left and the other right.

Wait, the problem says the electron is moving from the left along the horizontal axis, and the positron from the right. So in the lab frame, the electron is moving to the right, and the positron is moving to the left? Or maybe the electron is moving to the left, and the positron is moving to the right? Wait, correction: the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left, so direction is towards the right. The positron is moving along the horizontal from the right, so direction is towards the left. So they're moving towards each other along the same axis.

Wait, but wait, the positron is moving from the right, so direction is towards the left, same as the electron is moving towards the right. So they are moving towards each other.

So in the lab frame, their velocities are opposite along the horizontal axis.

Wait, but I need to compute their total energy and momentum.

The rest mass energy of both is the same, since electron and positron have same mass. The rest mass energy is m*c², where m is the electron mass. Let's denote m_e as the mass.

So for the electron: energy is gamma_e * m_e c². Momentum is gamma_e * m_e v_e. But wait, the direction: since the electron is moving to the right, its momentum is positive, while the positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is negative.

Wait, but the positron has gamma_p=2. So let me compute the momenta.

Wait, but the
