Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the setup is that there are two planets in the same star system. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius and is in a circular orbit with a transit impact parameter of 0.2. The star it's orbiting has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. The orbital period of this first planet is 3 days.

The question is about finding the maximum orbital period of a second planet that has a radius 2.5 times Earth's. The second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the first one. The key here is that it should exhibit both transit and occultation events. I think transit happens when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, and occultation is when it passes behind the star, right?

Wait, but the question is about the maximum period. Hmm. I remember that for a planet to have a transit, the orbital plane must be aligned such that its path in front of the star is possible. The impact parameter has to be such that the planet actually crosses the line of sight to the star. But in this case, the first planet already transits, so the orbital plane is aligned for transits.

But the second planet needs to also transit, but the orbital period must be such that it can both transit and occult. Wait, occultation is when the planet is behind the star from our perspective. So, when the planet is directly behind the star, it's occulted. So for both events to occur, the orbital periods of the two planets must be such that their orbital positions are aligned in a way that both can happen.

Wait, no. Wait, the second planet needs to have both transit and occultation events. So, the orbital period of the second planet must allow it to sometimes be in front of the star (transit) and sometimes behind (occultation). How does that work with the orbital periods?

I think for this to happen, the second planet's orbital period must be a multiple of the first planet's period. Or perhaps it's about the ratio of their periods. Maybe it's about the synodic period, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: for the second planet to both transit and occult, it must orbit the star at a different orbital period, but so that their orbital positions are such that they can both pass in
