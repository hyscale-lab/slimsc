Okay, so I have this question about astronomy and redshift. Hmm, let's see. The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I need to find the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Wait, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet range for the quasar. But when it's absorbed by hydrogen clouds, it's called the Lyman-alpha forest. Right, so the absorption lines are observed in the spectrum of the quasar. But the issue here is whether these lines can be seen with optical telescopes.

Ground-based optical telescopes can't observe ultraviolet light because Earth's atmosphere absorbs UV. So the observed Lyman alpha line must be shifted into the optical range for it to be detected. So the redshift must be such that the wavelength is longer than about 300 nm, because optical wavelengths are roughly from 400 nm to about 700 nm. Wait, but waitâ€”no, actually, optical telescopes can see longer wavelengths. So the Lyman alpha line, which is 1216 Angstroms (which is 121.6 nm), needs to be redshifted into the optical range.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The quasar emits light, which passes through the neutral hydrogen clouds. These clouds cause absorption at the Lyman alpha wavelength of 1216 Angstroms. But if the cloud is moving away from us, the wavelength is stretched. So the observed wavelength lambda_obs is lambda_emit multiplied by (1 + z), where z is the redshift.

But the problem is that the quasar's light is being absorbed by intervening hydrogen. So the quasar itself is at some redshift z_quasar, and the hydrogen cloud is at a lower redshift, right? Wait, no, wait. The hydrogen clouds are in front of the quasar, so they are at a lower redshift than the quasar. So the quasar's light passes through the cloud, which is at some redshift z_cloud.

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit on the redshift of the objects. The objects here are the hydrogen clouds. Because if the cloud is too close (low
