Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay and the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, I remember that particle physics often involves things like proper lifetimes and decay lengths. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8e-16 seconds. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. We need to find the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The options are A to D, with various units of meters.

Wait, I think I remember that when a particle is moving at a certain speed, its lifetime can be dilated due to time dilation in special relativity. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. So from the lab frame (like the Bubble Chamber), the lifetime τ would be longer because of the Lorentz factor γ.

The decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. It's given by the product of the velocity (v), the dilated lifetime (τ), and maybe the speed of light? Oh right, because distance is velocity multiplied by time. So the formula for decay length L is L = v * γ * τ₀ * c, but wait, maybe I should think in terms of units.

Wait, no, let's get the formula right. The decay length L is calculated as L = v * γ * τ₀. Because the speed of light c is part of v, since v = βc. So actually, L = βc * γ τ₀.

But since γ is 1/√(1 - β²), and β is v/c, so L = (βγ c) τ₀. But wait, another way: since βγ can be written as (v/c) * γ, which is v * γ / c, but that's a bit messy. Alternatively, I think that βγ is actually equal to v * γ / c, but wait, perhaps it's easier to just consider that L = v τ, where τ is the dilated lifetime.

Wait, no, τ is γ τ₀, so L = v * τ = v * γ τ₀. And since v = βc, that's L = βc γ τ₀.

But how do I find β and γ? Oh, because the particle is moving at a certain energy. The energy E is given as 27 GeV, and the mass m is 3.41 GeV. So the total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy.

So E = γ m c². Wait, but units are in GeV, so E = γ m, since m is in GeV/c², but maybe it's better to think in terms of natural units where c=1. Hmm.

So, since E = γ m, then γ = E / m = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 27 / 3.41.

Let me calculate that: 3.41 times 7 is 23.87
