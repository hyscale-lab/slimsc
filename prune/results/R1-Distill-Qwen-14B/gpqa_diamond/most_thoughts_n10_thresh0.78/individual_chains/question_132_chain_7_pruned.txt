Okay, so I've got this NMR question here, and I'm a bit rusty on my spectroscopy, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about the 1H NMR spectrum of a solution that's a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds. The molecular formula is C10H14 for both. The spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each in a 1:1 ratio. Then there are three singlets at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are various tetramethylbenzenes and a diethylbenzene.

Hmm, starting with the aromatic region. The two singlets at ~6.7 ppm. In aromatic compounds, singlets typically mean that the protons are equivalent and not split by neighboring protons. So each singlet represents a set of equivalent aromatic protons.

Wait, but in substituted benzene rings, each proton's environment depends on the substituents. For instance, if the ring has multiple methyl groups, the protons can be in different environments, leading to different signals.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, let me draw that. 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl would have four methyl groups in positions 1,2,3,4. That leaves positions 5 and 6 with what? Wait, no, wait: benzene has six positions. So 1,2,3,4 would be four methyls in a row, and the other two positions (5 and 6) would be H. So in that case, the aromatic protons would be at positions 5 and 6. Wait, but if the substituents are at 1,2,3,4, positions 5 and 6 are adjacent to substituents.

Wait, in 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, positions 5 and 6 are each next to a methyl group. So, the aromatic protons at 5 and 6 would each have neighboring substituents. Are they equivalent?

Wait, in 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, the structure would be a benzene ring with four methyl groups in positions 1, 2, 3, 4. So the remaining positions are 5 and 6. Let me visualize:

Positions: 1 (methyl), 2 (methyl), 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), 5 (H), 6 (H). Wait, but that can't be right because the structure would be like a ring with four methyl groups on adjacent positions. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should number the positions correctly. Let's think of 1,2,3
