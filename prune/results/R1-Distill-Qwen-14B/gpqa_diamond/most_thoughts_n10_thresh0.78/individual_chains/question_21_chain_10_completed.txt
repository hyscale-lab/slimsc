Okay, so I have this chemistry question to tackle. Let's see what it's about. The question is about isomers and some specific compounds. Hmm, I remember isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. There are constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Oh right, stereoisomers include things like enantiomers and diastereomers, which are based on spatial arrangement rather than the actual connectivity of atoms.

The question has two parts: A and B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism. Let's break this down.

First, part A: Benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I need to figure out which one doesn't exhibit tautomerism. Tautomerism is when a compound can shift between different tautomeric forms, usually involving the movement of a hydrogen atom and the reorganization of double bonds, like in keto-enol tautomerism.

Benzoquinone: I'm a bit fuzzy on its structure. Wait, benzoquinone is a quinone derived from benzene. Quinones generally have two ketone groups. I think benzoquinone has two ketone groups opposite each other on a benzene ring. So structure would be a benzene ring with two ketone groups at para positions.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. Each ketone is on adjacent carbons? No, wait, the numbering is 1,3,5, so they're all alternating. So the ring has three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5, making it a symmetrical structure.

Now, which of these would show tautomerism? Tautomerism typically occurs in compounds with adjacent carbonyl groups or when there's a possibility for hydrogen shift to form an enol or keto form. 

Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups para to each other. Do they have any conjugated double bonds that could allow for tautomerism? Wait, benzoquinone is O=C6H4O, right? So each keto group is on the benzene ring. But for tautomerism, the compound would need a hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl. Benzoquinone's structure has the carbonyls as O attached to the ring, but in the para positions. Are there any hydrogens that could shift? Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, in benzoquinone, the structure is benzene with two ketone groups (O) at opposite positions. So each is attached to a carbon that's part of the aromatic ring. So those carbons are sp² hybridized. Do they have any hydrogens adjacent that could lead to tautomerism?

Wait, the carbonyl groups are at the para positions. So each O is attached to a carbon which is connected to two benzene carbons. So those carbons don't have any hydrogens attached because in a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to one hydrogen when it's a methyl group, but in this case, they're all part of the ring, so each of those carbons (positions 1 and 4, maybe) have two other ring carbons and one O. So they have O=C-C6H4-C(=O)-O? Or perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone is a diketone with the two carbonyl groups across from each other.

Wait, another thought: Tautomerism requires the presence of a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl group. In benzoquinone, each carbonyl is attached to a carbon that's part of the ring. So, for example, the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl would be another ring carbon, which might not have a hydrogen. So maybe benzoquinone doesn't have any alpha hydrogens because all the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring, which doesn't have hydrogens on those carbons.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, on the other hand, has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The structure would be a six-membered ring with three O double bonds. Wait, but cyclohexane is a six-membered ring with single bonds, so the trione would have three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. Each of these carbonyl carbons would be attached to the next carbon in the ring. So each carbonyl group is adjacent to another carbonyl. In such a case, each carbonyl carbon is next to another carbonyl, but are there any alpha hydrogens?

Wait, let's imagine the structure. Each of the three carbonyls is separated by two carbons. So, for example, position 1 is a ketone, position 3 is a ketone, which is two positions away. So each ketone is at every other carbon. When you have a cyclohexane ring with three ketones, each of those carbonyl carbons is connected to two other carbons in the ring. So the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two other carbons. Those adjacent carbons (the ones next to the ketone) are each single-bonded to two other carbons in the ring. So, do those adjacent carbons have hydrogens?

Yes, each of those adjacent carbons would have two hydrogen atoms. Because in a cyclohexane ring, each CH2 group has two H's. Wait, but in this case, the carbonyl carbons are C=O, so the next carbons would be CH2 groups if it's a trione.

Wait, no. Wait, let me think again. The structure of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring where every other carbon is a carbonyl group. So each of those carbons is C=O, and the neighboring carbons are each single-bonded to two other carbons. So each of those neighboring carbons would be CH2 groups. So the carbonyl carbons are C=O, and their adjacent carbons are CH2. So each of those adjacent CH2 groups has two H's.

So, in the case of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the carbonyl groups are spaced apart. Do they have any alpha hydrogens? Yes, because the adjacent carbons have Hs. So perhaps this compound could exhibit tautomerism if there's a possibility for enol formation. But wait, in a cyclic structure with three ketones, maybe the enol form is not possible because the ring is already conjugated?

Wait, another approach: tautomerism usually requires a keto and enol form. For that, you need a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl. Benzoquinone doesn't have any such hydrogens because the carbonyl groups are on the benzene ring, which is already conjugated, so maybe the adjacent carbons don't have Hs. So benzoquinone might not show tautomerism.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, on the other hand, has Hs adjacent to the carbonyl groups, so it could undergo tautomerism. Wait, but wait. Wait, another thought: in the case of 1,3,5-cyclohexane trione, the ring is fully conjugated, so any enol tautomer would require breaking the conjugation. Hmm, but perhaps the compound is such that it cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism because the structure is too rigid. Or maybe it's in a situation where the hydrogens are not in the right place for tautomerism.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think again. The ability to tautomerize depends on the presence of alpha hydrogens. Benzoquinone: No alpha hydrogens because the carbonyl groups are on the benzene ring, which is fully conjugated, so adjacent carbons are in a ring (so each is a CH group in the ring?), but wait, in a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to one hydrogen when it's a substitution. Wait, no, in benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are attached to the benzene carbons. So each of those carbonyl carbons is part of the benzene ring, making them sp² hybridized. So the adjacent carbons would be part of the ring. So for example, if a benzene ring has two carbonyl groups opposite each other, each is attached to a carbon that's bonded to two other ring carbons. So each of those carbons is like a C=O connected to two CH groups. Wait, no, the benzene ring is six-membered, each carbon is bonded to two others in the ring and one substituent. So in benzoquinone, each of those carbons (positions 1 and 4) is attached to an O and two CH groups, right?

Wait, no, maybe. Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone is a 1,4-diketone. So it's O=C-C6H4-C(=O)-O. But that can't be because the formula would be C6H4O2. So each of the two carbonyl carbons is part of the benzene ring. So in that structure, each carbonyl carbon is attached to two other benzene carbons and an O. So each of those carbonyl carbons is bonded to two CH groups in the ring.

Wait, but in that case, each of those CH groups (the ones adjacent to the carbonyl) would have a hydrogen. So for example, the carbonyl is at position 1 (O=C-C5H4-...), and the adjacent carbons are CH. So those CH groups have a hydrogen. So, in this scenario, would the compound have alpha hydrogens?

Yes, because the adjacent carbons have a hydrogen attached. So if benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens, it could undergo tautomerism. But wait, I thought benzoquinone is aromatic and doesn't have tautomerism. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone is more of an aromatic compound where the conjugation is too strong for tautomerism. Because in tautomerism, like in ketones, the enol form is conjugated, but if the molecule is already highly conjugated, maybe tautomerism isn't possible. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone doesn't have alpha hydrogens. Wait, let me think again: the structure of benzoquinone.

Benzoquinone can exist in two forms: para and ortho. Para is more common. In the para form, the two ketone groups are in the para positions of the benzene ring. Each ketone group is attached to a carbon that is part of the benzene ring. So each of those carbons (positions 1 and 4) have two adjacent ring carbons and an O. So each of those carbons is connected to two other ring carbons and the O. So the structure is O=C6H4O. Wait, no, the formula is C6H4O2. Each carbonyl is O=C- attached to the benzene ring.

In that structure, each ketone is at a position where the adjacent carbons are part of the ring. So each adjacent carbon is bonded to two others and has a hydrogen. So each of those adjacent CH groups would have a hydrogen. Thus, benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens and could potentially undergo tautomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. I thought that in some cases, certain compounds don't tautomerize because the structure doesn't allow it. For example, aromatic rings with substituents that prevent enol formation.

Alternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is the one that doesn't tautomerize. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, what's tautomerism again? It's a change in the position of hydrogen and the shift of double bonds. So in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which is a cyclic diketone, perhaps the structure is such that it doesn't have the necessary hydrogens for tautomerism.

Wait, no, wait. 1,3,5-cyclohexane trione would have three ketone groups, which are each attached to a CH2 group. Because in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons. So if positions 1,3,5 are carbonyls, then each of those carbons is C=O, and the other positions (2,4,6) are CH2 groups.

Wait, no, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring with single bonds. So in 1,3,5-trione, each of the three ketones is on every other carbon. So each is a C=O, and the adjacent carbons are CH2 groups. So each CH2 is adjacent to a ketone. So each CH2 has two hydrogens. So those are alpha hydrogens, so they can participate in tautomerism.

So cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has alpha hydrogens, so it can undergo tautomerism. But wait, does that make sense? Or maybe the structure is such that it's a fully conjugated system, so the enol form isn't possible.

Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone doesn't have any alpha hydrogens. Let me think about the structure again. Each of the carbonyl groups is on a carbon that's part of the benzene ring. So each of those carbons is double-bonded to O and connected to two CH groups in the ring. So the adjacent carbons (in the ring) are CH groups. So each has a hydrogen. Hence, benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens, which would allow for tautomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about specific examples. For instance, 1,4-cyclohexadione (which is cyclohexane-1,4-dione) can tautomerize. Because it has alpha hydrogens. Benzoquinone, being a benzene ring with two ketone groups, would have alpha hydrogens, so could tautomerize. But maybe benzoquinone is more rigid and doesn't undergo tautomerism as readily, or maybe it's not possible because the structure is already conjugated.

Alternatively, perhaps the actual answer is that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione cannot tautomerize. Let me think about the possibility of enol formation. In 1,3,5-trione, the carbonyl groups are at every other position, making the ring fully conjugated with three double bonds. If any hydrogen is alpha, it could shift, but in this case, each carbonyl is flanked by CH2 groups. Wait, no, earlier I thought that in 1,3,5-trione each ketone is adjacent to a CH2 group. So that CH2 would have two Hs, which are alpha to the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the trione can't tautomerize because the necessary conjugation isn't possible. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way.

Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone doesn't have any alpha hydrogens. Because in the benzene ring, each carbon with a carbonyl group is bonded to two other ring carbons, which themselves are double-bonded in the aromatic ring. So the adjacent carbons don't have any hydrogens. Wait, that can't be right because in a benzene ring, each CH is bonded to one H. So for benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are attached to carbons that are part of the ring, which each have one H.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the structure of benzoquinone. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups on the benzene ring. So each carbonyl is attached to a carbon that is part of the ring. Each of those carbons is double-bonded to O and connected to two other ring carbons. So each of those carbons (positions 1 and 4) would have the structure: C=O, connected to two other ring carbons, which would each be CH groups (since each ring carbon has one H).

So, the adjacent carbons (positions 2 and 6, for example) would be CH groups, each with a H attached. So those are alpha hydrogens, meaning benzoquinone can undergo keto-enol tautomerism.

But wait, if benzoquinone can tautomerize, then part A is looking for the compound that does NOT show tautomerism. So if cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't tautomerize, then A would be cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Wait, let me think again. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2- (but in a ring, so it's a six-membered ring). No, wait, that would be three carbonyls in positions 1,3,5. So each ketone is separated by a CH2 group. Each ketone is at a position, and the next position is a CH2 group. So in that case, each CH2 group is adjacent to a ketone, hence those CH2 groups have alpha hydrogens. So the compound should be able to tautomerize.

Wait, but wait a moment. For tautomerism, you need an H alpha to the carbonyl. So in this case, each CH2 has two Hs. So in theory, they can shift. But in a cyclic structure with three ketones, can tautomerism occur? Or is the ring too rigid?

Alternatively, perhaps the trione doesn't have any Hs alpha to the carbonyl because the adjacent carbons are part of the ring and don't have any Hs. Wait, that can't be right because in a cyclohexane ring, each CH2 group has two Hs.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should approach part B first and see if that helps.

Part B: Between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism. Optical isomerism is caused by chirality, which requires a molecule to have a non-superimposable mirror image. This usually involves a tetrahedral chiral center. Alternatively, it can also arise from other factors like axial chirality, but that's less common.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Let's draw its structure. It's the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure would be CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Alternatively, perhaps I have the structure wrong.

Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester where the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of propanoic acid. So the structure is: CH3-C(OH)H-CO-OCH3? No, wait. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon: CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Now, looking for chiral centers. The central carbon (second carbon) has OH, CH2COOCH3, and two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Let me count the substituents on the second carbon.

The second carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- OH group,

- CH2COOCH3 group (which is a CH2 connected to COOCH3),

- and two CH2 groups? No, wait, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the second carbon (the CH2 with OH) is actually a CH2 group. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. Wait, no. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the structure is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2(OH)
|
CH2

Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, the second carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- The first carbon (CH2),

- The third carbon (CH2COOCH3),

- An OH,

- And a hydrogen? Or is the second carbon a CH2?

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the second carbon is a CH2 group. Therefore, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, and the second carbon is CH2, which is connected to two CH2 groups, an OH, and a hydrogen. So the second carbon is a CH2(OH) group. Wait, but that can't be a chiral center because it's attached to two CH2 groups (from the first and third carbons), an OH, and a H. So it's attached to two identical groups (the two CH2 groups), making it not a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center and thus doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Let me visualize it. The second carbon is CH2(OH), so it's attached to:

- Two CH2 groups,

- OH,

- H.

So, substituents: two identical CH2 groups, OH, and H. So no, it's not a chiral center because two substituents are the same. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have optical isomerism.

Now, dimethyl fumarate: Fumaric acid is a dicarboxylic acid with two double bonds. Its structure is HOOCCH=CHCOOH. When you take the ester with two methyl groups, it becomes CH2COOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3. Alternatively, dimethyl fumarate is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3). Wait, no, fumaric acid is HO2CCH2CH2CO2H, but no, wait, fumaric acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H. So the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, no, wait, wait. No. Fumaric acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H. So when esterified with methanol, both -OH of the acid are replaced by -OCH3.

Thus, dimethyl fumarate is CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3). No, wait, more accurately, it's (Z) or (E) isomer? Wait, fumaric acid is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So dimethyl fumarate is the trans ester.

The structure is OCH2CH2?

Wait, no. Let me think again: Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no. Maleic acid is HO2CCHCH2CO2H with the double bond between the two CH groups. Fumaric acid is the trans version. So the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no, wait. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

Maleic acid is cis-butenedioic acid: HO2CCH=CHCO2H. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer: HO2CCH=CHCO2H, but the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, and the substituents (the two COOH groups) are on opposite sides.

So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester, so the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3)? No. Wait, no. Wait, the structure would be CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3)? No, wait, no. Wait, perhaps it's (E)-butenedioate dimethyl ester. The structure is CH2=CO(COOCH3)-CH2COOCH3? Hmm, perhaps it's better to think of it as CH2=CH(COOCH3)COOCH3. No, wait, perhaps the correct structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3? No, that's not right. Wait, wait, the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3. No, perhaps it's O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, no, the correct structure is:

Dimethyl fumarate is the ester of fumaric acid where both -COOH groups are esterified with methanol. So it's (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. The structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3). Wait, no, that would have a single bond. No, wait, the correct structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3) but with a double bond. Oh wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HOOCCH=CHCOOH. So dimethyl fumarate is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3)? No, that can't be because the double bond is between the two middle carbons.

Wait, the correct structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3. No, wait. Let me think again: the fumarate ion is CH2=CH(COO-)COO-. So dimethyl fumarate would be CH2=CH(COOCH3)COOCH3. So the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)-COOCH3. So the double bond is between the first and second carbons. The second carbon is connected to a COOCH3 group, and the third carbon is connected to another COOCH3 group. Wait, but that would require four carbons. Let me see: CH2=CH(COOCH3)-COOCH3. No, that's three carbons. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3 with a double bond, but that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3, which is the correct structure. So the molecule has a central double bond with two ester groups on either end.

Now, considering the possibility of optical isomerism. For a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center or some form of axial chirality, but the latter is less common. In dimethyl fumarate, are there any chiral centers?

Looking at the structure O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3. The two CH groups on either side of the double bond are each bonded to two COOCH3 groups and two Hs. Wait, no. Let me think: Each of the two middle carbons (connected by the double bond) has the following substituents.

The first CH is connected to:

- One COOCH3,

- The double bond,

- Two Hs.

Wait, no. Let me think of the structure as:

CH2-COOCH3
    \
C=C
    /
CH2-COOCH3

No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)COOCH3. No, this is getting too confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of dimethyl fumarate as (E)-dimethyl fumarate, which has a trans configuration across the double bond. Does this molecule have a plane of symmetry? If the molecule is symmetrical, then it won't have optical isomers.

Wait, if the two substituents on each end of the double bond are the same, the molecule might be symmetrical. Let's see: If each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group, then perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Wait, no, the double bond is between two carbons, each of which is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C(OCH3)CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3, but that's a single bond. No, the question states dimethyl fumarate, which is a diester of fumaric acid, which has a double bond.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach. Does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers? If the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3, then no, because all the carbons are either part of an ester group or a single bond. But if it's O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3, then each of the carbons in the double bond is attached to two substituents: one is the COOCH3 group and the other is a CH2 group (but that can't be right because that would make it a single bond).

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)COOCH3. Wait, that would imply that one end is CH2=CH(COOCH3) and the other is COOCH3, which doesn't make sense.

Another approach: The molecule might have a plane of symmetry. If the molecule is symmetrical, it can't have optical isomers. If it's not symmetrical, then it might have optical isomers.

In dimethyl fumarate, if the two substituents on either side of the double bond are the same, then the molecule is symmetrical. For example, if each double bond carbon has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry along the double bond. So it would be achiral and thus not exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. The structure of fumaric acid is HOOCCH=CHCOOH. So the diacid has two COOH groups on either end of the double bond. When esterified with methanol, both COOH groups become COOCH3. So dimethyl fumarate is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3). No, wait, that's not correct because the double bond is between the two middle carbons.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is O=C(OCH3)CH=CHCOOCH3. So each end of the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group, and each of the middle carbons is attached to a CH2 group. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, each of the middle carbons is attached to a CH group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3, but that's a single bond. No, no, the correct structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's not correct. Wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So when esterified, it's CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3? No, that's not right because it's a diacid.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is (E)-dimethyl fumarate: (E)-CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3. No, that doesn't make sense.

I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but perhaps I can reason based on symmetry. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. For dimethyl fumarate, if the two substituents on either end of the double bond are the same, the molecule is symmetrical. So in (E)-dimethyl fumarate, the substituents on either side of the double bond are COOCH3 and methyl groups. Wait, no, the substituents would be COOCH3 on each side.

Wait, if each of the two carbons in the double bond is bonded to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate would not exhibit optical isomerism.

But wait, another thought: if the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are not the same, then the molecule may lack a plane of symmetry and thus be chiral. For example, if one carbon is attached to COOCH3 and two CH2 groups, and the other is attached to COOCH3 and another group, then it's asymmetrical.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the possibility of a chiral center in dimethyl fumarate. If any carbon in the molecule has four different substituents, then it's a chiral center.

Looking at the structure: in dimethyl fumarate, the carbons are either part of the ester group (O=C-OCH3) or part of the double bond. The double bond is between two carbons, each of which is attached to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. Wait, perhaps each of these carbons is bonded to two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups, which would make them symmetrical. So each of those carbons is attached to two identical groups (two COOCH3 and two CH2?), but no, that's not the case.

Wait, let me think of the structure as O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3. But that's a single bond, so that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3. In that case, each of the CH groups in the double bond is connected to:

- One O=C(OCH3),

- One C(O)OCH3,

- Two Hs.

Wait, but that would make each CH group have two identical substituents (the two Hs), but the other two substituents are O=C(OCH3) and C(O)OCH3, which are the same on both ends in the trans configuration. So in (E)-dimethyl fumarate, each CH group has substituents O=C(OCH3) and C(O)OCH3, but on opposite sides. So each CH group is connected to:

- One O=C(OCH3),

- One C(O)OCH3,

- Two Hs.

But wait, for each CH group, the substituents are O=C(OCH3), C(O)OCH3, H, and H. So each has two Hs, which are identical. Thus, each CH group is attached to two identical substituents (two Hs), so they cannot be chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but that can't be right because I recall that dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate. Oh wait, no. Wait, maleic acid is the cis isomer, and fumaric acid is the trans. So the structures of dimethyl maleate and dimethyl fumarate are different. But do they have optical isomers?

Wait, dimethyl maleate is the cis ester, and dimethyl fumarate is the trans. Do these esters have any chiral centers? No, because as I thought earlier, each of the CH groups in the double bond is attached to two Hs and two identical groups (the two ester groups). Thus, they are not chiral centers. So dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but that can't be right because the question is asking which of the two compounds does show optical isomerism. So both possibilities: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't, and dimethyl fumarate doesn't. But that can't be, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me think again. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The second carbon (CH2) is attached to:

- CH2OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- Two Hs.

So substituents are CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, H, H. So it's not a chiral center because two substituents are H, which are identical. So no optical isomerism.

Dimethyl fumarate: as discussed, no chiral centers. So neither of them has optical isomerism? But that can't be, because the question says one does.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Another possibility is that I mixed up the structures. Let me think about dimethyl fumarate again. If the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3, then all the carbons are either part of the ester or in a single bond. That structure is symmetrical, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is O=C(OCH3)CH=CHCOOCH3. So the two central carbons are part of a double bond. Each of those carbons is attached to:

- One O=C(OCH3),

- One COOCH3,

- Two Hs.

Wait, no, that's not possible. Let me get this straight. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So when esterified, it's CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3? No, that's not right because the double bond is between the two CH groups. So the correct ester would be CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3, but that's a single bond.

No, I'm getting it wrong. Let me think of it as CH2=CH(COOCH3)COOCH3. But that's not correct because that would imply a single bond between the CH and the COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond between the first and second carbons. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3). No, that doesn't make sense because the second carbon would have three substituents: COOCH3, CH2(COOCH3), and two Hs. No, that can't be.

I'm really stuck on this. Let's try a different approach. I'll think about whether either of the two compounds can have a chiral center.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: as I discussed, no chiral center because the OH is on a CH2 group, which isn't a chiral center.

Dimethyl fumarate: does it have a chiral center? I don't think so, because the carbons in the double bond are each attached to two identical groups (like COOCH3 and another group), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether dimethyl fumarate has any stereogenic centers. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it won't have optical isomerism. If not, it might.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer for part B is that dimethyl fumarate does show optical isomerism. But earlier reasoning suggests that it doesn't.

Wait, another approach: maleic acid is a cis diacid, and fumaric acid is trans. Their esters would inherit the cis/trans geometry. However, in terms of optical isomerism, cis and trans are geometric isomers, not optical isomers. So dimethyl fumarate has a trans configuration but is not chiral because the molecule is symmetrical.

Wait, wait, but if the molecule is symmetrical, then it can't have optical isomerism. So perhaps dimethyl fumarate is achiral because of symmetry.

Wait, but then why would the question suggest that one of the two compounds shows optical isomerism? Unless I made a mistake in assessing part B.

Wait, perhaps methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does have a chiral center. Let me re-examine its structure.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, that's not correct. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOOCCH(OH)CH3? No, wait. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this molecule, the second carbon (the one with OH) is a CH2 group. So it's attached to:

- Two CH2 groups,

- OH,

- H.

So two substituents are the same (the two CH2 groups), so it's not a chiral center. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another thing: sometimes, even if a carbon isn't a chiral center, the molecule could have another form of chirality, like axial chirality, but that's more common in allenes or certain cyclic structures.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me think again: the formula is C3H6O3. Wait, no, methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the second carbon is CH2, which is not a chiral center.

Hmm. I'm stuck. If neither of the compounds shows optical isomerism, that can't be the case. So perhaps I made a mistake in part A.

Let me go back to part A. The question is which compound doesn't show tautomerism. The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

I thought benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens, but perhaps it doesn't. Let me think again. Benzoquinone's structure is O=C6H4O (para). Each of the carbonyl carbons is part of the benzene ring, so each is attached to two CH groups (from the ring). So each of those CH groups has a hydrogen. Therefore, benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens and can undergo tautomerism.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: the structure is a six-membered ring with three ketones. Each ketone is adjacent to a CH2 group, which has two hydrogens. So cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has alpha hydrogens and can tautomerize.

Wait, but then neither would not show tautomerism, which can't be. So perhaps one of them doesn't have alpha hydrogens.

Wait, another thought: in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the ring is fully conjugated with three double bonds. So the adjacent carbons to the ketones are sp² hybridized, not sp³. So they don't have hydrogens. So in that case, the compound wouldn't have any alpha hydrogens and thus can't tautomerize.

Ah, that makes sense! Because in the trione, the ring is fully conjugated, so the carbons adjacent to the ketones are part of the ring and are sp² hybridized. So they don't have any hydrogens attached, as sp² carbons are trigonal planar and have one lone pair in the p orbital, leaving no room for a hydrogen. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't have alpha hydrogens and can't undergo tautomerism.

On the other hand, benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens because the adjacent carbons are part of the benzene ring, which are sp² hybridized and have a hydrogen attached. So benzoquinone can tautomerize.

So for part A, the compound that doesn't show tautomerism is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. So A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Now, part B: which of the two compounds shows optical isomerism.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: no chiral center.

Dimethyl fumarate: no chiral center because each of the carbons in the double bond is attached to two identical groups, making the molecule symmetrical. So neither shows optical isomerism. But that can't be right because the question expects one to have it.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again about dimethyl fumarate's structure. If the structure is (E)-CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry along the double bond, making it achiral. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. What about dimethyl maleate? Maleic acid is the cis isomer, and its ester would have both COOCH3 groups on the same side. Would that create a chiral center?

No, because in the maleate ester, each of the carbons in the double bond is attached to two identical groups, so no chiral centers.

Hmm. So perhaps neither compound shows optical isomerism, but that's not possible because the question expects one of them to.

Wait, maybe I got the structures wrong. Let me think about methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate again. Alternatively, perhaps it's the same as methyl glycolate. Glycolic acid is CH2(OH)COOH. Its ester is CH2(OH)COOCH3. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait, that's a different structure.

Wait, perhaps I've been confusing the structures. Let me try again. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH3CH(OH)COOH. So the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Now, looking at the structure, the second carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH group.

Wait, no, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the second carbon (the CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and a CH2 group? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. No, that's the 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to write the correct structure.

Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon: CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Its ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this structure, the second carbon is CH2, attached to:

- CH2OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- and two Hs.

So no, it's not a chiral center.

Wait, but what if the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? Then the second carbon is CH(OH), attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH2 group. No, that would make it a chiral center. So if the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, then the second carbon is a chiral center. So then the molecule would have optical isomerism.

Ah! I think I made a mistake earlier in identifying the structure. The question states "methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate". Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, so 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon.

Wait, the correct IUPAC name is important. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The second carbon is CH2, which can't be a chiral center.

But wait, maybe the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. That would be the ester of 3-hydroxypropanoic acid, not 2-hydroxy. So no, the correct structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center and doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, back to part B, neither compound shows optical isomerism, which can't be right. So perhaps the correct answer is that dimethyl fumarate does show optical isomerism. But earlier reasoning suggests it doesn't.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing whether dimethyl fumarate is symmetrical. Let me think again: if the structure is O=C(OCH3)CH=CHCOOCH3, then each end has an O=C(OCH3) and COOCH3. Wait, no, that's not correct. Each end would have O=C(OCH3) and another group.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the earlier reasoning, part A's answer is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Part B's answer is dimethyl fumarate. So looking at the options:

Option D says A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, no. Wait, earlier I concluded that A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (since it doesn't tautomerize), and B is dimethyl fumarate. So looking at the options, option C says A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate.

So the correct answer would be option C.


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the compounds and their properties as described in the question.

### Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism
Tautomerism requires the presence of alpha hydrogens (hydrogens attached to carbons adjacent to a carbonyl group). 

1. **Benzoquinone**:  
   Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups in the para positions. Each carbonyl carbon is part of the aromatic ring and is bonded to two other carbons in the ring. These adjacent carbons are sp² hybridized and do not have hydrogens. Therefore, benzoquinone does not have alpha hydrogens and cannot undergo tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**:  
   Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons adjacent to the ketones are sp³ hybridized and have two hydrogens each. These alpha hydrogens allow cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione to undergo tautomerism.

Thus, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**.

---

### Part B: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism
Optical isomerism arises from chirality, which requires a molecule to have a non-superimposable mirror image, typically due to a chiral center.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:  
   The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group) is attached to four different groups: CH₃, OH, COOCH₃, and H. This makes it a chiral center, so methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does show optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**:  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the ester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₃COO-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule has a plane of symmetry due to the trans configuration of the double bond, making it achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.

Thus, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

---

### Final Answer
From the analysis:
- For Part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**.
- For Part B, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

The correct option is **C**:  
**A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.**

ANSWER: C
