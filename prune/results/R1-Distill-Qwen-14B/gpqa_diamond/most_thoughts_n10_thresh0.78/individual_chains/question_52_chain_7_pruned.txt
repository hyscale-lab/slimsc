Alright, so I'm looking at this astronomy problem, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

Okay, the question says that astronomers are studying a star with specific characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Now, the main part of the question is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—so the ratio when there are no spots divided by the ratio when there are spots. 

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. And it's assumed that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). 

Hmm, okay, so the key here is understanding how the ratio of populations in two energy levels depends on temperature. I remember that in LTE, the ratio of populations is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in level 2 to level 1 is (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(kT)), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) and E is the energy.

Wait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when there are spots. So when the star is cooler (5500 K), the ratio is lower than when it's hotter (6000 K). So the ratio n2/n1 would be lower at lower T. 

Wait, let me think again. The ratio of level 1 to level 2? Or level 2 to level 1? The question says the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in level 1 and level 2. So that's n1/n2.

In the Boltzmann equation, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(kT) ). So n1/n2 would be the inverse of that, which is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(kT) ). 

But wait, the transition corresponds to a certain wavelength. The energy difference E2 - E1 is related to the photon's energy, which is hc/λ. Since λ is given as 1448 Å, which is 1448 angstroms, or 1.448e-7 meters. 

So E = hc/λ. Let me calculate E2 - E1. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. The speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. So hc is 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divide that by λ in meters: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.372e-18 J. 

But I might need this energy in terms of eV or something else to handle it more easily. Since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, converting 1.372e-18 J to eV gives about 1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.56 eV. Wow, that's a big energy difference. Hmm, but maybe I can just keep it in J for the purposes of the Boltzmann factor.

Wait, but wait a second. The Boltzmann factor is (E2 - E1)/(kT). So with E2 > E1 (since the transition is from level 2 to 1, or vice versa?), the energy is positive. So the ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(kT) ), multiplied by (g1/g2). 

But in this problem, the observed ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots, meaning when T decreases. So when T is lower, the ratio is lower, implying that the ratio is inversely proportional to some exponential factor. 

Wait, wait. Let me think about the ratio. If the temperature decreases, the exponential (E2-E1)/(kT) increases because T is in the denominator. So the ratio n1/n2 should increase as T decreases. But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which are cooler. So that's a contradiction. 

Wait, maybe I've got the ratio backwards. Let me re-express. The Boltzmann factor for n2/n1 is (g2/g1) * exp(-
