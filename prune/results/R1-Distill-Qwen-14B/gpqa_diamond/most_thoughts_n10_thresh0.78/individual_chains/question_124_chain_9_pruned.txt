Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a go.

So the problem says that when particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector, they produce new particles. These new particles travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. Now, they're asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the detector's inner walls. The options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28.

Wait, let me think. I remember that the Lorentz factor is gamma, which is equal to 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But in this problem, I think the key is about the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector's walls. Because if they decay before reaching the wall, they won't be detected. So the probability that a particle reaches the wall depends on their lifetime as observed in the lab frame.

Oh right! The proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame) is tau. Then, from the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma times tau. If the particles are moving at a certain speed, the time they have to travel to reach the detector's wall is t = R/(v), where R is the radius and v is their velocity.

Wait, but wait. The particle's lifetime from our perspective (lab frame) is longer by gamma. So t = gamma * tau. But the time they have to reach the detector is t_available = R/(v). So if t_available >= tau, the particle can reach the wall. Or wait, no, because if t_available is less than gamma * tau, then the particle can decay before reaching the wall. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, I think the condition is that the particle must survive long enough to reach the detector. So, the time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is t = (R)/(v). For the particle to reach the wall, this time must be less than its lifetime in the lab frame, which is gamma * tau. Wait, no
