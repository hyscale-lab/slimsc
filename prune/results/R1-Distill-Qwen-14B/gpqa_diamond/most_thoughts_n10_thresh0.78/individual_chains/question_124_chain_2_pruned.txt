Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The problem says that when particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector, new particles are produced. These new particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the detector's inner walls. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. 

Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls instead of one third. The options given are A) 54, B) 68, C) 40, D) 28.

Hmm, okay. So I think this has to do with the particles' lifetime and how far they travel before decaying. Since they're ultra-relativistic, their lifetime as observed from the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. The distance they can travel before decaying depends on their Lorentz factor (gamma), right?

Wait, let me think again. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. If a particle doesn't reach the detector walls, it's probably because it decayed before traveling that distance. So the particles that do reach the walls are those that have a lifetime long enough to reach 30 meters at their speed.

But then why does the fraction change with the Lorentz factor? Oh, I think it's because the decay is a Poisson process. The probability of a particle decaying before traveling a certain distance depends on the proper lifetime and the Lorentz factor.

Wait, so when the particles are moving at a higher Lorentz factor, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame increases. So they can travel further before decaying. That would mean a higher gamma would lead more particles to reach the detector walls.

In the given scenario, with gamma=20, only 1/3 of the particles reach the walls. So the average distance they travel is 30 meters multiplied by 1/3, but wait, no. Wait, actually, the radius is 30 meters, so if a particle reaches the walls, it's because it didn't decay before traveling that distance. The number that reach the walls is the fraction that didn't decay. 

Wait, wait.
