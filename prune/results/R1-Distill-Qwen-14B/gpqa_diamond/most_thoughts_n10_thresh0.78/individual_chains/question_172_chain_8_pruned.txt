Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres related to iron atoms' energy levels. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, this has to do with the Boltzmann distribution, right? Because the distribution of particles in different energy states depends on temperature.

Wait, Boltzmann factor. The probability of a particle being in a certain energy state is proportional to exp(-E/(kT)), where E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

So in this case, the energy difference between the two levels is given as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. Let me call the lower level E1 and the higher E2. But wait, wait, actually, for the Boltzmann factor, the ratio of populations is given by (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(kT)). Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Oh right, the formula is n_i / n_j = exp(-(E_i - E_j)/(k T)). So if E2 is higher than E1, then n2/n1 = exp(-(E2 - E1)/(kT)).

But in the problem, star_1 has iron atoms twice as excited. So higher energy level, I guess. So n1_upper / n1_lower is 2 times (n2_upper / n2_lower). Or wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So perhaps the population of the excited state in star_1 is twice that of star_2 in the same state? Or wait, maybe it's the ratio of the populations of the excited state to the ground state?

Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited." So maybe the excitation is the ratio of the excited state to the ground state. So in star_1, that ratio is twice that of star_2.

So let me define the ratio as (n_upper / n_lower) for each star. So for star 1, ratio is 2 * (ratio for star 2). Let me write this down.

Let me
