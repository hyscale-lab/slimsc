Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about partition functions for a system of spins. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says we have three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. And we're supposed to find the partition function Z. The options are A to D, each with different exponential terms.

First, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). But wait, k is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature. But in terms of the problem, each state has a certain energy E, so each term in the sum is e^(-βE).

So I need to find all possible states of the three spins and calculate E for each. Then sum e^(-βE) for all states.

But wait, since each spin can be +1 or -1, the total number of possible states is 2^3 = 8. That seems manageable. Let me list all possible combinations.

The spins are S1, S2, S3. Each can be +1 or -1. So the possible states are:

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Now, for each state, compute E. The energy expression is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3).

Let me compute each term step by step.

Starting with state 1: (+1, +1, +1)
S1S2 = (+1)(+1) = 1
S1S3 = 1
S2S3 =1
Sum: 1+1+1 =3
E = -J*(3) = -3J

So the exponential term is exp(β * (3J)), because E is -3J, so -βE is 3Jβ.

Wait, wait. Because partition function term is e^(-βE). So for E = -3J, -βE is 3Jβ. So the term is e^{3Jβ}.

Hmm, but let me think again. Because E is the energy, the Boltzmann factor is e^{-β E}, right? So when E is negative, the exponent becomes positive.
