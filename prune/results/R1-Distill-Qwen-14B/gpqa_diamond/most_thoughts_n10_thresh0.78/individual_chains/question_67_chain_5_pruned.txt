Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says that two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum states. So, each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l equal to 1, since p orbitals have l=1. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, so l1 is 1, l2 is 1, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and the magnetic quantum number m is -1.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for each electron. We need to find the joint probability that both measurements give eigenvalues of -ħ. So, basically, what's the probability that when we measure L1z and L2z, both are -ħ.

Wait, right. Each Lz measurement for an electron would yield mħ, where m is the magnetic quantum number. So L1z would have possible eigenvalues of -ħ, 0, or ħ (since m can be -1, 0, +1 for l=1). Similarly for L2z.

But wait, the coupled state given is |1,1,2,-1>. So this is a state in the coupled basis, which combines the individual angular momenta. So I think this is the total angular momentum state, considering both electrons' orbital angular momenta.

Wait, but each electron's orbital angular momentum is a separate entity, and their sum gives the total. So the coupled state describes the combined system.

But the question is about the individual L1z and L2z measurements. So I need to see if the state can be expressed in terms of the product states of the individual Lz's.

Alternatively, perhaps I can expand the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> in terms of the uncoupled basis |l1, m1; l2, m2>, where m1 is the magnetic number for the first electron and m2 for the second.

Wait, the coupled state is |l1, l2, L, M> where L is the total angular momentum quantum number, which is 2 here, and M is the total magnetic quantum number, which is -1.

So in the coupled state, the total Lz is Mħ = (-1)ħ. And that comes from the sum of L
