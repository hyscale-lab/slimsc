Okay, so I'm looking at this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem states an annihilation process: p + p-bar → 2A+ + 2A-. So, a proton and an antiproton annihilate each other and produce two particles of charge +A and two of charge -A. Wait, no, I think I misread that. Oh, right, it's 2A+ and 2A-, meaning four particles in total. So each A is a particle with charge +A or -A. Or wait, maybe each A is a different type, but perhaps the problem is considering them as two plus and two minus.

The given data is that the antiproton is moving slowly. Hmm. And that m_A c squared is 300 MeV. The question is about finding the velocity of particle A.

Wait, but in the reaction, each A is a product. So I need to find the speed of these A particles.

Wait, so let me think about the process. The initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Protons and antiprotons have the same mass, right? So the rest mass energy of each is about 938 MeV/c². But wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, which probably means its kinetic energy is much less than its rest energy. So maybe it's at low speed compared to the speed of light. Hmm, but the proton is probably at rest? Or is it the other way around? Wait, the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some slow speed. Or perhaps both are moving, but the antiproton's speed is low.

Wait, but the problem says "the antiproton is slowly moving", so I think that implies its speed is much less than the speed of light. So maybe we can approximate some terms here.

But first, I should think about the conservation laws
