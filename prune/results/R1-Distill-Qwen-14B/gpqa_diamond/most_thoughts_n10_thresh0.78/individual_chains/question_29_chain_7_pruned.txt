Okay, so I've got this question about genetics, specifically dealing with mutations in a gene that produces an anti-nutritional compound in barley. The goal is to figure out which mutation would eliminate the compound. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the setup: there's this barley cultivar that's drought-resistant, which is good, but it has a gene producing an anti-nutritional compound. That compound is bad because it makes the barley unsuitable for food. So, the researchers found the gene responsible. The gene has five exons and four introns. The plan is to use EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and see which one gets rid of the compound.

The intact gene sequence is given, which starts with 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. Then there are four mutants (1-4), each with a change in the first exon area.

The question is asking which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So, I'm thinking that this would happen if the mutation disrupts the gene's function, like a loss-of-function mutation. That would stop the compound from being made.

Looking at how DNA mutations affect proteins, I remember that changes in the coding sequence can lead to changes in the amino acids of the resulting protein. If a mutation leads to a premature stop codon, the protein might be truncated and possibly non-functional. Alternatively, a missense mutation might change an amino acid in a critical part of the protein, rendering it non-functional.

Looking at the mutants:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the intact gene, I notice that in the middle, the intact gene has ...CGT..., and mutant 1 has CGC. So, in the coding sequence, that would change an amino acid. Let me think: the triplet before that is ...CTG... in the wild type. Wait, maybe I should write the sequences.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look for where the changes occur. Let me compare each mutant to the intact gene.

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Looking for the differences. The first part: the intact gene has TTTCG, and mutant 1 has TTCTA. Wait, let's see:

Intact starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT G... 

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC T... 

Wait, maybe I should line them up.

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT G...
Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CG
