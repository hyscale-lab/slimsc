Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about a series of chemical reactions, and we need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v. Hmm, symmetry groups, so this must relate to the structure of E, which is a product of a reaction.

Let me parse the information given.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, A + 8 B → C. What could that be? 8 equivalents suggest a ratio of 1:8. Maybe A is something that reacts with 8 moles of B per mole of A. I'm thinking maybe a metal reacting with a halogen? Wait, or perhaps a nitride? Because sometimes nitrides have high ratios. For instance, sodium nitride has a 1:3 ratio with nitrogen, but that's not 8. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's something like sulfur reacting with something else. Oh, wait, I remember that the reaction of a metal with chlorine gas can form a chloride. For example, sodium reacts with chlorine to form NaCl. But in that case, the ratio is 1:1. Hmm, but 8 equivalents—so maybe a metal reacting with a diatomic gas. Let's think: if B is Cl2, then 8 equivalents would mean 4 moles of B per mole A. Because each mole of Cl2 gives 2 moles of Cl. So, to get 8 equivalents, each A reacts with 4 moles of Cl2, giving 8 Cl per A. So maybe the formula is ACl8? But I'm not sure what solid A would be in that case. Alternatively, maybe B is something else, like O2 or N2.

Wait, another possibility: when a metal reacts with chlorine, the product is a chloride. For example, aluminum reacts with Cl2 to form AlCl3. Aluminum has a valency of +3, Cl is -1, so the formula is AlCl3. But that's 3 equivalents. Hmm, but in the first reaction, it's 8 equivalents. So perhaps the metal is something with a +2 charge? Then 8 equivalents of B (like Cl2) would give 16 Cl-, so the formula would be ACl8. But I don't know any common metal with +8 charge. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe B is a diatomic molecule, so each equivalent is a molecule, not atoms.

Wait, maybe B is a diatomic gas like O2. Then, if A is a metal, say sodium, reacting with 8 equivalents of O2? That would form NaO2? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe A is something else, like sulfur. Wait, sulfur reacts with something? I'm getting stuck here.

Let me think about product C. It's bright red, which is a clue. What compounds are bright red? Maybe something like mercury(II) nitrate is red, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps it's a transition metal compound. Oh wait, sodium chromate is yellow, not red. Wait, maybe it's a sulfide? No
