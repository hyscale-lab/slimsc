Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance of a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm. I remember that interplanar distance is calculated using some formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices.

Wait, what's a rhombohedral crystal? Oh right, a rhombohedron has all edges equal and all angles equal, so it's a special case where the lattice is cubic but with all angles the same. So the unit cell is a rhombohedron, which is like a cube that's been skewed.

The given interatomic distance is 10 angstroms, but wait, is that the lattice parameter a? Or is that the interatomic distance in some other context? Oh, wait, in a rhombohedral structure, if it's a primitive lattice, the interatomic distance would be a, because each atom is at a corner. But wait, maybe the interatomic distance is different. Wait no, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a. So here, since the crystal is rhombohedral, perhaps a is 10 angstroms.

Wait, but the question says interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So a is 10. Oh, but wait, in a face-centered cubic or body-centered cubic structure, the interatomic distance isn't the same as a. But I think in this problem, since it's a rhombohedral structure, and all sides are equal, it's a primitive unit cell, so the interatomic distance is a. So a=10 angstrom.

The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. So in a rhombohedral system, the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by 1/d^2 = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) - (hk + hl + kl)/(a²) * (1/(1 - cos^2 alpha)) ) or something? Wait, no, I think the more precise formula is derived using the structure factor or from the reciprocal lattice.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = [ (a² (h² + k² + l²) - a² (hk + hl + kl) cos α ) ]^(-1/2) * (1/√(1 - cos^2 α)) )? Hmm, no, maybe I'm mixing up some terms. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

But wait, that's for a cubic system with angles, like in a face-centered cubic. Wait, no, I think for a general rhombohedral system, the formula is a bit different. Let me recall.

The interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral crystal is given by:

d_{hkl} = (a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )) ) * (1 / (1 - cos² α))^{1/2}

Wait, that's not quite right. Another approach: the interplanar distance can be found using the relation between the reciprocal lattice vectors and the real lattice vectors. For a rhombohedral system, the unit cell vectors are a, a, a, and all angles equal to α.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a) [ 1 0 0 ] / (1 - cos α)
Wait, no, that's probably oversimplifying. Alternatively, the reciprocal vectors satisfy the condition that b · a = 1, but I think I need a different approach.

Wait, perhaps using the formula for d-spacing in a hexagonal system can help, but wait, rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal? No, wait, rhombohedral is a special case of the hexagonal lattice when the axial ratio is 1. Wait, no, I think that's not correct. The hexagonal system has one hexagonal and two other axes, while rhombohedral has a cubic system with all angles equal.

Wait, maybe I should look for the formula specifically for rhombohedral d-spacing. From memory, the formula is:

d_{hkl} = [ (a^2 (h² + k² + l²) ) - (a^2 (hk + hl + kl) cos α ) ]^(-1/2) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - cos² α)) )

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the general formula for interplanar spacing in a triclinic system but specialized for rhombohedral.

Wait, another approach: The general formula for d-spacing in any crystal system is given by:

d^2 = (a² b² c²) / [ (h^2/l^2 + k^2/m^2 + l^2/n^2) - ( sin^2 α sin^2 β sin^2 γ ) / ( ... ) ]

Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula specific to rhombohedral systems. I think the formula is:

d_{hkl} = [ (1/(h² + k² + l²)) - (2 cos α)/(h + k + l)^2 ]^(-1/2) * a / sqrt(1 - cos^2 α)

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. The formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral system can be written as:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk +
