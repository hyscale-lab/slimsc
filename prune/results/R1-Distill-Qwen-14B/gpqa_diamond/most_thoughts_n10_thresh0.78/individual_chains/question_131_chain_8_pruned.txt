Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR questions can be tricky. Let me read through it carefully.

Alright, the question starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. It's dehydrated to form an anhydride. I remember that dehydrating a dicarboxylic acid usually forms an anhydride, and the structure would depend on the starting material.

The anhydride has some specific NMR data. The 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. Hmm, that's a region where aromatic protons usually show up, but wait, 7 ppm could also be for an alkenyl proton if it's deshielded. But wait, the starting material had a cis-alkene, and dehydration would form an anhydride. Alternatively, the peak might be for an aromatic ring, but I thought the starting material was a diacid, so maybe it's not. Or perhaps it's a conjugated dienophile?

Wait, the 13C NMR shows two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 165 is a carbonyl carbon, probably from the anhydride group. 137 could be a carbon adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, maybe a carbonyl, so perhaps a double bond carbon. So maybe the anhydride has a conjugated double bond?

Wait, the starting material had a cis-alkene. When it dehydrates to form the anhydride, the double bond would be in the anhydride. But the structure of the anhydride would have two carbonyls connected by a bridge. Wait, maybe the anhydride has a structure like a cyclic structure or a substituted one.

Wait, but the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. That suggests that all the protons in that region are equivalent. So, maybe it's a pair of equivalent protons, perhaps on adjacent carbons in a double bond. Alternatively, it could be a di-substituted alkene where the protons are equivalent.
