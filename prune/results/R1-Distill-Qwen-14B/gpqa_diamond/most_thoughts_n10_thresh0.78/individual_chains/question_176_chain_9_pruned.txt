Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem states that the system's state at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, that doesn't look like a unit vector. Oh wait, maybe it's just given as a vector, and I might need to normalize it? But let me think about that later.

We have two operators, P and Q. The operator P is represented by a 3x3 matrix. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). And operator Q is another 3x3 matrix with the first row (1, 0, 0), second row (0, 0, 0), third row (0, 0, -1).

The question is about measuring P first, then Q, and finding the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, no, wait. Wait the question says, what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring Q just after P. So I think the measurement of P is done first, then Q. So the process is: measure P, get a value, then measure Q in the same state, or maybe the state collapses after P's measurement? Hmm, quantum mechanics measurement collapses the state, so after measuring P, the state would be an eigenstate of P corresponding to the measured value. Then, measuring Q on that new state.

Wait, but the question is about the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So that would involve two steps: first, the state after P measurement (given that we got 0 for P), and then from that state, measuring Q and getting -1.

But wait, another way to think about it: the combined probability would involve first finding the probability of getting 0 in P, and then, given that, the probability of getting -1 in Q. So it's the product
