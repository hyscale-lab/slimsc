Okay, so I've got this physics problem about annihilation processes, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The process is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So, a proton and an antiproton annihilate into two particles each of charge + and - A. The antiproton is moving slowly, which probably means its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. The mass of A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A to D, with velocities around 0.77c, etc.

Hmm, okay. So first, I should probably think about conservation laws here. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe we can approximate that the initial kinetic energy is negligible, and the system is such that the initial momentum is low. But wait, protons and antiprotons have rest mass energy, so their rest masses are about 938 MeV each. But the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe its kinetic energy is much smaller than its rest mass energy. So perhaps the initial total energy is dominated by their rest energies.

Wait, but the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. So the proton is probably at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly. Or maybe both are moving, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, which might imply that its speed is much less than c, so relativistic effects are small. Hmm, but the output particles are moving at some significant fraction of c, as the options are 0.77c and up.

So the initial setup: let me model this. Let's assume the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some velocity, but slowly. So the initial total momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton. Now, after the annihilation, we have four particles: two A⁺ and two A⁻. But since the charges are symmetric, perhaps they move in such a way that the total momentum is conserved. But the problem states that the product is 2A⁺ and 2A⁻, so four particles. But since they're all identical in mass, perhaps they move symmetrically, maybe in opposite directions or something, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps in the center of mass frame, but wait, the initial proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with low speed, so the center of mass frame isn't the same as the lab frame. Hmm, maybe I should work in the lab frame where the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some velocity v_p̄.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says the antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps its speed is much less than c, so we can approximate using non-relativistic mechanics. But wait, the products are moving at significant fractions of c. So maybe relativistic effects are important for the products.

So, perhaps I should consider energy and momentum conservation.

Let me denote the initial system: a proton (mass m_p) at rest, and an antiproton (mass m_p̄, which is same as m_p, since they have the same mass) moving with velocity v. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, v is much less than c. So in the lab frame, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has some momentum.

Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe v_p̄ << c. So the kinetic energy is (1/2) m_p̄ v_p̄², which is much less than m_p̄ c².

So the initial total energy is the sum of the proton's rest energy (m_p c²) and the antiproton's total energy (gamma m_p c²), but since v is small, gamma is approximately 1 + (v²)/(2c²), so the total energy would be m_p c² + m_p c² + (some small term). Wait, so the total initial energy is approximately 2 m_p c² plus a small term from the antiproton's kinetic energy.

But wait, the product particles are A⁺ and A⁻, each with mass m_A. So the total rest mass energy of the products is 4 m_A c². So plugging in the given value, m_A c² = 300 MeV, so 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. But the initial rest mass would be m_p c² + m_p̄ c², which is about 2*938 MeV ≈ 1876 MeV, which is larger than 1200. So that suggests that energy is conserved, but also, the process would have some kinetic energy in the products.

Wait, but that's the rest mass energy. The initial kinetic energy of the antiproton is small, so the total initial energy is around 1876 MeV plus a small amount. The products have rest mass energy 1200 MeV plus kinetic energy. So the products must carry away kinetic energy, but perhaps we can assume that the initial kinetic energy is negligible compared to the rest mass, so we can approximate the products' energy as their rest mass plus any kinetic energy. Hmm, but this might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps in the center of mass frame, the initial total momentum is zero, but since the antiproton is moving, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should model this as an inelastic collision where the initial particles (proton and antiproton) combine into two pairs of A⁺ and A⁻. So perhaps I should consider energy and momentum conservation in the lab frame where the proton is at rest.

So in the lab frame:

- Proton (mass m_p) is at rest. So its momentum is zero.

- Antiproton is moving with velocity v, so its momentum is gamma m_p v, where gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)).

So the initial total momentum is gamma m_p v.

The initial total energy is m_p c² (proton rest energy) plus gamma m_p c² (antiproton's total energy).

After the collision, we have four particles: 2 A⁺ and 2 A⁻.

Assuming that the products move symmetrically, perhaps in pairs, like each A⁺ and A⁻ move in opposite directions, but that's speculative. Alternatively, maybe the four particles move in such a way that the total momentum is conserved.

But perhaps each A has the same speed, and the particles are arranged symmetrically so that their momenta sum up to the initial momentum.

Wait, but if the products are two A⁺ and two A⁻, perhaps each pair is moving in opposite directions. Alternatively, maybe each A⁺ is moving in one direction, and each A⁻ in the opposite, but that's not necessarily the case. Alternatively, perhaps each A has the same velocity magnitude but perhaps in different directions, but that might complicate the momentum calculation. Alternatively, maybe the particles are moving in the same direction, but that seems less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the products are two particles each, but that's not the case here. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering that the total momentum is carried equally by the four particles. But that's probably not the case. Alternatively, perhaps it's more manageable to think that the two A⁺ and two A⁻ are moving in such a way that their momenta add up to the initial momentum. So perhaps each A has the same speed, and their directions are arranged such that their momenta sum up to the initial momentum.

Wait, but with four particles, symmetry might be involved. Alternatively, perhaps each A⁺ and A⁻ are moving in a particular arrangement, but without more information, perhaps it's better to make some assumption about the symmetry of the products.

Alternatively, perhaps each pair (A⁺ and A⁻) moves in opposite directions, so their momenta cancel each other. But then the total momentum would be zero, which would imply that the initial momentum was zero, which only happens if the antiproton is at rest, which contradicts the statement that it's moving. So that can't be correct.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think about the conservation laws.

So, initial momentum is p_initial = gamma_p̄ m_p v_p̄ (since the proton is at rest). Let's denote the proton mass as m_p, and since the antiproton is moving, its momentum is gamma_p̄ m_p v_p̄, where gamma_p̄ is the Lorentz factor for the antiproton's speed.

The initial energy is E_initial = m_p c^2 + gamma_p̄ m_p c^2.

After the collision, the products are four particles. Let's assume that each A has a velocity u, but that's probably not the case unless they all move in the same direction, which is unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the A particles are moving in pairs, such that their momenta add up in a way that the total is the same as initial.

Wait, perhaps the products are moving in two pairs. For example, two A⁺ moving in the same direction, and two A⁻ moving in the opposite direction. Or maybe each A⁺ and A⁻ are moving in opposite directions, but that would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the products are moving in such a way that their momenta sum up to the initial momentum. So the total momentum of the four A particles equals the initial momentum p_initial.

But without knowing the directions, it's a bit tricky. Maybe I can make an assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton. That would make the momentum just 4 * gamma_A m_A u, where u is their velocity. But that's a big assumption and might not hold true, but perhaps it's a way to proceed.

Wait, but that would require all four to move in the same direction, which may not be the case, but maybe it's a simplifying assumption. Let me try that.

So, if all four A particles are moving with velocity u in the same direction as the initial antiproton's motion, then the total momentum after collision is 4 gamma_A m_A u.

Now, the initial momentum is gamma_p̄ m_p v_p̄, so:

4 gamma_A m_A u = gamma_p̄ m_p v_p̄.  [Conservation of momentum]

Similarly, energy conservation:

m_p c^2 + gamma_p̄ m_p c^2 = 4 gamma_A m_A c^2. [Conservation of energy]

Hmm, but this seems too simple. Are there any other factors? Well, the antiproton is moving slowly, so v_p̄ is much less than c, so gamma_p̄ ≈ 1 + (v_p̄²)/(2 c²). But since v_p̄ is small, maybe I can approximate gamma_p̄ as 1. Because for small v, gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²), which is close to 1. So perhaps gamma_p̄ ≈1. Then, the initial momentum is approx m_p v_p̄.

Wait, but if the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is (1/2) m_p v_p̄², which is small compared to its rest energy. So in that case, the initial energy is m_p c² + m_p c² + (1/2 m_p v_p̄²) ≈ 2 m_p c² + (small term). So the initial energy is approximately 2 m_p c².

The energy after collision is 4 gamma_A m_A c². So 4 gamma_A m_A c² ≈ 2 m_p c².

Wait, that would give gamma_A = (2 m_p c²) / (4 m_A c²) ) = (m_p)/(2 m_A).

Given that m_A c² is 300 MeV, and m_p c² is about 938 MeV.

So m_p/(2 m_A) = 938 / (2 * 300) ) ≈ 938/(600) ≈ 1.563.

So gamma_A ≈ 1.563.

Then, gamma_A is 1.563, so 1/gamma_A = 0.64.

So, u = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma_A^2)).

Wait, let me compute that.

gamma_A = 1.563.

So gamma_A^2 = (1.563)^2 ≈ 2.443.

1/(gamma_A²) ≈ 0.409.

So 1 - 0.409 = 0.591. Square root of 0.591 is about 0.769. So u ≈ 0.769 c.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.91c and option A is 0.77c. So 0.77 is close to 0.769.

Wait, but that's under the assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction. But that might not be the correct scenario. Perhaps it's better to model the problem with more accurate momentum and energy conservation without making that assumption.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the products are moving in pairs. For example, two A⁺ going in one direction and two A⁻ going in the opposite direction. But then their momenta could cancel each other, which would require the initial momentum to be zero, which isn't the case here. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the products are arranged symmetrically but in a way that the total momentum is conserved. For example, each A⁺ and A⁻ pair moves in opposite directions, but their momenta add up in a way that the total equals the initial momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps each A⁺ and A⁻ is moving in a direction such that their combined momentum is the same as the initial. But this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Since the initial antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the resulting particles A have their velocities much higher than the antiproton. So perhaps we can neglect the initial velocity of the antiproton compared to the velocity of the A particles. But that doesn't seem right because the initial momentum has to be accounted for.

Hmm, perhaps I should model the initial momentum and energy without approximation, but that might require solving a system of equations.

So, let me denote:

Initial momentum: p_initial = gamma_p̄ m_p v_p̄.

Initial energy: E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p̄ m_p c².

After collision, the four A particles have a total momentum P and total energy E.

But without knowing the individual momenta, perhaps I can make an assumption about symmetry.

Wait, perhaps each A⁺ and A⁻ are moving in such a way that their momenta add up in the same direction. But this is getting a bit too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the situation where all four particles have the same speed u, but their directions are arranged such that the total momentum is conserved. But without knowing the angles, that's difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the concept that the total momentum is carried by the products in a way that all four have the same speed and direction, which would make the total momentum 4 gamma_A m_A u.

But I'm not sure if that's a valid assumption, but let's try it.

So, from the conservation of momentum:

4 gamma_A m_A u = gamma_p̄ m_p v_p̄.

And from conservation of energy:

m_p c² + gamma_p̄ m_p c² = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

So, I have two equations with two variables: u and gamma_p̄.

But wait, I can write these as:

Equation 1: 4 gamma_A m_A u = gamma_p̄ m_p v_p̄.

Equation 2: m_p c² (1 + gamma_p̄) =4 gamma_A m_A c².

Hmm, but equation 2 can be rewritten as:

gamma_p̄ = (4 gamma_A m_A c²) / (m_p c²) ) - 1.

Wait, no: equation 2 is m_p c² (1 + gamma_p̄) =4 gamma_A m_A c².

So dividing both sides by c²,

m_p (1 + gamma_p̄) =4 gamma_A m_A.

So,

1 + gamma_p̄ = (4 gamma_A m_A) / m_p.

So,

gamma_p̄ = (4 gamma_A m_A / m_p ) - 1.

Now, substituting gamma_p̄ into equation 1:

4 gamma_A m_A u = [ (4 gamma_A m_A / m_p ) - 1 ] m_p v_p̄.

Wait, but wait, the right-hand side is [gamma_p̄ m_p v_p̄ ].

So,

4 gamma_A m_A u = [ (4 gamma_A m_A / m_p ) - 1 ] m_p v_p̄.

Simplify the right-hand side:

(4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ) v_p̄.

So,

4 gamma_A m_A u = (4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ) v_p̄.

Hmm, but this seems a bit messy. Let's think about the initial conditions again.

The antiproton is moving slowly, so v_p̄ is much less than c. So, gamma_p̄ ≈ 1 + (v_p̄²)/(2 c²), but since v_p̄ is small, perhaps gamma_p̄ ≈ 1.

If gamma_p̄ ≈1, then equation 2 becomes:

m_p (1 + 1) =4 gamma_A m_A.

So,

2 m_p =4 gamma_A m_A.

Which gives gamma_A = (2 m_p )/(4 m_A ) = m_p/(2 m_A).

Which is what I did earlier.

So gamma_A = (938 MeV )/(2 * 300 MeV ) = 938/(600) ≈ 1.563.

So u = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma_A²)).

As calculated before, that gives u ≈ 0.769 c, which is approximately option A: 0.77c.

But let me think again. If I make the assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction, this gives u ≈ 0.77c, which is option A.

But wait, I have another thought. The initial system's kinetic energy is small, so the products' kinetic energy must be small as well. But wait, 0.77c is quite a high speed, which would imply significant kinetic energy. Hmm, perhaps this approach is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is symmetric, and the products' momenta are arranged such that the total momentum is the same as the initial.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the products are moving in pairs. Suppose that two A+ and two A- are emitted, each pair moving in opposite directions. But that would cause their momenta to cancel each other, which would require the initial momentum to be zero, which isn't the case. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the two A+ are moving in one direction, and the two A- in the same, but that would complicate momentum conservation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the products are moving in such a way that their momenta add up to the initial momentum. For example, each A has the same velocity u, and all four are moving in the same direction. That would indeed make the total momentum 4 gamma_A m_A u, and the energy 4 gamma_A m_A c².

So, using that, I can proceed.

So, let's set up the equations again:

Momentum conservation:

4 gamma_A m_A u = gamma_p̄ m_p v_p̄. (1)

Energy conservation:

m_p c^2 + gamma_p̄ m_p c^2 =4 gamma_A m_A c^2. (2)

From equation (2):

gamma_p̄ = (4 gamma_A m_A c^2 - m_p c^2 ) / (m_p c^2 )

= [4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ] / m_p.

Now, substituting into equation (1):

4 gamma_A m_A u = [ (4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ) / m_p ] * m_p v_p̄.

Simplify the right-hand side:

(4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ) v_p̄.

So,

4 gamma_A m_A u = (4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ) v_p̄.

But we also know from the initial momentum that v_p̄ is small, so perhaps (4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ) is approximately 4 gamma_A m_A, since m_p is much larger than m_A? Let me check the numbers.

m_p c² is about 938 MeV, m_A c² is 300 MeV, so 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV.

So 4 gamma_A m_A =4 * 300 * gamma_A.

Wait, but earlier I found gamma_A ≈1.563, so 4 * 300 * 1.563 ≈ 1875.6 MeV, which is larger than m_p c² (938). So 4 gamma_A m_A =1875.6, m_p=938.

So 4 gamma_A m_A - m_p = 1875.6 - 938 ≈ 937.6 MeV.

Then, v_p̄ is small, but it's the velocity of the antiproton. Let's proceed.

So,

4 gamma_A m_A u = (4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ) v_p̄.

But I can express v_p̄ in terms of gamma_p̄.

Wait, but since the antiproton is moving slowly, v_p̄ << c, so gamma_p̄ ≈1.

So, approximating gamma_p̄ ≈1, equation (1) becomes:

4 gamma_A m_A u ≈ (4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ) v_p̄.

But from equation (2), with gamma_p̄ ≈1,

m_p c² + m_p c² =4 gamma_A m_A c².

So,

2 m_p c² =4 gamma_A m_A c².

Thus,

gamma_A = (2 m_p c² )/(4 m_A c²) ) = m_p/(2 m_A).

Which is what I had before: gamma_A ≈1.563.

So then, from equation (1):

4 *1.563 *300 u = (4 *1.563 *300 -938 ) * v_p̄.

Wait, let me compute 4 gamma_A m_A.

gamma_A is 1.563, m_A is 300 MeV/c². So 4 *1.563 *300 = 4 * 468.9 = 1875.6 MeV.

So,

4 gamma_A m_A =1875.6 MeV.

So,

(4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ) =1875.6 - 938 =937.6 MeV.

So,

4 gamma_A m_A u =937.6 * v_p̄.

But I'm trying to find u, the velocity of the A particles.

Wait, but I don't know v_p̄. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps v_p̄ is small, but I can express v_p̄ in terms of the initial momentum.

Wait, initial momentum p_initial = gamma_p̄ m_p v_p̄ = m_p v_p̄, since gamma_p̄ ≈1.

But from equation (1), 4 gamma_A m_A u ≈ (4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ) v_p̄.

So,

u ≈ [ (4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ) / (4 gamma_A m_A) ] * v_p̄.

But I'm not sure how that helps me. I have two variables here: u and v_p̄.

Hmm, perhaps I should relate u and v_p̄ using energy.

Wait, from equation (2), I have gamma_A = m_p/(2 m_A). So that gives me u in terms of c, as before.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the initial system's energy is 2 m_p c² (since gamma_p̄ ≈1), and the products' energy is 4 gamma_A m_A c².

So,

4 gamma_A m_A c² =2 m_p c² + K_initial,

where K_initial is the initial kinetic energy of the antiproton. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, K_initial is much less than m_p c², so perhaps it's negligible.

Wait, but if K_initial is negligible, then 4 gamma_A m_A c² ≈ 2 m_p c².

Which again gives gamma_A ≈ (2 m_p c² )/(4 m_A c² ) ) = m_p/(2 m_A) ≈ 1.563.

So, then, to find u, we calculate u = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma_A^2)).

Which gives approximately 0.77c, which is option A.

But another approach: perhaps the process is symmetric, and each A⁺ and A⁻ are moving in opposite directions with the same speed. But considering four particles, that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed in such a way that the velocity of A is determined purely by conservation of energy and momentum, and the initial kinetic energy is negligible, leading to u≈0.77c.

So, given the options, the closest answer would be A) 0.77c.


To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation process \( p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^- \) using conservation of energy and momentum. The antiproton is moving slowly, meaning its kinetic energy is much smaller than its rest energy, and we approximate its Lorentz factor as \( \gamma_{\bar{p}} \approx 1 \). The proton is assumed to be at rest in the lab frame.

### Conservation of Momentum
The initial momentum is entirely due to the slow-moving antiproton:
\[
p_{\text{initial}} = \gamma_{\bar{p}} m_p v_{\bar{p}} \approx m_p v_{\bar{p}}.
\]
After the annihilation, the total momentum of the four \( A \)-particles must equal the initial momentum. Assuming the \( A \)-particles move symmetrically, we assume all four \( A \)-particles have the same velocity \( u \) and move in the same direction. Thus:
\[
p_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A u.
\]
Equating initial and final momentum:
\[
4 \gamma_A m_A u = m_p v_{\bar{p}}.
\]

### Conservation of Energy
The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's total energy:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = m_p c^2 + \gamma_{\bar{p}} m_p c^2 \approx 2 m_p c^2.
\]
After annihilation, the total energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of the four \( A \)-particles:
\[
E_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A c^2.
\]
Equating initial and final energy:
\[
4 \gamma_A m_A c^2 = 2 m_p c^2.
\]
Solving for \( \gamma_A \):
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{2 m_p}{4 m_A} = \frac{m_p}{2 m_A}.
\]

### Substituting Known Values
The rest energy of the proton is \( m_p c^2 \approx 938 \, \text{MeV} \), and the rest energy of \( A \) is \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \). Substituting these values:
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{938}{2 \times 300} \approx 1.563.
\]

### Finding the Velocity of \( A \)
The Lorentz factor is related to the velocity \( u \) by:
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - u^2/c^2}}.
\]
Rearranging for \( u \):
\[
u = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_A^2}}.
\]
Substituting \( \gamma_A \approx 1.563 \):
\[
\gamma_A^2 \approx 2.443, \quad \frac{1}{\gamma_A^2} \approx 0.409, \quad 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_A^2} \approx 0.591.
\]
\[
u = c \sqrt{0.591} \approx 0.769c.
\]

### Final Answer
The velocity of particle \( A \) is approximately \( 0.77c \), which corresponds to option **A**.

Answer: A
