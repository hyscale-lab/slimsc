Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about atomic nuclei and fission. Let's try to break it down. Hmm, I remember a bit from my high school classes about nuclear reactions and energy. So the question is about finding the difference between the correct kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment and the value calculated using the classical approximation.

The setup is that an atomic nucleus with mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So, initial mass is M, after fission, two fragments: m1 and m2, where m1 = 2 * m2 (since one is twice as massive as the other). Also, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the sum of rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass. So that's 0.99 M. So, the initial mass is M, and after fission, the total rest mass is 0.99 M. So some energy was released in the form of kinetic energy, right? Because in nuclear reactions, mass can be converted into energy via E=mc², and that energy is usually kinetic energy.

The problem says that the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. We need to find the difference between the correct T1 (relativistic) and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

So the steps I think I need to take are:

1. Find the masses of the two fragments, m1 and m2. Since m1 is twice m2, and m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Let me calculate that.

Let me denote m2 as x. Then m1 = 2x. So 2x + x = 3x = 0.99 M → x = 0.99 M /3 → x = 0.33 M. So m2 = 0.33 M, m1 = 0.66 M.

Wait, wait. Wait, 0.99 M is the sum of m1 and m2. So 3x=0.99 M → x=0.33 M. So m1=0.66 M, m2=0.33 M. Got it.

2. Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. That is, their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So, the momentum of m1 is equal in magnitude to m2, but opposite. So, p1 = -p2.

3. Because of that, the kinetic energy of each fragment can be found using their respective velocities and masses. But wait, since they are moving in opposite directions, their velocities' magnitudes might not be the same. Wait, but in reality, the center of momentum frame is the rest frame, so in this case, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta.

Wait, but in a more precise way, the total initial momentum is zero, so the total momentum after must be zero. So, m1 v1 = m2 v2, but since they're moving in opposite directions, the actual momenta are opposite. Hmm, maybe it's better to write the magnitudes.

So, considering magnitudes, m1 v1 = m2 v2, but since they're going in opposite directions, p1 = -p2. So, m1 v1 = m2 v2, and because the directions are opposite, perhaps the speeds can be different.

Wait, but the masses are 0.66 M and 0.33 M. So m1 is twice m2. So, if p1 = m1 v1 and p2 = m2 v2, then since p1 = -p2, m1 v1 = m2 v2. So v1 = (m2/m1) v2 = (0.33 / 0.66) v2 = 0.5 v2. So the velocity of m1 is half that of m2. Hmm.

But maybe using momentum conservation and energy conservation would help here.

But perhaps it's better to model this in the center of mass frame, which in this case is the rest frame of the original nucleus. So in that frame, the two fragments will have
