Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. Hmm, I remember that the potential is V(r) = ½ m ω² r². Right, that's Hooke's law, which makes sense because a harmonic oscillator is involved.

The question is about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, each state has a specific energy level, and the number of eigenfunctions corresponds to the degeneracy of that state.

Wait, so in three dimensions, the isotropic harmonic oscillator has energy levels given by something like E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), right? Or wait, maybe that's not exactly right. Because the energy levels also depend on the quantum numbers. So wait, in three dimensions, the energy levels are determined by the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction.

Oh wait, no, in three dimensions, the energy is E = ħω (n + 3/2), where n is the sum of the individual quantum numbers in each direction. So n = n_x + n_y + n_z. That makes sense because each direction contributes equally in an isotropic oscillator.

So the ground state is when n=0, because n_x, n_y, n_z are all zero. Then the first excited state would have n=1, second would be n=2, third would be n=3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the ground state is the lowest energy, which is n=0. The first excited state is when the sum increases by one, so n=1. The second excited would be n=2, third excited n=3. So the third excited state is n=3.

So the energy would be E = (3 + 3/2) ħω. Wait, no. Wait, E is given by (n + 3/2) ħω. So n is the sum. So n=3, so E = (3 + 3/2) ħω. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, hold on. Let me double-check. The energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by E = (n + 3/2
