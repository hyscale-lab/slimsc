Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and understand what's being asked.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the formula is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. The options are various powers of r: r cubed, r to the fifth, r to the fourth, or r squared.

Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the angle at which the position of a star appears to shift when observed from two points on Earth's orbit. The formula I recall is that distance (d) in parsecs is approximately 1 divided by the parallax in arcseconds. So d = 1/plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Wait, so if d = 1/plx, then plx = 1/d. Which means plx is inversely proportional to distance. So plx decreases as distance increases.

The problem states that the number of stars (N) is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

Since I need to find how N changes with distance, I should express plx in terms of d. Because plx = 1/d, substituting that into the equation gives N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5.

Let me calculate that. (1/d)^5 is 1/(d^5), so 1 divided by that is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, plx^5 is (1/d)^5 = 1/d^5. So 1/(plx)^5 is 1/(1/d^5) ) = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So, that would be the change in N as r (distance) changes. But wait, the way the question is phrased: "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per
