Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy question, and I'm a bit stuck. Let's see what the question says. So, the question is about how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance. The given relationship is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over the parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. I remember that parallax is related to distance, so I need to connect parallax with distance and then figure out how the number of stars changes with distance.

Wait, parallax. Right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So, plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. That makes sense because the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So if I have a star at a distance d, plx is 1/d. But in this problem, the number of stars (let's call it N) varies as 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5.

Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N would be proportional to (1/( (1/d) ))^5. Let me compute that. 1/(1/d) is d, so (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5. Wait, but wait, that's not the whole story because the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit range. So maybe I need to think about the number of stars per unit distance, or the density? Or perhaps the number per a certain range.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to express everything in terms of distance. So, if plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is a constant. Substitute d into that, N = k * d^5. But the question is about how N changes with distance, per unit range. So perhaps I should think about the number of stars as a function of distance, and how it increases as we go further.

But wait, the way the question is phrased: "How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" Hmm, maybe they're asking about the differential number of stars, like the number per unit distance. So if N ‚àù d^5, then the number per unit distance would be
