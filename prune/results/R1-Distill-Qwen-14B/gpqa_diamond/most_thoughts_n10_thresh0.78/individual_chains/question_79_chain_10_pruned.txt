Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about identifying Compound X based on the reaction and the NMR spectra of the product.

The reaction given is that Compound X (which has the formula C11H12O) is treated with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, the product's 1H and 13C NMR spectra are provided. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different structures.

I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, often used in reactions like the epoxide opening. Wait, but Compound X is reacting with this base. Hmm. Epoxides can undergo ring-opening reactions under basic conditions, typically nucleophilic attacks. So if Compound X is an epoxide, reacting with a base might cause it to open.

But wait, looking at the options, some are epoxides. Let me check the options. Option D is 2-styrylepoxide. So if the product is resulting from an epoxide ring-opening, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide that undergoes some reaction.

Wait, but the product's NMR is given. So maybe the reaction is a ring-opening, and the product is something else. Or perhaps the reaction is something else, like elimination or a rearrangement.

Wait, another possibility: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is also known as DBU (1,8-diazabicycloundec-7-ene?), but wait, no, that's a different structure. Alternatively, this base is often used in elimination reactions, especially in E2 mechanisms, because it's a strong, non-nucleophilic base. So perhaps the reaction is an elimination.

Wait, Compound X is C11H12O. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C + 2 - H - X)/2. X is 0 here. So (2*11 + 2 -12 -0)/2 = (24-12)/2 = 6. So 6 degrees: could be three rings, or a combination of rings and double bonds. An epoxide has a three-membered ring with an oxygen, so that's one ring and two double bonds (counted as two for the ring). Wait, no: the epoxide is an oxygen in a three-membered ring, which is a cyclic ether. Each ring counts as one, each double bond as one, each triple bond as two. So for an epoxide, that's one ring (the three-membered) and one double bond (the ether oxygen doesn't count as a double bond, but the ring itself imposes a double bond equivalent).

Wait, maybe I
