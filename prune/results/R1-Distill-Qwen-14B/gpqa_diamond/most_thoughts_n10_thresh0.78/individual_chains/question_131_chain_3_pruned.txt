Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's take it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a reaction involving an anhydride and a cyclopentadiene derivative. The products are two, and their NMR spectra are key here.

First, let's parse the given information. The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride has some specific NMR characteristics: a single peak at 7 ppm in 1H NMR and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in 13C NMR. Wait, 7 ppm in 1H—so that's probably an aromatic proton. But wait, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. So when it dehydrates, the structure probably forms an anhydride with a conjugated diene or something else.

Wait, no, wait. The anhydride's 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm, which suggests equivalent protons. Maybe it's a symmetrical structure. Also, the 13C NMR has two peaks. One at 137 ppm—that's likely a carbon adjacent to an oxygen, maybe a carbonyl. The other is 165 ppm, which is probably a carbonyl carbon, like a ketone or an acid. But in an anhydride, there are two carbonyls. So the 13C spectrum having two peaks for the anhydride suggests that both carbonyls are equivalent. So maybe the anhydride is symmetrical. For example, like maleic anhydride? Wait, but maleic is a diene with cis double bond. Wait, no—wait, the starting material is a cis-alkene. When it dehydrates, it forms an anhydride. So the structure of the anhydride must have a double bond.

Wait, but in the 1H NMR, it's a singlet at 7 ppm. So maybe there are two equivalent protons in a symmetrical environment. Like, maybe the anhydride has a structure where the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are equivalent. Like in the case of succinic anhydride, but that's a saturated compound. No, wait, maybe it's a cyclic anhydride with a double bond.

Wait, maybe the starting dicarboxylic acid is something like cis-butenedioic acid. Let me think. If you have a cis-dioic acid, when you dehydrate it, the structure would form an anhydride with two double bonds? Or perhaps a cyclic structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride is maleic anhydride, which is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. Wait no, maleic anhydride is an unsaturated anhydride. Its structure has a
