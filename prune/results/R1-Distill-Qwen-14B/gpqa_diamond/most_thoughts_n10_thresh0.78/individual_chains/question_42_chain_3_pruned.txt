Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

So, there are three planets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variation. But I remember that the TTV method is used to detect planets by the gravitational influence on each other, causing variations in their transits. But I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here. Maybe it's just context.

The question gives me some ratios. The equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. So, T1/T2 ≈ 1.4. Then, between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 2.3. So T2/T3 ≈ 2.3. Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4. Similarly, T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3. So T_eq1 is larger than T_eq2, which is larger than T_eq3. Hmm.

Then, the mass ratios: the mass of Planet1 to Planet2 is approximately 1.15. So M1/M2 ≈ 1.15. And the mass of Planet2 to Planet3 is about 1.35, so M2/M3 ≈ 1.35.

The question is: By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1? The albedo for all three is 0.3, same as Earth's.

Hmm. So I need to find (Period3 / Period1) ?

Wait, but I don't know anything about the orbital periods directly. But maybe I can relate this to the other given ratios. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T_eq = [ (L * (1 - a) ) / (16 * π * σ * D^2) ) ]^(1/4), where L is stellar luminosity, a is albedo, and D is the distance from the star (semi-major axis). Since the albedos are the same for all three planets, the ratio of their temperatures would relate to the inverse square root of their distances.

Wait, no. Wait, T_eq is proportional to (L*(1-a))^(1/4) / D^(1/2). So if L is the same for all three planets (assuming they orbit the same star), then T_eq is proportional to [ (1-a) / D ]^(1/4). But wait, (1-a) is same for all, as a=0.3. So T_eq is proportional to (1/D)^(1/4). So T_eq is inversely proportional to D^(1/4). So higher D means lower T_eq.

Alternatively, T_eq^4 is inversely proportional to D.

So, T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (D2 / D1)^(1/2). Wait
