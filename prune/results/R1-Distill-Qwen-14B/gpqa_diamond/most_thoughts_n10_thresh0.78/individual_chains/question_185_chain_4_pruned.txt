Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. Oh wait, σ is the Pauli spin matrices, right? And n is a unit vector, so it's just a direction. I remember that the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, and each is a 2x2 matrix. So, when you take the dot product with n, that's like taking the components of σ multiplied by the components of n and adding them up.

Wait, so σ · n would be σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z. Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1. But for the eigenvalues, maybe the direction doesn't matter because eigenvalues are just the possible outcomes of the observable, which depends on the magnitude.

Oh right, eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix in a particular direction. So the operator σ·n is a spin component in the direction n. Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, right? So if I have σ·n, its eigenvalues should be plus and minus 1 because each Pauli matrix when diagonalized has those eigenvalues.

Wait no, wait. Because σ·n is a linear combination of Pauli matrices. But for any direction, the eigenvalues would still be ±1. Because the magnitude of σ·n is the same as the operator's square. Let me think: (σ·n)² = (σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z)^2. Expanding that, I get each σ_i² times n_i² plus cross terms. Since σ_i² is identity matrix I for each, and the cross terms involve products like σ_i σ_j, which are anti-commuting. But wait, when you square it, the cross terms might vanish because when you multiply and add them all, the terms would involve 2σ_i σ_j for i≠j. But wait, I'm not expanding correctly.

Alternatively, I know that for any unit vector n, (σ · n)^2 = I. Because (σ · n) is like a spin-1/2 operator in the n direction, and when you square it, it's proportional to the identity. Because each Pauli matrix squares
