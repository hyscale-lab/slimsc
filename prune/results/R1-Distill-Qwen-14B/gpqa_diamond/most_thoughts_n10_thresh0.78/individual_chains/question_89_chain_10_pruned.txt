Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow and think out loud, so to speak.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step and see what's happening.

First reaction: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240Â°C. The product is a light yellow solid (product 1). The NMR and IR data are given, so I'll need to figure out what product 1 is.

1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in an adamantane structure. When dibromides react with KOH, especially in a dehydrohalogenation reaction, elimination can occur. Since there are two bromines, perhaps they undergo double elimination. Wait, but KOH is a strong base, usually leading to E2 mechanisms. So two dehydrohalogenation steps could form an alkene. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a bridged compound, so elimination could form a bridgehead double bond. Alternatively, maybe it forms a diene, but since it's a bridged structure, perhaps it's a single elimination.

Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. That makes me think of something with an exo double bond, maybe an alkene. Because alkenes can be yellowish. Alternatively, maybe it's forming an epoxide, but KOH isn't typically used for that. Wait, wait, the IR spectrum has a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So product 1 has a carbonyl group. Hmm, so what reaction with KOH would produce a carbonyl?

Wait, wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some kind of elimination or oxidation? Or perhaps elimination to form an epoxide, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a Dieckmann cyclization, but that's for esters. Wait, no, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate two HBr molecules to form a conjugated diene. Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl, so maybe it's an elimination reaction forming a ketone.

Wait, wait. Wait, when vicinal dihalides (like 1,3-dibromoadamantane) react with a strong base like KOH, they can undergo dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne. But wait, would that form a triple bond? But let's think about the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid hydrocarbon, so eliminating two HBr from 1,3-dib
