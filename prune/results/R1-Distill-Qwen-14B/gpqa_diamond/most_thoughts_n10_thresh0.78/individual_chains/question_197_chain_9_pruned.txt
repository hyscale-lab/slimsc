Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and we need to find the final product. The options are A, B, C, D, all of which are various substituted benzoic acids or isomers of benzene with substituents.

First, let me look at the spectroscopic data given. The IR and NMR should tell me about the structure of Compound X.

Starting with the IR data: peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1 usually indicate an O-H or N-H stretch. But the region is broad, so maybe it's an O-H from a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, it could be an alcohol or maybe an amine, but considering the other peaks, let's see.

Another peak is at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong peak, likely a carbonyl group (C=O). So maybe it's a ketone, aldehyde, acid, or ester. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions might be aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound probably has an aromatic ring, possibly with substituents.

Looking at the NMR data now. The 1H NMR shows several signals:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm is typical for an aldehyde proton. Wait, no, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, it could be an acidic proton, like from a carboxylic acid. Wait, but wait, carboxylic acid protons are usually broad and around 10-12 ppm. So that fits. So maybe this is a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but in the IR, the carbonyl is at 1720 cm-1. Carboxylic acids typically have a carbonyl around 1700 cm-1. But maybe that's stretching because of conjugation or other factors. Alternatively, could it be an ester? Esters have carbonyl around 1740 or so, but 1720 is a bit lower. Maybe a ketone? No, because then where's the O-H?

Wait, but in the IR data, the 3400–2500 region is a broad peak, which might suggest an O-H stretch. If Compound X has a carboxylic acid group, that would explain the broad O-H in IR and the 10.5 ppm peak in NMR.

So perhaps Compound X is a benzoic acid derivative. Let's look at the other NMR signals.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). Those are typical for an aromatic ring with two substituents para to each other. Like a para-substituted benzene, where each substituent is in the para position. So the two doublets are probably from the aromatic protons next to substituents.
