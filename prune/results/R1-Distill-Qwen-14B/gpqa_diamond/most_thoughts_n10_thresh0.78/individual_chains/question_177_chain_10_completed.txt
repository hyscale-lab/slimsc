Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their radii and masses are in a 1.5:1 ratio, meaning Star_1 is larger in both. The astronomers found that the wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. Also, their radial velocities are zero and 700 km/s respectively. We're told to assume they radiate as black bodies and compute the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2.

Hmm, right. So I remember that for black bodies, the peak wavelength emitted depends on their temperature. The formula I think is Wien's Law: lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same, because lambda is the same. That's a key point.

Wait, but wait. The radial velocities are given. Radial velocity is the speed at which the star moves towards or away from us. How does that affect the observed wavelength? Oh, right, that's the Doppler shift. If a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, and if moving away, redshifted. The formula for Doppler shift is something like lambda_observed = lambda_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light.

Wait, but in this problem, the observed brightest wavelengths are the same. So the rest wavelength (emitted by the star) might be different, but due to Doppler shift, we observe the same lambda. Oh, but wait, the question says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. Hmm, so the observed lambda is the same for both. But the rest lambda (the actual emission peak) would depend on their temperatures, which might be different. Because if a star is moving, it shifts the observed peak.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. If I have two stars with different temperatures, but due to Doppler shift, their observed peak wavelengths are the same. So their rest wavelengths would be different. Because:

Star_1's observed lambda (lambda_1) = lambda_1_rest * (1 + v1/c)
Similarly, for Star_2: lambda_2 = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v2/c)

But lambda_1 = lambda_2 (given same observed). So:

lambda_1_rest / lambda_2_rest = (1 + v2/c) / (1 + v1/c)

But wait, no. Let me correct that. Since lambda_1 = lambda_1_rest * (1 + v1/c), assuming v1 is the radial velocity for Star_1. Similarly for Star_2: lambda_2 = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v2/c).

But the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same, so lambda_1 = lambda_2. So,

lambda_1_rest * (1 + v1/c) = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v2/c).

But I also know from Wien's Law that lambda_rest is inversely proportional to temperature. So lambda_1_rest = b / T1, lambda_2_rest = b / T2. So substituting,

(b / T1) * (1 + v1/c) = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c).

The b's cancel, so:

(1 + v1/c) / T1 = (1 + v2/c) / T2.

Rearranging, T2 = T1 * [ (1 + v2/c) / (1 + v1/c) ) ]

Wait, but what are the velocities? The question says radial velocities are 0 and 700 for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. So v1 is 0 km/s, and v2 is 700 km/s.

So substituting:

T2 = T1 * [ (1 + 700/c) / (1 + 0/c) ) ].

But c is about 3e5 km/s, so 700 is much smaller. So (1 + 700/c) ≈ (1 + 0.002333). But for approximation, maybe we can ignore v/c for small velocities. Wait, but 700 is about 0.0023% of c. So (1 + 700/c) ≈ 1.002333. Divided by 1, so T2 ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

Hmm, so T2 is approximately 1.002333 times T1. So T2 ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

Wait, but the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same. So the Doppler shift accounts for a small difference in their temperatures. So Star_2 has a slightly higher temperature than Star_1, because it's moving away (since v2 is +700, assuming that's positive as moving away), which would cause a redshift. So the observed lambda would be longer, but since Star_1 has v1=0, its emitted lambda is shorter, so that when you apply the Doppler shift, they have the same observed lambda. So T2 is a bit higher than T1.

But I'm not sure if the velocities are significant enough to make a difference. Let's see, maybe the velocities are small compared to c. So 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s. Speed of light is 3e8 m/s, so 700,000 / 3e8 is roughly 0.002333, so 0.2333% of c. So the Doppler shift factor is about (1 + 0.2333e-3) ≈ 1.0002333. So the temperature ratio would be about T2 = T1 * (1 + 700/(c)). So T2 is about 0.23% higher than T1. So the temperature difference is small.

But perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler shift because the velocities are so small? That would make the temperature T1 = T2. Because if v is zero, then lambda_rest = lambda_observed. But in this case, one star has v=0, and the other has v=700.

Wait, let me check the problem again. It says, "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So their observed wavelengths are the same. So the rest wavelengths would be different because of Doppler shift.

But for the sake of solving the problem, perhaps the velocities are negligible, so we can assume T1 = T2. Then we can proceed. Or perhaps we have to account for the Doppler shift. Hmm, but given the options, the answer is about 2.3, which suggests a factor that's more than 2.25 (option A is ~2.25, D is ~2.23), so perhaps the velocities are being considered.

Wait, but let me think. If the velocities are 0 and 700, then for Star_2, it's moving away, so its observed wavelength is longer. To have the same observed wavelength as Star_1, which is at rest, Star_2 must have a higher temperature. Because a higher temperature would emit a shorter rest wavelength, which when shifted by the Doppler effect, would match Star_1's observed wavelength.

Wait, maybe that's a bit more precise. Let me model it.

Let’s denote:

Star_1: v1 = 0, so lambda_1_observed = lambda_1_rest = b / T1.

Star_2: v2 = 700 km/s (assuming moving away, so positive velocity), so lambda_2_observed = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v2/c) = (b / T2) * (1 + 700/c).

But lambda_1_observed = lambda_2_observed. So:

b/(T1) = (b/T2) * (1 + 700/c)

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + 700/c)

So T2 = T1 * (1 + 700/c )

Wait, but 700/c is 700 / (3e5) = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.02333.

Wait, that's about 2.333% So 1 + 0.02333 is 1.02333.

So T2 = T1 * 1.02333.

So T2 is about 2.33% higher than T1.

So now, knowing that, I can proceed to calculate the luminosity.

Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

We know R1 = 1.5 R2. So (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

We have T2 = T1 * 1.02333. So T1/T2 = 1/1.02333 ≈ 0.97728.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (0.97728)^4 ≈ let's compute that.

0.97728^2 = (approx) 0.97728 * 0.97728. Let's compute:

0.97728 * 0.97728 ≈ 0.977^2 = (1 - 0.023)^2 = 1 - 0.046 + 0.000529 = approx 0.9545.

Wait, perhaps exactly:

0.97728 * 0.97728:

= (0.97 + 0.00728)^2.

= 0.97^2 + 2*0.97*0.00728 + (0.00728)^2.

0.97^2 = 0.9409.

2*0.97 *0.00728 = 2 * 0.0070796 = 0.0141592.

0.00728^2 ≈ 0.000053.

Adding up: 0.9409 + 0.0141592 = 0.955059 + 0.000053 ≈ 0.955112.

So (0.97728)^2 ≈ 0.955112.

Then (0.955112)^2 = (approx 0.955)^2 ≈ 0.912025.

Wait, but let's compute 0.955112 * 0.955112:

0.95*0.95 = 0.9025.

0.95 * 0.005112 * 2 = 0.95 * 0.010224 ≈ 0.009713.

(0.005112)^2 ≈ ~0.000026.

So total approx 0.9025 + 0.009713 + 0.000026 ≈ 0.91224.

So (0.955112)^2 ≈ 0.91224.

So (0.97728)^4 ≈ 0.91224.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * (0.91224) ≈ 2.25 * 0.91224.

Let me compute that.

2.25 * 0.9 = 2.025.

2.25 * 0.01224 = approx 0.02754.

So total is approx 2.025 + 0.02754 = 2.05254.

Wait, but wait, that's 2.05, but the options are around 2.23 to 2.35. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the T ratio. Let me double-check.

Wait, earlier I thought T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c). But wait, wait. Because v is the radial velocity. If the star is moving away (v positive), then the observed wavelength is longer. So the star's emitted wavelength must be shorter to result in the same observed wavelength.

So let me re-express that. Using the Doppler formula correctly.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is lambda_observed = lambda_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ) for relativistic speeds, but for non-relativistic speeds, it's approximately lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + v/c).

But since v is 700 km/s, which is non-relativistic (as 700 is much less than c), we can use the approximation.

So for Star_2, which is moving away at 700 km/s, the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted wavelength.

So lambda_obs_2 = lambda_emit_2 * (1 + v2/c).

Similarly, lambda_obs_1 = lambda_emit_1 (since v1=0).

Since lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2,

lambda_emit_1 = lambda_emit_2 * (1 + v2/c).

From Wien's law, lambda_emit = b / T.

So for Star_1: lambda_emit_1 = b / T1.

For Star_2: lambda_emit_2 = b / T2.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c )

Wait, that's what I had earlier. So that part is correct.

But wait, v2 is positive because it's moving away, so (1 + v2/c) increases T2 compared to T1.

So T2 = T1 * (1 + 700/(3e5)).

700/(3e5) is 700/300,000 = 0.002333.

So (1 + 0.002333) = 1.002333.

So T2 = T1 * 1.002333.

So T1 = T2 / 1.002333.

Or T1 = T2 * (1/(1.002333)) ≈ T2 * 0.99768.

Wait, no: T2 = T1 * 1.002333 → T1 = T2 / 1.002333 ≈ T2 * 0.99768.

So T1 is about 0.99768 times T2.

Wait, so T1 is lower than T2.

So when I compute (T1/T2)^4, it's (0.99768)^4.

Wait, that's different from before. Because in my earlier calculation, I thought of T2 as 1.02333 times T1, but now I see that T2 is 1.002333 times T1. So (T1/T2) = 1/1.002333 ≈ 0.99768.

Ah, I think I messed up the earlier calculation because I thought T2 was higher than T1, but now I'm seeing that because Star_2 is moving away, its emitted wavelength is shorter, which implies higher temperature. So T2 is higher than T1.

So (T1/T2) is 0.99768.

So (0.99768)^4.

Let me compute that.

First, 0.99768 is approximately 1 - 0.00232.

We can use the approximation (1 - x)^n ≈ 1 - n x for small x.

So (0.99768)^4 ≈ (1 - 0.00232)^4 ≈ 1 - 4*(0.00232) = 1 - 0.00928 = 0.99072.

But perhaps a more accurate calculation is needed.

Alternatively, compute 0.99768^2 first.

0.99768 * 0.99768 = ?

Let me compute:

(1 - 0.00232)^2 = 1 - 2*(0.00232) + (0.00232)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00464 + 0.00000538 ≈ 0.995365.

Then square that:

0.995365^2 ≈ ?

Again, using approximation:

(1 - 0.004635)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(0.004635) + (0.004635)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00927 + 0.00002147 ≈ 0.99075.

So (0.99768)^4 ≈ 0.99075.

So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (2.25) * (0.99075) ≈ 2.25 * 0.99075.

Calculating 2.25 * 0.99075:

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.00075 = 0.0016875.

Adding them gives 2.2275 + 0.0016875 ≈ 2.2291875.

So approximately 2.23.

Looking back at the options:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23.

So the factor is approximately 2.23, so option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought the ratio came to about 2.23 when considering the Doppler effect. But if I ignore the Doppler effect (i.e., assume T1 = T2), then L1/L2 would be (1.5)^2 * (1)^4 = 2.25, which is option A. But the correct answer according to the options includes considering the Doppler shift, which brings the luminosity ratio down a bit from 2.25 to about 2.23.

So the answer should be D) ~2.23.


To determine the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

Thus, the luminosity ratio is:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

### Step 1: Radius Ratio
The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5
\]

Squaring this gives:

\[
\left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Ratio
The stars appear brightest at the same observed wavelength, meaning their observed peak wavelengths are identical. Using Wien's law, the rest wavelengths are inversely proportional to their temperatures:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

The observed wavelength is related to the rest wavelength by the Doppler shift formula. For Star_1 (at rest, \(v_1 = 0\)) and Star_2 (\(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\)):

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}}, \quad \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
\]

Since the observed wavelengths are the same:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
\]

Substituting \(\lambda_{\text{rest}} = b/T\):

\[
\frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
\]

Canceling \(b\):

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{T_2} \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = 1 + v_2/c
\]

Substituting \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}\):

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = 1 + \frac{700}{3 \times 10^5} = 1 + 0.002333 = 1.002333
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1.002333} \approx 0.99768
\]

### Step 3: Luminosity Ratio
Substitute the radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot (0.99768)^4
\]

First, calculate \((0.99768)^4\). Using approximations:

\[
(0.99768)^2 \approx 0.99536, \quad (0.99536)^2 \approx 0.99075
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.99075 \approx 2.229
\]

### Step 4: Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2. Comparing this to the options:

- **A)** ~2.25  
- **B)** ~2.32  
- **C)** ~2.35  
- **D)** ~2.23  

The correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
