Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to work through it. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, N ∝ 1/plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Parallax (plx) in arcseconds is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is the distance in parsecs.

Wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. Oh right, they're asking for the change per unit range of distance. So we're looking for the number of stars per unit distance, maybe like a differential relationship.

Let me think about the formula. If N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, and plx is 1/r, then substituting that in, N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that. (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1 divided by that is r^5. So N ∝ r^5. But wait, that's the number of stars as a function of distance. But the question is about the change in number with distance, which might be the derivative.

Wait, no, maybe not. Because the number of stars in a given region depends on how much volume there is. Oh wait, because stars are spread out in space, the number you observe depends on the volume. But here the relationship is given as a direct function of parallax, not necessarily volume.

Wait, let me think again. The question says that the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is some constant. Since plx = 1/r, substituting gives N = k * r^5. So as r increases, N increases as r^5. But wait, that seems counterintuitive because when you look further away, you'd expect fewer stars in a given area, but maybe this is a specific region where more stars are present as you go further? Hmm, but perhaps the question is about the number of stars per unit distance.

Wait, maybe the question is about the density of stars as a function of distance. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the number of stars in a shell of radius r and thickness dr
