Okay, so I've got a chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, I need to find the ΔHf for this molecule.

The molecule given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That looks a bit complex, but maybe I can break it down. Wait, perhaps it's a diene or something with multiple double bonds? Let me count the carbons. Each (CH3)2C group has three carbons, so maybe it's a longer chain with some branching and double bonds.

The data provided includes enthalpy of atomization for carbon, which is 1000 kJ/mol. Also, bond energies for H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H. So I think I need to use bond energies to calculate the enthalpy of formation.

I remember that the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the formula: 

ΔHf° = Σ (Bond energies of reactants) - Σ (Bond energies of products)

Wait, but wait—that's for reactions. Oh right, but for the formation of a molecule from its elements, I should calculate the energy required to break all bonds in the reactants and the energy released when forming all bonds in the products.

Alternatively, another approach is to consider that the enthalpy of formation is the energy change when 1 mole of the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for a hydrocarbon, that would involve carbon (graphite) and hydrogen gas.

So, the general formula is:

ΔHf = [sum of bond energies of all bonds in the compound] - [sum of bond energies of all bonds in the elements]

Wait, no, more accurately, the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the atomization approach. The formula is:

ΔHf = (Sum of bond energies in reactants) - (Sum of bond energies in products)

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the enthalpy
