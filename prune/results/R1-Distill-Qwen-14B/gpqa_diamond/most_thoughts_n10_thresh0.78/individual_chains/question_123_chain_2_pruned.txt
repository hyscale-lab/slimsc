Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says that a supernova occurred, and part of its ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is, how far does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame?

Wait, so time is measured differently in each frame. I remember that when you have different frames moving relative to each other, time dilation comes into play, right? Because of special relativity. Oh, right, the time experienced in each frame isn't the same.

So, I think I need to use the time dilation formula. The formula is t' = gamma * (t - (v x)/cÂ²), but wait, when the motion is along the x-axis, and if the events happen at the same place in one frame, then t' = gamma * t. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem says that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. We need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during that time.

Wait, but wait. The ejecta is moving at high speed relative to the Galaxy. Let me think about the frames. The Galaxy's frame is S
