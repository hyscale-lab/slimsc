Okay, so I've got this question about redshift and detecting quasars with neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm, I remember that when a quasar's light passes through a hydrogen cloud, the hydrogen absorbs certain wavelengths, like the Lyman alpha line. The Lyman alpha wavelength is about 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range.

The question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. Wait, optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet because the atmosphere absorbs that. So, if the light is shifted into the optical range, that means the wavelength must be longer than 1216 Angstroms when observed.

Redshift (z) is calculated using the formula 1 + z = observed wavelength / rest wavelength. So the observed wavelength needs to be in the optical range. What's the cutoff? Optical wavelengths are roughly 4000 Angstroms and above, I think. Let's see, visible light is about 400-700 nm, which is 4000-7000 Angstroms. So the smallest observed wavelength we can detect is around 4000 Angstroms, but maybe even longer? Or wait, maybe the limit is higher because some telescopes can go to maybe 3000 Angstroms? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, the Lyman alpha is 1216 Angstroms. When it's redshifted, the observed wavelength lambda_obs = 1216 * (1+z). We want lambda_obs to be in the range that optical telescopes can see, so let's say the lower limit is when lambda_obs is just entering the optical. Let's assume the optical starts around 3000 Angstroms (300 nm) because that's the near-ultraviolet or the start of visible. Or maybe higher, like 400 nm (4000 Angstroms). Hmm, I'm not sure. Let's work with 3000 Angstroms as the lower limit for optical.

So if lambda_obs is 3000 Angstroms, then 1 + z = 3000 / 1216 ≈ 2.466. So z ≈ 1.466. So the redshift has to be at least about 1.47. But wait, the question is about the lower limit. So anything below that would shift the wavelength below optical, meaning we can't detect it with optical telescopes.

Looking at the options: option B is 1.2, which would give lambda_obs = 1216 * (1+1.2)=1216*2.2≈2675 Angstroms. That's 267.5 nm, still in the UV, which optical telescopes can't see. So that's too low.

Option D is 1.9: 1+1.9=2.9, 1216 *2.9≈3526 Angstroms, which is 352.6 nm. That's in the near-UV, but perhaps still not visible. Wait, visible is 400-700 nm, so 352 nm is still UV. Hmm, so even at z=1.9, the observed wavelength is 3526 Angstroms, which is 352.6 nm. That's below the visible range. Oh wait, so maybe the optical telescopes can't detect it yet.

Wait, maybe the optical telescopes can detect up to around 900 nm (9000 Angstroms) in the infrared? No, I think optical is up to about 700 nm. Hmm. So perhaps I should think of the minimum z such that lambda_obs is just at 400 nm (4000 Angstroms).

So 4000 = 1216*(1+z) → 1+z=4000/1216 ≈3.29. So z≈2.29. So the redshift needs to be at least about 2.29 to have the Lyman alpha line at 4000 Angstroms. Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.29. So the lower limit would be just above 2.29, so anything above that would shift it into the optical.

But wait, that's if the optical can detect down to 4000 Angstroms. If the telescope can go a bit lower, maybe 3000 Angstroms is considered the cutoff. But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Another approach: The Lyman alpha absorption is in the UV, which isn't observable from the ground. But when the object is at a high enough redshift, the Lyman alpha line is shifted into the visible spectrum. So the minimum redshift would be when the absorption line is at the lower end of the visible, which is about 400 nm (4000 Angstroms).

So z = (4000/1216) -1 ≈ 3.29 -1 = 2.29. So the redshift needs to be at least approximately 2.3. So which option is near that?

Option C is 2.4. So the lower limit would be z≈2.29, so anything below that won't be detected. So the minimal z is about 2.29, so the answer would be 2.4, since lower z wouldn't be detectable.

Wait, but maybe the cutoff is higher? I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the possible options.

If z=2.4, then lambda_obs=1216*(1+2.4)=1216*3.4=4134.4 Angstroms, which is 413 nm. That's in the visible (violet/blue). So that's detectable. But if z is lower than that, like 2, then lambda_obs is 1216 *3=3648 Angstroms (364.8 nm), which is UV and not detectable by optical telescopes.

So the minimal redshift is when Lyman alpha is just at 400 nm. So z≈2.29. So among the options, the closest lower limit is option C)2.4, but wait option D is 1.9. Hmm.

Wait, let me recalculate:

At z=2.4, 1216*(3.4)=4134.4 Angstroms. That's 413 nm, which is visible.

At z=2.3, 1216*3.3=4012.8 Angstroms, about 401 nm, which is near the lower end of visible.

So the lower limit is when the wavelength is 400 nm. So the minimal redshift is (4000/1216) -1.

Wait, 4000/1216 is about 3.29. So z=2.29. So any z >=2.29 would place the Lyman alpha in the visible spectrum. So the minimal z is approximately 2.3.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.29, so the lower limit is 2.29. So the minimal redshift is 2.3, and so any object with a higher z would be visible. So the question is asking for the lower limit, so the minimal z is 2.29, but since the options don't have that, the next higher is 2.4 (option C). But wait, another option is D)1.9.

Wait, what's the maximum wavelength that optical telescopes can observe? Maybe I was wrong about the lower limit. Maybe the optical can go down to 3000 Angstroms (300 nm), which is near UV. But wait, ground-based telescopes can't observe UV because the atmosphere blocks it. So we can't observe 300 nm with optical telescopes. So that's not possible.

So any Lyman alpha line that is redshifted to below 400 nm (4000 Angstroms) is in the UV and not observable. So the minimal z is when lambda_obs is 400 nm, which is the start of the visible spectrum.

So to compute that: 1 + z = 4000 / 1216 ≈3.29. So z≈2.29.

So the minimal z is about 2.3. Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is higher than that. So the lower limit is 2.3, so any redshift equal to or higher than that can be detected.

Wait, but the options don't have 2.3. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So the minimal redshift is about 2.3, so the lower limit is any z >=2.3. The options have C)2.4, which is just above. So the correct answer would be C)2.4.

Wait, but someone could think that the cutoff is higher, like 450 nm. Let's see:

If lambda_obs is 450 nm (4500 Angstroms), then 1+z=4500/1216 ≈3.703. So z≈2.703. So that would make option A)3 the next possible, but 3 is much higher than 2.3.

So I think the initial assumption that the cutoff is 400 nm is correct. So the minimal z is about 2.29, so the lower limit for detectability is z≈2.3.

So the answer would be the option closest to 2.3, which is option C)2.4.

Wait, another thought: The question says 'lower limit on the redshift' such that they can be detected. So the minimal z is 2.29, so any z >=2.29 is detectable. So the lower limit is 2.29. Looking at the options, the lowest possible z that's above 2.29 would be 2.4 (C), but wait, perhaps the options expect a lower z?

Alternatively, maybe the reasoning is that the Lyman-alpha line is at 121.6 nm (1216 Angstroms). For it to be in the optical, the observed wavelength must be above 400 nm. So:

z +1 = 400 / 121.6 → wait, 121.6 nm is 1216 Angstroms, right? So:

z = (400 / 121.6) -1 = 3.291 -1 ≈ 2.291.

So yeah, about 2.3.

But the options have D)1.9 and C)2.4. So the lower limit is 2.29, so any z >=2.29 is okay. So the minimal z is 2.29, so the next possible option is 2.4. So the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the cutoff is higher. Maybe the maximum wavelength that a ground-based optical telescope can detect is about 700 nm (7000 Angstroms). Wait, no, 7000 is 700 nm. No, optical telescopes can detect up to about 700 nm (red end), but for Lyman-alpha to be in optical, it's when the observed wavelength is within 400-700 nm.

So the minimal z is when observed wavelength is 400 nm (as before), giving z≈2.29. The maximum z would be when lambda_obs is 700 nm: 7000 Angstroms.

7000 / 1216 ≈5.758. So z=4.758. But the question is about the lower limit.

So the answer should be approximately 2.3. The closest option is C)2.4.

Wait, but option D is 1.9, which is lower than 2.29. So if z is 1.9, the observed wavelength is 1216*(2.9)=3526.4 Angstroms=352.6 nm, which is UV and not detectable. So the correct minimal z is 2.3, so the lower limit is z >=2.3. The options don't have 2.3, but option C is 2.4, which is the next higher. So the correct answer is C)2.4.


To determine the lower limit on the redshift \( z \) such that large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorbing the Lyman alpha wavelength (~1216 Å) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to consider the wavelength range detectable by these telescopes. Optical telescopes can observe wavelengths approximately in the range of 400–700 nm (4000–7000 Å). Since the Lyman alpha line is in the ultraviolet range (~1216 Å), it must be redshifted into the optical range for detection.

The relationship between the observed wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)) and the rest wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{rest}} \)) is given by:

\[
1 + z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}}
\]

For the Lyman alpha line to be detectable, \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) must be at least 4000 Å (the lower end of the optical range). Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \) and \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 4000 \, \text{Å} \):

\[
1 + z = \frac{4000}{1216} \approx 3.29
\]

\[
z \approx 3.29 - 1 = 2.29
\]

Thus, the minimal redshift required for the Lyman alpha line to be detectable in the optical range is approximately \( z \approx 2.29 \). Any redshift below this value would result in the Lyman alpha line remaining in the ultraviolet range, which is not detectable by optical telescopes.

Now, analyzing the options:
- **Option A (3):** This corresponds to a redshift much higher than the calculated lower limit, so it is not the minimal value.
- **Option B (1.2):** At \( z = 1.2 \), the observed wavelength is \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 1216 \times (1 + 1.2) = 2675.2 \, \text{Å} \), which is in the ultraviolet range and not detectable by optical telescopes.
- **Option C (2.4):** At \( z = 2.4 \), the observed wavelength is \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 1216 \times (1 + 2.4) = 4134.4 \, \text{Å} \), which is in the visible range and detectable. This is slightly higher than the calculated lower limit of \( z \approx 2.29 \), making it the closest valid option.
- **Option D (1.9):** At \( z = 1.9 \), the observed wavelength is \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 1216 \times (1 + 1.9) = 3526.4 \, \text{Å} \), which is still in the ultraviolet range and not detectable.

Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift for the Lyman alpha line to be detectable with optical telescopes is approximately \( z \approx 2.29 \), and the closest valid option is **C (2.4)**.
