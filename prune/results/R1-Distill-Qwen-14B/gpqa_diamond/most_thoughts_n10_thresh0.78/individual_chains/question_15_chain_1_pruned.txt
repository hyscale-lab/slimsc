Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think through it.

So, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. They use the transit method to detect exoplanets, right? So the transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star, and the orbital distance.

Wait, but the question says both planets have already been detected via the RV method. So they know their minimum masses and orbital periods. The masses are the same, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period. Oh, and both have circular orbits.

The stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. Interesting. So, same radius but different masses. That probably affects other factors, like the star's brightness or the planet's orbital distance.

Transit probability formula... I remember the probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital size to the star's radius. Oh wait, or is it the other way around? No, wait, the probability is roughly proportional to (R_planet / R_star)Â² multiplied by (a / R_star), where 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

Wait, more accurately, the transit probability (P) is given by P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / R_s) * (something else?), but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a (e)) ), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so maybe it's just (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a / R_s) or something else.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by
