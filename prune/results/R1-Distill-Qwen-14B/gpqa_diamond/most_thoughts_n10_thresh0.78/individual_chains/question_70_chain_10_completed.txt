Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem describes a series of reactions, and based on that, I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

First, let me break down the reactions step by step.

1. Reaction 1: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
   - Hmm, 8 equivalents suggests that the molar ratio is 1 A : 8 B → 1 C.
   - What kind of compounds react in such a way? Maybe something like sulfur reacting with something else? Or perhaps a transition metal forming a complex?

2. Reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
   - 2 equivalents implies a 1:1 molar ratio for C to D → 1 E.
   - E is hazardous, so maybe something like a cyanide or a highly reactive compound?

3. Reaction 3: C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.
   - So, when C is hydrolyzed, it breaks down into A, F, and G. Since F is strong and G is weak, maybe F is HCl (strong) and G is H2SO3 or something weaker? Or maybe it's H2S, which is a weak acid.

4. Reaction 4: Gas D reacts with gas B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.
   - Common solvents like H2O, ethanol, etc. But since D and B are gases, probably something like H2O. Wait, but H is a solvent, and D and B are gases reacting 1:1. H could be H2O, but that would require D and B to be something like H2 and O2. Or maybe D is H2O and B is something else? Hmm, not sure yet.

Let me try to figure out what the substances could be.

Starting with Reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent). Since both are gases, and it's a 1:1 ratio, could it be that D is H2O and B is something else? Wait, H2O is a liquid at room temp, but maybe under reaction conditions it's a gas. Alternatively, maybe D is NH3 and B is something else. Or perhaps D is O2 and B is H2, making H2O.

Wait, another thought: B is a gas. So maybe B is H2. Then D could be O2. So D (O2) + B (H2) → H2O, which is H. But H2O is a solvent, so that fits. Alternatively, B could be Cl2 and D be something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, suppose D is H2O and B is another gas like NH3. Then D + B would produce NH4OH (which is a weak acid, but maybe that's a stretch). I'm not certain.

Let me think about Reaction 3. When C reacts with water, it produces A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So which substances when hydrolyzed produce two acids?

One possibility is that C is a metal sulfide or something else. Alternatively, C could be a salt that, upon hydrolysis, gives two different acids.

Wait, another approach: What if A is a metal, B is a halogen, and C is a halide. For example, if A is Fe, and B is Cl2, then 8 equivalents would mean Fe + 4 Cl2 → FeCl4? But FeCl4 is a liquid, not sure if it's bright red. Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur, B is something else.

Wait, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form C. Suppose A is sulfur (S8). Then, what would B be? Since 8 equivalents would be 1 S8 : 8 B → 1 C. Oh, wait, S8 plus something else. Maybe B is O2. Then sulfur burns to form SO3? No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2. S8 + Cl2 → SCl something. Wait, S8 + Cl2 on reaction could form SCl2, but that's not bright red. Alternatively, maybe C is something else.

Wait, another angle: product C, when reacted with D (2 equivalents) gives E. E is hazardous. Maybe E is SO2 or something else. Alternatively, if E is a highly toxic gas, perhaps it's HCN. Wait, but how would that come from C and D.

Wait, let's get back to Reaction 3. If C is a salt that upon hydrolysis produces two acids, perhaps it's a sulfite and something else. For example, if C is Na2SO3, then reacting with water would produce NaOH (if it's a basic sulfite), but I'm not sure. Or maybe C is Na2S. Wait, no, Na2S reacting with water would produce 2 NaOH and H2S, but H2S is a weak acid. So, if C is Na2S, then upon hydrolysis, it would produce 2 NaOH (so F is strong acid, meaning the conjugate acid is strong, so F would be HCl? Wait, no, 2 NaOH is a strong base, but F is an acid. Hmm, maybe I'm getting somewhere.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal sulfide. For example, if C is FeS, then when it reacts with water, it might produce Fe(OH)2 and H2S. But Fe(OH)2 is not very stable, perhaps it's Fe(OH)3. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride. For example, AlN reacting with water gives NH3 and Al(OH)3. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal chlorate or something similar. Wait, maybe C is a metal carbonate. But when carbonate reacts with water, it would produce CO2 and the corresponding base. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the reaction: C + H2O → A + F + G.

If F is a strong acid and G a weak acid, then perhaps C is a salt of a weak base and a strong acid. For example, if C is NH4Cl, which upon hydrolysis would produce NH4OH (which is weak, but wait, no, NH4Cl is a salt of a weak base and strong acid. So when it reacts with water, it would produce HCl (strong acid, F) and NH4OH (weak acid, G). So, then, A would be NH3. But wait, NH3 is a gas, but in the first reaction, A is a solid. So that might not fit.

Hmm, maybe C is something else. Let's think of another possibility. What about sodium selenate? Wait, not sure. Another thought: maybe C is a sulfite salt like Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it would produce 2 NaOH (so F is HCl, but wait, that doesn't fit. Or maybe F is H2SO4, but that's not right.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's look at the first reaction again. 8 equivalents of B reacting with A to form C. If A is Fe, and B is Cl2, then perhaps Fe reacts with Cl2 in a certain way. But Fe + Cl2 gives FeCl3. But 8 equivalents would imply a ratio of Fe : Cl2 as 1:3, since FeCl3 is Fe^3+ and Cl^- is 3 per Fe. Wait, but 8 equivalents of Cl2 would mean 8 moles per mole of Fe. That would be FeCl8, which I don't think exists. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, another approach: perhaps A is sulfur (S8), B is oxygen (O2). So S8 + O2 → SO3? But that's not the correct formula. Sulfur trioxide is solid, but I'm not sure about the reaction. Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and the product is SO2 or something else.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the first reaction is between a metal and a halogen. For example, sodium (a solid) reacting with chlorine gas. 8 equivalents of Cl2 per Na. But sodium has a +1 charge, so 8 Cl2 would be 16 Cl atoms. So Na + 8 Cl2 → NaCl8? I'm not sure if such a compound exists. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more along the lines of Fe and Cl2. Fe + Cl2 → FeCl3, but the stoichiometry is 2 Fe + 3 Cl2 → 2 FeCl3. So that's 3/2 equivalents of Cl2 per Fe. But the problem says 8 equivalents, so that would mean 1 Fe : 8 Cl2 → FeCl4? Not sure if that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about product E. E is formed when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. And E is extremely hazardous. What are some highly hazardous compounds? Maybe something like sarin gas, but that's probably too specific. Alternatively, E could be a cyanide compound, but that's also dangerous. Or perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like HCN, but how would that form?

Wait, another possibility is that E is a phosgene, but I don't know. Alternatively, E could be a metal cyanide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly reactive compound like O3 (ozone), but I'm not certain.

Let me think about the second reaction: C + 2 D → E.

If D is a gas, like O2, and C is a metal oxide, then perhaps E is a higher oxide. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps D is H2O. When C reacts with H2O, it produces E. But E is also produced when C reacts with D. Hmm, maybe D is O2 and C is something that when oxidized becomes E.

Wait, perhaps C is CO and D is O2. Then CO + O2 → CO2. But that's a combustion reaction, but E would be CO2, which isn't extremely hazardous (though it's a greenhouse gas). But the problem says E is extremely hazardous, so perhaps it's something else.

Alternatively, if C is NH3 and D is O2, perhaps under certain conditions E could be NO or NO2, which are toxic. But I'm not sure if that fits.

Wait, let's think about the reactions again. C reacts with water to produce A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So C is probably a salt that when hydrolyzed gives a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is ammonium sulfide (NH4)2S, then hydrolysis would produce NH3 (A), H2S (weak acid G), and maybe (NH4)2S → 2 NH3 + H2S + ... Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, if C is NaHSO3, which is sodium bisulfite. When it reacts with water, it would produce HSO3^- and Na^+ plus H2O. Hmm, but I'm not sure how that would break down.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a nitrate salt. For example, if C is Ca(NO3)2, then upon hydrolysis, it would produce Ca(OH)2 and HNO3. Since HNO3 is a strong acid (F) and Ca(OH)2 is a base, but wait, the question says two acids are formed. So maybe C is something else.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. Then when it reacts with water, it would produce 2 NaOH (so F would be HCl, but how?) Alternatively, perhaps the hydrolysis produces H2SO3 (which is a weak acid, G) and NaOH (F is strong acid, but NaOH is a base, not an acid. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe C is a chlorate, like KClO3. When it reacts with water, it's stable, but under certain conditions, it can decompose into KCl and O2. But that doesn't produce acids.

Hmm, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me think about the molecular symmetry of E. The options are symmetry groups: C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

What are these symmetry groups associated with?

- C2: has a 2-fold rotation axis. Something like H2O has C2 symmetry? No, H2O is C2v.

Wait, maybe E has a certain structure. Let's think of possible E structures.

If E is a molecule with high symmetry, like CO2 (which has D∞h symmetry) or SO2 (C2v). Alternatively, if E is something like Cl2O7 (dichlorodioxide), which has a certain symmetry.

Wait, another possibility: E could be HCN. HCN is a linear molecule, so its point group is D∞h. But is HCN extremely hazardous? Yes, it's a highly toxic gas.

So, if E is HCN, then what's the structure? H-C≡N. The molecule is linear, so its point group would be D∞h. So looking at the options, option B is D4h and C is D∞h. So if E is HCN, the answer would be C) D∞h.

But wait, how would E be formed? Let's see.

Reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to produce E. If E is HCN, then D would be a source of CN- or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps D is NH3 and C is something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me model the reactions again.

First reaction: A + 8 B → C (bright red). Suppose A is carbon (solid), B is O2. Then C could be CO, which is a gas, but I don't think it's bright red. Alternatively, if A is Fe and B is O2, maybe C is FeO. But FeO is not bright red. Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur, B is something else.

Wait, another angle: the first reaction produces a bright red product. What compounds are bright red? For example, lead dioxide (PbO2) is dark brown, but maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe C is a transition metal complex that's red. For example, some cobalt complexes are red.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide. For example, CdS is bright yellow, but maybe another sulfide is red.

Wait, another possibility: the first reaction produces a compound with SO4^2- ions. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitro compound. For example, if A is an amine and B is nitric acid, but that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the solvent H from reaction 4. If H is a common solvent, like H2O, ethanol, etc. But reaction 4 is D + B → H (solvent). Let's suppose H is H2O. Then D and B are gases that react to form H2O.

So, D + B → H2O. Since both are gases, possible combinations are H2 and O2 (but they react in 2:1 ratio, but reaction 4 is 1:1). Alternatively, maybe D is NH3 and B is HCl (but both are gases, and they would form NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. So that doesn't fit.)

Wait, another possibility: D is NO and B is O2. They react in a 1:1 ratio to form NO2, but NO2 is a liquid? No, it's a gas. Wait, but NO2 is a reddish-brown gas, but H is a solvent. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is CO2 and B is something else. For example, B could be NaOH, but NaOH is a solid, not a gas. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, D could be HCl gas and B is NaOH, but again, NaOH is a solid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps D is H2S and B is O2. They react in a 1:1 ratio to form H2O and S. But that would produce H2O (the solvent) and S (solid). But the reaction would be more complex, involving multiple steps. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is NH3 and B is HCl. They would react in a 1:1 ratio to form NH4Cl, but that's a solid, not a solvent. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try a different approach. Let's assume that E is HCN, which has D∞h symmetry. Then, in reaction 2, C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form HCN. So, C + 2 D → HCN.

If D is H2O, then C would have to provide the CN^- part. Alternatively, if D is NH3, perhaps C is something else. Or maybe D is Cl- and C is HCN minus Cl? Not sure.

Wait, another idea: perhaps D is a halogen, like Cl2. Then, reaction 2 is C + 2 Cl2 → E. If E is HCN, then perhaps C is CHCl3 or something, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a cyanide salt. For example, if C is NaCN, then reacting with Cl2 (D) could produce HCN (E) and NaCl. But the reaction would be NaCN + 2 Cl2 → HCN + 2 NaCl + something else? Not sure about the stoichiometry.

Wait, the reaction is C + 2 D → E. So, for example, if C is NaCN and D is H2O, then E would be HCN and NaOH. But how many equivalents? Let's see: NaCN + H2O → HCN + NaOH. That's a 1:1 reaction. But the problem says 2 equivalents of D, so maybe it's 2 H2O per C. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: Let's think about what E could be. If E has D∞h symmetry, like HCN, then what's its structure? It's linear, with a triple bond between C and N. The molecule is polar, with symmetry elements: a C2 axis (if looking along the C≡N axis), and mirror planes perpendicular to it. So the point group is D∞h.

What reactions produce HCN? One way is from the reaction of a cyanide salt with a strong acid. For example, KCN + H2SO4 → KHSO4 + HCN↑. But in this case, D would be H2SO4 (but H2SO4 is a liquid, not a gas, so that doesn't fit).

Alternatively, HCN can be produced from the reaction of a cyanide with a strong acid, but D has to be a gas. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe D is Cl2 and C is NaCN. Then, C + 2 Cl2 → HCN + 2 NaCl. But I'm not sure if that's a valid reaction.

Wait, another possibility: E is SO2, which is a gas and toxic. SO2 has a bent structure, so its point group is D2h or C2v? Wait, no, SO2 is a bent molecule with a bond angle around 120 degrees. Its point group is D2h. But looking at the options, option B is D4h and D is C2v. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, if E is O3 (ozone), which is a triatomic molecule with a bent structure (like O-O-O), its point group is D3h. But that's not one of the options here.

Wait, another thought: E could be Cl2O7 (dichlorodioxide), which is a linear molecule with Cl-O-Cl structure. No, Cl2O7 is a cyclic structure, I think. Wait, no, Cl2O7 is a linear molecule with each Cl connected to an O, and O in the middle. So the structure is Cl-O-Cl with other oxygens? Not exactly. I'm a bit rusty on that.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule with D4h symmetry. For example, something like XeF4, which has a see-saw geometry and D3h symmetry, so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe E is a square planar molecule, but D4h is a higher symmetry.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the reaction of C with D to produce E. If E is a compound with D∞h symmetry, perhaps it's a linear molecule like CO2 or HCN. CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry. So, if E is CO2, then what would C and D be?

CO2 is produced from the oxidation of carbon. So, perhaps C is carbon and D is O2. But let me see:

Reaction 2: C (solid) reacts with 2 D (O2) → CO2 (E). So, 2 D would be 2 equivalents of O2. But wait, the first reaction is A + 8 B → C. So if C is CO2, then A must be something that reacts with B to form CO2.

Hmm, but this is getting a bit too speculative. Let me try to outline the possibilities again.

If E has D∞h symmetry, it's likely a linear molecule. So possible candidates are HCN, CO2, NO, etc. But which of these are produced via the given reactions?

If E is HCN, then in reaction 2, C + 2 D → HCN. So, C might be a cyanide salt, and D could be a strong acid, but D must be a gas. For example, if D is H2SO4 (but that's a liquid). Alternatively, D could be HCl gas. Then, C would be NaCN. So, NaCN (C) + 2 HCl (D) → HCN (E) + 2 NaCl. But would that be a 1:2 molar ratio? Yes, because each HCl provides one H+ and one Cl-.

But wait, if C is NaCN and D is HCl, then the reaction would be:

NaCN + 2 HCl → HCN + 2 NaCl.

So, that's 1 mole of C reacting with 2 moles of D, which fits the reaction equation given (C + 2 D → E). So that makes sense.

In that case, E is HCN, which has D∞h symmetry. So the molecular symmetry group would be D∞h → option C.

Now, let's check Reaction 3: C (NaCN) reacts with water to produce A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). Wait, but NaCN is a salt. When NaCN reacts with water, it hydrolyzes:

NaCN + H2O ↔ HCN + NaOH.

So, in this case, A would be NaOH, but NaOH is a strong base, not a solid. Wait, in the problem statement, A is a solid. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a different cyanide salt. Let's say C is KCN. Then, KCN + H2O → HCN + KOH. So, A would be KOH, which is a solid. F would be HCN (a weak acid, but the problem says F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. Wait, no, in this case, F would be HCN, which is weak, and G would be KOH, which is a strong base, not an acid. That doesn't fit the description.

Hmm, maybe I'm making a wrong assumption about C. Let me think again. If E is HCN, then C must be a cyanide salt, but when it's hydrolyzed, it produces a strong acid and a weak acid. Let me think of another possibility.

Wait, if C is a metal carbonate, like CaCO3. When it reacts with water, it doesn't hydrolyze much. Alternatively, if C is a hydroxide, like NaOH, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes to produce NaOH (strong base, so F would be HCl, maybe, but that's not matching the reaction.

Wait, another approach: perhaps C is a nitride, like NH4N3. But that's more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe C is a chlorate, like KClO3. Upon hydrolysis, it could produce HClO3 (strong acid?) and KCl. But I'm not sure about the strength of HClO3. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrolysis produces HClO3 and KCl, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's go back to the scenario where E is HCN, thus D is HCl, and C is NaCN. Then, when C (NaCN) reacts with water, it produces HCN (weak acid, G) and NaOH (strong base, but the problem says F and G are acids). So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a different compound. Let's consider if C is Na2SO3. Then, when it reacts with water, it produces HSO3^- and OH^- ions. But that doesn't give two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixture of salts. Hmm, not likely.

Wait, perhaps C is a diacid salt, like NaHSO4. But NaHSO4 is more stable in solution as H+ and SO4^2-.

Alternatively, maybe C is a bisulfate, like Na2SO4·2H2O. But I'm not sure.

Another thought: perhaps C is a sulfonate ester. When it hydrolyzes, it produces a strong acid and a weak acid. I'm not familiar with such a reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed salt, like magnesium nitrate sulfate. But that's a stretch.

Wait, maybe C is a metal carbonate like CaCO3. When it reacts with water, it doesn't hydrolyze much, but under certain conditions, it can produce CO2 and Ca(OH)2. But CO2 is a gas, and Ca(OH)2 is a weak base. So, F and G would be CO2 (weak acid) and Ca(OH)2 (weak base), which doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm going down the wrong path. Let me think about the other reactions again.

Reaction 4: D + B → H (a solvent). If D is H2O and B is something else, like NH3, then H could be NH4OH (which is a weak acid and a solvent). But earlier I thought H is a solvent, but D and B are gases. H2O (D) and NH3 (B) would react to form NH4OH (which is a liquid and a solvent). So, in that case, D is H2O, B is NH3, H is NH4OH.

Then, looking back at Reaction 2: C + 2 D → E. D is H2O, so C + 2 H2O → E.

If E is HCN, then C would have to be a compound that when reacted with water produces HCN. For example, if C is NaCN, then NaCN + H2O → HCN + NaOH. But that's a 1:1 reaction, but in our case, 2 equivalents of D (H2O) are used. So perhaps C is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps C is (NH4)2CN. Then, when it reacts with water, it could produce HCN and some ammonium hydroxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: if C is KCN, and D is H2O, then:

C (KCN) + 2 H2O → HCN (G) + KOH (F). But F is a strong acid, KOH is a strong base. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe C is a different compound.

Wait, perhaps C is a cyanide salt, and when it reacts with a strong acid (like H2SO4), it produces HCN. But in this case, D would be H2SO4, but it's a liquid, not a gas. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps D is HCl gas, which is a strong acid. So, if C is a cyanide salt, like NaCN, then:

NaCN + 2 HCl → HCN + 2 NaCl.

So, in this case, D is HCl (gas), B is something else. From reaction 4:

D (HCl) + B → H (solvent). H is a solvent, so what could that be? HCl + B → solvent. If B is NH3, then HCl + NH3 → NH4Cl (solid), which isn't a solvent. Alternatively, if B is something else.

Wait, perhaps B is O2. Then, D is HCl. So, HCl + O2 → H2O? No, that's not a direct reaction. Alternatively, maybe B is C (solid carbon), and D is HCl. Then, C (carbon) + HCl → CHCl or something, but not sure.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Let me try to summarize what I have so far.

Assuming E is HCN (D∞h symmetry), which is produced when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. If D is HCl, then C is NaCN. Then, in reaction 3, C (NaCN) reacts with water to produce A (NaOH), F (HCN, weak acid?), but the problem states F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So, this doesn't fit because NaOH is a base, not an acid.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a different compound that when hydrolyzed produces a strong acid and a weak acid.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester. For example, if C is CH3SO3Na (sodium methyl sulfonate), then hydrolysis would produce CH3SO3H (a weak acid, perhaps) and NaOH. But again, F would be NaOH, a base, not an acid.

Alternatively, maybe C is a mixed anhydride. For instance, if C is something like HSO4^- combined with another acid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: when C is hydrolyzed, it produces two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). So perhaps C is a salt of a weak acid and a strong acid. For example, if C is NaHSO3, then hydrolysis would produce HSO3^- (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). But again, that gives a base, not an acid.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate salt. For example, NaNO3. When it reacts with water, it doesn't hydrolyze much. Alternatively, maybe in acidic conditions, it produces HNO3.

Wait, perhaps C is a phosphate salt. For example, NaH2PO4. When it reacts with water, it could produce H2PO4^- (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). Again, not fitting.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate, like Na2CO3. When it reacts with water, it produces CO3^2- and OH^-. So, in solution, it can hydrolyze to produce CO2 and H2O, but that's not two acids.

Hmm. Maybe I'm stuck here. Let me think of the possible answer based on the symmetry.

If E is HCN, it's linear, D∞h symmetry. So the answer would be C.

Alternatively, if E is SO2, which is bent, its point group is D2h, which isn't in the options. So, the options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Another possibility: E is a molecule with C2v symmetry. For example, H2O has C2v symmetry. But H2O isn't extremely hazardous. Alternatively, SO2 has C2v symmetry? Or maybe O3 has C2v? Not sure.

Wait, O3 has a bent structure with a central O, so its symmetry is D3h, I think. So not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a square planar molecule, but that's more about D4h symmetry.

Wait, another thought: E could be Cl2O, which has a bent structure, but I'm not certain about its symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe E is a molecule with C2v symmetry, like H2S. But H2S isn't extremely dangerous, though it's toxic.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule with C2 symmetry. For example, H2O has C2v, but maybe another molecule.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D∞h, which is option C. So the answer would be C.


The problem involves a series of reactions leading to the identification of the molecular symmetry group of product E. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. This suggests a high molar ratio reaction, possibly involving a transition metal or a compound with specific electronic properties to appear bright red.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. This indicates E is likely a highly toxic or reactive compound.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and two acids, F (strong acid) and G (weak acid). This implies C is a salt that hydrolyzes to produce acids, with F being strong and G weak.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. This suggests D and B are gases that react to form a common solvent, likely water (H₂O).

### Key Analysis of E:
- E is described as extremely hazardous. Possible candidates include highly toxic gases like HCN (hydrogen cyanide), SO₂ (sulfur dioxide), or Cl₂O₇ (dichlorodioxide).
- The molecular symmetry group of E depends on its structure:
  - **HCN** is a linear molecule with a triple bond between C and N, belonging to the **D∞h** symmetry group.
  - **SO₂** is a bent molecule with **D2h** symmetry, but this is not among the options.
  - **Cl₂O₇** is a nonlinear molecule with **C2v** symmetry.

### Consistency with Reactions:
- If E is HCN, it aligns with the reaction conditions:
  - Reaction 2: C (a cyanide salt like NaCN) reacts with 2 equivalents of D (HCl gas) to form HCN.
  - Reaction 3: C (NaCN) hydrolyzes with water to produce HCN (weak acid, G) and NaOH (strong base, but misaligned with F being a strong acid).
  - Despite some inconsistencies in Reaction 3, HCN fits the description of E as extremely hazardous and linear, with **D∞h** symmetry.

- Other candidates like SO₂ or Cl₂O₇ do not align as well with the reaction conditions or symmetry options.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible candidate for E is HCN, which has **D∞h** symmetry. This matches the description of E as extremely hazardous and aligns with the reaction conditions, despite minor inconsistencies in Reaction 3.
