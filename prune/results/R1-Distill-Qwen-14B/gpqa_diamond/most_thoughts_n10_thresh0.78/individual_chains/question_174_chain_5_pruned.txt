Okay, so I have this physics problem here about nuclear fission and the kinetic energy of the fragments. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Let me read the question again. An atomic nucleus with mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Wait, the question is about the difference between the relativistic and the classical T1. So I need to calculate both and find the difference.

First, I'll note down the given data:

- Initial rest mass energy of nucleus: 300 GeV.
- After fission, two fragments: let their rest masses be m1 and m2.
- m1 = 2 * m2 (since one is twice as massive as the other).
- m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.

So M is the initial mass. Let me express everything in terms of M.

Wait, but the initial rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. So, E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV. But when fission happens, the sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of M. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

Since m1 = 2 m2, let's substitute. So 2 m2 + m2 = 0.99 M → 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.33 M. Then m1 = 0.66 M.

Wait, but the initial mass is M. So the total mass after fission is 0.99 M, which is less than M. That makes sense because in fission, mass is converted into energy (the binding energy, etc.), so the rest mass decreases.

But wait, the initial rest mass is M. The rest mass after is 0.99
