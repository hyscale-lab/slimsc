Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, let me read it again and break it down step by step. 

The question is about a series of reactions leading to a final product, and we need to determine how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present. Let me outline the steps to understand what's happening.

The first step says that 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1.

Wait, okay. So the starting material is a bicyclic compound with a tert-butoxy group. The other reagent is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. I think this might be a Diels-Alder reaction because the starting bicyclo compound is a diene, and the other compound has two dienophile groups, maybe?

Wait, no. Let me think. The starting compound is a diene, the other is a dienophile perhaps. But wait, the other reagent is a cyclohexadiene with two dibromomethyl groups. Hmm, maybe the reaction is more about alkylation or some coupling.

Wait, I remember that when dienes react with dienophiles, it's Diels-Alder. But in this case, the other reagent has two dibromomethyl groups, which are good leaving groups. So maybe it's a [4+2] cycloaddition, but perhaps in a different setup.

Wait, sodium iodide is present. Oh! That's a nucleophilic substitution condition. But wait, the main starting material has a bicyclo structure. The other molecule has two bromomethyl groups on a cyclohexadiene ring.

Wait, perhaps the tert-butoxy group is acting as a nucleophile. But wait, tert-butoxy is O-t-Bu, which is a poor nucleophile because it's bulky. Unless it's a leaving group? Or maybe the reaction is a Diels-Alder between the bicyclo diene and the other di
