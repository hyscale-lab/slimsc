Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry reactions, specifically sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct products for each of the three reactions given and then match them with the options provided.

Let me start by recalling what sigmatropic rearrangements are. I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a sigma bond along with the movement of pi bonds, and they often follow pericyclic [n]migrations, like the Cope and Claisen rearrangements. Oh wait, the question says that these reactions are usually thermodynamically favored, so they tend to form more stable products.

Looking at the first reaction:

1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) â†’ A

Hmm, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. So that's an amine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon. The structure would be something like (CH3O)2CH-NH2. Wait, no, ethanamine is CH3CH2NH2, but here it's 1,1-dimethoxy, so ethan-1-amine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon. So, (CH3O)2CH-NH2.

But-3-en-2-ol is CH2CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol structure. Butene is four carbons. So but-3-en-2-ol would be: CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, wait, no. Let me think again. The double bond is between 3 and 4 carbons if it's 3-en, but wait, but-3-ene is CH2CHCH2CH2? No, buten-3-ene would be CH2CH2CH=CH? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol would have the hydroxyl on C2, and the double bond between C3 and C4. So structure is CH2(OH)CH2CH2CH2? Wait, no, the formula is CH2CH(OH)CH
