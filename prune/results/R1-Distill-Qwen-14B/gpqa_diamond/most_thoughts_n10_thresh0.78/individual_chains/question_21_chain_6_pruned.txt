Okay, so I have this chemistry question to solve. Let me read it carefully and try to break it down. 

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. It also talks about tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I think I remember that tautomerism involves the movement of a hydrogen atom and the shift of a bond, leading to different structures, like in keto-enol tautomerism. And optical isomerism has to do with chirality, where a molecule has a plane of symmetry or not.

The problem has two parts, A and B. Let me look at each part separately.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which doesn't show tautomerism. 

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. Quinones are diketones, right? So benzoquinone would have two ketone groups on a benzene ring. Now, ketones can undergo tautomerism if there's a neighboring group that can stabilize the enol form. Wait, but benzoquinone has two ketone groups adjacent—like in para positions? Or maybe it's in a ring where the enol form isn't possible because there's no adjacent H's. Let me think. If the molecule has two ketones across a ring, like para positions, maybe the enol form isn't feasible because each ketone might not have an adjacent H to form the enol. Alternatively, perhaps the structure isn't conducive to keto-enol tautomerism because the necessary H isn't present. For example, if the carbonyl groups are too far apart, maybe the tautomerism isn't possible. Wait, benzoquinone is like a benzene ring with two ketone groups. So the structure is O=C6H4-C=O, but in positions 1 and 4 or 2 and 5? Actually, benzoquinone can have two forms: para-benzoquinone (1,4) and ortho (1,2). Para is more common. Now, can para-benzoquinone undergo keto-enol tautomerism? Well, for keto-enol, you need adjacent H. If the two carbonyls are opposite, maybe each has a hydrogen adjacent, but perhaps they can't form tautomerism because the structure isn't conjugated enough or maybe the necessary H isn't present. Or wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone doesn't have any H on the carbon next to the carbonyl group. Oh wait, benzene rings are aromatic, so the carbons are sp² hybridized. So each carbonyl carbon in benzoquinone is connected to two other carbons and one oxygen. So maybe there's no H on that carbon adjacent. So the structure would be like O=C-C6H4-C=O. Wait, no, wait. Benzoquinone is O=C6H4-C=O. But each of the carbons where the oxygen is double-bonded is part of the ring. So each of those carbons has only three substituents: two from the ring and one from the oxygen. So each carbonyl carbon is attached to two ring carbons. So in that case, there's no H on the carbonyl carbon because it's double-bonded to O. So no H to form the enol. Therefore, benzoquinone can't undergo tautomerism because the carbonyl carbons don't have H attached. So benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism.

What about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione? That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with three O=C groups. Let me think: each of those carbonyl carbons is attached to two CH2 groups, perhaps? Wait, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring of CH2 groups. So, when you have trione, three of the carbons are carbonyls. Wait, no. Wait, 1,3,5-trione would have three ketone groups. So each of those carbons would be attached to two other carbons (from the ring) and the double-bonded O. So each carbonyl carbon is connected to two ring carbons—so no H on those carbons. Therefore, no H to form the enol. So wait, can cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione undergo tautomerism? No, because each carbonyl group is at a position where the adjacent carbons don't have H on the same carbon as the carbonyl.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so it can't have any H. So in both benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the carbonyl carbons have no H. Therefore, neither can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. But wait, that's conflicting with the question, because the question says one of them doesn't show tautomerism. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait another possibility: maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism, while benzoquinone can't. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again: for tautomerism, the molecule must have a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl group. Alpha means adjacent to carbonyl. So, if the carbonyl is on a carbon that's connected to another carbon that has a H, then that H can move, leading to tautomerism.

Benzoquinone: each carbonyl is on a benzene ring. The adjacent carbons (the ones next to the carbonyl) are part of the ring. Each is bonded to two other ring carbons and a substituent—maybe no H. Wait, in a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to two other ring carbons and two H's (unless substituted). Wait, no, in benzoquinone, two of the carbons are double-bonded to O. So the structure is a benzene ring where two of the carbons are carbonyls. The adjacent carbons (ortho positions) have only two substituents: the ring and another ring carbon. So, each ortho carbon would have two H's. Wait, but wait, in the case of benzoquinone (let's say the para positions), the structure is O=C6H4-C=O. So the carbons adjacent to each carbonyl are the positions 2 and 6 for one carbonyl, and 3 and 5 for the other. Each of these adjacent carbons
