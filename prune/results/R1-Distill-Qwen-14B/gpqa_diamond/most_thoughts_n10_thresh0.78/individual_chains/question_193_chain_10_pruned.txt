Okay, so I have this astronomy question here. Let me read it again. Hmm. It says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. The options are A to D, which are various powers of r.

Wait, I remember that parallax and distance are related. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/distance, or plx = 1/r, where r is the distance. So if plx is small, the distance is large, and vice versa.

The number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/r, substituting that in gives N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that exponent. (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1 over that is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. Oh, right, that is the differential, like the change in N for a small change in r. So I think I need to find dN/dr, the rate of change of number of stars with distance.

Since N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr would be proportional to 5 r^4. Because the derivative of r^5 is 5r^4. So the number of stars increases with distance as r^4.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The number of stars in a region as a function of distance. So if N ∝ r^5, then for each unit increase in r, the number of stars increases by 5 r^4. So the rate of change is proportional to r^4.

Looking at the options, option C is r^4, option B is r^5. Oh, so the question is about how the number changes with distance, so the rate, which is r^4. So the answer should be option C.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the way the question is phrased. Let me double-check. The question says, "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)
