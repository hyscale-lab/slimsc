Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through it. The question is about finding the expectation value of an operator involving sigma_z and sigma_x for a spin-half particle.

Alright, the setup: the particle is in a state that's a linear combination of spin-up and spin-down states. Specifically, it's 0.5|↑⟩ plus sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Wait, but these |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of sigma_z, right?

The operator we're looking at is 10σz +5σx. So, the expectation value would be the average value we'd measure for this operator on this state.

Hmm, expectation value formula is <ψ| O |ψ>, where O is the operator. So here, O is 10σz +5σx. Breaking it into parts might make it easier. Let me compute each part separately.

First, let's find the expectation value of σz, then multiply by 10. Similarly, find the expectation of σx and multiply by 5, then add them together.

Wait, but to compute the expectation of σz, since our state is already expressed in terms of its eigenstates, it should be straightforward. Because |↑⟩ is an eigenstate of σz with eigenvalue +1 and |↓⟩ is eigenstate with eigenvalue -1.

So, the state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. The square of the coefficients gives the probabilities. So, |0.5|^2 is 0.25 and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4. So, 25% chance spin-up, 75% spin-down.

So, the expectation value of σz is (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. Multiply by 10, that's -5.

Now, the tricky part is σx. σx is the Pauli x matrix. Since our state isn't an eigenstate of σx, the expectation might be more involved. Let me recall σx in matrix form. It's [[0,1],[1,0]]. So in the σz basis, the state |↑⟩ is [1;0], |↓⟩ is [0;1].

So, writing the state ψ as a vector. The state is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩, which corresponds to the vector [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. 

The expectation value of σx is given by ψ† σx ψ. Let's compute that.

So, let's compute ψ† σx ψ. σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when we multiply, first, σx times ψ:

σx times [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] equals [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]. Then, ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] as a row vector.

So, ψ† (σx ψ) is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) ) = (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) = sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So, the expectation value of σx is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.866. Multiplying by 5 gives about 4.33.

Wait, wait, wait. No. Wait, no. I think I made a mistake here. Because the expectation value calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, no, that's correct. Because the state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩, so when you compute ψ†σx ψ, that's the expectation of σx.

So, the expectation is approximately 0.866. So 5 times that is about 4.33.

Then, the total expectation value of 10σz +5σ
