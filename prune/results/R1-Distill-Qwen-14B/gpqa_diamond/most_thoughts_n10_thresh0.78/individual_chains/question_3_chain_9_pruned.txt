Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the expectation value of a certain operator for a given state. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh wait, and |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, which is the Pauli z matrix. Right, σz has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for those states, I recall.

The operator we're looking at is 10σz +5σx. We need the expectation value of this operator. Oh, expectation value. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator and |ψ⟩ is the state.

So breaking it down, this operator can be split into two parts: 10σz and 5σx. So the expectation value will be the sum of the expectation values of each part. That is, ⟨10σz +5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That should make things easier because I can find each expectation separately.

First, find ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward. The expectation value of σz in state |ψ⟩ is the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

The state is ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩. Let me calculate the coefficients squared for the probabilities. The square of 0.5 is 0.25, and the square of sqrt(3)/2 is (3/4) = 0.75. So the probability of being in |↑⟩ is 0.25, and in |↓⟩ is 0.75.

Wait, σz has eigenvalues +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. So the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So that part is -0.5.

So 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Next, I need to find ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix, which I think has eigenstates that are different from |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. So, I can't directly use the eigenstates here. Instead, I'll need to calculate the expectation value using the state ψ.

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩. Let me compute that.

First, let me write ψ as a column vector. Since |↑⟩ is usually [1; 0] and |↓⟩ is [0; 1], ψ is 0.5 [1;0] + (sqrt(3)/2) [0;1] = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

Wait, wait. Wait, let me make sure. So |↑⟩ is (1,0) and |↓⟩ is (0,1). So ψ is a vector with first component 0.5 and second component sqrt(3)/2.

Now, σx is the Pauli X matrix,
