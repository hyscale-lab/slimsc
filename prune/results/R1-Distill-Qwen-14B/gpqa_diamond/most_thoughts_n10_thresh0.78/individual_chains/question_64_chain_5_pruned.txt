Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem is a bit complicated, but I'll take it slowly.

So, the question says that we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams. They are heated to 200°C without air. Then, only a mixture of gases is formed. These gases are passed through several tubes.

The setup is that the gases first go through a tube filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (tube №1), then a Ca(OH)2 solution (tube №2), and finally red-hot copper (tube №3). The results are that the weights of tubes 1 and 3 increased by 3.60 grams and 0.80 grams respectively. Tube 2 didn't change in weight. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure.

The question is asking for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Alright, let's break this down. I think I'll need to figure out what the gases are, and from that, deduce what salts A and B might be.

First, looking at tube №1: Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent. It probably absorbs water, so the gas that passed through must have had water vapor. So, tube 1 gained 3.60 grams, which is likely the mass of the water absorbed. So the amount of H2O is 3.60 g. Let me calculate the moles of H2O: molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol. So 3.60 / 18 = 0.2 mol.

So that's 0.2 moles of H2O.

Next, tube №3 is red-hot copper. Red-hot copper would react with certain gases. Typically, copper reacts with oxygen or maybe carbon monoxide. The product is CuO. The mass increase is 0.80 grams. The molar mass of CuO is about 80 g/mol (Cu is ~64, O is 16), so 0.80 g is 0.80 / 80 = 0.01 mol. So 0.01 moles of CuO were formed. Since CuO is the product of the reaction between Cu and, say, CO or O2, perhaps.

Let me think about possible reactions. If the gas was CO, it would react with Cu to form CuO and CO2. Or if it's H2O vapor, but I don't think that reacts with copper at high temperatures. Wait, but the tube is red-hot, so maybe some steam could decompose, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is CO, which would react with copper.

Wait, the tube 2 (Ca(OH)2 solution) didn't gain any weight. That suggests that whatever gas passed through didn't react with it. Ca(OH)2 is a base; it would react with acidic gases like CO2, HCl, etc. If the gas didn't cause a reaction, maybe it's a neutral gas, like N2, O2, or maybe Ar, but those are unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps some other inert gas. But the main gases produced from heating salts... Hmm.

Wait, but the gases after tube 1 (which absorbed water) would have the remaining gases passing through to tube 2. Since tube 2 didn't react, perhaps the gas is O2 or N2, which are inert. Alternatively, maybe the gas is CO, but CO would react with Cu in tube 3, producing CuO and CO2.

Wait, but in tube 3, the mass increased by 0.80 g. As we calculated, that's 0.01 mol of CuO. So perhaps the gas in tube 3 is CO, which reacts as follows:

CO + Cu → CuO + C (but that's not balanced) Wait, not quite. The reaction for CO with Cu is:

2 CO + 2 Cu → 2 CuO + C (graphite) ?

Wait, maybe it's better to write the balanced equation. Let's balance CO and Cu.

Cu + CO → CuO + C

Let me balance this:

CO: 1 C, 1 O
CuO: 1 Cu, 1 O
C: 1 C.

So, to balance, let's see:

Left: 1 Cu, 1 C, 1 O.
Right: 1 Cu, 1 O, 1 C (from CuO and C).

Wait, actually, another approach. For every 2 CO molecules reacting with 2 Cu, we get 2 CuO and 1 C (as in the formation of graphite). So the
