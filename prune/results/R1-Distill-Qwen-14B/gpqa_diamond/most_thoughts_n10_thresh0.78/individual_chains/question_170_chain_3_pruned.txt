Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. An electron is in a spin state (3i, 4), and I need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that spin states are represented as vectors in a two-dimensional space. The state (3i, 4) is a two-component vector, right? So the first component is 3i and the second is 4. Maybe I should write this as a column vector. So, it would be [3i; 4].

Now, the spin operator S_y is given by the Pauli matrix sigma_y multiplied by ħ/2. Oh wait, the note says sigma_y is a matrix:

[0  -i]
[i   0]

So S_y is (ħ/2) times that matrix. So S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

The expectation value of an operator is calculated as the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator, then multiplied by the state vector. So the formula is <S_y> = ψ† S_y ψ.

Wait, ψ is the state vector. So I need to compute ψ† times S_y times ψ. Let me write that out.

First, ψ is [3i; 4], so the conjugate transpose ψ† would be [ -3 , 4* ]? Wait, wait, wait. The conjugate of 3i is -3 (since i^* is -i), right? And 4 is real, so conjugate is 4. So ψ† is [ -3, 4 ].

Now, let me compute ψ† S_y. Let me compute the matrix multiplication step by step.

Wait, S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So let me first compute ψ† times sigma_y.

So sigma_y is:

0   -i
i    0

So ψ† is [ -3, 4 ]

Multiplying ψ† * sigma_y:

First element: (-3)(0) + (4)(i) → 0 +4i =4i.

Second element: (-3)(-i) + (4)(0) →
