Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point when acetic acid is titrated with NaOH. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem states that we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So, the first thing I should probably do is calculate the concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution. 

Wait, right, when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. The formula is M1V1 = M2V2, where M is molarity and V is volume. So here, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20.00 cm³. The total volume after adding water is 40.00 cm³. So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2. Plugging numbers in: (0.05 * 20) / 40 = 1/4 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. 

Let me tackle each part one by one.

First, the equivalence point. At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid initially present. So I should calculate the moles of acetic acid. 

The initial volume is 40.00 cm³ (20+20), and concentration is 0.025 M. Moles = M * V (in liters). So 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles of acetic acid. 

Since NaOH is a strong base, it will react with acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio. So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is also 0.001 moles. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration. Volume = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10.00 cm³. 

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO^-). So the solution will be a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will be basic. 

The acetate ion will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

To find the pH, I need to calculate the concentration of acetate ions. The total volume at equivalence is 40 cm³ (initial) + 10 cm³ (NaOH) = 50 cm³, or 0.05 L. The moles of acetate are 0.001, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The Kb for acetate can be found using Kw / Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, no, wait a second. Let me recheck that. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb for acetate is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5. Let me calculate that: 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 5.405e-10. Correct.

Now, to calculate the pH, I can use the formula for a weak base. The concentration is 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis equation is: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The expression for Kb is [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ x² / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so I can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So x² = Kb * 0.02. 

x² = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. Taking square root: x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M. That's [OH^-], so pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. Therefore, pH is 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but none of the options have a pH around 9. So perhaps I made a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that at equivalence point, the solution is not just acetate but involves the sodium ions too, but sodium is a spectator ion so it doesn't affect pH. Hmm, maybe I messed up the Kb calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the Kb. Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10. That's correct. 

Wait, another thought: perhaps when calculating the concentration of acetate, I should have considered the total volume correctly. Let me see, after adding 10 cm³ of NaOH to 40 cm³, the total volume is 50 cm³ (0.05 L), so 0.001 moles / 0.05 L = 0.02 M, correct.

Hmm, but why is the pH not matching any of the options? Let's see the options for equivalence point: option A is 8.52, B is 6.73, C is 7.00, D is 6.92.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-do it.

The Kb is 5.405e-10
