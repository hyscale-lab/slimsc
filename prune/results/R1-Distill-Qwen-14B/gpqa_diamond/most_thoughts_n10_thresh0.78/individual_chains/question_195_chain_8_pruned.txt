Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about the maximum orbital period of a second planet that can still show both transit and occultation events. Both planets are in the same system, same star, same orbital plane. The first planet is given, and the second one is the one we're figuring out.

Wait, what do I remember about transits and occultations? Oh right, a transit happens when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so we lose the planet's light (if it's reflecting starlight) from our view. For both events to happen, the orbital plane needs to be edge-on enough so that the planet transits, and the orbit's inclination allows it to also be hidden behind the star.

But the problem says both planets share the same orbital plane as the first transiting planet, which I think means their orbits are aligned edge-on relative to us, allowing transits. So that's probably not the issue here.

Wait, the key here might be the orbital periods and their orbital distances. Because if the second planet's period is longer, it's farther out, but if it's too far, maybe the star's gravity doesn't allow for the necessary alignment for both events. Or maybe it's about the timing of when the second planet would be on the same side as the star relative to us.

Another thought: for both a transit and occultation to occur, the planet's orbit must be such that it can pass in front of the star (transit) and then, at some point later, behind the star (occultation). But for that to happen, the orbital period of the second planet must be such that during the time the first planet transits, the second is either in front or behind. Wait, maybe not. Maybe the problem is about the Hill sphere or the Roche limit, but I'm not sure that's relevant here.

Wait, the question states that both planets have circular orbits. So their orbits are stable, but for a planet to transit, the orbital plane must be such that the planet's path intersects our line of sight. But since both are in the same orbital plane, that's already satisfied.

Hmm, maybe the problem is about the size of the star and planet. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius and transits with an impact parameter of
