Okay, so I've got this NMR question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are between cis and trans versions of propenyl and butenyl acetates.

First, I need to recall what these compounds look like. Acetates are esters where the acid part is acetic acid. So propenyl acetate would have a propenyl group (like CH₂CH₂CH₂ but with a double bond) attached to the oxygen of the acetate.

Wait, no, wait. Propenyl is CH₂CH₂CH₂? No, wait. Propenyl is actually CH₂=CHCH₂- but I might have to think about the structure. Let me get this straight. Propenyl groups are allyl groups, right? So, propenyl would be CH₂=CHCH₂- as a substituent. Wait, but depending on where the substituents are, the structure can vary.

Wait, the options are propenyl and butenyl. So propenyl has three carbons with a double bond. Butenyl has four carbons with a double bond. So, for propenyl acetate, the structure would be something like OAc-O-CH₂CH₂CH₂, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, acetate is OAc-O-R, where R is the propenyl or butenyl group.

Right, so for propenyl acetate, the R group is propenyl, which is CH₂=CHCH₂- attached to the oxygen. Now, for the cis and trans versions, that would refer to the configuration around the double bond. But wait, in the case of propenyl acetate, since it's only a three-carbon chain, there's a double bond between C1 and C2, so the substituents on either end would be an oxygen group and a methyl group (since propenyl is CH₂=CHCH₂- or CH₂CH₂CH₂? Wait, maybe I'm confusing the substituents.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure of each option. Let's take each option:

Option C is Cis-propenyl acetate. So the structure would be OAc-O-CH₂CH₂CH₂? No
