Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is an organic one, and the options are between different propenyl and butenyl acetates, either cis or trans. The given 1H NMR data has four signals. Let me list them out:

1. 7.0 ppm, 1H, doublet, J = 16.0 Hz.
2. 5.5 ppm, 1H, a doublet of quadruplets, I think that means a dq (doublet of quartets?) or maybe a multiplet that looks like that.
3. 2.1 ppm, 3H, singlet.
4. 1.6 ppm, 3H, doublet.

Hmm. Let's think about the structure. These are all esters, so I'm picturing an acetate group (OAc) attached to some kind of propenyl or butenyl group.

First, the 2.1 ppm singlet for 3H. That's probably the acetoxy group's methyl, since in acetates, the OAc is O-C-O-(CH3)2, but wait, no, acetate esters would have the structure R-O-CO-OCH3? Or wait, no, wait. Acetate esters are R-O-CO-OCH3? Wait no, wait. Acetate esters are typically formed from acetic acid, so the structure is R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, the acetate ester would be R-O-CO-CH3, because the ester is R-O-CO-R', where R is from the acid. Wait, no, the ester is from the alcohol and the acid. So if the acid is acetic acid (CH3COOH), then the ester would be R-O-CO-CH3. So the OAc group is O-CO-CH3, right? So in the NMR, the methyl group attached to the carbonyl (CO) would be a singlet because it's attached to a carbonyl and has no neighboring Hs. That's the 2.1 ppm peak, likely the OCH3 of the acetate. Wait, no, wait. No, the acetate ester is O-CO-OCH3? No! Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me clarify.

Wait, no, wait. The structure of an acetate ester would be like R-O-CO-OCH3. Wait no, that's not right. Oh wait, no. Acetate esters are formed from acetic acid, which is CH3COOH. So when you make an ester, the structure is R-O-CO-CH3. So the carbonyl is attached to the O from the R-O group and a CH3. So the methyl group is adjacent to the carbonyl, so it's a singlet because it's only attached to the carbonyl group with no neighboring Hs. So yes, 2.1 ppm, singlet, 3H, that's the OCH3 from the acetate.

So that part makes sense.

Now, looking at the other signals. The 7.0 ppm doublet, J=16 Hz. That's a high coupling constant, which suggests it's a trans coupling. Wait, because in double bonds, the coupling between the two protons is trans, and the J is about 16 Hz for trans, while cis would be lower, maybe around 10 Hz? Wait, wait, I think the trans coupling in double bonds is higher. So a J of 16 Hz is a trans coupling.

So that proton is part of a double bond. Let's say it's a vinyl proton. So in a structure like CH2=CH-, the protons on each carbon would couple with each other. If it's a trans coupling, that suggests that the two protons are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Wait, but looking at the options, the compounds are propenyl and butenyl acetates. So the structure would be something like CH2CH2-O-CO-CH3, but wait, maybe more accurately, the structure is R-O-CO-CH3, where R is a propenyl or butenyl group.

Wait, no. Wait, the options are propenyl acetate, etc. So for propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2CHCH2-O-CO-CH3? Or perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Wait, propenyl is CH2CH2CH3 with a double bond. Wait, wait, no. Propenyl groups are like CH2=CHCH2- or CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond. Let me clarify.

Wait, propenyl is an allyl group, so propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2- as the substituent. So the ester would be, for example, CH2CHCH2-O-CO-CH3. Alternatively, perhaps it's a butenyl group, which is a four-carbon group with a double
