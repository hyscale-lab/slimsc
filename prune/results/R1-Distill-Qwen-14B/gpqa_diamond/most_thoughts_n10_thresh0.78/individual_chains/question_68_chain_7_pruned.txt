Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again.

The question says there's a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times Sz. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction, and the particle's moment is aligned with it. Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude B. The average of the z-component of the particle's moment starts oscillating. I need to find the oscillation frequency.

Hmm. I remember that in such situations, when the magnetic field changes direction, the spin precesses, leading to oscillations in expectation values. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

So, the initial state of the particle must be aligned with the initial magnetic field. Since the magnetic field is along Z, the spin state is either up or down in the Z direction. But wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma * Sz, and the energy is proportional to B·mu. So initially, the particle is in an eigenstate of Sz.

But when the magnetic field is switched to Y, the Hamiltonian changes. The new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, because the magnetic field is along Y. Oh wait, no, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the energy is -mu·B, which is -gamma * (S·B). So when B is along Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma B S_y. Alternatively, maybe it's proportional to S_y, depending on the sign. I think the exact form depends on conventions, but maybe it's H = gamma B S_y.

Wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. The energy is U = -mu·B. So when B is along Y, U = -gamma B S_y. So H = -gamma B S_y. Or perhaps it's H = - mu · B, which would be H = -gamma B S_y. Hmm.

Alternatively, sometimes the Hamiltonian is written as H = -gamma B S·n, where n is the direction of B. So in this case, n is along Y, so H = -gamma B S_y. But I'm not entirely sure about the signs
