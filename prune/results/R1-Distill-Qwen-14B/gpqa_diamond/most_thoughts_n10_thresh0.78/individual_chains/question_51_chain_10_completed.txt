Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potential energy of a charge near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step.

Right, the setup is a charge q placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of the system. The options are A to D, and I have to choose the correct one.

Wait, I remember that when a charge is placed near a conductor, it induces charges on the conductor. Since the sphere is grounded, electrons can move freely, so the induced charges will rearrange themselves. For a conducting sphere, I think the induced charge will be such that the potential on the sphere's surface is the same everywhere.

But wait, the sphere is grounded, so the potential on its surface must be zero because the ground is at zero potential. Right, because grounding means it's connected to the earth, which is at zero potential. So the sphere's potential is zero.

So, how does the charge q affect this? When you bring a charge near a grounded conductor, the conductor's induced charges will create an electric field that affects the potential. But since the sphere is a conductor, all the induced charge will be on its surface.

I think I should model this using method of images. Oh wait, right! For a conducting sphere, when you place a charge outside it, the conducting sphere's response can be modeled by a image charge inside the sphere. The image charge is located at a distance of (R^2)/d from the center, on the same line as the charge q.

Wait, the image charge method is usually used in the case of finding electric fields or potentials due to the induced charges. So for a point charge outside a conducting sphere, the image charge is given by q' = - (q R)/(d), where d is the distance from the charge to the center, and R is the radius of the sphere.

Wait, the image charge formula... I think it's q' = - (q R²)/(d² - R²)^½? Or wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the formulas. Let me think again. The image charge for a conducting sphere when a charge q is at distance d from the center (d > R) would be q' = - (q R)/(d). Because the distance from the center to the image charge is R²/d. So if the original charge is at distance d, the image is at R²/d from the center, but on the opposite side. So the distance between the original charge q and the image charge q' is d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

So the potential energy between q and q' would be the potential energy of two point charges: U = (k q q') / (separation). Substituting q' = - q R /d, and separation (d² - R²)/d.

Wait, let me calculate that:

U = k * q * (-q R/d) / [ (d² - R²)/d ]

Simplify that:

The denominator (d² - R²)/d = (d²-R²) / d, so the reciprocal is d/(d² - R²).

So U = k * (-q² R/d) * [d/(d² - R²)].

The d's cancel out, so U = -k q² R / (d² - R²).

But wait, that can't be all because the system's potential energy is the energy due to the charge and the induced charges. But since the sphere is grounded, does that affect the potential energy calculation?

Wait, another approach: the system's potential energy is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to the point d away, considering the potential due to the sphere.

But the sphere is grounded, so its potential is zero. The potential at the point d due to the sphere (when it's grounded) is zero as well. Wait, no. The sphere's potential is zero, but the point d is outside the sphere, so the potential at that point due to the sphere would be the potential due to the induced charges.

Wait, but when you bring the charge q near the sphere, the induced charges on the sphere will create a potential at the point where q is placed. The work done in bringing q there is the potential energy. So the potential energy U is q times the potential at that point due to the sphere.

But because the sphere is a conductor, the potential on its surface is zero. So the potential inside the sphere is the same as on the surface. But since the point is outside, the potential at that point is due to the induced charges, which can be found using the image charge.

Wait, so the potential at point d due to the sphere's induced charges is the same as the potential due to the image charge. So the potential V is k q' / r, where q' is the image charge and r is the distance from q' to the point d.

Wait, the image charge is at a distance of R²/d from the center, in the opposite direction. So the distance between q and q' is d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d, as before.

So the potential at the location of q (which is at distance d from the center) due to the image charge q' is k q' / [ (d² - R²)/d ].

So substituting q' = - q R/d, we get:

V = k [ (- q R/d) ] / [ (d² - R²)/d ]

Simplify that:

V = k (- q R) / (d² - R² )

So the potential energy U is q multiplied by this V, because U = q V.

So U = q * [ -k q R / (d² - R²) ) ] = -k q² R / (d² - R² )

Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see that exact expression. Let me check the options again.

Option D is U = - (1/2) k q² R / (d² - R² )

Option C: U = -(1/2) k q² R²/(d² -R^2)

Wait, where did I go wrong? Because my calculation gave U = -k q² R / (d² - R² ), but none of the options exactly match that. Wait, looking at the options:

Option A) U= - (1/2) k q² d/(d²+R² )

Option B) U= -k q² d/(d² - R² )

Option C) U= -(1/2) k q² R^2/(d² - R^2 )

Option D) U= - (1/2) k q² R/(d² - R^2 )

Hmm, so I have U = - k q² R/(d² - R² ), but the options don't have that. So maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy is the work done in assembling the system, which includes both the charge and the induced charges. But since the sphere is grounded, perhaps half of the energy is stored in the sphere and the other half is in the charge's potential energy.

Wait, I think I might have confused the potential energy in the system. Let me think again.

The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to the point d, considering the potential due to the sphere. Alternatively, it's the work done to assemble the charge and the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, another approach: The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q to the point d, plus the work done to bring the induced charges into place. But since the sphere is conducting and grounded, the induced charges are a result of the charge q.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy is equal to the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to d, which is q times the potential at d due to the sphere.

But the potential at d due to the sphere is V = k Q / d, where Q is the induced charge on the sphere. But how much is Q?

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the method of images again. The image charge is q' = - q R² / d². Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me recall the method of images for a conducting sphere.

When a charge q is placed outside a conducting sphere of radius R, the image charge is located at a distance R²/d from the center, on the same line. The image charge is q' = - q R²/d². Wait, no, wait: the image charge for a sphere is q' = - (q R²) / d².

Wait, I'm not so sure. Another approach: the potential outside a conducting sphere due to a charge q and the induced charges should be the same as the potential due to the charge and its image.

So the potential at any point outside the sphere is given by V = k q / r + k q' / r', where r is the distance from q, and r' is the distance from q'.

But in the case of a sphere, the image charge is placed such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. So for any point on the sphere's surface, the potentials from q and q' must add up to zero.

Wait, the potential at the sphere's surface (r = R) due to q is k q / R. The potential at the same point due to q' is k q' / (2 R) (if the image charge is on the opposite side, so distance from q' to point on sphere is 2 R - d? No, wait, perhaps I'm complicating.

Alternatively, the condition is that on the sphere's surface, the potential due to the charge and the image charge equals zero. So:

V_sphere = k q / R + k q' / (R') = 0,

where R' is the distance from the image charge to a point on the sphere.

If the original charge is at distance d, the image is at distance R²/d from the center on the opposite side. So when evaluating at a point on the sphere's surface (r=R), the distance from the image charge would be |d - (R²/d)|? Or perhaps |d + (R²/d)| if on the opposite side.

Wait, perhaps I should think geometrically. The original charge is at point P, distance d from the center. The image charge q' is placed so that the sphere's surface is an equipotential at zero potential.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for a formula about potential energy of a charge and a grounded sphere.

Wait, I remember that when a charge is placed near a conductor, the potential energy is the same as if it were placed in the field of the image charge. So the potential energy U is the potential energy between the charge and its image.

So using that, U = k (q)(q') / (distance between them).

Earlier I thought q' = - q R /d, and the distance between them is (d² - R²)/d.

So U = k * q * (- q R/d) / [ (d² - R²)/d ]

= k * (- q² R ) / (d² - R² )

Which is the same as before.

But none of the options match. Wait, let me look again.

Wait, the options:

Option D is - (1/2) k q² R/(d² - R^2 )

Hmm, so my calculation is giving U = -k q² R/(d² - R^2 ), but that's not any of the options. So maybe I missed a factor of ½ somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy is half of that because the energy is stored in the system, and each part (charge and image) contributes half.

Wait, no, in the method of images, the potential energy is the same as if you had the charge and the image charge. So the potential energy between them is U = k q q' / (distance). But wait, in reality, the induced charges don't have their own energy; the image charge is a model to find potentials and fields, but the actual energy might be different.

Hmm, another approach: The energy stored in the electric field of the system is given by (1/2) ε₀ ∫ E² dV, but that might be complicated.

Alternatively, the potential energy of the system when bringing the charge q from infinity to point P is the work done against the electric field, which is q multiplied by the potential at P due to the sphere.

The potential at P due to the sphere is the same as the potential due to the image charge.

Wait, earlier calculation gave V = -k q R/(d² - R² )

So the potential energy U is q * V = -k q² R/(d² - R² )

But looking at the options, none of them have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the image charge's value.

Wait, maybe the image charge is q' = - (q R²)/d² ?

Let me recalculate with that.

If q' = - q R² / d²,

Separation between q and q' is (d² - R²)/d,

So U = k q (- q R² /d² ) / ( (d² - R²)/d )

= k (- q² R² ) / ( d² (d² - R²)/d )

Simplify denominator: d (d² - R² )

So U = (-k q² R² ) / (d² (d² - R²)/d )

= (-k q² R² ) * (d) / (d² (d² - R²) )

= -k q² R² * 1/(d (d² - R²) )

Hmm, that gives U = -k q² R²/(d (d² - R²) )

Looking at the options, option A is - (1/2)k q² d/(d² + R² )

No, not matching. Option C is -(1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R^2 )

Hmm, my current U is -k q² R²/(d (d² - R²) ), which isn't any of the options. So perhaps the image charge approach isn't the right way here.

Wait, another thought: when a charge is placed outside a grounded conducting sphere, the potential energy of the system is the same as the potential energy of the charge in the field created by the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero.

The potential at point d (where the charge is placed) due to the sphere is the same as the potential due to the induced charges. But how much is that?

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy U is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to d, which is q multiplied by the potential at d.

But what is the potential at d due to the sphere?

Wait, the sphere's potential is zero, but the potential at d is not necessarily zero. The potential at a point outside a conducting sphere is given by V = k Q / r, where Q is the induced charge on the sphere.

But in this case, since the sphere is grounded, the induced charge Q is such that the potential at the sphere's surface is zero. So the potential at any point outside should be V = k Q / r.

Wait, but the potential at the sphere's surface is zero, so setting r=R, V=0: 0 = k Q / R → Q=0. But that can't be right because we have a charge q nearby. Hmm, perhaps that reasoning is incorrect.

Wait, the sphere is grounded, so the potential on its surface is the same as the ground's potential, which is zero. So the potential at the center of the sphere is also zero because it's a conductor. But how does the charge q affect this?

Wait, the presence of charge q outside the sphere will induce a charge on the sphere. The total induced charge will be such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.

So, the potential at the surface due to charge q and the induced charges must be zero. Let me denote the induced charge on the sphere as Q. The potential at the surface (r=R) due to charge q is V1 = k q / R.

The potential at the surface due to the induced charge Q is V2 = k Q / R.

But since the sphere is conducting, the induced charges reside on the surface. So the total potential at the surface is V1 + V2 = 0.

So,

k q / R + k Q / R = 0 ⇒ q + Q = 0 ⇒ Q = -q.

Wait, that can't be. Because then the induced charge is Q = -q. But that would make the potential at a point d equal to V = k Q / d = -k q / d.

So the potential energy U is q * V = q * (-k q / d ) = -k q² / d.

But that can't be right because it doesn't match any of the options either. Also, I'm ignoring something here. Wait, this approach assumes that the induced charge Q is such that the potential at the surface is zero, but that's only considering the charge q and the induced charge. But perhaps the method is oversimplified.

Wait, another take: The conducting sphere, when grounded, has a potential of zero. The charge q is placed outside. The potential at the point where q is placed is due to the sphere's induced charges. The potential energy is the charge times that potential.

The potential V at point d due to the induced charges on the sphere.

The induced charges on the sphere, when the sphere is grounded, are such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. The potential due to charge q at the sphere's surface is V1 = k q / R. The potential due to the induced charges Q on the sphere at the surface is V2 = k Q / R. The sum must be zero: V1 + V2 = 0 ⇒ Q = -q.

So the potential at point d due to the induced charges is V = k Q / d = -k q / d.

So the potential energy is U = q * V = q * (-k q/d ) = -k q² /d.

But looking at the options, option B is U = -k q² d/(d² - R² ), which is different from what I calculated here.

Hmm, perhaps this approach is missing something because the induced charge on the sphere isn't just -q. Because when the sphere is placed in the field of charge q, the induced charge distribution isn't uniform. The induced charge would be such that the sphere's surface is an equipotential.

Wait, but I think the correct approach is to model the sphere as a capacitor. When you bring a charge q near a conducting sphere, it's similar to a capacitor where the sphere acts as one plate and the charge is like the other.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy is the same as the energy stored in the capacitor. The capacitance of a conducting sphere in the presence of another charge can be considered.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the image charge method again.

Wait, when you have a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge is inside the sphere. The image charge q' is such that the sphere's surface is at zero potential. So the image charge is located at a distance of R²/d from the center, on the opposite side of the sphere relative to q.

So the potential energy of the system is the potential energy between q and q', which is U = k q q' / r, where r is the distance between them.

q' is - ( q R² ) / d².

Wait, no, I think I might have mixed up the formula. I think the image charge q' is given by q' = - ( q R ) / d. Because for a sphere of radius R, the image charge for a point charge q at distance d is q' = - q R / d.

So if q is at distance d, then the image charge is at a distance R²/d from the center (opposite side), and q' is - q R / d.

The distance between q and q' is d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

So U = k * q * (- q R/d ) / [ (d² - R²)/d ]

Simplify:

U = (-k q² R / d ) * (d / (d² - R² )) )

The d's cancel: U = -k q² R / (d² - R² )

But looking at the options, none have this. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of ½.

Wait, the potential energy between two charges is U = (k q1 q2 ) / r. But in this case, the image charge is a result of the real charge, so the actual energy stored in the system is (1/2) U, because the image charge is a model and you shouldn't double count.

So perhaps the correct potential energy is (1/2) times what I calculated.

So U = -(1/2) k q² R/(d² - R² )

Looking at the options, option D is this: U = - (1/2) k q² R/(d² - R^2 )

Ah, so that would be the correct answer, option D.


To calculate the net potential energy of the system, we consider a charge \( q \) placed at a distance \( d \) from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius \( R \). The sphere is grounded, meaning its potential is zero. The presence of the charge \( q \) induces charges on the sphere's surface, and the system's potential energy can be determined using the method of images.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Induced Charges and Image Charge**:  
   When a charge \( q \) is placed outside the sphere, it induces charges on the sphere's surface. The sphere's potential remains zero due to grounding. The induced charges can be modeled using an image charge \( q' \) located inside the sphere at a distance \( \frac{R^2}{d} \) from the center, on the opposite side of the sphere relative to \( q \). The image charge is given by \( q' = -\frac{q R}{d} \).

2. **Potential Energy Calculation**:  
   The potential energy of the system is the energy between the charge \( q \) and its image charge \( q' \). The distance between \( q \) and \( q' \) is \( \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d} \). Using the formula for the potential energy of two point charges:
   \[
   U = \frac{k q q'}{\text{separation}}
   \]
   Substituting \( q' = -\frac{q R}{d} \) and the separation \( \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d} \), we get:
   \[
   U = \frac{k q \left(-\frac{q R}{d}\right)}{\frac{d^2 - R^2}{d}}
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   U = -\frac{k q^2 R}{d^2 - R^2}
   \]

3. **Factor of \( \frac{1}{2} \)**:  
   The potential energy calculated above represents the energy of the system as if it were due to the charge \( q \) and its image charge \( q' \). However, in reality, the energy stored in the system is half of this value because the image charge is a model and should not be double-counted. Thus:
   \[
   U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k q^2 R}{d^2 - R^2}
   \]

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing the derived expression with the given options, the correct match is:
   \[
   U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k q^2 R}{d^2 - R^2}
   \]
   This corresponds to **Option D**.

### Conclusion:
The net potential energy of the system is \( -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k q^2 R}{d^2 - R^2} \), which matches **Option D**.

**Answer: D**
