Okay, so I have this question about the Mott-Gurney equation and its validity conditions. Hmm, I need to think carefully. Let me recall what I know about this.

The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current in a semiconductor device when the current is space-charge-limited. I remember that in the SCLC regime, the current is dominated by the electric field created by the space charge itself. The equation given is J equals (9/8) multiplied by epsilon, mu, V squared over L cubed. So J = (9/8) ε μ V² / L³.

Wait, I think the Mott-Gurney equation applies to single-carrier devices. Because if there are two carriers, like both electrons and holes, maybe a different model applies, like the trap-enhanced emission or something else. Or perhaps the equation simplifies in some way when considering two carriers. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Also, the equation assumes that the space charge is the dominant factor. So the device should be such that the current is limited by the space charge, not by other factors like series resistance or traps. Oh, right, the derivation probably assumes that the device is trap-free because traps would complicate things by causing additional effects like secondary emission or trapping of carriers.

Oh, and the equation holds when the injection is in the Ohmic contact limit, meaning that the built-in voltage is negligible. Because if there's a significant barrier, like in a Schottky contact, then the electric field wouldn't just be due to the space charge but also the potential barrier. So that might affect the validity.

Wait, another point: the derivation of the Mott-Gurney equation assumes that the current is due to drift only, not diffusion. So if diffusion currents are significant, the equation wouldn't hold. Therefore, the equation is valid when diffusion is negligible, meaning drift is the dominant transport mechanism.

So putting it together, the equation is valid for a single-carrier device (so no two carriers involved), trap-free (so no traps causing complications), Ohmic contact (so no significant built-in potential), and negligible diffusion current (so drift-dominated).

Looking at the options:

Option A: Trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. Wait, no. Because if drift is negligible, then maybe the current is due to diffusion. But the Mott-Gurney equation requires that the current is space-charge-limited, which is a drift effect. So if drift is negligible, maybe it wouldn't fit. Or wait, the equation assumes the current is due to drift, so perhaps the option should have 'negligible diffusion current' instead of drift. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Option B: Trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current. That fits. Because trap-free (good), single-carrier (good), no injection barrier suggests Ohmic contact (so negligible built-in voltage), and negligible diffusion (so drift is dominant). So this seems correct.

Option C: Single-carrier device with Schottky contact. That would imply a barrier, which might mean the electric field isn't just due to space charge. So probably not valid under Mott-Gurney conditions.

Option D: Two-carrier device. I thought Mott-Gurney is for single-carrier, so this is unlikely.

Wait, another angle: ohmic contact means that the built-in potential is zero or negligible, which is correct. So when the contacts are Ohmic, the space charge is controlling the current, which supports the Mott-Gurney scenario.

So which option says trap-free, single-carrier, Ohmic contact, and negligible diffusion? Let me check each option.

Option B says no carrier injection barrier. That's the same as Ohmic contact, because in Ohmic contacts, the built-in potential is zero, so no injection barrier. So B says trap-free, single-carrier, no injection barrier (Ohmic contact), and negligible diffusion. That sounds right.

Option A says negligible drift current. Wait, but in the Mott-Gurney equation, the current is due to drift, so if drift is negligible, the equation wouldn't apply. Therefore, A is incorrect.

So the correct statement is option B.


The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current in a semiconductor device under the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation assumes that the current is dominated by the electric field created by the space charge and is valid under specific conditions. These conditions include a single-carrier device (to avoid complications from two-carrier effects), a trap-free environment (to exclude additional effects like trapping), negligible diffusion current (so that drift is the dominant transport mechanism), and an Ohmic contact (to ensure negligible built-in potential).

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** mentions "negligible drift current," which contradicts the Mott-Gurney equation's requirement that drift be the dominant mechanism. Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option B** states that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (equivalent to Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion current. This aligns perfectly with the conditions for the Mott-Gurney equation to hold, making this the correct choice.
- **Option C** refers to a Schottky contact, which implies a significant built-in potential barrier. This would complicate the current behavior and make the Mott-Gurney equation invalid, so this option is incorrect.
- **Option D** specifies a two-carrier device, which is inconsistent with the Mott-Gurney equation, as it applies to single-carrier systems. Thus, this option is also incorrect.

The correct answer is **Option B**, as it satisfies all the necessary conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation.

Answer: B
