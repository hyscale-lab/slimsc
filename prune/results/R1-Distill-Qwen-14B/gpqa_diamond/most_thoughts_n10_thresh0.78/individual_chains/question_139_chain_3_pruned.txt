Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that two compounds, A and B, are treated separately with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. After this treatment, two different diketones are produced. I need to determine which starting materials A and B are correct from the given options.

Hmm, the reactions produce diketones, which are compounds with two ketone groups. I remember that the treatment with HCl, NaNO2, and water usually relates to some kind of diazotization reaction, but wait, that's more about aromatic amines forming diazonium salts. Oh wait, wait, maybe it's something else. Oh wait, another possibility: when alcohols, especially secondary alcohols, react under certain conditions, they can form ketones. Oh, wait, maybe it's the Stephen reduction or some kind of oxidation? Hmm, no, Stephen is for aldehydes.

Wait a second, another thought. Diazonium salts can undergo various reactions, but that's typically with aromatic amines. Oh wait, but if the starting material is a diol, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe it's about the formation of carbonyl groups via elimination.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The reagents are HCl, NaNO2, and water. Oh wait! This is the mixture used in the HNO2 (nitrous acid) reaction, which is often used for the formation of N-nitrosations or for the production of diazo compounds. But in the context of alcohols, maybe it's the HCl acting as a catalyst for some elimination or oxidation reaction.

Wait, another angle: when alcohols, especially secondary alcohols, are treated with HCl and then NaNO2, perhaps in a protic acid environment, it can lead to the formation of nitro compounds or maybe even the formation of ketones. Oh wait! I think I remember that when a secondary alcohol is treated with a mixture of nitrous acid (HNO2, which is formed from HCl and NaNO2), it can undergo the Beckmann rearrangement. But wait, Beckmann is for oximes. Oh, right, oximes are formed when ketones or al
