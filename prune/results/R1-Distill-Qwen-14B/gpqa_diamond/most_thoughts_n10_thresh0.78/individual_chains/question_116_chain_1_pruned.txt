Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's take it step by step.

The question starts with Compound A. Its proton NMR shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet means each proton is next to two others, and a quartet suggests each is next to three.

Looking at the integration, 6H and 4H. That might suggest something like two CH2CH3 groups and a CH2CH2 something. Wait, maybe it's a di-substituted alkane. Oh! Maybe it's 2-methylpentane or similar. Wait, no, let me think again. Another possibility is that the 6H are from two equivalent CH3 groups, and the 4H are from two CH2 groups.

So, for the triplet at 0.9 ppm, that's typically a CH3 next to a CH2. And the quartet at 1.3 suggests a CH2 next to a CH2 (maybe like ethyl groups). Wait, perhaps it's a structure like (CH2CH3)2CHCH2? Or wait, maybe it's a cyclopropane derivative? No, more likely a straight chain.

Wait, another approach: the triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H. 6 hydrogens could be two methyl groups (each with 3H), so maybe something like (CH2CH3)2CH2? No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the 6H are two methyl groups attached to a CH2. Let me think: the triplet would come from a CH2 group adjacent to two adjacent CH3 groups. Oh wait, perhaps it's diethyl something. No, wait, if the triplet is for the CH3, that means each CH3 is attached to a CH2 that has two neighboring Hsâ€”so maybe like CH2CH2CH3.

Wait,
