Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me take a deep breath and try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons, varying in hydrogen and oxygen counts.

Alright, looking at the data given. First, FTIR. The spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm-1. I remember that broad peaks in the IR typically indicate O-H stretching. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, a very broad peak might be more like an alcohol, since carboxylic acids have a broader and sometimes stronger absorption, but I'm not sure. Also, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Hmm, the 1700 is probably a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde. The 1650 might be another carbonyl, but maybe something else? Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in a carbonyl or maybe an ester or something else. Oh, wait, esters have two carbonyl groups, or maybe that's a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ring with substituents.

Next, the 1H NMR. It says there are several peaks, including vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, right? So that suggests there's a double bond in the structure, maybe an alkene. So the compound has both a carbonyl and a double bond.

Then, the mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z=45. I need to think about what fragments would give that. 45 is a common m/z value. For example, it's the molecular ion for methyl acetate, which is (CH3COOCH3), but that's C3H6O2, but wait, our compounds are all C6, so maybe it's part of a larger molecule. Alternatively, 45 could be a fragment like a ketene ion or something else. Wait, another thought: 45 could be the molecular ion of something like (CH3)2CO, which is acetone (C3H6O), but again, not matching the C6 here. Alternatively, perhaps a fragment like a ketone or an ester group.

Let me think about each clue step by step. 

Starting with the IR. The broad peak at 3000 cm-1 is probably O-H. But wait, if it's a broad peak, maybe it's an alcohol, but another possibility is a carboxylic acid. However, in a carboxylic acid, the O-H is usually very strong and broad, maybe around 2500-3300 cm-1. Alternatively, an alcohol's O-H is also a broad peak but maybe less so than a carboxylic acid. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me keep that in mind.

The 1700 cm-1 peak is a strong indication of a carbonyl group. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, acid, or amide. But the 1650 cm-1 peak is a bit lower than a typical ketone. Wait, aldehydes
