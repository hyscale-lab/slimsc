Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question is asking. The goal is to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options, each gives a sequence of reactions. I need to pick the right one that leads to the desired product with high yield.

Hmm, let me think about the structure of the target molecule. It's a phenyl group attached to an ethanone (acetone) group. The substituents on the benzene ring are bromo at the 3 position and nitro at the 5 position. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering would matter. So, the substituents are meta to each other? Because 3 and 5 are two positions apart in a six-membered ring. Wait, no, 3 and 5 are actually adjacent? Let me visualize the benzene ring. Let's say the ketone (ethan-1-one) is at position 1. Then the nitro group is at position 5, and bromo at position 3. So the substituents are in the meta positions relative to each other. Wait, no. Let's number the benzene ring: position 1 is the ketone group. Then, moving clockwise, position 2 is next, then 3, 4,5,6. So nitro at 5 and bromo at 3. So if the ketone is at position 1, the nitro is at 5 (two positions away from 1 in one direction), and bromo is at 3 (two positions away in the other direction). So the nitro and bromo are meta to each other relative to the ketone.

Wait, but wait. Benzene is a ring, so positions are relative. Let me think of it as the substituents being in the 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone. So if the ketone is on position 1, nitro on 5 (which is the same as position 2 if you consider the ring's symmetry?), no, I think that's not right. Maybe I should sketch it on paper mentally.

Alternatively, perhaps the substit
