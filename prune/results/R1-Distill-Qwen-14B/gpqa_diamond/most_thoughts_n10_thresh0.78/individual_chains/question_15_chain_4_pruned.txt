Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about detecting transits of two Earth-like planets. I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should observe that one. Let me break this down.

First, I remember that the transit method detects planets when they pass in front of their host star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the size of the orbit.

The question says both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So, P1 is shorter, meaning it's closer to its star. Also, both have circular orbits.

The star for Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Hmm, wait, more massive stars are usually larger, but in this case, they have the same radius. Interesting. So, Star_1 (Planet_1's star) is more massive but same size as Star_2. That probably affects the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, but the probability of transit depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the size of the orbit. The formula I remember is the transit probability (p) being approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a / R_s)^2? Or wait, wait. I think the formula is p ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / (R_s)) ), no, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the transit probability is actually the ratio of the areas or something more precise. Let me think. The probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a / (R_s)) ), no, maybe not. Alternatively, the probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / (R_s))? Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1/(a / R_s)) )? No, wait, perhaps I should recall the exact formula.

Oh right! The transit probability, p, is given by the formula:

p ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (a / R_s) )^{-1} )

Wait, no. Let me think again. The transit probability depends on the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. The probability is the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the planet's orbit... or something like that.

Wait, the correct formula for the transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits) is:

p = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (a) / (R_s) )^{-1} )

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a)^2? No, that would be (R_p / a)^2 * (R_s^2 / R_s^2) ), which doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Wait, I think I need to clarify. The probability is the ratio of the area of the planet's disk to the area of the star's disk times the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned so that it passes in front. The alignment probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. Wait, maybe not exactly, but something like (R_s / a), but considering that the planet needs to be in the right plane.

Wait, another approach. The probability that a planet transits is approximately (R_p + R_s) / a, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a)^2. No, perhaps that's not the right way.

Wait, I think I remember that the transit probability is given by:

p ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / R_s) )

But that can't be, because if a is larger than R_s, which it is, then a/R_s is greater than 1, which would make the probability larger than 1, which isn't possible. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a). Because then, as a increases, the probability decreases, which makes sense because the planet's orbit is larger, making alignment less likely.

Wait, let's think about it. The transit probability is the area of the star (as seen from Earth) divided by the area of the planet's orbit. No, wait, that's not exactly right. The probability is the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the planet's orbit, but only if the planet's orbital distance is much larger than the star's radius. But in any case, the formula for the probability is:

p = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a)^2 × something. Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

p ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a)^2 × (something else? )

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look up the formula.

Wait, no, I can't look it up, I have to think. Oh, right! The transit probability depends on the relative size of the planet's orbit. The probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a)^2. Wait, that would give (R_p^2 R_s^2) / (R_s^2 a^2) ) = (R_p^2)/(a^2). Hmm, but that doesn't involve the star's radius beyond that, which might not capture everything.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, I remember that the probability of a transit is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s)), or (R_s / a). So p ≈ (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (R_s / a) ) = R_p^2 / (R_s a). 

Wait, that could make sense. Let me think about the units. R_p squared is area, R_s is length, a is length. So (R_p^2)/(R_s a) would be 1/(length), which doesn't make sense for a probability. So that can't be right.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the planet's disk to the area of the star, multiplied by the alignment factor. The alignment factor is the probability that Earth's line of sight intersects the planet's orbital plane. That probability is approximately (R_s / a), because the orbital distance a is much larger than R_s.

Wait, so the alignment probability is roughly (R_s / a). Because the star's radius is much smaller than the planet's orbital distance, the chance that the line of sight is within the plane is proportional to R_s / a. So the overall probability would be (R_p^2 / R_s^2) [the chance that the planet blocks the star] multiplied by (R_s / a) [the alignment factor].

So p = (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (R_s / a) ) = (R_p^2) / ( R_s a )

Yes, that seems right. Because when a is large, the probability is small, and when R_p is large (relative to R_s) or R_s is large, the probability is higher.

So, the formula for transit probability is
