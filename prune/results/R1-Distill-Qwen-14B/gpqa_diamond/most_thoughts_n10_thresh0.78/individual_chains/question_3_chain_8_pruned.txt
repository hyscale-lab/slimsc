Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I remember that expectation values are important in quantum mechanics, and they depend on the state the particle is in.

The particle is a spin-half, which I think means it's like an electron or something similar with spin 1/2. The state it's in is a linear combination of the spin-up and spin-down states. The state is given as 0.5|↑> + sqrt(3)/2 |↓>. Wait, wait, I should check if this is a normalized state. Let me compute the sum of the squares of the coefficients. (0.5)^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4)=0.75. Adding them gives 1. So yes, it's normalized. That's good because expectation values require the state to be normalized.

The operator we're looking at is 10σz +5σx. Oh right, σz and σx are the Pauli matrices. I remember that σz has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑> and |↓>, respectively. And σx is a bit trickier because it's the Pauli matrix for x, which flips the spin states.

The expectation value of an operator is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues for each basis state. Alternatively, I can compute it by taking the inner product of the state with the operator acting on the state.

Wait, the operator is 10σz plus 5σx. Let me think about each part separately. The expectation value <O> is <ψ| O |ψ>, where O is 10σz +5σx.

So, breaking it down, <ψ| 10σz |ψ> plus <ψ|5σx|ψ>.

Let me compute each term.

First, <σz> for this state. Since σz|↑> = +1 |↑>, and σz|↓> = -1 |↓>. The state is 0.5|↑> + sqrt(3)/2 |↓>.

So, <σz> = (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1). Let me compute that.

(0.25)*1 + (3/4)*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So <σz> is -0.5. Then 10 times that is -5.

Next, the expectation value of σx. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix. I think σx |↑> = |↓>, and σx |↓> = |↑>.

So, let me compute <σx> = <ψ| σx |ψ>.

Expanding this, it's (0.5 <↑| + (sqrt(3)/2) <↓| ) multiplied by σx acting on (0.5 |↑> + sqrt(3)/2 |↓> ).

Wait, compute that. Alternatively, since σx is a matrix, I can write it as [[0,1],[1,0]].

But maybe a better approach is to compute the expectation value using the state's coefficients.

Wait, σx is given by the matrix:
[ [0, 1],
  [1, 0] ]

So, the expectation value is ψ† σx ψ.

But maybe I can
