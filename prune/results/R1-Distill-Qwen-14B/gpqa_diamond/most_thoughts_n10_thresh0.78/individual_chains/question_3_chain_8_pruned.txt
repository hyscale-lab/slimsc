Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about a spin-half particle in a specific superposition state. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. The options are A) -1.4, B) 1.65, C) -0.7, D) 0.85.

Hmm, expectation values. Right, the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd expect if you measured that observable many times on identically prepared systems. The formula for the expectation value ⟨O⟩ is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator and |ψ⟩ is the state vector.

So the operator here is 10σz +5σx. I remember that σz and σx are the Pauli matrices. Let me recall what they look like.

The Pauli σz matrix is [[1, 0], [0, -1]], and σx is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So 10σz would be [[10, 0],[0, -10]], and 5σx would be [[0,5],[5,0]]. Adding them together, the operator becomes [[10,5],[5,-10]].

But wait, maybe I don't need to compute the matrix explicitly. Alternatively, I can compute the expectation value of each term separately and then combine them.

The expectation value of 10σz +5σx is equal to 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. So I can compute ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ separately.

First, I'll compute ⟨σz⟩. Since σz has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively, and the state is a superposition.

The state is |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩.

The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is the sum of |c_i|^2 times the eigenvalues. Because σz is diagonal in the |↑⟩, |↓⟩ basis.

So for |↑⟩, the coefficient is 0.5, so |0.5|^2 is 0.25. The eigenvalue for σz on |↑⟩ is +1. So that's 0.25 * 1 = 0.25.

For |↓⟩, the coefficient is sqrt(3)/2. The square is ( (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) which is (3/4) = 0.75. The eigenvalue for σz on |↓⟩ is -1. So that's 0.75 * (-1) = -0.75.

Adding them together, ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, onto ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix, which is a bit more involved because it's not diagonal in the standard basis. So to compute the expectation value, I can either change basis or work it out using the matrix elements.

Wait, the state |ψ⟩ is a linear combination of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Let's write it as a column vector. Assuming |↑⟩ is [1; 0] and |↓⟩ is [0;1], then |ψ⟩ would be [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

The expectation value of σx is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

Let me compute this. σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when I compute σx |ψ⟩, I get [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Then ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is the dot product of [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] and [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

So compute each term:

0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = (0.5 * 1.732)/2 ≈ (0.866)/2 ≈ 0.433.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, let me calculate it properly.

Wait, let me compute each component:

First component: 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3)/4) ≈ (1.732)/4 ≈ 0.433.

Second component: (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 = same as above, (sqrt(3)/4) ≈ 0.433.

So the dot product is 0.433 + 0.433 = 0.866. Wait, 0.433 + 0.433 is 0.866, which is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, that
