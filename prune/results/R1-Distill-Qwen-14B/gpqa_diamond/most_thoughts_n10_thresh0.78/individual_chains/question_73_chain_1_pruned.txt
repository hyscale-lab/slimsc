Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I'm supposed to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the problem states that the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting the speeds. I remember that you can't just do a simple subtraction because of the way velocities add in special relativity. Oh right, the velocity addition formula is needed here.

So the formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving at u and v relative to the same frame is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/cÂ²). But wait, I think I got that right. Let me confirm: when you want the velocity of one object as seen from the other's frame, you use this formula.

Wait, in this case, the two astronauts are moving in the same direction. So for the first astronaut (2m mass, speed 0.6c), what's the speed of the second astronaut (3m, 0.5c) relative to him? Or vice versa? No, the question says, what is the relative speed between them. I guess it depends on the frame, but perhaps the problem is asking for the speed of one as seen from the other's frame.

Alternatively, maybe it's the speed of the second astronaut relative to the first. Let me think: the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from the first astronaut's perspective, the second is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)? No, that's not correct in relativity. Because you can't just subtract like that.

So the correct approach is
