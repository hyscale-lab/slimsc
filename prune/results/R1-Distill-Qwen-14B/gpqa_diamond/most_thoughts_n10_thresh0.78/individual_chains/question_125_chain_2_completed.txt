Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a particle of mass m moving in an isotropic three-dimensional potential given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that this potential is similar to a harmonic oscillator, but in three dimensions. Oh wait, right, this is the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. The force here should obey Hooke's law, which makes sense because F would be -k r, and V proportional to r squared.

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to that energy eigenvalue.

Hmm. Let me think. In quantum mechanics, for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized. Each energy level depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Since it's isotropic, the potential is the same in all directions, so the energy levels are determined by the total quantum number, which is the sum of the individual quantum numbers nx, ny, nz. 

Wait, no, I think for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, each direction is a 1D oscillator. The energy in each direction is (n + 1/2) ħω, where n is the principal quantum number for that direction. So the total energy would be the sum across the three directions.

So, the total energy E is given by E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, and you add them up.

Now, the states are labeled by the quantum numbers nx, ny, nz which are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). The energy depends on the sum N = nx + ny + nz. So each N defines a particular energy level. 

Wait, the question is about the third excited state. So, I need to clarify what's considered the ground state and how excited states are counted. The ground state is the lowest energy, which is when N=0 (n_x = n_y = n_z = 0), giving E = (3/2) ħω.

Then the first excited state would be the next possible energy, which is N=1. Because N=0 is ground, N=1 is first excited, N=2 is second excited, N=3 is third excited. Or wait, no—wait, the number of excited states is the number of states above the ground. So, the ground state is zero excited. First excited is the first level above ground. So, the third excited state would correspond to N=3.

So, the third excited state has N=3.

Wait, but sometimes people might interpret differently. Let me double-check. The ground state is the lowest energy, no excitations. The first excited state is the first energy level above ground, which is N=1. The second excited would be N=2, and the third excited would be N=3. Yes, that makes sense.

So, the energy E for the third excited state is (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. Because E = (N + 3/2) ħω, since N is the sum of the quantum numbers. So for N=3, E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. So that's the energy part.

Now, the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for the same energy eigenvalue. These are the states with the same N=3. So each state with different nx, ny, nz that sum to 3 is a distinct eigenfunction. The number of such states is the number of non-negative integer solutions to nx + ny + nz =3.

To find the number of solutions, it's a combinatorial problem. The formula is (n + k -1 choose k-1 ), where n is the total and k is the number of variables. Here, n=3, k=3. So it's (3 + 3 -1 choose 3-1 ) = (5 choose 2) = (5*4)/(2*1) )=10. So there are 10 possible eigenfunctions with N=3.

Therefore, the third excited state has energy (9/2) ħω and 10 eigenfunctions.

Looking at the options:

Option A says (9/2) ħω, 10. So that matches.

Option C says (9/2) ħω, 3. The number 3 is incorrect as we have 10. So A is the correct.

Wait, but just to make sure. Are there any other options that have the same energy but different counts? Option B and D have different energies, so they can be eliminated.

So the correct answer should be option A.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle of mass $m$ moving in an isotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$. The energy levels of such a system are quantized and depend on the total quantum number $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n_x$, $n_y$, and $n_z$ are the quantum numbers in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions, respectively. The total energy is given by:

\[
E = \left(N + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega
\]

The ground state corresponds to $N=0$, and the first, second, and third excited states correspond to $N=1$, $N=2$, and $N=3$, respectively. For the third excited state, $N=3$, the energy is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega
\]

The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to a given energy eigenvalue is determined by the number of non-negative integer solutions to $n_x + n_y + n_z = N$. For $N=3$, the number of solutions is given by the combinatorial formula:

\[
\binom{N + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{5}{2} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
\]

Thus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the third excited state.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: $(9/2) \hbar \omega, 10$ matches the calculated energy and the number of eigenfunctions.
- **Option B** and **Option D**: The energy expressions are incorrect as they do not match the form of the harmonic oscillator energy levels.
- **Option C**: While the energy is correct, the number of eigenfunctions is incorrectly stated as 3 instead of 10.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
