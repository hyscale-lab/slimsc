Okay, so I've got this question about nucleophilicity in aqueous solution. Hmm, I remember that nucleophilicity can depend on a few factors like the solvent, the charge of the nucleophile, and the structure. Wait, the question is about arranging them from most reactive (most nucleophilic) to least.

The nucleophiles given are:
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. Hydroxide
3. Propionate
4. Methanol
5. Ethanethiolate

I think nucleophilicity in aqueous (polar protic) solvents is tricky. Because in such solvents, polar and charged species are solvated more, which can reduce their nucleophilicity. So the more the nucleophile is solvated, the less reactive it is.

Let me list the nucleophiles by their charges and structure.

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: That's an alkoxide, so it's a strong base. It's a resonance structure; wait, no, cyclohexoxide is a conjugate base of an alcohol, so it's a strong nucleophile.

2. Hydroxide: Another strong base, similar to the first. Wait, but in aqueous solution, OH- is the conjugate base of water. So it's a good nucleophile but in water, maybe it's less reactive because it's solvated.

3. Propionate: That's the conjugate base of propionic acid. So it's an anion, but it's a weaker base compared to hydroxide or cyclohexoxide. Wait, but wait, the strength of the acid affects the basicity of the conjugate base. Since propionic acid is stronger than acetic acid, but wait, no, wait, hydroxide is the conjugate base of water, and propionate's conjugate acid is propionic acid, which is weaker than H2O. So propionate is a weaker base than OH-.

Wait, the order of nucleophilicity in polar aprotic is different from polar protic. Since the question is about aqueous solution, which is a polar protic solvent.

In polar protic solvents, the more polarizable and less solvated the nucleophile, the more reactive. So the order of nucleophilicity is usually: weaker bases can be better nucleophiles if they're less solvated. Wait, but actually in polar protic, the larger, less solvated ions are better nucleophiles.

Wait, for example, iodide is a better nucleophile than hydroxide in polar protic solvents because it's less solvated. But in this case, all the options are either anions or neutral.

Wait, let's see. The nucleophilicity in polar protic solvents tends to follow the trend: weaker bases (but better nucleophiles) when considering the same charge. But also, the size and ability to donate electrons.

So, let's list the species:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: Negative charge on an oxygen, and it's a bulky group. So in a protic solvent, the solvation would be significant, making it less nucleophilic. But wait, wait, is it more or less than hydroxide? Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about their basicity. Stronger bases are better nucleophiles in aprotic solvents but in protic solvents, their nucleophilicity is reduced because of strong solvation.

Wait, but in this case, all these are either strong or moderately strong bases.

Wait, another approach: compare their conjugate acids.

The strength of the conjugate acid affects the basicity. The weaker the acid, the stronger the conjugate base.

1. 4-methylcyclohexanol is a primary alcohol, but wait, the conjugate acid of the cyclohexoxide would be 4-methylcyclohexanol. Methanol's conjugate acid is CH3OH, which is weaker than water but stronger than some other alcohols. Wait, but wait, let me list the conjugate acids:
