Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens if the molecule has a chiral center. But wait, I remember that not all chiral centers mean optical activity. Let me think through each compound one by one.

The first compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but it's a double bond. Since the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituents are Cl on C1 and CH3 on C2. Wait, the molecule is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Oh wait, that's (Z) configuration. So the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are Cl and CH2CH3 on one side; on the other, it's CH2CH2 (no, wait, butene is four carbons. Let me draw it: Cl is on C1, which is CH2Cl. Then C2 is CH(CH3)-C. Wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the substituents on each are: on C1: Cl and CH2CH2 (but I'm getting confused). Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2, but no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Wait, but with substituents. Wait, 1-chloro-
