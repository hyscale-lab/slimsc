Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem, and I need to figure out how to solve it. Let's see what it's about. The question says that racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. I have to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A to D, with numbers 4, 8, 6, 2.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds. Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, usually Ruthenium-based, and it's used for ring-closing metathesis, ring-opening, and also for cross metathesis.

So the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. But wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene... Let me draw its structure.

Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But wait, 3-methyl would mean a methyl branch on the third carbon. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let me count the carbons. Pent means five carbons. So 1-ene is double bond starting at C1.

So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, that's six carbons. Wait, wait. Maybe I'm miscounting.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So the positions are 1,2,3,4,5. So for 3-methyl, the substituent is on C3. So it's CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? But that's four carbons after the double bond. Wait, that would make the structure CH2=CH-C(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, but that's five carbons in total. Oh, wait no, because after the double bond, it's CH2-C(CH3)-CH2CH3? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as (CH2)2C=CHCH2CH3. No, wait. Alternatively, perhaps 3-methylpent-
