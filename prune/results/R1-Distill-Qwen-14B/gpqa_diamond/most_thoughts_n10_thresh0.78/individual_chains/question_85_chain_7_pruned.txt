Okay, so I have this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. Both planets are detected using transit and radial velocity methods, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. The question gives me a lot of data, so I'll try to break it down.

First, the star's properties: mass is 1.5 times the Sun, radius 1.2 times, and effective temperature 6300 K. The planets have their own masses and radii. Planet1 is 7 Earth masses with a radius of 1.7 Earths, and Planet2 is 5 Earth masses with 1.3 Earth radii.

But wait, the question is about equilibrium temperature, which depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Oh right, the Doppler shifts given might relate to their orbital periods or velocities, which could help find their distances. Because the RV method detects the Doppler shift due to the planet's mass causing the star to wobble.

So the star's velocity is measured through the Doppler shift. For Planet1, the shift is up to 0.03 Å in the [OI] line at 6300 Å. For Planet2, it's 0.04 Å. Wait, the same line, so the wavelength is same for both. The RV method measures the velocity of the star towards and away from us, which relates to the mass of the planet and the orbital period.

But to find the distance, I think I need the orbital period, but maybe I can relate the semi-major axis to the star's velocity and the planet's mass. Alternatively, the Doppler shift gives the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's mass and the semi-major axis.

The Doppler shift (Δλ/λ) is given, and the velocity can be found from that. The formula is Δλ/λ = v/c, where c is the speed of light. So for each planet, I can calculate the velocity of the star.

Let me compute that. For Planet1: Δλ = 0.03 Å. The line is at 6300 Å. So Δλ/λ is 0.03 /6300 = approximately 4.76e-6. Then v = c * (Δλ/λ) = 3e5 km/s * 4.76e-6 ≈ 1.428 km/s.

Similarly for Planet2: Δλ = 0.04. 0.04/6300 ≈ 6.349e-6. v = 3e5 * 6.349e-6 ≈ 1.905 km/s.

But wait, the RV method relates the star's velocity (v_s) to the planet's velocity (v_p) through v_s = (M_p/(M_star + M_p)) * v_p. Since M_p is much smaller than M_star (assuming M_star is much larger than Earth masses), M_p/(M_star) is approx v_s = (M_p / M_star) * v_p. But perhaps a better approach is to use the fact that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v_p sin i) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3))) ) * (1/( (1-e²)^(0.5) (1 + cos i) )) ), but maybe that's too complicated. 

Alternatively, for circular orbits and edge-on (sin i =1), and assuming that M_p << M_star, then K is approximately ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * ... Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude:

K = ( (2πG) / (P c) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(1 - e²)^(1/2)) )

But since e=0 for circular orbits, it's easier. So K = (2πG/(P c))^(1/3) * (M_p sin i)/(M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) )

But since M_p << M_star, the denominator M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so it's approximately:

K ≈ (2πG/(P c))^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / M_star^(2/3)

And for edge-on orbits (sin i =1), so K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) )

Wait, but I don't know the orbital periods P of the planets. So maybe I can relate the velocities to the semi-major axes. The RV method gives the mass function, which depends on the planet mass, the inclination (but here we can assume sin i=1, edge-on), and the orbital period.

Alternatively, maybe a better approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given as the velocity of the star. For planet 1, K is 1.428 km/s, and for planet 2, K is 1.905 km/s
