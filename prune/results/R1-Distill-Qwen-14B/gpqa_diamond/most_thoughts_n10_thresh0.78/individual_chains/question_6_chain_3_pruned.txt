Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a specific potential. Let's see what the potential looks like.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, wait, that's in polar coordinates, I think. So it's a function of r and θ. I remember that in two dimensions, sometimes potentials can be expressed in polar coordinates, especially when there's symmetry involved.

I'm trying to recall what kind of potentials lead to known energy spectra. The harmonic oscillator comes to mind. Oh wait, for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the potential is V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r², and the energy levels are quantized as E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2)ℏω. But here, the potential is not isotropic since it has a θ dependence.

So this potential isn't symmetric in all directions. Let's see what the potential looks like when we expand it. The V(r,θ) can be rewritten as V(r,θ) = (k/2) r² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Because (1/2) + (3/2) cos²θ = (1 +3 cos²θ)/2, so yeah, that's correct.

Wait, 1 + 3 cos²θ is the same as 4 cos²θ + sin²θ? Let me check: 3 cos²θ +1 = 3 cos²θ + sin²θ + cos²θ = (3 cos²θ + cos²θ) + sin²θ = 4 cos²θ + sin²θ. Oh wait, no, because 3 cos²θ +1 = 3 cos²θ + (sin²θ + cos²θ) )= 4 cos²θ + sin²θ. So that's correct.

So V(r,θ) = (k/2) r² [4 cos²θ + sin²θ]/4? Wait no, I think I messed that up. Let me re-express it properly.

Wait, V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ = (1/2)k r² (1 + 3 cos²θ). So that's (k/2) r² (1 + 3 cos²θ). Hmm, maybe we can express this in terms of angular momentum because the potential depends on θ, which suggests that the Hamiltonian might have some angular dependence.

Alternatively, I remember that when the potential has a specific angular dependence, it might be possible to separate the Schrödinger equation into radial and angular parts. But wait, in two dimensions, the separation is a bit different than in three dimensions.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using polar coordinates, the potential can be expressed in
