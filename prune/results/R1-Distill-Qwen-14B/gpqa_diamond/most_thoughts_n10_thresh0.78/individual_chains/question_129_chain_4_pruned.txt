Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again and see what it's asking.

The question is about a reaction scheme where compound A goes through several reactions to form compound E. I need to identify which of the options A to D is compound E based on the given information and hints.

Let me break down the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are two hints provided:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and compound E has a strong peak around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are four different cyclic ketones.

First, I'm going to think about what each reaction step does.

Step 1: A + HCN â†’ B.
HCN typically adds to carbonyl groups. So if A is a ketone, HCN would add to the carbonyl, forming a cyanohydrin. Alternatively, if A is an aldehyde, same thing, but the options given are all ketones, so probably A is a ketone.

Step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. This is hydrogenation. If B is a cyanohydrin (a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached), reducing it would add hydrogen. Wait, but H2 with Pd is usually for hydrogenation of triple bonds or maybe alkenes. Oh wait, the cyanohydrin has a hydroxyl group and a nitrile. Maybe the nitrile is converted to an amine? Or perhaps the alcohol is reduced. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe step 1 is a different reaction.

Wait, another possibility: If A is a ketone, reacting with HCN gives a cyanohydrin, which is a vicinal diol (but one OH and one CN). Then, when B is hydrogenated, perhaps the nitrile group (CN) is reduced to CH2NH2, but that's not right. Or wait, maybe it's a ketone that after addition of HCN, becomes a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group. But when you hydrogenate with H2 and Pd, perhaps the nitrile is hydrogenated. Wait, nitriles can be hydrogenated to amines, but that's under different conditions, maybe. Alternatively, nitriles hydrogenated with H2 and a catalyst like Raney Ni give amines, but Pd might do a different thing. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is hydrogenated to a methylene group. Wait, I'm not quite sure. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile becomes an amine, but that might not fit the next steps.

Let me think again. Another approach: Let's look at the hints.

Hint a) says that when A reacts with a phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the structure of that product is a cyclopentane ring with substituents at positions 1,2 (two methyl groups) and position 4 (a propan-2-ylidene group, which is a carbene-like substituent, perhaps an allyl group or something similar.

Wait, phosphorous ylides are typically used in the Wittig reaction. The Wittig reaction converts aldehydes or ketones into alken
