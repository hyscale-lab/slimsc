Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's about reaction mechanisms, specifically involving cyclohexanones and some other reagents. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has two parts: reaction A and reaction B. Let's tackle them one at a time.

Starting with reaction A: The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The reagent is ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK. Hmm, t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so it's probably involved in an elimination or maybe a substitution reaction. But wait, cyclohexanones with carbonyl groupsâ€”maybe it's an aldol addition or some kind of conjugate addition?

Wait, ethyl acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. So when I think of reactions between carbonyl compounds and such esters, it's often a Michael addition or some kind of conjugate addition. Oh, right, in the presence of a base, the enolate can form, and then attack the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, but the starting material here is a cyclic ketone. So maybe it's a Claisen-like addition. Let me visualize the structure of the starting material. 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the cyclohexane ring has a keto group at position 1. Positions 2 and 6 have methyl groups, and position 2 also has an ethyl group. So the structure is a bit crowded around position 2.

Now, when the base (t-BuOK) deprotonates the alpha position. Wait, the alpha positions are adjacent to the carbonyl. So in cyclohexanone, the alpha positions are at positions 2 and 6. But in this case, position 2 has both ethyl and methyl groups, making it quite bulky. So, the base might prefer to deprotonate the less hindered position.

Wait, but the starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So position 2 has two substituents (ethyl and methyl?), wait no, the numbering: position 2 has an ethyl group, and position 6 has a methyl group. Wait, maybe that's not correct. Let me think. The molecule is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl. So at position 2, there's an ethyl group and another methyl group (since it's 2,6-dimethyl). So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at position 1, an ethyl group at position 2, and methyl groups at positions 2 and 6. So the carbonyl is at position 1, and positions 2 and 6 are substituted with methyl and ethyl.

So, the positions adjacent to the carbonyl (positions 2 and 6) are both substituted. Deprotonating the alpha positions would be possible. But steric hindrance could play a role. The more substituted position (position 2) is more hindered, so maybe the base deprotonates the less hindered position, which is position 6? Hmm, but position 6 has a methyl group, which is less bulky than an ethyl. Wait, but if position 2 is already substituted with ethyl and methyl, the adjacent position would be more hindered.

Alternatively, maybe the base forms an enolate, but the regiochemistry depends on where the deprotonation occurs. Once the enolate is formed, it will attack the ethyl acrylate.

Wait, ethyl acrylate has the structure CH2=CHCOO
