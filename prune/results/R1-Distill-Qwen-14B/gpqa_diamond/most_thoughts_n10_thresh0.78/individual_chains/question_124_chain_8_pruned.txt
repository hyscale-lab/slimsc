Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it again.

The problem says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20 on average. One third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector's radius is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. The options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28.

Hmm. I remember that the Lorentz factor, gamma, is related to time dilation and length contraction in special relativity. Since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame would be gamma times their proper lifetime. 

Wait, so the particles are produced at the center of the detector, and they decay after traveling some distance. The ones that reach the inner walls are those that live long enough to travel that distance. So, the fraction that reach the detector walls depends on how much their lifetime is dilated compared to the lab frame.

Let me think. The particles' lifetime in their rest frame (proper time) is tau. In the lab frame, their lifetime is gamma * tau. The distance they can travel before decaying is their speed times their lifetime. Since they're ultra-relativistic, their speed is approximately the speed of light, c. So the maximum distance they can travel is approximately gamma * c * tau.

But wait, the detector has a radius R of 30 meters. The particles are produced at the center, so the distance to the wall is 30 meters. So the condition is that gamma * c * tau >= R, because only then will some fraction of them reach the wall.

Wait, but in the first case, they have a Lorentz factor of 20, and one third reach the wall. So we need to find another gamma where two-thirds reach the wall. How does the fraction depend on gamma?

I think I'm missing something. Maybe the number of particles that reach the wall depends on the probability that their lifetime is sufficient to reach the wall. Since the particles decay exponentially, the probability that a particle lives long enough to reach the wall depends on the ratio of gamma to some critical value.

Wait, that rings a bell. The mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau. So the time it takes to reach the wall is t = R/(v), where v is the particle's speed. Since v is approximately c, t = R/(c). 

The probability that a particle decays after time t is given by the exponential decay law: P(t) = e^(-t/(gamma tau)). So the probability that the particle hasn't decayed by time t is P = e^(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, no. Wait, the probability that the particle decays before time t is 1 - e^{-t/(gamma tau)}, so the probability that it survives (doesn't decay) up to time t is e^{-t/(gamma tau)}. But that's the probability for a single particle.

But in the problem, it seems that on average, one third reach the walls. So the survival probability (fraction that reach the wall) is 1/3 for gamma=20. So I can set up an equation: 1/3 = e^{-t/(gamma tau)}.

But wait, t is the time it takes for the particle to reach the wall, which is t = R/(v). Since v is approximately c, t â‰ˆ R/(c).

So let's write t = R/(c). Then, the equation becomes:

1/3 = e^{ - (R/(c)) / (gamma tau) }

Taking natural logarithm on both sides
