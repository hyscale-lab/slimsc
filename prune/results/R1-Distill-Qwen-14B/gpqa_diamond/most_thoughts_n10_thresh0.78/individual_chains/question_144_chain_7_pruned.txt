Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I remember from my studies that mesons are subatomic particles, and their decay has something to do with their lifetimes and energies. Let's try to break this down.

The question gives me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. And I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters, so I guess it's a very small distance, which makes sense because particles decay quickly.

Wait, I think the decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime multiplied by its velocity. Oh right, the formula I remember is something like decay distance (cτ) equals the speed of light multiplied by the mean lifetime. But how does that connect to the given parameters?

Oh wait, the mean lifetime τ is related to the decay width Γ. The relation is Γ = ħ/τ. Oh, because Γ is the total decay width, which is the energy uncertainty, and τ is the lifetime uncertainty via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. So τ is ħ divided by Γ. But wait, I have to be careful with the units here.

So first, I need to find the lifetime τ. Let me think: τ = ħ / Γ. But I have to convert Γ into the same units as ħ. ħ is about 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·seconds. Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check the value—Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and ħ
