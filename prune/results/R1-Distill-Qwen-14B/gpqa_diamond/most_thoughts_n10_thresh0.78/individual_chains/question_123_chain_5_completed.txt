Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about calculating the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame of reference when a certain time passes in the ejecta's frame. 

Wait, so the setup is that the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. That probably means we can use special relativity here because we're dealing with different inertial frames. Oh right, because if one frame is moving relative to another, time might dilate or lengths contract.

The problem states that in the ejecta's frame, the center of the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy is approaching at that speed. But we need to find out how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. So the time given is in the ejecta's frame, which is 50 seconds. But we need the distance in the Galaxy's frame. So we need to relate the two frames.

In special relativity, time dilation comes into play when frames are moving relative to each other. The formula for time dilation is t' = gamma * (t - (v x)/c²), but since here it's a direct approach (ejecta moving towards the galaxy), maybe it's a straightforward velocity transformation problem.

Alternatively, proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the event. Wait, but in this case, the movement is of the ejecta, so perhaps we can think about how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, no. Because from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s. So the distance traveled would be v * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame.

But we have t' (50 seconds) in the ejecta's frame. So perhaps we need to find t in the Galaxy's frame, then compute distance as v * t.

But how do we get t from t'? Because of time dilation. The formula is t' = gamma (t - (v x)/c²), but since the movement is directly towards each other, maybe the x is along the direction of motion, and perhaps the events are at the same place in one frame.

Wait, perhaps it's a simple case of velocity addition. Or maybe using the Lorentz transformation between the two frames.

Let me think about the two frames: S is the Galaxy's frame, and S' is the ejecta's frame. In S', the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So the velocity u’ of the Galaxy in S' is 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta.

But from S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving at velocity u. So I think that the velocity u as seen in S is 60,000 km/s towards the center, so u = 60,000 km/s. Wait, but wait, the problem says that both are inertial frames. So perhaps in S, the ejecta is moving at u, and in S', the Galaxy is moving at u' = -u, because S' is moving at u relative to S.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me clarify the frames. Let's say S is the Galaxy's frame, and S' is the ejecta's frame. So in S, the ejecta is moving at velocity v = 60,000 km/s towards the center (which is in the negative x-direction, perhaps). So from Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards it.

In the ejecta's frame, S', the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So, the velocity u' of the Galaxy in S' is 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta, which is the same as the velocity of the ejecta in S.

Wait, that makes sense because if S' is moving at u relative to S, then in S', the velocity of S (Galaxy) is -u. So if in S, the ejecta is moving at u = 60,000 km/s, in S' (ejecta's frame), the velocity of the Galaxy (S) is -60,000 km/s, meaning the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s.

Now, the problem states that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame (S'), and we need to find the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (S), which is the distance the ejecta has moved in that time.

So in S, the ejecta is moving at u = 60,000 km/s. The time that passes in S is t, and the time in S' is t' = 50 seconds. So we need to find t, then distance in S is u * t.

But how do we find t? We can use the time dilation formula. The proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the process. Wait, but in this case, what's the proper time? The events are: the ejecta is at some point, and after some time, it has moved a certain distance.

Wait, perhaps the proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the object (the ejecta, so S'). So the proper time is t' = 50 seconds. Then, the time in the Galaxy's frame (S) would be longer. The time dilation formula says t = gamma * t', where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). But wait, let me confirm that.

In special relativity, time dilation occurs such that moving clocks run slower. So if an event occurs over t' seconds in the moving frame (S'), the time in the stationary frame (S) is t = gamma * t'. Because from S's perspective, the moving clock (S') is ticking slower.

Wait, no, wait. If S' is moving relative to S, then S sees S' as having slower clocks. So the proper time (time in S') is less than the time in S. So in this case, t' = 50 s is the proper time, so the time in S would be longer.

Yes, so t = gamma * t'.

So, let's compute gamma. The velocity is v = 60,000 km/s. Let's convert that into m/s to make calculations easier, because usually c is 3e8 m/s.

Wait, 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. 1 km is 1e3 meters, so 6e4 km/s = 6e7 m/s.

Wait, but the speed of light is approximately 3e8 m/s, so 6e7 m/s is two-thirds of the speed of light. So beta (β) is v/c = (6e7)/(3e8) = 0.2, wait, no, 6e7/3e8 is 0.2? Wait, 6e7 is 60 million, 3e8 is 300 million. Oh wait, 6e7 is 60 million, 3e8 is 300 million. 60/300 is 0.2. So β = 0.2. So β = 0.2.

Then, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96). Let's compute sqrt(0.96). Hmm, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So 1/0.9798 is approximately 1.0206. So gamma is approximately 1.0206.

So t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute gamma more accurately. Because the approximation might matter for the options given.

Wait, let's compute 1 - β² = 1 - (0.2)^2 = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) is exactly sqrt(24/25) = (2 * sqrt(6))/5 ≈ 0.9798. So 1 / 0.9798 = approximately 1.0206.

So t ≈ 1.0206 * 50 = 51.03 seconds.

Now, the distance the ejecta travels in S (Galaxy's frame) is v * t. v is 6e7 m/s, t is approximately 51.03 seconds.

So distance = 6e7 m/s * 51.03 s = 6e7 * 51.03 = 3.0618e9 meters.

Wait, but the options are in kilometers. Let's convert that to kilometers: 3.0618e9 m = 3.0618e6 km. So approximately 3,061,800 km.

Looking at the options:

A) 2,940,000 km.

B) 3,000,000 km.

C) 2,880,000 km.

D) 3,060,000 km.

Hmm, option D is 3,060,000 km. But wait, my approximation gave me 3,061,800 km. So that's close to D, which is 3,060,000. Perhaps the exact calculation would get closer.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with gamma. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

Compute gamma: 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96).

Let me compute sqrt(0.96) more accurately.

0.96 is between (0.98)^2=0.9604, so sqrt(0.96)= approx 0.9798.

Wait, but 0.98 squared is 0.9604, which is 0.0004 more than 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.979795897.

So 1 / 0.979795897 is approximately 1.020305.

So gamma is approximately 1.020305.

Then t = 50 * 1.020305 ≈ 51.01525 seconds.

So v = 6e7 m/s.

Distance = 6e7 m/s * 51.01525 s = ?

6e7 * 51.01525 = 6e7 * (50 + 1.01525) = 6e7 *50 + 6e7 *1.01525.

6e7 *50 = 3e9 m = 3e6 km.

6e7 *1.01525 = 6e7 * (1 + 0.01525) = 6e7 + 6e7 *0.01525.

6e7 = 60,000,000.

6e7 *0.01525 = 60,000,000 * 0.01525 = 60,000,000 * 0.015 = 900,000, plus 60,000,000 *0.00025=15,000. So total 915,000.

So 6e7 *1.01525 = 60,000,000 + 915,000 = 60,915,000 meters.

So total distance is 3e9 + 60,915,000 = 3,060,915,000 meters = 3,060,915 km.

Wait, 3,060,915 km is approximately 3,060,915 km.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D: 3,060,000 km. So that would be the answer.

But wait, wait a minute. Did I get the direction right? Because in the problem, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center, so the distance is how much it's moved in that 50 seconds of its own time.

Wait, but no, because the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer than 50 seconds. So the time in the Galaxy's frame is 51.015 seconds, so the ejecta would have moved 6e7 m/s * 51.015 s = 3,060,915,000 meters = 3,060,915 km.

So the option is D) 3,060,000 km. So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but wait another thing. Maybe the problem is that in the ejecta's frame, the time is 50 seconds, but the distance is measured in the Galaxy's frame, so perhaps I should use the velocity in the Galaxy's frame multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, but that's exactly what I did. The velocity is 6e4 km/s, and the time in the Galaxy's frame is about 51.015 seconds, leading to 6e4 * 51.015 seconds.

Wait, wait, no. 6e4 km/s is 60,000 km/s. So 60,000 km/s * 51.015 s = 60,000 *51.015 = 3,060,900 km. So same as before, approximately 3,060,900 km, which rounds to 3,060,000 km as in option D.

But let me check again: perhaps the speed is 60,000 km/s, which is v = 6e4 km/s. So in 51.015 seconds, the distance is 6e4 * 51.015 = 3,060,900 km. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but another approach: Maybe the problem is using the velocity as given in the ejecta's frame, but that's not correct. Because in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. So the distance in the Galaxy's frame is v * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame. So yes, what I did earlier.

So the calculation leads to approximately 3.06 million km, which is option D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's reference frame. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Understanding the Frames**:  
   - In the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy is approaching at a speed of \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \).  
   - In the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving towards the center at the same speed \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \).  

2. **Time Dilation**:  
   - The problem involves two inertial frames moving relative to each other at \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \).  
   - The time \( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \) is measured in the ejecta's frame (S').  
   - Using special relativity, the time dilation formula \( t = \gamma t' \) applies, where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} \) and \( \beta = \frac{v}{c} \).  

3. **Calculating \( \gamma \)**:  
   - Convert \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) to \( v = 6 \times 10^7 \, \text{m/s} \).  
   - Compute \( \beta = \frac{v}{c} = \frac{6 \times 10^7}{3 \times 10^8} = 0.2 \).  
   - Calculate \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.04}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0203 \).  

4. **Relating Times**:  
   - Using \( t = \gamma t' \), the time in the Galaxy's frame is \( t = 1.0203 \times 50 \approx 51.015 \, \text{s} \).  

5. **Calculating Distance in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   - The distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is \( d = v \cdot t \).  
   - Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( t = 51.015 \, \text{s} \), we get:  
     \[
     d = 60,000 \times 51.015 \approx 3,060,900 \, \text{km}.
     \]  

6. **Matching the Closest Option**:  
   - The calculated distance \( d \approx 3,060,900 \, \text{km} \) aligns closely with option D, \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \).  

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
