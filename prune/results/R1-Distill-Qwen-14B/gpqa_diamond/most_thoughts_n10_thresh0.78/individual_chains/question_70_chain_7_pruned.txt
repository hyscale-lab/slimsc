Alright, so I'm looking at this chemistry problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a series of reactions, and we need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options given are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. Hmm, I remember that symmetry groups are related to the shapes of molecules. So I need to figure out what E is, then determine its molecular structure, and from there, its symmetry.

Let me start by breaking down the reactions given.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Okay, so A + 8B → C. What could this be? I'm thinking maybe a metal reacting with a halogen or something similar. Like, maybe A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas, like Cl2 or O2.

Second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E. So C + 2D → E. E is extremely hazardous, so maybe something like a toxic gas or a highly reactive compound.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is in water, it breaks down into A, F, and G. Since F is strong and G is weak, perhaps F is HCl (strong) and G is maybe H2SO3 or something like that. Wait, but if A is the original solid, perhaps it's something like sulfur, which is solid, and B is Cl2? Wait, let me think.

Wait, another thought: if C is a compound that when reacts with water, it produces two different acids. So maybe C is a salt that contains two different acid components. For example, maybe C is a metal chloride, but when it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes into a strong acid and a weak acid. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite or something else.

Wait, let's think about the first reaction. If A is a solid reacting with B, which is a gas. Let me think of a solid metal reacting with chlorine gas. For example, maybe A is iron (Fe) and B is Cl2. Then, Fe reacts with Cl2 in a certain ratio to form FeCl3? But wait, FeCl3 is a solid, I think, but is it bright red? No, FeCl3 is more of a yellowish-brown color. Hmm, maybe another metal.

Wait, another possibility: A is sulfur (S), solid, and B is oxygen (O2). S + O2 forms SO3? But SO3 is a gas, and when it comes to the reaction with water, it forms H2SO4. But wait, the reaction says C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. If C is SO3 and reacts with water, it forms H2SO4, which is just one acid. But the question says two different acids F and G. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's look at the third reaction again. C reacts with water to form A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So perhaps C is a salt that contains both strong and weak acid components. For example, maybe C is sodium sulfite, Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes into NaOH (strong base, but wait, that would produce a base, not acid. Hmm, maybe not.)

Alternatively, perhaps C is a salt of a weak acid and a strong acid. Like sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3. When it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes into NaOH (strong base) and carbonic acid, which is weak. But in the problem, it's producing two acids, F and G. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is ammonium sulfide, (NH4)2S. When it reacts with water, it breaks down into NH3 (which is a weak base) and H2S (a weak acid). But the problem states that F is a strong acid and G a weak acid. So this doesn't fit either.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride, like Mg3N2. When Mg3N2 reacts with water, it produces Mg(OH)2 and NH3. Not fitting the acid scenario.

Wait, perhaps C is a chlorate or something else. Alternatively, maybe C is a mixed salt. Wait, maybe I should think about the other reaction. C reacts with gas D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. What gases D could be that when reacting with C produce something dangerous?

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is something else. Let me think about the second reaction. C + 2D → E. Maybe D is another kind of gas. For example, if C is Cl2O7 (chlorine pentaoxide?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps D is O2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So B and D in 1:1 ratio. If B is Cl2, then D could be something like NH3, but Cl2 and NH3 react in a 1:1 ratio to form NH2Cl and HCl gas, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, if B is O2, maybe D is H2, but O2 and H2 react in 1:1 ratio to form H2O. H2O is a solvent, which fits. So that could be H.

Wait, if D is H2, then D reacts with B (O2) to form H2O. So H is H2O, which is a solvent. That makes sense. So D is H2, B is O2. Then, what is C?

So let's retrace the reactions.

First reaction: A (solid
