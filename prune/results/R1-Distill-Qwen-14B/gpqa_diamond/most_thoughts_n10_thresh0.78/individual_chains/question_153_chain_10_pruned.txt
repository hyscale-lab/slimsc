Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves enolates acting as nucleophiles attacking α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Let me think through each part step by step.

The question has three different reactions, and for each, I need to determine the reactants and major products. The options given are A, B, and C, each with different product structures. Let me tackle each part one by one.

First reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH. I think NaOEt is a strong base, so it probably deprotonates the malonate to form an enolate. Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it can form a stable enolate. The other reactant is an α,β-unsaturated ester—methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. That's an electron-deficient double bond, so it's a good Michael acceptor.

In the Michael addition, the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the β carbon of the acrylate. The attack would occur at the less substituted end because of the E stereochemistry. Wait, no, in E geometry, the substituents are opposite, but for the Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the β carbon, which in this case is the middle carbon of the acrylate.

So, when the enolate attacks, the acrylate's carbonyl becomes a ketone, but since it's an ester, it becomes a ketone in the product. Wait, no, the ester is part of the structure. Let's see, the structure of methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. Wait, actually, the structure is more like CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group attached where? Maybe the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Hmm, wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH- with the substituents on the double bond. Wait, the formula is likely CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 but with a p-tolyl group on the same carbon as the double bond? Or perhaps it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Wait, the correct structure would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, with the p-tolyl group on carbon 2, and the ester group on carbon 3.

So the Michael addition would occur where the enolate (from dimethyl malonate) attacks the β position (carbon 1) of the acrylate. Wait, no. The acrylate is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. The α,β-unsaturated carbonyl is
