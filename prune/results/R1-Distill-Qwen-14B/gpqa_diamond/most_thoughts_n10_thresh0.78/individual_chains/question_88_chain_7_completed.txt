Okay, so I have this question about immunology, and I'm supposed to figure out the process that's happening in the scenario described. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand it.

So, the setup is that someone tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then, they observed via in vivo imaging that some GFP fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid and some got entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. They identified the fluorescent Peyer's patches and isolated the proliferating cells. When they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes, there was high variability. The question is asking which process is taking place.

Hmm. The options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

Let me break this down. Rotavirus is a virus that affects the gastrointestinal tract. Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), and they're involved in immune responses to enteric pathogens. Since the GFP is on the inner capsid proteins, which are likely antigens, the mice's immune system is responding to them.

Now, when they delivered the rotavirus via oral gavage, some of the GFP was destroyed by stomach acid. Stomach acid is strong, so that probably killed some of the virus particles. But some made it through and got to the intestines. The Peyer's patches are where much of the immune response in the gut happens. The fact that the fluorescent cells were found in the Peyer's patches suggests that the rotavirus antigens were presented there, triggering an immune response.

They isolated the proliferating cell population. Proliferating cells in lymphoid tissues are often B cells that are activated and dividing. When they look at the variable heavy chain genes and see high variability, this suggests that those genes are undergoing some sort of diversification.

Wait, what do I know about the processes listed?

VDJ recombination is the process that happens during the development of B cells in the bone marrow. It's when the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments are combined to create the unique B cell receptor. This happens during the maturation of B cells, so it's more of a developmental process, not something that happens in response to an antigen.

Somatic hypermutation, on the other hand, occurs after B cells are activated. They undergo this process in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues. Somatic hypermutation introduces point mutations in the variable region of the B cell receptor, increasing the diversity of the antibodies produced. This is a way to fine-tune the immune response and generate higher affinity antibodies.

Class switching recombination, or isotype switching, is when the class of the antibody (like IgM to IgG) changes. This process occurs after the B cell is activated, and it's regulated by cytokines. It doesn't directly affect the variable regions but changes the class of the antibody produced.

Complement activation is a part of the innate immune response, involving the complement system. It's not directly related to the generation of variability in the variable regions of the B cell receptors.

In the question, the GFP is on the capsid proteins, so the B cells are responding to these antigens. The Peyer's patches are sites where antigens are sampled, and the immune response is initiated. The fact that the variable heavy chains show high variability suggests that the B cells are undergoing some process that diversifies their receptors.

Since the question describes an in vivo situation where the B cells are proliferating after encountering the antigen, this process is likely happening after the initial encounter. So it's not VDJ, which is during development. It's more likely to be somatic hypermutation, which occurs in the germinal centers where B cells are activated and undergo this diversification.

So the process taking place is A) somatic hypermutation.


The scenario describes an experiment where GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are delivered to mice via oral gavage. After passing through the stomach (where some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid) and intestinal mucus, the antigens reach the Peyer's patches, which are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Here, the immune system responds to the antigens, and proliferating cells are isolated. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes of these cells reveals high variability, indicating a process that diversifies the B cell receptors.

To determine the process, the options are analyzed:

- **VDJ recombination** occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J gene segments are rearranged to form unique B cell receptors. This is a developmental process and does not explain the observed variability in response to antigens.

- **Somatic hypermutation** occurs in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues after B cells are activated. It introduces point mutations in the variable region of the B cell receptor, increasing diversity and affinity of antibodies. This matches the scenario, as the observed variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests this process is taking place.

- **Class switching recombination** changes the class of the antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not diversify the variable regions, making it unlikely to explain the high variability observed.

- **Complement activation** is part of the innate immune response and does not involve diversification of B cell receptors.

Given that the B cells are proliferating in response to antigens and show high variability in their variable heavy chain genes, the process occurring is **somatic hypermutation**.
