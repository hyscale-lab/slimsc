Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The question involves mixtures X, Y, and a substance Z. Let's break down what each part says.

First, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Hmm, what makes a liquid decolorize bromine water? I remember that alkenes and alkynes can do that because they have unsaturated bonds. They react with bromine, causing it to decolorize. So mixture X probably contains two alkenes or maybe an alkene and another unsaturated compound.

Then, when X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y, which is also an equimolar mixture but of two other liquids. Importantly, Y does not decolorize bromine water. Wait, that means Y doesn't have any unsaturated bonds because if it had, bromine would decolorize it. So what kind of compounds would that be? Maybe alkanes, which are saturated and don't react with bromine.

The next part says that hydrogenation of both X and Y in the presence of platinum under severe conditions gives only one substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%. Let me calculate what that means. The mass fraction is (mass of H)/(mass of Z) = 0.1428.

Hydrogenation usually adds hydrogen across double bonds. So if X had alkenes, hydrogenation would saturate them into alkanes. If Y is an alkane, hydrogenation wouldn't do much, unless maybe it's a different structure. Wait, but the problem says that when both X and Y are hydrogenated, only Z is formed. That suggests that both X and Y, after hydrogenation, give the same Z.

But wait, mixture Y is formed from X via a disproportionation reaction when treated with Pt and heat. Disproportionation is when a single species is both oxidized and reduced. Oh, wait, but the question says that mixture Y is formed as a result of disproportionation. So maybe the components of X are undergoing disproportionation.

Wait, let me think again. X is treated with Pt when heated, leading to Y. Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so it's more saturated. If Y is formed by a reaction with Pt, perhaps that reaction is hydrogenation or some addition.

Wait, but the problem says that X is treated with Pt when heated, which causes a disproportionation, giving Y. So perhaps the components of X are reacting in a way where each component is both oxidized and reduced, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe X has a component that can undergo such a reaction.

Wait, another thought: if X is two alkenes, and after treatment with Pt and heat, perhaps they undergo some addition or rearrangement. Or maybe it's a case where X is a di-substituted alkene, and upon hydrogenation, it becomes an alkane. But why would that be a disproportionation?

Alternatively, maybe X contains an alkyne. Because when you hydrogenate an alkyne, it can become an alkene or an alkane depending on conditions. But the problem states that Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so Y's compounds must be alkanes.

Wait, but the question says that when X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation to give Y. So maybe the components of X are undergoing some kind of decomposition or rearrangement. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Let me think about the hydrogenation part. When X and Y are hydrogenated in the presence of Pt under severe conditions, they both yield the same Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. Let me compute that.

Let's denote Z as CnH2m. The molar mass of Z would be 12n + 2m. The mass of hydrogen is 2m g per mole (since each H is about 1 g/mol). So the mass fraction is (2m)/(12n + 2m) = 0.1428.

Let me set up the equation:

(2m) / (12n + 2m) = 0.1428

Multiply both sides by denominator:

2m = 0.1428 * (12n + 2m)

Let me compute 0.1428 * denominator:

0.1428 * 12n = approx 1.7136n

0.1428 * 2m = 0.2856m

So adding them: 1.7136n + 0.2856m = 2m

Bring all terms to one side:

1.7136n = 2m - 0.2856m = 1.7144m.

So 1.7136n ≈ 1.7144m. Hmm, perhaps the values are close enough that n≈m. Or maybe n=2, m=4?

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate exactly. Let me compute 0.1428 * (12n + 2m) = 2m.

Let me write it as:

2m = (12n + 2m) * (1/7) because 0.1428 is approximately 1/7 (since 1/7 ≈ 0.142857). Let's check: 1/7 is approximately 0.142857, so yeah.

So,

2m = (12n + 2m) * (1/7)

Multiply both sides by 7:

14m = 12n + 2m

Subtract 2m:

12m =12n

Divide both sides by 12:

m =n.

So m =n.
