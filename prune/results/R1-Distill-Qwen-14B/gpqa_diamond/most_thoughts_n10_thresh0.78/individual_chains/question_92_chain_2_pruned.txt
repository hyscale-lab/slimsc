Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific molecule. Hmm, let me read the question again.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wow, that's a mouthful. I'm not exactly sure what that structure looks like, but maybe it doesn't matter too much for the calculation. The question gives some bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization for carbon. 

Wait, I remember that the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So for the formation of the given compound, I need to consider breaking bonds in the reactants and forming bonds in the product.

The given data includes:
- Enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol. So that's the energy needed to break a C-C bond in graphite into two atoms of carbon gas, I think. Or wait, no, atomization is breaking into individual atoms. So each carbon atom comes off as C(g), I guess.

The bond energies provided are:
- H-H: 100 kJ/mol
- C-C: 200 kJ/mol
- C=C: 300 kJ/mol
- C-H: 400 kJ/mol

Wait, but each bond's energy is the energy released when forming that bond. So to break a bond, you have to put in that energy. Or wait, I think bond energy is the energy required to break a bond. So when you break bonds, you add the bond energy, and when you form them, you subtract?

No, wait, maybe the other way around. Think: when a bond forms, energy is released (exothermic), so bond energies are the amount of energy released. So if I'm calculating the enthalpy change, I should consider the bonds broken as positive (since energy is absorbed) and bonds formed as negative (energy is released). Or maybe I should think in terms of bond dissociation energies.

Wait, maybe the approach is to calculate the total bond energies in the reactants and the products. The enthalpy of reaction (which in this case is the formation, so the reaction is elements to compound) is equal to the sum of bond energies of reactant bonds minus the sum of bond energies of product bonds. But wait, no, that might be the reverse. Let me think: when forming a molecule, you break bonds in the reactants and form new bonds in the products. So the enthalpy change (Î”H) is [sum of bonds broken in reactants] minus [sum of bonds formed in products].

Wait, no, perhaps it's the opposite. Because if you're forming a bond, you're releasing energy, so the reaction is exothermic, and the enthalpy change would be negative. So, the enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change
