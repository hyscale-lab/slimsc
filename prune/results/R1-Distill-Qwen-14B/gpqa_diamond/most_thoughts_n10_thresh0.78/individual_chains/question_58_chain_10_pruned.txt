Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. Hmm. Let's think about what regularization means. From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—like infinities that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math work by introducing a temporary "cutoff" and then removing it in the end. But why would some theories not need this?

The options given are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, classical theories don't have the same issues as quantum ones. Classical Electrodynamics (option D) is a theory that works at the level of everyday physics, but when you go quantum, like in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), you get issues with divergences. So QED definitely requires regularization because of loop diagrams causing infinities. So C) is out.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) deals with the strong force. I know that QCD has something to do with quarks and gluons. Wait, but isn't QCD a non-Abelian gauge theory? It has asymptotic freedom, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant gets smaller. But wait, does that mean it doesn't have the same kind of divergences as other theories? Or does it still need regularization? I'm a bit confused here. I think QCD does require regularization because of things like the Landau pole and other renormalization issues. But wait, maybe because of asymptotic freedom, it's more manageable. Or perhaps it's the opposite—maybe it's the only one that doesn't require regularization? No, I don't think so. I think all quantum field theories require some form of regularization or renormalization, but maybe in string theory things are different.

Superstring Theory is a quantum theory of strings. Strings are supposed to provide a consistent description at all energy scales, right? Because in string theory, the fundamental objects are strings rather than point particles. So when you compute things in string theory, perhaps you don't get the same kind of divergences that require regularization? Or maybe string theory doesn't require it because it's a background-independent theory and handles infinities more gracefully. Alternatively, I've heard that string theory doesn't have the same types of divergences because the perturbation series is different. Or perhaps it's because it's a theory that unifies quantum mechanics and general relativity, so it handles high energies better. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another angle. Regularization is needed when a theory has divergences—like when you calculate loop integrals that go to infinity. If a theory is finite, meaning it doesn't have these divergences, then you don't need regularization. But which of these theories is finite?

I remember that QED is a renormalizable theory but it still needs renormalization, which comes after regularization. Wait, but does it require regularization? Because during calculations, you have to regularize, then renormalize.

Wait, another thought. In some theories,
