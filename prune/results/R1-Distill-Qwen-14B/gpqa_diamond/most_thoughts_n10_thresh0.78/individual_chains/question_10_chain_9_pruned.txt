Okay, so I need to figure out which exoplanet has the highest density. Let me think about what I know regarding planetary density. I remember that density is mass divided by volume, right? So the formula is density = mass/volume.

The question gives four options, a to d, each describing a planet with different mass and radius or composition. I need to compare their densities.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, I think. Because Earth is made of rock and metal, so that's the baseline here.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but wait, if the density is given, then I don't need to calculate it. So this planet's density is 5.5, same as Earth. Hmm, but wait, does mass affect the density if the radius is the same? Wait, no, because density is mass/volume, and if the radius is the same, volume is same, so if mass is higher, density would be higher. Wait, but in option b, the density is given as 5.5, same as Earth. So maybe the radius isn't the same? Or perhaps the question is structured differently. Hmm, no, the question says option b is a planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of ~5.5. So according to that, its density is 5.5. So same as Earth. So if that's the case, its density doesn't exceed Earth's. So perhaps not the highest.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth. Wait, same composition implies same density? Because composition affects both mass and radius. So if a planet has same composition, its density is same as Earth. But wait, wait, same composition would mean same average density, but if it's more massive, but same density, then the radius would be larger. Because mass is proportional to radius cubed times density. Let me think: If density is same, then mass = density * (4/3 π r³). So if mass is 5 times, then r is cube root of (5) times Earth's radius. So about 1.7 times Earth's radius. But the issue is, the question is about which has the highest density. So if option c
