Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to figure out the structure of the target. The name is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Ethan-1-one is acetone, right? So the structure is like an acetone where the methyl group is attached to a benzene ring. The substituents on the benzene are a bromo group and a nitro group. The positions are 3 and 5 relative to the ketone group.

Wait, let me draw this out mentally. The benzene ring has the acetone group (which is a ketone, so it's attached as a substituent) at the 1 position. Then, looking at the benzene ring, the substituents are at the 3 and 5 positions. So, numbering the ring with the ketone at position 1. That would mean the bromo is at position 3 and nitro at 5, or vice versa? Wait, no. Let me think: the substituents are 3-bromo and 5-nitro. So the ring has the ketone at position 1, bromo at position 3, nitro at position 5. So it's a 3-bromo-5-nitro group attached to the same ring as the acetone.

Wait, no. Wait, the compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl group is attached to the ethanone. So the phenyl group is substituted, and in that, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5. So the benzene ring attached to the ketone has bromine at position 3 and nitro at position 5. So the ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5 relative to the point of attachment (the ketone is attached to position 1 of the benzene ring).

So the benzene has substituents at positions 1 (the ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). Wait, but that's three substituents. Oh, no, wait, no: the phenyl is substituted with Br at 3 and NO2 at 5. So the ketone is attached to position 1, and the substituents are at 3 and 5 relative to that. So the benzene ring has substituents at 1 (the ketone, which is actually an acetyl group), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2).

But wait, benzene can't have three substituents in that arrangement? No, it's possible. So the substituents are at positions 1,3,5? Wait, no, that's a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene. The ketone is at position 1, then Br at 3, and nitro at 5. That would make the substituents in the meta positions relative to each other.

Wait, but how do you get the substituents in the correct positions when you're doing electrophilic substitution reactions? Because each substitution affects the next due to directing effects.

So beginning with benzene, I need to add the substituents in a way that they end up in the correct positions. So the target has three substituents: a ketone (acetyl), bromine, and nitro group. But wait, no, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ethanone is attached to a benzene ring that has Br at position 3 and NO2 at position 5. So the benzene ring has three substituents? Or is the benzene attached to a -COCH3 group, and two substituents (Br and NO2) in the 3 and 5 positions relative to that.

So the benzene ring is attached to the ketone (COCH3) at position 1. Then, there are Br at position 3 and NO2 at position 5. So that's indeed three substituents on the benzene ring.

Hmm, but synthesizing such a compound requires multiple substitution steps. Each step adds a substituent, but each substituent will direct the next incoming group to a specific position.

The substituents we have are: Br, NO2, and COCH3 (the ketone). Let me think about their directing effects.

The ketone group (COCH3) is a strong meta-directing group. Nitro groups are also strong meta directors. Bromine is an ortho/para director but is deactivating because it's an electron-withdrawing group.

Wait, but wait: the bromine is attached to the benzene ring, so when it's present, it directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. The nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. The ketone is a deactivating, meta-directing group as well.

But the target has the ketone, Br, and nitro groups in specific positions. The question is, in what order should these groups be added to benzene to end up in the correct positions.

I think the order of addition is crucial because each substituent will influence where the next one goes.

Let me consider the positions. The target has:

Position 1: COCH3 (the ketone)
Position 3: Br
Position 5: NO2

Wait, no, the benzene ring is such that the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone. So if the ketone is at position 1, then the Br is at position 3, and the nitro is at position 5.

So how can I get these substituents to appear in the correct positions?

Let me think about the possible steps. The starting material is benzene.

Option 1: Maybe first add nitro group, then bromine, then ketone.

But wait, the ketone is a meta director, so adding it last would affect where the previous groups were added.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is added first, then nitro, then bromine? Or some other sequence.

Wait, another approach: look at the options given and see which sequence makes sense.

Looking at the options, each is a series of reactions. Let's look at each option's steps.

Option A:
i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts acylation: adds acetyl group)
ii) Br2/FeBr3 (bromination)
iii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration)
iv) Fe/HCl (maybe removing something? Like a nitro group reduction?)
v) HNO3/H2SO4 (another nitration)
vi) NaNO2/HCl (maybe diazotization)
vii) H3PO2 (like for Sandmeyer reaction, but not sure)

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts adds the acetyl group. But benzene can undergo Friedel-Crafts acylation, but if benzene is activated, but wait, benzene is not strongly activated. Wait, benzene can undergo Friedel-Crafts acylation, which would add the acetyl group. Then, bromination would occur, but where?

Wait, after adding the acetyl group, which is at position 1, the next substitution would be directed by the acetyl group. Since acetyl is meta-directing, the next substitution would be at meta to it.

So perhaps the first substitution is acetyl, then bromine would come in meta to it. Then nitration would come in another position.

But let's think through each step.

Option A:
i) Friedel-Crafts acylation: benzene becomes acetophenone (phenyl ketone). So the acetyl is at position 1.

ii) Br2 in FeBr3: bromination. Since the acetyl group is meta-directing, the next Br would enter at meta to the acetyl. So in the benzene ring, the acetyl is at position 1, Br at 3.

iii) Nitration: HNO3/H2SO4. The acetyl group is meta-directing, but the Br is ortho/para-directing (but deactivating). So where would the nitronium ion attack?

Wait, the current substituents are acetyl at 1 and Br at 3. The next substitution is nitration.

The ring has two substituents: acetyl (meta director) and Br (ortho/para director). So the positions available would be influenced by both.

Wait, but the acetyl group is a stronger deactivating group than Br. So perhaps the nitration would be directed by the acetyl group. Or maybe the Br has more influence.

Wait, but in such cases, the orientation is determined by the strongest director. Since acetyl is a meta director and Br is an ortho/para director, but both are deactivating. So which is a stronger director? Well, the acetyl group is a strong meta director, so the nitration may occur meta to it, but that depends on the positions.

Wait, acetyl is at position 1, Br at 3. So the positions available for nitration are 5 (meta to acetyl) or 4 and 6 (ortho to Br) or 2 and 6 (para to Br? Wait, no, in a benzene ring, the positions are such that if position 1 is acetyl, position 3 is Br, then position 5 is opposite to position 1 (if benzene is a hexagon with 1 at top, 2 and 6 adjacent, 3 and 5 opposite each other.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to imagine as a benzene ring with acetyl at position 1, Br at position 3. Then the available positions are 2,4,5,6.

Nitration would be directed by the substituents. Let's see: the acetyl group at 1 is a meta director, which would direct incoming groups to position 4 (since 1's meta is 4). Or wait, no: the meta to position 1 would be positions 3 and 5. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the meta positions relative to position 1 are positions 3 and 5? Wait, position 1 is top, positions 2,3,4,5,6 in clockwise. So the meta positions are 3 and 5 relative to position 1. So the acetyl group directs incoming electrophiles to positions 3 and 5.

But position 3 is already occupied by Br. So the next position would be 5. So nitration would occur at position 5.

So after step iii in option A, the substituents would be 1 (acetyl), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). That's exactly the target structure!

Wait, but wait. Then, what about the following steps in option A?

iv) Fe/HCl: perhaps that's a reduction step, but Fe and HCl usually is used for something else. Maybe it's a reagent for removing a nitro group, but nitro groups are reduced to NH2 with H2/Pd or similar. Or maybe it's for a different purpose.

Wait, if we have acetyl, Br, and nitro groups, and then step iv is Fe/HCl, I'm not sure what that would do. Maybe it's a typo, but perhaps it's a step to remove one of the substituents? But the target has all three substituents, so this doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, the target is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl connected to the ketone. So the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone, which is at position 1. So in option A, after step iii, we would have exactly that: acetyl at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. So that would be correct. Then why are there more steps?

Because the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which is the same as acetophenone with Br at 3 and nitro at 5. So after step iii, we have the target. But option A has more steps beyond iii.

Hmm, that suggests that option A is not correct because the target is achieved after step iii, but the option goes on to further steps, which would alter the structure. Unless some steps are just for purification or maybe a protecting group, but that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the order of substituents. Let's think again.

Another approach: think about the order in which substituents are added. The ketone is a meta director, which would direct any subsequent electrophilic substitution to the meta position.

If I added the nitro group first, then the acetyl, then the bromine, would that work?

Wait, let's think about the options. Another option is option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3: so first addition is Br. So benzene becomes bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration. Br is ortho/para director. So nitration would occur at ortho or para to Br.

Wait, but if Br is at position 1, nitration could be at 2, 4, or 6. But wait, the next step is adding acetyl.

Wait, then step iii is CH3COCl/AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, bromobenzene is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts may not proceed easily. Because bromine is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the ring, making Friedel-Crafts difficult. So step i: Br2/FeBr3 on benzene gives bromobenzene. Then step ii: nitration. But bromobenzene is deactivated, so nitration would be difficult unless a strong nitrating mixture is used. But if possible, nitration would occur in positions ortho or para to Br. Then step iii: Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, bromobenzene is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts would not proceed. Acylation needs an activating group, and Br is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts would not work. So option B might not be feasible because after adding Br, the ring becomes deactivating, making further electrophilic substitution difficult. Therefore, option B is probably incorrect.

Option C:

i) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration. Benzene undergoes nitration to become nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl: perhaps reduction of nitro group to amine. Wait, Fe/HCl is not typically used for nitro reduction. Nitro groups are usually reduced with, say, H2/Pd or Sn/HCl. Fe/HCl is more for something else, like maybe removing a nitro group.

Wait, but in any case, after nitration, step ii uses Fe/HCl. So if nitro group is present, and then Fe/HCl, perhaps the nitro group is converted to something else.

Wait, but nitrobenzene is meta director. So if you add a nitro group first, then the next substitution would be meta to it. Then adding an acetyl group, but wait, let me see the steps.

Option C's steps:

i) Nitration: benzene becomes nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl: perhaps reduction to aniline. Wait, but Fe/HCl isn't typically the reagent for that. Normally, nitrobenzene is reduced to aniline with H2/Pd or with Sn/HCl. So maybe this step is not for that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction. Wait, Fe/HCl could be used in a different context. Maybe it's a Birch reduction? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a step to demote the position of substitution.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is in position 1, and then after some steps, other substituents are added in the correct positions. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration. Benzene becomes nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl: perhaps reducing nitro group to amine. But again, not sure.

Wait, but then step iii: NaNO2/HCl: which is a diazotization step. So if the nitro group is reduced to amine, then diazotization would form a diazonium salt. But then step iv: H3PO2, which is a reducing agent, perhaps for the diazonium salt. Diazonium salts can undergo various reactions, like Sandmeyer reaction to introduce Cl, Br, CN, etc.

So in option D:

i) Nitro group added.

ii) Reduce nitro to amine.

iii) Diazotization.

iv) H3PO2: this is a mild reducing agent, perhaps used for controlled reduction. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but the target has an acetyl group, bromine, and nitro. So if nitro is added first, then we'd have to add the acetyl and bromine in the correct positions. But if nitro is at position 1, then the acetyl would come in meta to it (position 3 or 5), but then bromine would have to be at position 5 or 3. But then, the directing effects need to be considered.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the target structure. The acetyl group is attached to the benzene, with Br at position 3 and nitro at position 5. So the substituents are in 1,3,5 positions, but only two substituents besides the acetyl.

Wait, no, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl group in the ethanone has Br at 3 and nitro at 5 relative to the point of attachment (the ketone at 1). So the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 on the phenyl ring, and the ketone is at position 1.

So the problem is to arrange the substituents Br at 3 and NO2 at 5 with respect to the ketone.

So the synthesis steps must lead to this arrangement.

Let me think about the order of adding substituents. Since the ketone is a meta director, and nitro is also a meta director, perhaps the nitro group must be added after the ketone to be in the correct position.

Wait, if I add the ketone first, then nitro, and then Br, but wait, the Br is an ortho/para director. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added first, then the ketone, then Br.

Wait, let me think: if I first nitrate benzene to get nitrobenzene. Then perform Friedel-Crafts acylation to add the ketone. But nitro group is a meta director, so the acetyl would come in meta to nitro. So nitro at position 1, acetyl at position 3. Then, adding Br would be directed by the acetyl group (since it's a meta director) and the nitro group.

Wait, but after adding acetyl, the substituents are nitro (position 1) and acetyl (position 3). Now, adding Br: the acetyl group is at 3, which is a meta director, so Br would come at position 6 (meta to 3). But we need Br at position 5 relative to the acetyl (position 1). Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add Br first, then acetyl, then nitro. Let's see:

Benzene → bromobenzene (Br at 1).

Then Friedel-Crafts acylation: acetyl would come in meta to Br (since Br is ortho/para director). Wait, no: Friedel-Crafts is an electrophilic substitution. Br is an ortho/para director, so the acetyl would come in an ortho or para position. So if Br is at position 1, acetyl could be at 3 or 4. Let's say 3.

Then nitration: the substituents are Br at 1 and acetyl at 3. The acetyl is a meta director, so nitration would come at position 5 (meta to position 3). So that would give us Br at 1, acetyl at 3, nitro at 5.

But the target has the acetyl at position 1. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is acetyl first, then nitro, then Br.

So benzene → acetophenone (acetyl at 1).

Then nitration: acetyl is a meta director, so nitro comes at position 3 or 5. Let's say 3.

Then bromination: acetyl is meta director, bromine would come at position 5 (meta to acetyl at 1). Wait, but position 3 is already occupied by nitro.

So in this case, the Br would have to go into position 5. That would give acetyl at 1, nitro at 3, Br at 5. Which matches the target structure.

So that's the correct order: first acetylate (Friedel-Crafts), then nitrate (directed meta to acetyl), then brominate (directed meta to acetyl, but position 5 is available because 3 is nitro).

So the steps would be:

i) Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3)

ii) Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4)

iii) Bromination (Br2/FeBr3)

Wait, but let me think again. After acetylation, the ring has the acetyl group. Nitration would then occur at position 3 (meta to acetyl). Then bromination would occur at position 5 (meta to acetyl). But in the ring, after adding nitro at 3, where does the bromine go?

Wait, after adding nitro at 3, the substituents are acetyl (1) and nitro (3). Now, the next step is bromination. The ring has two substituents: acetyl (meta director) and nitro (meta director). So incoming Br would be directed to positions where both substituents agree.

Nitro at 3 is a meta director, so it would direct to positions 6 and 1 (but 1 is already occupied by acetyl). Acetyl at 1 is a meta director, so directs to 3 and 5 (3 is taken). So the only available position is 5. So Br would go to 5.

Thus, the substitution would be at position 5. So the substituents would be at 1 (acetyl),3 (nitro),5 (Br). But the target is 1 (acetyl),3 (Br),5 (nitro). Hmm, that's the opposite of what we need.

Wait, so the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5. But in this sequence, nitro is at 3 and Br at 5. So that's not matching.

Ah, this is an issue. So perhaps the order of nitration and bromination needs to be swapped.

Alternative approach: after acetylation, brominate first, then nitrate.

So steps:

i) Friedel-Crafts → acetyl at 1.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → Br at 3 (meta to acetyl).

iii) Nitration → nitro would be directed to position 5 (meta to acetyl).

So substituents are 1 (acetyl),3 (Br),5 (nitro). Which matches the target.

So the correct sequence is acetyl, then Br, then nitro.

Looking at the options, does any option follow this sequence?

Let me check each option's steps.

Option A: Steps are acylation, bromination, nitration. That's the correct order. So after step iii, the target is achieved.

But looking at option A, after step iii, it has other steps. So that can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me recheck the options:

Option A's steps:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

So after these three steps, the molecule should have acetyl (1), Br (3), nitro (5). Which is the target. But option A continues with steps iv to vii, which would alter the structure.

So why are there more steps? That suggests that option A isn't the correct sequence because the target is achieved earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is synthesized through a different pathway, maybe requiring protection or other steps.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the nitro group is added before the acetyl. Let me consider that possibility.

If nitration is done first, then acetylation, then bromination.

So step i: nitration → nitro at 1.

Step ii: Friedel-Crafts acylation. But nitro is a meta director. So acetyl would come at position 3 or 5.

Then step iii: bromination. The substituents are nitro (1) and acetyl (3, say). Nitro is meta director, acetyl is meta. So where would Br go? The available position would be 5, which is meta to acetyl (3) and para to nitro (1).

Wait, nitro is at 1, acetyl at 3. Then, Br would be at 5 (meta to acetyl). So substituents are 1 (nitro), 3 (acetyl), 5 (Br). But the target has acetyl at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, acetyl comes at position 5. Then, after nitration and acetylation, the substituents are nitro at 1, acetyl at 5. Then bromination: Br would go to position 3 (meta to acetyl at 5). That would give substituents at 1 (nitro), 3 (Br), 5 (acetyl). Which is not the target.

Hmm, this isn't working. So perhaps the initial approach of adding acetyl first, then Br, then nitro is correct, and the steps in the options must follow this.

Looking again at the options, which option does that?

Option A's steps are:

1. Acetyl

2. Br

3. Nitro

So the correct order. But then why does option A have steps after that? Because in the target, the substituents are acetyl (1), Br (3), nitro (5). Once all three are added, the target is formed. So why are there more steps?

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the steps. Let me re-examine.

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in how the substituents are arranged. Alternatively, perhaps the target has the nitro group at position 5 relative to the acetyl, but the bromine is at position 3.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the nitration occurs before bromination, but after acetylation. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps there's a possibility of adding the nitro group after the acetyl and before the bromine. Let me see.

But earlier reasoning suggested that if acetyl is added first, then nitration, then bromination, the nitro would be at 3 and Br at 5, which is not the target. But if we swap the order: acetyl, bromine, nitration, that would have nitro at 5.

Wait, no: after acetyl, bromination would place Br at 3 (meta to acetyl). Then nitration would place nitro at 5 (meta to acetyl). So that's correct.

Which option follows this order?

Looking at the options:

Option A: steps i, ii, iii are acetyl, Br, nitro. So that's the correct order. Then, why does option A have more steps?

Wait, perhaps the question is about high-yield synthesis, and some steps are necessary for protection or other purposes. Alternatively, perhaps the target has more substituents, but that's not the case.

Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So it's only three substituents.

But looking at the options, option A's steps after iii are:

iv) Fe/HCl → perhaps this is for something else, but I'm not sure.

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration? But we already have nitro group.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → maybe for something else.

So, this doesn't make sense because the target is already achieved after step iii.

So perhaps option A isn't the right choice. Then, looking at other options.

Option C: steps i) nitration, ii) Fe/HCl (possibly reduction), iii) acylation, iv) bromination, etc.

Wait, let me think. If I first nitrate benzene to get nitrobenzene (step i). Then step ii: Fe/HCl. As before, not sure what that does. Then step iii: acylation with CH3COCl/AlCl3. But nitrobenzene is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts may not work. So option C might not be feasible.

Option D: steps i) nitration, ii) Fe/HCl, iii) NaNO2/HCl, iv) H3PO2, which may involve some diazonium salt formation.

Not sure, but perhaps this is for substituting a nitro group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a way to introduce a bromine via an intermediate.

Wait, another idea: sometimes, nitro groups can be converted to other substituents. For example, nitro can be reduced to amine, then the amine can be converted to a leaving group.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think about how each option's steps would proceed.

Option D's steps:

i) Nitration → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction to aniline.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization to form diazonium chloride.

iv) H3PO2 → a reducing agent, perhaps to convert the diazonium salt to a bromine? Wait, H3PO2 is used in the presence of Cu for the Jones oxidation, but for diazonium salts, perhaps it's used in the Sandmeyer reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, H3PO2 is used for controlled reductions, like in the Arndt-Eistert synthesis, but I'm not certain.

Another thought: if nitro is reduced to amine (step ii), then diazotized (step iii) to form a diazonium salt, which can undergo displacement with, say, Br- to introduce Br via the Sandmeyer reaction.

But wait, in that case, the substituents would be introduced in a specific position.

Let me try to imagine the steps.

Step i: nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene (position 1).

Step ii: Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine. So benzene has -NH2 at position 1.

Step iii: NaNO2/HCl → form diazonium chloride. So the amine becomes a diazonium salt.

Step iv: H3PO2 → perhaps a reducing condition to introduce Br.

Wait, no, after forming the diazonium salt, perhaps in step v, but option D doesn't have a step v with Br. Alternatively, maybe in step iv, the diazonium group is converted to Br.

Wait, in the Sandmeyer reaction, the diazonium salt is treated with CuBr in presence of KCN, etc., to introduce Br. So perhaps in step iv, H3PO2 is used as a reducing agent to convert the diazonium salt to Br.

But I'm not sure about this. Alternatively, perhaps option D is introducing Br via this method.

But let's think about the positions. If the nitro group is at position 1, and after reduction, it's an amine. Then, diazotization and substitution would replace the amine with Br at position 1.

But that would give bromobenzene, but then we have to introduce the acetyl group. So perhaps after that, steps would involve acylation.

But looking at option D's steps:

After step iv, which is H3PO2, there's step v: Br2/FeBr3 → bromination again? Or perhaps another step.

Wait, option D's steps go on to step v: Br2/FeBr3.

So after steps i-iv, we have Br at position 1. Then step v: bromination, which would add another Br. But the target only has one Br.

Hmm, this seems confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is acetylation first, then bromination, then nitration, as in option A's first three steps. But why does option A have more steps?

Wait, perhaps the steps after iii in option A are for some other purpose, like removing a group or introducing another substituent, but that doesn't make sense because the target is achieved after step iii.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something about the reaction steps. Maybe some steps are for activating the ring again or for functional group interconversion.

Wait, another angle: the presence of a nitro group can be reduced to an amine, but I don't see that being necessary here.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration in step iii of option A is followed by some reduction steps to convert nitro to something else, but that doesn't align with the target.

Wait, perhaps the target requires the nitro group to be in a specific position relative to the acetyl and Br. So maybe the order is acetyl, nitro, Br.

Wait, but as earlier analysis, that would place Br at position 5, whereas the target has Br at position 3. So that's not correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's consider each option's steps and see which leads to the correct substitution pattern.

Option A:

After steps i, ii, iii:

- Acetyl at 1

- Br at 3

- Nitro at 5

Which is the target. So why are there more steps in option A? Because the target is achieved after step iii, the other steps would likely destroy the structure. So perhaps the correct option is A, but the other steps are extraneous or perhaps the correct option is the one that stops at step iii. But none of the options stop; they all have 7 steps.

Wait, perhaps the target is not achieved after step iii. Maybe I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, another possibility: the positions after substitution may not be as I imagined. Perhaps the substituents are added in a different orientation.

Wait, another approach: the target has the substituents at 3 and 5 relative to the acetyl group. So after acetyl is added, the next substituents are added in the meta positions. So bromine must be added before nitro to get them in the correct positions.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is acetyl, bromine, nitro. Then, the substituents would be 1 (acetyl),3 (Br),5 (nitro). That's correct.

So which option follows this order?

Looking at the options:

Option A: steps i, ii, iii are acetyl, Br, nitro. So that's correct.

So after steps i, ii, iii, the target is formed. So why does the option include steps iv to vii?

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but the subsequent steps are unnecessary. Or perhaps the steps after iii are for further modification, but since the question is about leading to the target, the first three steps are sufficient.

But all the options have seven steps. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the target.

Wait, perhaps the target is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl with the ketone. So the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 on the benzene ring attached to the ketone. So perhaps the order is correct in option A, but the steps after iii are for something else, like introducing another group or perhaps a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option A because the initial steps are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the possibility that the target is not just three substituents but has a different arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the target is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl group attached to the ketone. So in that case, the ring has acetyl (position 1), Br (3), nitro (5).

So the correct order is acetyl, Br, nitro. Which is option A's first three steps.

So the correct answer is option A. But why does option A have more steps? Maybe those other steps are not relevant, or perhaps they are part of a longer synthesis that includes other functional groups, but the target is formed after step iii.

But since the question asks for the sequence that leads to the target, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the nitration in step iii of option A adds the nitro group in the correct position because of the directing effects of the acetyl and Br groups. Let me re-examine.

After acetyl and Br are added:

- Acetyl (1): meta director.

- Br (3): ortho/para director.

So the nitration would be directed by both. The acetyl would direct meta (positions 4 and 6, I think?), while Br would direct ortho (2,6) and para (5).

Wait, wait. The acetyl is at 1, Br at 3.

The possible positions for nitration would be:

From acetyl (meta): positions 3 and 5. But 3 is taken by Br, so 5 is available.

From Br (ortho/para): ortho positions (2 and 4), para position (6).

So the nitronium ion would have to choose between position 5 (directed by acetyl) and positions 2,4,6 (directed by Br).

Which one is more influential? Acetyl is a stronger deactivating group than Br. So the nitration would be directed more by the acetyl group.

Thus, nitration would occur at position 5.

So the substituents would be 1 (acetyl), 3 (Br), 5 (nitro). Which matches the target.

So option A is correct.

Thus, despite the extra steps, the correct sequence is steps i, ii, iii, which are in option A. So the correct option is A.


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must ensure that the substituents (acetyl, bromine, and nitro groups) are introduced in the correct positions on the benzene ring. The target compound has the acetyl group at position 1, bromine at position 3, and nitro group at position 5, relative to the ketone.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A:**
1. **Step i: CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ (Friedel-Crafts acylation)**  
   Benzene undergoes acylation to form acetophenone (acetyl group at position 1).

2. **Step ii: Br₂/FeBr₃ (bromination)**  
   The acetyl group is a meta-director. Bromination occurs at position 3 (meta to the acetyl group).

3. **Step iii: HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (nitration)**  
   The acetyl group remains the dominant director. Nitration occurs at position 5 (meta to the acetyl group).  
   **Result:** The target compound is formed after these three steps.

4. **Steps iv–vii:**  
   These steps (Fe/HCl, HNO₃/H₂SO₄, NaNO₂/HCl, H₃PO₂) are unnecessary for the synthesis of the target compound and do not align with the required sequence.

#### **Option B:**
1. **Step i: Br₂/FeBr₃ (bromination)**  
   Benzene undergoes bromination to form bromobenzene (bromine at position 1).

2. **Step ii: HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (nitration)**  
   Bromine is an ortho/para-director. Nitration occurs at position 2 or 4. This does not lead to the desired substitution pattern.

3. **Step iii: CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ (Friedel-Crafts acylation)**  
   Bromobenzene is deactivated, making Friedel-Crafts acylation difficult or unlikely to proceed efficiently.

#### **Option C:**
1. **Step i: HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (nitration)**  
   Benzene undergoes nitration to form nitrobenzene (nitro group at position 1).

2. **Step ii: Fe/HCl**  
   This step is unclear but does not align with the required sequence for introducing the acetyl group.

3. **Step iii: CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ (Friedel-Crafts acylation)**  
   Nitrobenzene is deactivated, making Friedel-Crafts acylation difficult or unlikely to proceed efficiently.

#### **Option D:**
1. **Step i: HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (nitration)**  
   Benzene undergoes nitration to form nitrobenzene (nitro group at position 1).

2. **Step ii: Fe/HCl**  
   This step is unclear but does not align with the required sequence for introducing the acetyl group.

3. **Step iii: NaNO₂/HCl (diazotization)**  
   This step is unnecessary for the synthesis of the target compound and does not contribute to the desired substitution pattern.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence of reactions is found in **Option A**, where the acetyl group is introduced first (Friedel-Crafts acylation), followed by bromination, and finally nitration. These steps ensure that the substituents are added in the correct positions to form the target compound. While Option A includes additional steps (iv–vii) that are not necessary for the synthesis, the first three steps (i–iii) are sufficient to achieve the desired product.
