Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me take it step by step.

The question starts with Compound A, which has the formula C3H6. Hmm, what structures could that be? Well, C3H6 is either propene (an alkene) or propane with a double bond. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3, right? Because another possibility is cyclopropane, but that's less likely unless specified. So I think A is propene.

Then, compound A undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Oh, wait, bromination in CCl4 is usually an addition reaction. Since A is propene, which has a double bond, the bromine (Br2) would add across the double bond. So adding Br2 to propene would yield 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, no, wait. Propene has a CH2-CH2-CH3 structure but with a double bond between carbons 1 and 2. So adding Br would give 1,2-dibromopropane. So compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, but sometimes the addition can be in a different position, but I think in this case, since it's propene, the addition would be between the two middle carbons. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base, so perhaps an elimination reaction. Wait, if B is 1,2-dibromopropane, the reaction with KOH (alcoholic) would induce an elimination, probably dehydrohalogenation. But wait, 1,2-dibromopropane has two adjacent Br atoms. So when eliminating, the base would abstract a Î²-hydrogen, but since both adjacent carbons have
