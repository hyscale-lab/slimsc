Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. The options are given in terms of E, which is defined as E = (pi² ħ²)/(2mL²). So each particle's energy in the well is quantized, right?

I remember that for a single particle in a 1D infinite well of length L, the energy levels are given by E_n = n² E, where E is as defined. So the ground state is n=1, first excited is n=2, second excited is n=3, etc.

But wait, the problem has four identical spin-1/2 particles. Spin-1/2 means they're fermions, right? Because electrons, protons, etc., have spin-1/2 and are fermions. So they obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state in the same system.

So for fermions, each energy level can hold a certain number of particles. Each distinct quantum state is described by a unique set of quantum numbers and spin. Since it's a 1D well, the quantum number is just n. And for spin-1/2, each n can have two possible spin states: up and down.

Wait, no, wait. In a 1D well, the quantum state is determined by n and spin. So for each n, you can have two particles with opposite spins. So each n can hold two particles.

But wait, in the case of spin-1/2 particles, each spatial state (n) can hold two particles with opposite spins. So for each energy level E_n, you can have two particles.

Wait, but when filling the levels, you have to do so according to the Pauli exclusion principle, which means each unique quantum state can only have one particle. So for each n, you can have two particles (spin up and spin down).

Right, so for four particles, let's think about how they fill the energy levels.

The ground state would have the lowest possible energy, so the lowest n possible, but each n can have two particles.

So let's list the energy levels in order of increasing energy:

n=1
