Alright, so I've got this question about the impulse approximation in nuclear physics. Hmm, I remember that the impulse approximation is used in many-body calculations, especially when dealing with interactions like electroweak. The idea is that nucleons behave as if they're free, right? But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact assumptions that lead to this approximation.

The question gives four assumptions and asks which combination leads to the impulse approximation. Let me read each assumption again.

1. Interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.
2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.
3. The quarks inside the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.
4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.

The options are A to D, each a combination of these. I need to figure out which assumptions together imply the impulse approximation.

Okay, thinking about the impulse approximation. From what I remember, it's when the internal motions of the nucleons are considered, but the interaction is treated as a perturbation. So, each nucleon interacts almost independently. 

Assumption 1 says the interaction only affects individual nucleons. That makes sense because the impulse approximation treats each nucleon as if it's free, so the current doesn't mess with othersâ€”just one at a time.

Assumption 2: the nucleus is transparent except for the selected nucleon. Wait, transparent means that the interaction doesn't see the other nucleons, right? So the nucleus doesn't impede the interaction beyond the one nucleon. That's like saying the other nucleons don't affect the interaction, which would mean each nucleon behaves as a free particle. That fits with the impulse idea.

Assumption 3: quarks are non-relativistic. Hmm, I'm not sure. Non-relativistic means their speeds are much lower than light, so maybe it's related to how we model their interactions. But the impulse approximation is more about the treatment of the interaction in the nucleus, not so much about the internal quark dynamics. Wait, but if the quarks are non-relativistic, maybe their motion doesn't contribute much to the overall interaction. Or perhaps it's about the wavefunctions being static? Not too sure. Maybe this assumption is more about the structure of the nucleon rather than the nuclear interactions. So if the quarks are non-relativistic, perhaps their internal motion isn't considered in the interaction, treating the nucleon as a point particle. So that could fit into the approximation.

Assumption 4: the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces. Oh, right, because if the nucleon feels no binding, it's like it's free. So that definitely supports the impulse approximation. So in this case, the other nucleons aren't affecting the one we're looking at, so it acts as if it's free.

Wait, the question says which assumptions jointly imply the impulse approximation
