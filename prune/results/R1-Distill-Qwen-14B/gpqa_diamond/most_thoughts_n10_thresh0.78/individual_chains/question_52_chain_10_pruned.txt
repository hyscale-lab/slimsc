Alright, let's try to figure out this astronomy problem. So, the question is about stars with and without spots and how that affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, okay, let's break it down.

So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The photosphere is in LTE, so Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium applies, which means I can probably use the Boltzmann equation for the energy levels.

The problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2 decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Wait, the factor is (Ratio without spots) / (Ratio with spots), right? Because the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, so the factor should be greater than one.

The energy levels are in neutral Ti, so I'm dealing with the Boltzmann distribution. The ratio n1/n2 is given by (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(kT) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights of the levels, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

But wait, the transition between these levels is at 1448 Ã…. Oh, that's in the ultraviolet, which I think is part of the star's spectrum. So, this emission or absorption line is related to the energy difference between the two levels.

Hmm, but the star's temperature is the key here. Without spots, the Teff is 6000 K, but when 40% of the surface is spotted, the overall Teff is 5500 K. Wait, I'm a bit confused. How does having spots lower the effective temperature? Oh, right, because the spots are cooler, so the total emitted flux is less.

Wait, the effective temperature is a measure of the total luminosity. When spots cover part of the surface, the star appears cooler overall. But in this case, the problem says the effective
