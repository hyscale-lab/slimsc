Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let me read it again and think through each step.

So the question involves two reactions with mCPBA and aqueous acid. The starting materials are (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Then, the products are combined and run on two HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation of alkenes. So when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. But wait, the reaction conditions are followed by aqueous acid. Oh right, that usually leads to the opening of the epoxide. So what happens when an epoxide is treated with acid?

Epoxide ring opening with acid typically involves a protonation of the oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, a nucleophilic attack occurs. Since it's acid, water is likely the nucleophile. So the epoxide will open via acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.

But wait, the initial reaction is the epoxidation. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the structure of the epoxide. Let's think about each reaction.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene. The E geometry means that the higher priority groups on each carbon are opposite each other. When mCPBA adds to the double bond, it forms an epoxide. Since mCPBA is an electrophilic oxidizing agent, it adds across the double bond, creating an epoxide with specific stereochemistry. Wait, mCPBA adds across the double bond in a way that forms an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene? Or does it form a trans epoxide?

Wait, no. Let me think. mCPBA is a peracid, and epoxidation by peracids is a concerted process. The addition of the oxygen occurs across the double bond, and the stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the geometry of the starting alkene. For a trans (E) double bond, the epoxide will form a trans configuration as well. Wait, no, the epoxide will form
