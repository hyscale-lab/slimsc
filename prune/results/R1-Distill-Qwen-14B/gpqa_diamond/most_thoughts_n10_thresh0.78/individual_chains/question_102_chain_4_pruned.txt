Okay, so I've got this question about a scientific experiment involving gene constructs and fluorescent markers. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step. 

So the setup is that someone identified a new ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor has an IRES upstream of it. There are stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272 respectively, which I think are used for Cre-mediated recombination to allow expression of either the ligand or receptor.

Wait, bicistronic means two genes in one vector, right? So the vector probably has both ligand and receptor under certain promoters and stop cassettes. Oh, but the vector is lox-Cre, so maybe it's for conditional expression. So when Cre is present, it would delete the stop cassettes, allowing the genes to be expressed.

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested them on Western blot. So they transfected primary astrocytes and checked for the proteins. Actin is a loading control here. But the main part is when they breed the mouse model homozygous for the construct on a wild-type background, then crossed them with SOX10-Cre mice. The offspring should have the Cre, which would recombine the lox sites, I think. So the idea is that Cre would remove the stop cassettes, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But they looked for green signal under the microscope. eGFP is green, so they expected the receptor-eGFP to be expressed in certain cells. But they didn't see any green signal. So why?

Looking at the options:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But how does that affect the expression in the mouse model? If they're expressed in the same cell, maybe it's autocrine. If they're in different cells, maybe the Cre is not activating both. But the question is about expression of the receptors, not necessarily the function. So perhaps this isn't the main issue here.

B) receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. If the protein isn't trafficking properly, it won't be at the cell surface, so you won't see the GFP signal. But if the construct is correctly made, it should traffic. Also, the Western blot would show the protein if it's made, but maybe not if it's retained. Wait, but the question says they tested the construct expression on Western blot—so if the protein isn't made, the blot wouldn't show a signal. But in this case, the mouse is homozygous, so the construct is present. But the problem is that the Cre might not have activated the expression. Or maybe the expression is not being driven correctly.

C) the enhancer for ligand and receptor is missing. If the promoters aren't working, the genes won't be expressed. The ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter. The receptor has an IRES, which is used in internal ribosome entry sites—commonly for allowing two genes to be expressed from a single transcript. But wait, the vector is bicistronic with the ligand first, then the receptor. So the IRES would allow the receptor to be translated after the ligand. But if the enhancer is missing, the promoters might not be active, so neither ligand nor receptor would be expressed. But the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter, so that might not be the issue. Unless the IRES isn't working, but I'm not sure.

D) the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Oh wait, perhaps the stop cassette is between the receptor ORF and eGFP. So the receptor is followed by a stop, then eGFP. So if the stop is not removed, the receptor would be expressed without eGFP. But if the stop is removed by Cre, then the receptor-eGFP would be expressed as a single fusion protein. Wait, no. The stop cassette is in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 between the receptor and eGFP. So when Cre (which recognizes loxP sites) acts, but wait, lox2272 is a different variant. Oh, wait, loxP and lox2272 are different. Cre from SOX10-Cre is probably loxP-specific. So if the vector has a loxP stop in the ligand region and lox2272 in the receptor region, and the Cre used is only loxP, then the lox2272 region won't be cut.

So the setup is: the ligand is at 5', with a loxP-stop-loxP cassette after it, before mCherry. The receptor is at 3', with a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette after it before eGFP. So when Cre is introduced (from the SOX10-Cre mice), which recognizes loxP sites, it will remove the loxP-stop-loxP cassette, allowing the ligand to be expressed along with mCherry. The receptor's lox2272 cassette won't be affected because Cre doesn't cut lox2272. So the receptor would remain with the stop cassette, meaning the receptor wouldn't be expressed. Because the stop would prevent translation beyond it.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The ligand is 5', followed by loxP-stop-loxP, then mCherry. So without Cre, the stop would prevent the ligand from being expressed with mCherry. Cre would delete the loxP sites and the stop, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be co-expressed. But the receptor is at 3', with an IRES upstream, then the ORF, then lox2272-stop-lox2272, then eGFP. So the IRES allows the receptor to be translated after the ligand. But the stop cassette is in between the receptor and eGFP. So if Cre isn't acting on the lox2272 sites, the stop cassette remains, preventing the eGFP from being expressed. So the receptor would be expressed as a separate protein, and eGFP would not.

Wait, but in the mouse model, they are homozygous for the construct. So both alleles have the ligand and receptor constructs. Then when they cross with SOX10-Cre, which is a transgenic mouse that expresses Cre under the control of the SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells, I think. So in the offspring, the Cre should delete the loxP sites in the construct.

So in the ligand's part: Cre deletes the loxP-stop, so the ligand and mCherry are expressed together. But in the receptor's part: the stop is between the receptor OR
