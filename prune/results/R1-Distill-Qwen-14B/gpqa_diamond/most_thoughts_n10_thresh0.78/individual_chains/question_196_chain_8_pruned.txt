Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic context. Right, in classical mechanics, the maximum speed for a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². At maximum speed, these are equal, so v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m). But wait, that's the non-relativistic case, and the options include some with the speed of light c, so I guess relativity comes into play here.

Relativistic effects become significant when the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So the kinetic energy can't be treated classically anymore. Oh right, in relativity, the total energy includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The total energy E is gamma times mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor: 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

So the system's total energy would be the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy. Wait, but in the case of a harmonic oscillator, energy is conserved. The maximum potential energy is when the mass is at amplitude A. So maybe the total mechanical energy (which is conserved) would be the sum of the rest energy and the maximum potential energy. Or is it the other way around? 

Wait, in a classical oscillator, the total energy is (1/2)kA². But when you consider relativity, the energy might be different because the kinetic energy increases with speed. Hmm, okay, I need to model this properly.

Let me outline the approach. The potential energy of the oscillator is U = (1/2)kx². The total energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential energy. But in relativity, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². So at the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic, which is the maximum speed scenario. At x=A, all energy is potential, which would be the maximum potential energy.

Wait, but in relativity, the total energy E is gamma mc². At x=0, the kinetic energy is E - mc². Because
