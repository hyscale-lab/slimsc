Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Optical isomerism, as I remember, occurs when a compound has chiral centers, meaning they're non-superimposable mirror images. Or wait, maybe it's when there's a plane of symmetry or something else? Hmm, no, chiral centers are definitely key here.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So this sounds like a biphenyl structure, which is two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are on the 2 and 6 positions. Wait, the substituents are nitro groups and carboxylate esters. Because the biphenyl has a single bond between the two rings, the molecule can rotate, so if the substituents are on opposite sides, there might be a possibility of cis and trans isomers. But wait, optical isomerism requires a chiral center, not just geometric isomerism. But wait, maybe the substituents create a chiral center in the structure. Alternatively, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it might not be chiral. Hmm. Let me visualize it. The biphenyl has two rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at the 2 and 6 positions on each ring. Wait, the 2 and 2' positions have carboxylate groups, and the 6 and 6' have nitro groups. So each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate group, but on adjacent positions. Wait, no, 2 and 6 are opposite on a benzene ring. So each ring has nitro at 6 and carboxylate at 2. So each ring has two substituents in para positions. Wait, but if that's the case, the molecule might
