Okay, let's try to figure out this physics problem. Hmm, so the question is about particles moving in a detector and reaching the inner walls. The setup is that when particles are collided, new particles are produced. These new particles are fast and have a Lorentz factor of about 20 on average. But only one third of them reach the detector's inner walls. Now, they want to know what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds reach the walls.

Wait, so the original situation is a Lorentz factor of 20, and 1/3 reach the walls. They want to find the new Lorentz factor that would result in 2/3 of the particles reaching the walls.

I think the key here is the relationship between the particles' speed (or Lorentz factor) and how far they travel before decaying. Because if the particles are moving faster, they might travel further before decaying. So the probability of them reaching the detector walls depends on their lifetime and speed.

Oh right, in relativity, the lifetime of the particle as measured in the lab frame is longer than its proper lifetime due to time dilation. The Lorentz factor gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), right? So the proper lifetime is tau, and the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau.

But wait, these particles are fast and decay quickly. So the distance they can travel before decaying is important. The distance would be velocity times the lifetime, so v * gamma tau. But since gamma is v/c over sqrt(1 - v²/c²), but perhaps more importantly, for ultra-relativistic particles, v is approximately c. So distance d ≈ c * gamma tau.

The detector has a radius of 30 meters. So for a particle to reach the inner wall, the distance it travels must be at least 30 meters. So the condition is d >= 30 m.

So the probability that a particle reaches the wall depends on how likely it is for them to travel at least 30 meters before decaying.

Wait, but the problem says that on average, one third reach the wall. So maybe the probability is related to the ratio of the distance they can travel on average versus the detector's radius.

Another thought: the number of particles that reach the wall is probably proportional to the product of the velocity and the time they live, which relates to their speed and lifetime. Since the Lorentz factor affects both the speed (which is almost c for high gamma) and the lifetime.

Wait, perhaps the fraction of particles reaching the wall is proportional to the ratio of the distance they can travel to the detector's radius. So if a particle can go a distance L, and the detector is radius R, then the probability P is the ratio L/R. But wait, that would be for particles that can go exactly R. Hmm, not exactly sure.

Alternatively, the average distance a particle travels is v * gamma tau. Let's call this average distance D. So D = v * gamma tau.

But since v is approximately c for high gamma, D ≈ c gamma tau.

So the average distance is proportional to gamma. So the probability that a particle reaches the wall would be D divided by the detector's radius, but that's not exactly correct because it's a probability function. Maybe the probability is the fraction of particles whose average distance is greater than the detector's radius.

Wait, but in the first case, they have a Lorentz factor of 20, and one third (1/3) reach the walls. So when gamma was 20, the fraction is 1/3.

We need to find gamma_new such that the fraction is 2/3.

Assuming that the fraction is proportional to gamma, but let's think again. Because the average distance is proportional to gamma, so the fraction reaching the wall would scale with gamma. So if gamma increases, the fraction would increase.

Wait, but wait. If the
