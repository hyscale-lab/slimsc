Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to think through it step by step. 

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The cavity has radius r, and it's smaller than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. 

The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. The point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, so P is definitely outside. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm. I remember that when a charge is inside a conductor's cavity, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. So when we put the charge +q inside the cavity, the conductor must have induced charges. 

Inside a conductor, the electric field is zero. But wait, this is a cavity situation. So I think the conductor's charges would arrange themselves in such a way to cancel the field inside the conductor. But the cavity is non-conductive, right? Or wait, no—the conductor is conducting. So the cavity is surrounded by a conductor. 

So when the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge -q on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor was initially uncharged, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance. Because the total charge of the conductor before was zero, so now the inner surface is -q, the outer must be +q.

But wait, the problem states the conductor is uncharged. So the total charge on the conductor is zero. So the inner surface will have -q, and the outer surface must have +q. Because the conductor was neutral, and the charge inside the cavity is +q, so the conductor's net charge is zero. Therefore, the inner surface must have -q (due to induction), and the outer surface must have +q.

Now, for the electric field outside the conductor. The conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So when we're outside the conductor (since P is at distance L > R), the electric field should be due to the +q on the outer surface. But wait, the outer surface is a sphere, so the field outside would be as if the charge were concentrated at the center. 

Wait, but wait—wait a second. The conductor is a sphere, but the cavity is not at the center. The center of the cavity is s away from the center of the conductor. So the induced charges on the conductor's inner surface are not symmetrically placed. The inner surface's charge distribution is not uniform because the cavity is offset. So does that affect the outer surface's charge distribution?

No, because the outer surface of the conductor is a spherical shell. The charge on the outer surface will still distribute uniformly, regardless of the inner charge distribution, because the conductor is a sphere. So the outer
