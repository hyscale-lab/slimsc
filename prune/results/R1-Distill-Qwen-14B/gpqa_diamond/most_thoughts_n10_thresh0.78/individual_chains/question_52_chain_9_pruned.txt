Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. When it's not covered by dark spots, it has a certain effective temperature, and when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall temperature drops. Then, there's a question about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels, and how this ratio changes when the star has spots.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that the distribution of atoms between energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). Oh right, the Boltzmann factor tells us the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels.

The Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(kT) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in level 1 and level 2 (n1/n2) is what's being considered. So the ratio they're looking at is the inverse of the usual n2/n1. So, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(kT) ). Wait, no, because E2 is higher than E1, so E2-E1 is positive. So when T increases, the exponent becomes larger negative, so n2/n1 decreases because exp(-something big) is small. Or wait, let me think again.

Wait, let me get this straight. Suppose E2 is higher than E1. Then the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1. So, the exponent is -ΔE/(kT). If temperature T increases, this exponent becomes less negative, so the exponential term increases. So, n2/n1 increases with temperature. Because when it's hotter, more atoms can be excited to higher energy levels.

But in this problem, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So the temperature goes down. So for a lower T, the exponent becomes more negative. So the ratio n2/n1 would decrease because the exponential term becomes smaller. So then, the ratio of n1/n2 would increase because (n1/n2) is inversely proportional to that.

Wait, the question says that when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. Hmm, that's the opposite of what I thought. So let me check again.

Wait, maybe I got the ratio backward. The problem says that the ratio of n1 to n2 (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. Wait, let me re-read the question.

"Astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots." So when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 is lower than when it doesn't. So, when spots are present (lower T), n1/n2 is smaller.

Wait, but based on the Boltzmann equation,
