Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, so that's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. The NMR data is given, and then it's reacted with a series of reagents. I need to find the final product from the options given.

First, I think I should analyze the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. Let's break down the NMR peaks.

The 1H-NMR data is:
- 9.72 ppm: triplet (t), 1H
- 6.98 ppm: doublet (d), 2H
- 6.51 ppm: doublet (d), 2H
- 6.27 ppm: broad singlet (bs), 2H
- 3.66 ppm: doublet (d), 2H

I remember that a triplet around 9.7 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. So that's 1H as an aldehyde. So the molecule probably has an aldehyde group (-CHO).

Next, looking at the aromatic region. The peaks at 6.98 and 6.51 are both doublets. That suggests two sets of aromatic protons, each as doublets. Maybe two substituted benzene rings, each with two equivalent protons. For example, para-substituted rings. Because in para substitution, the protons are equivalent and split into doublets when there's a substituent in the para position.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. If the ring has substituents in the para position, each ring's protons would be a doublet. For example, if each ring has a substituent (like a nitro group or another group) that deshields the protons, causing the downfield shift.

Alternatively, maybe it's a para-substituted benzaldehyde. But let's see.

The 6.27 ppm peak is a broad singlet integrating for 2H. Broad singlet suggests maybe an exchange process, like an acidic proton, such as a phenol. So, perhaps two phenolic protons, but they're split into a singlet? Wait, but if it's two protons, why a singlet? Oh, unless they're in the same environment and not split by adjacent protons. Hmm, maybe it's a di-substituted ring where the two protons are equivalent and not adjacent to any other protons. Like a meta substitution? Or maybe it's a ring with two substituents causing the protons to be equivalent and not split into multiple peaks.

Wait, another thought: maybe the 6.27 ppm is a vinyl proton? No, because vinyl protons are usually in the range of
