Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, right? I remember that when a system is in a pure state, the density matrix is a projector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. But this one looks different.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks like a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩. Oh right, because the trace of ρ should be 1 for a valid density matrix. Let me check: the trace is the sum of the diagonals. Each term |0⟩⟨0| has a 1 at (0,0), and |1⟩⟨1| has a 1 at (1,1). So adding them and dividing by 2, the diagonal entries would be 1/2 each. So the diagonal is [1/2, 1/2], and the off-diagonal elements are zero. So ρ is a diagonal matrix with entries 1/2 and 1/2.

I think this is the maximally mixed state for a qubit. Because a qubit has two states, and when it's completely mixed, it's equally likely to be in either state. So the density matrix would have equal probabilities on the diagonal.

Now the question is about its geometrical position in the qubits space. I'm a bit fuzzy on how density matrices correspond to points in space. Oh, I remember something about the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states. For a pure state |ψ⟩, it's a point on the unit sphere. But for mixed states, it's inside the sphere.

The Bloch vector representation comes into play here. For a general 2x2 density matrix, ρ can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector in 3D space. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So if I can express ρ in terms of these, the coefficients will give me the components of r.

Let's compute. The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Wait, |0⟩⟨0| is diag(1,0), and |1⟩⟨1| is diag(0,1). So adding them gives diag(1,1)/2. So ρ is diag(1/2, 1/2).

Now, the general form is (I + r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz)/2. Let me write that out. The identity matrix I is diag(1,1). So the expression is (I + ... )/2.

The σx matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], σy is [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz is diag(1,-1).

So let's compute each term. I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so (I)/2 is diag(1/2, 1/2).

Now, if r_x is the coefficient of σx, then (r_x σx)/2 is [[0, r_x/2], [r_x/2, 0 ]]. Similarly, r_y σy /2 is [[0, -i r_y/2], [i r_y/2, 0]], and r_z σz /2 is diag(r_z/2, -r_z/2).

Adding all together, the total matrix is:

(1/2)I + (r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz)/2.

So putting it all together, the diagonal entries are (1/2 + r_z/2) and (1/2 - r_z/2). The off-diagonal terms are (r_x/2) in the top right and (r_x/2) in the bottom left. The top left off-diagonal is r_x/2, but wait, no: the σx term has 1/2 (r_x) times [[0,1],[1,0]], so when divided by 2, it's [[0, r_x/2], [r_x/2, 0]]. Similarly for σy.

So the total matrix should be:

[ [ (1/2 + r_z/2 ), ( r_x/2 - i r_y/2 ) ],
  [ ( r_x/2 + i r_y/2 ), (1/2 - r_z/2 ) ] ]

Now, our given ρ is diagonal and has [1/2, 1/2] on the diagonal. So the off-diagonal elements must be zero. So setting the off-diagonal elements to zero:

r_x/2 - i r_y/2 =0. Which implies that r_x =0 and r_y=0, because the only way a complex number is zero is if both real and imaginary parts are zero.

So r_x = 0, r_y=0.

Looking at the diagonal elements, (1/2 + r_z/2 ) = 1/2, so 1/2 + (r_z)/2 = 1/2 → r_z =0.

So r = (0, 0, 0). 

Wait, but that's the origin. So the density matrix ρ is at the center of the Bloch sphere. Because it's a completely mixed state. Oh right, because for a completely mixed state, all information is lost, so it's the furthest point from the surface, at the center.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer must be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This matrix is diagonal with entries \(\frac{1}{2}\) on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere. It represents a maximally mixed state for a qubit, meaning the qubit is equally likely to be in either the \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\) state.

To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a general \(2 \times 2\) density matrix, it can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is a vector in 3D space. Expanding this, the diagonal elements of \(\rho\) are:

\[
\rho_{00} = \frac{1}{2} \left( 1 + r_z \right), \quad \rho_{11} = \frac{1}{2} \left( 1 - r_z \right),
\]

and the off-diagonal elements are:

\[
\rho_{01} = \frac{1}{2} \left( r_x - i r_y \right), \quad \rho_{10} = \frac{1}{2} \left( r_x + i r_y \right).
\]

For the given \(\rho\), the off-diagonal elements are zero, which implies \(r_x = 0\) and \(r_y = 0\). The diagonal elements are both \(\frac{1}{2}\), which implies \(r_z = 0\). Thus, the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to the origin in the Bloch sphere.

This result is consistent with the fact that the maximally mixed state is located at the center of the Bloch sphere, as it represents complete loss of quantum information.
