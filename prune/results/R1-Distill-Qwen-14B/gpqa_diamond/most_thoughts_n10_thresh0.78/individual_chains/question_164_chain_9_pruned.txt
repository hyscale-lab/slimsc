Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, binary stars, right? They orbit around a common center of mass. The question is about figuring out the mass ratio between two systems, system_1 and system_2. 

Let me read the details again. Both systems exhibit eclipses, and their periods are given. System_1 has a period of 2 years, and system_2 has a period of 1 year. Wait, but the period is the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. So that's the orbital period of the binary system. Both are binary because they have two stars each, right?

Now, the spectroscopic observations show radial velocity (RV) variations. For system_1, the amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, it's 15 km/s and 10 km/s. RV amplitudes—those are the maximum velocities each star has towards or away from us, I think. So each star's velocity amplitude is given.

I remember that in a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. The more massive star moves more slowly, and the less massive one moves faster. So the velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. Oh, right, because of the center of mass: m1 * v1 = m2 * v2. So the mass ratio is (v2/v1), perhaps. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the formula is m1/m2 = v2/v1. Yeah, because m1 * a1 = m2 * a2, but acceleration a is v squared over radius, but perhaps more directly, since their velocities are in the same proportion as their masses... Wait, no, I think the velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. Because if one is more massive, it doesn't have to move as much. So, for example, if m1 is twice m2, then v1 is half of v2.

So given that, the mass ratio m1/m2 equals v2/v1. Because m1 * v1 = m2 * v2, so m1/m2 = v2/v1.

In system_1, the two RV amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. Let's call them v1 and v2. So for system_1, v1 is 10, v2 is 5. Then m1/m2 for system_1 is (v2)/(v1) = 5/10 = 0.5. So the mass ratio is 0.5 for system_1.

Similarly, for system_2, the RVs are 15 and 10. So v1 = 15, v2=10. The mass ratio m1/m2 is 10/15 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667.

Wait, but the question is asking by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. Wait, system_1's total mass is m1a + m2a, and system_2's is m1b + m2b. So we need the ratio (m1a + m2a) / (m1b + m2b).

But wait, how does the period come into play here? Because the masses of the stars also affect the orbital period. Kepler's third law comes into mind here. The period depends on the total mass of the system and the size of the orbit.

Wait, the orbital period is given by Kepler's law for binary systems. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M1 + M2)) ) * a³, where a is the separation between the two stars. Alternatively, another version is (P/(2π))² = (a³)/(G(M1 + M2)).

But perhaps I can find the ratio of the masses using just the RV amplitudes, but I think I also need the period to find the total mass, because the velocity amplitudes relate to the mass ratio, but the period relates to the total mass.

Wait, let
