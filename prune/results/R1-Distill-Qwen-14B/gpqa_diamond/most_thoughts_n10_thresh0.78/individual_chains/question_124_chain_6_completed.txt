Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor around 20 on average. So, the initial condition is a Lorentz gamma of ~20. 

Now, one third of these fast-decaying particles reach the detector's inner walls. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the detector's inner walls instead.

Hmm. I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma relates to time dilation and length contraction in special relativity. Since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their lifetime from our (lab) frame's perspective is longer due to time dilation. So, the particles can travel a longer distance before decaying.

Wait, the particles are produced at the center of the detector. So the maximum distance they can travel is the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. If a particle doesn't decay before traveling 30 meters, it would reach the wall. But if it decays before that, it won't.

So the key here is the proper lifetime of the particles. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame, tau (τ). The lab frame measures a longer lifetime because of time dilation. The relation is gamma * tau.

The particles' decay follows an exponential probability distribution. The probability that a particle hasn't decayed after time t is given by P(t) = exp(-t/(gamma tau)). But since we're dealing with distance, not time, we need to relate the time and distance. Distance is velocity multiplied by time. So, if the particle's speed is v, then t = distance / v. 

But since they are ultra-relativistic, v is approximately the speed of light, c. So, t ≈ distance / c.

So, substituting, the probability P that a particle hasn't decayed by the time it would take to reach the wall (distance L) is P = exp(-L/(gamma c tau)).

Wait, let me think again. Or maybe it's better to express it as the decay length. The decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. It's given by c * gamma tau. So, the probability that a particle hasn't decayed after traveling a distance L is exp(-L/(gamma c tau)).

But wait, another approach: the particles have a certain lifetime, so the average distance they travel is gamma c tau. So, if the detector's radius is 30 meters, the fraction that reach the wall depends on how the decay length compares to 30 meters.

In the initial case, when gamma is 20, one third of the particles reach the walls. So, for gamma=20, the fraction f is 1/3. For the new gamma, which we'll call gamma', the fraction f' is 2/3. We need to find gamma' such that f' = 2/3.

So, the fraction f is the probability that the decay length is longer than L (30 meters). Since the decay follows an exponential distribution, the survival probability is exp(-L/(gamma c tau)). So, f = exp(-L/(gamma c tau)).

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The survival probability P is the probability that the particle hasn't decayed when it would have traveled distance L. So, for a particle to reach the detector wall, it must not have decayed during the time it takes to travel L. So, P = exp(-L/(gamma c tau)).

So, in the initial case, when gamma is 20, P_initial = 1/3. So,

1/3 = exp( -30 / (20 c tau) )

Taking the natural logarithm on both sides:

ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 c tau )

Multiply both sides by -1:

ln(3) = 30 / (20 c tau )

So,

30/(20 c tau) ) = ln(3)

Simplify 30/20 = 3/2. So,

(3)/(2 c tau) ) = ln(3)

So,

c tau = 3/(2 ln(3)) )

Hmm, but maybe I can relate the two probabilities. In the initial scenario, gamma is 20 and f_initial is 1/3. So,

1/3 = exp(-30/(20 c tau)).

In the new scenario, gamma' is what we're trying to find, and f' is 2/3. So,

2/3 = exp( -30/(gamma' c tau) )

Take ln of both sides:

ln(2/3) = -30/(gamma' c tau )

Multiply both sides by -1:

- ln(2/3) = 30/(gamma' c tau )

But from the initial calculation, I have:

30/(20 c tau) ) = ln(3)

So, let me express 30/(gamma' c tau) ) as (30/(20 c tau )) * (20 / gamma') )

Because 30/(gamma' c tau) ) = (30/(20 c tau )) * (20/gamma') )

From initial condition, 30/(20 c tau) = ln(3)

So,

30/(gamma' c tau ) ) = (ln 3) * (20/gamma' )

So, going back to the second equation:

- ln(2/3) = 30/(gamma' c tau )

Which is:

- ln(2/3) = (ln 3) * (20 / gamma' )

Wait, because 30/(gamma' c tau ) = (ln3) * (20/gamma' )

Wait, let me re-express:

We have,

30/(gamma' c tau) ) = [30/(20 c tau)] * (20 / gamma' )

Which equals ln(3) * (20 / gamma' )

So,

30/(gamma' c tau) = (20 ln 3 ) / gamma'

Multiply both sides by gamma' / 20 ln 3:

gamma' / (gamma') = [30/(gamma' c tau)] * (gamma' / (20 ln3)) )

Wait, maybe a better approach: from initial condition,

ln(1/3) = -30/(20 c tau )

Which is,

ln(3) = 30/(20 c tau )

So,

c tau = 30/(20 ln 3 ) ) = (3)/(2 ln3 )

So,

c tau = 3/(2 ln3 )

Now, in the new case,

ln(2/3) = -30/(gamma' c tau )

Which is,

ln(2/3) = -30/(gamma' c tau )

But c tau is 3/(2 ln3 ), so,

ln(2/3) = -30 / ( gamma' * (3/(2 ln3 )) )

Simplify denominator: gamma' * (3/(2 ln3 )) = (3 gamma')/(2 ln3 )

So, 

ln(2/3) = -30 * [2 ln3 / (3 gamma' ) ]

Multiply both sides by (3 gamma'):

3 gamma' * ln(2/3) = -30 * 2 ln3 /3 

Wait, maybe better to solve for gamma':

ln(2/3 ) = -30/(gamma' * (3/(2 ln3 )) )

Multiply both sides by gamma' * (3/(2 ln3)),

gamma' * (3/(2 ln3 )) * ln(2/3) = -30

So,

gamma' = [ (-30 ) * (2 ln3 ) ] / [3 * ln(2/3) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: -30 * 2 ln3 = -60 ln3 

Denominator: 3 * ln(2/3) 

So,

gamma' = (-60 ln3 ) / (3 ln(2/3) )

Simplify factors:

60/3 is 20, so,

gamma' = (-20 ln3 ) / ln(2/3 )

Now, note that ln(2/3 ) is negative because 2/3 <1. So,

ln(2/3 ) = ln(2) - ln(3) ≈ 0.6931 - 1.0986 ≈ -0.4055 

Therefore,

gamma' = (-20 ln3 ) / (-0.4055 )

The negatives cancel, so,

gamma' = (20 ln3 ) / (0.4055 )

Calculate ln3 ≈ 1.0986

So,

gamma' = 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055 

Calculate numerator: 20 * 1.0986 ≈ 21.972 

Divide by 0.4055: 21.972 / 0.4055 ≈ 

Let me compute this: 21.972 / 0.4055 

Well, 0.4055 is roughly 0.4055. Let's compute 21.972 / 0.4055.

Let me think:

0.4055 * 54 = approx. 0.4055 *50=20.275, 0.4055*4=1.622 → sum 21.897, close to 21.972. So 54 would give 21.897. The difference is about 21.972-21.897=0.075.

So, 0.4055 * 54 = ~21.897. To get 21.972, we need an additional 0.075. 0.075 / 0.4055 ≈ 0.185. So gamma' is approximately 54.185. So around 54.

But wait, the options are given, and option A is 54, option B is 68, C is 40, D is 28. So 54 is an option, but let's make sure.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the math because I might have made a mistake in signs or in the setup.

Wait, the initial condition is that when gamma is 20, the probability is 1/3. So:

f_initial = 1/3 = exp( - L/(gamma c tau) )

We need to find gamma' where f' = 2/3.

So,

2/3 = exp( - L/(gamma' c tau) )

Take natural logs of both sides:

ln(2/3) = - L/(gamma' c tau )

Multiply both sides by -1:

- ln(2/3) = L/(gamma' c tau )

We can write this as:

gamma' c tau = L/( - ln(2/3) )

Similarly, for the initial case:

gamma_initial c tau = L/( - ln(1/3) )

Because,

1/3 = exp( - L/(gamma_initial c tau) )

So,

gamma_initial c tau = L/( - ln(1/3) )

But gamma_initial is 20. So,

20 c tau = L/( - ln(1/3) )

We can express gamma' c tau in terms of the initial gamma c tau.

So,

gamma' c tau = [ L/( - ln(2/3) ) ]

gamma_initial c tau = [ L/( - ln(1/3) ) ]

Therefore,

gamma' / gamma_initial = [ L/( - ln(2/3) ) ] / [ L/( - ln(1/3) ) ]

The L cancels, so,

gamma' / 20 = ( - ln(2/3) ) / ( - ln(1/3) )

Simplify the negatives:

= ( ln(3/2) ) / ( ln(3) )

Wait, because ln(2/3) is negative, so negative of that is ln(3/2), and ln(1/3) is negative, so negative of that is ln(3).

So,

gamma' = 20 * [ ln(3/2) / ln(3) ]

Compute the numerical value:

ln(3) ≈ 1.0986

ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055

So,

gamma' ≈ 20 * (0.4055 / 1.0986 )

Calculate 0.4055 / 1.0986 ≈ 0.369.

Then,

gamma' ≈ 20 * 0.369 ≈ 7.38?

Wait, that can't be right. Because initially, gamma was 20, and the fraction was 1/3. Now, we're trying to get a larger fraction, 2/3, which would require gamma to be larger. Because a higher gamma means longer lifetime, so more particles would reach the wall.

Wait, so this suggests I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, let's re-express. The initial condition:

gamma_initial c tau = L/( - ln(1/3) )

Which is,

20 c tau = 30 m / (ln 3 )

Because,

- ln(1/3) = ln 3.

So,

c tau = 30/(20 ln 3) ) = 3/(2 ln3 )

In the new case,

gamma' c tau = 30 m / ( - ln(2/3) )

But,

- ln(2/3) = ln(3/2 )

So,

gamma' c tau = 30 / ( ln(3/2) )

Substituting c tau from initial condition,

gamma' * (3/(2 ln3 )) ) = 30 / ln(3/2 )

So,

gamma' = [30 / ln(3/2) ] * [ 2 ln3 /3 ]

Simplify:

30 * 2 ln3 / (3 * ln(3/2) )

Which is,

(60 ln3 ) / (3 ln(3/2) )

= 20 ln3 / ln(3/2 )

Now, compute this:

ln3 ≈ 1.0986

ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055

So,

gamma' ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 20 * 2.708 ≈ 54.16

Ah, that makes more sense. So about 54.

Looking back at the options, option A is 54. So, the answer would be A) 54.

Wait, but let me think again: initially, at gamma=20, 1/3 reach the wall; so, we need to increase gamma to get a higher probability. So, higher gamma, higher chance, so answer should be higher than 20, which option A is. So it makes sense.

I think my initial mistake was in the ratio setup, but after redoing it, it comes to around 54.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relationship between the Lorentz factor ($\gamma$), the decay length of the particles, and the probability of reaching the detector's inner walls. The key equations and reasoning are as follows:

1. **Decay Length and Survival Probability**:  
   The decay length of a particle is proportional to $\gamma \tau c$, where $\tau$ is the proper lifetime of the particle, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor. The probability that a particle survives (does not decay) over a distance $L$ is given by:  
   \[
   P = \exp\left(-\frac{L}{\gamma \tau c}\right)
   \]  
   For the detector's inner walls at a radius of $L = 30$ meters, the survival probability determines the fraction of particles that reach the walls.

2. **Initial Condition**:  
   At $\gamma = 20$, one-third of the particles ($f_{\text{initial}} = \frac{1}{3}$) reach the walls. Substituting into the survival probability formula:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{30}{20 \tau c}\right)
   \]  
   Taking the natural logarithm:  
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{20 \tau c}
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   \frac{30}{20 \tau c} = \ln(3) \quad \Rightarrow \quad \tau c = \frac{30}{20 \ln(3)} = \frac{3}{2 \ln(3)}
   \]

3. **New Condition**:  
   For the desired scenario, two-thirds of the particles ($f' = \frac{2}{3}$) reach the walls. Substituting into the survival probability formula:  
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{30}{\gamma' \tau c}\right)
   \]  
   Taking the natural logarithm:  
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{\gamma' \tau c}
   \]  
   Rearranging:  
   \[
   \gamma' \tau c = \frac{30}{-\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)}
   \]  
   Using $\tau c = \frac{3}{2 \ln(3)}$ from the initial condition:  
   \[
   \gamma' \cdot \frac{3}{2 \ln(3)} = \frac{30}{-\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)}
   \]  
   Simplify $\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \ln(2) - \ln(3)$ and substitute numerical values ($\ln(3) \approx 1.0986$, $\ln(2) \approx 0.6931$):  
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \approx -0.4055
   \]  
   Substituting:  
   \[
   \gamma' \cdot \frac{3}{2 \cdot 1.0986} = \frac{30}{0.4055}
   \]  
   Simplify:  
   \[
   \gamma' = \frac{30}{0.4055} \cdot \frac{2 \cdot 1.0986}{3} \approx 54
   \]

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The Lorentz factor required for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls is approximately $\gamma' = 54$.
