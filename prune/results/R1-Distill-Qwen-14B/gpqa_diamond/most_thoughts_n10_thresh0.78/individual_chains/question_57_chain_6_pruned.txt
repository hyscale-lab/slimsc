Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I remember that in scattering experiments, especially in quantum mechanics, the scattering amplitude plays a big role. The question gives me phase shifts at different angular momenta and asks me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, the phase shifts are given as δ0=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, and δ4=13°. Oh, right, phase shifts are associated with each angular momentum l. So for each l, there's a phase shift δ_l. But in this case, the question says to ignore the rest, so I guess we're considering l=0 to l=4 and ignore higher l's.

The problem is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam. I think the scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) has both real and imaginary parts, and in some cases, like for elastic scattering, certain terms might contribute more.

Wait, along the incident beam direction, I think that's the direction of the initial motion. So when θ=0°, the scattering is forward. What about φ? Oh, I think in this case, φ is the azimuthal angle, but along the beam, maybe φ=0°, which I can set to align with the beam direction. Or perhaps the problem is considering the dependence on φ for each term.

But wait, in the case of spin-0 particles, the scattering amplitude might depend on both angles θ and φ, but for electrons, which have spin-1/2, the situation is a bit more complicated. But maybe the problem is treating it as spin-independent for simplicity.

I remember that the general form of the scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) is a sum over l and m of [ (e^{iδ_l} - 1) * (some spherical harmonics terms) ]. Oh right, the formula is something like:

f(θ, φ) = (1/(2π)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ sum_{m=-l}^l [ (e^{iδ_l} - 1) * (2l + 1) * (Pl^m( cosθ )) * e^{i m φ} ) ]

Wait, but for the case when the target is spin-0, like a nucleus, the angular dependence would involve only terms with m=0 because the total angular momentum projection m must be zero. Because the target is spin-0, the initial state has m=0, so the final state should also have m=0. So the scattering amplitude would only have terms where m=0. So the sum over m would only include m=0, which means the exponential e^{i m φ} becomes 1. So the φ dependence would drop out for each term in the sum. So the scattering amplitude would only depend on θ.

Wait, but the question specifies along the incident beam direction. So θ would be 0 degrees, because along the beam is when the scattering angle is 0. So cosθ would be 1. And what about φ? Well, if the scattering is along the beam, the azimuthal angle φ is 0, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here because in the formula, for m=0, the e^{i m φ} factor is 1.

So, putting it all together, the scattering amplitude f(0,0) would be given by (1/(2π)) multiplied by the sum over l of (e^{i δ_l} -1) multiplied by (2l+1) multiplied by Pl^m( cosθ ). But since θ is 0, and for m=0, Pl^0(1) is 1, because the Legendre polynomial Pl^0(1) is 1 for all l.

So f(0,0) becomes (1/(2π)) * sum_{l=0}^4 (e^{i δ_l} -1) * (2l + 1) * 1.

Wait, but wait, the problem says to ignore the rest beyond l=4. So we'll consider l=0 to l=4.

But the question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So Im(f(0,0)) is what we need.

Let me compute each term for l=0 to l=4, calculate (e^{i δ_l} -1), multiply by (2l+1), sum them up, and then multiply by 1/(2π), then take the imaginary part.

But wait, each (e^{i δ_l} -1) can be written in terms of sine and cosine. Let's see. e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ. So e^{iθ} - 1 = (cosθ -1) + i sinθ.

So the imaginary part of (e^{iθ} -1) is sinθ.

So, for each term, the imaginary part is sin(δ_l) multiplied by (2l + 1). Then, when we take the imaginary part of the sum, it would be the sum of each term's imaginary part multiplied by (2l + 1), and then multiplied by 1/(2π).

Wait, but wait, hold on. The sum is over (e^{i δ_l} -1) times (2l +1), and then the imaginary part of the entire sum is the sum of the imaginary parts of each term.

So for each l, the imaginary part is (2l +1) * sin(δ_l). Then, the total imaginary part is (1/(2π)) multiplied by the sum over l of (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, that makes sense. Because each term's contribution to the imaginary part is (2l+1)*sin(δ_l), and then all of these are added and scaled by 1/(2π).

So the formula for Im(f(0,0)) becomes:

Im(f) = (1/(2π)) * sum_{l=0}^{4} (2l + 1) * sin( δ_l )

Now, let's compute each term. The given δ_l are:

l=0: δ0=90° → sin(90°) = 1
l=1: δ1=67° → sin(67°)
l=2: δ2=55° → sin(55°)
l=3: δ3=30° → sin(30°) = 0.5
l=4: δ4=13° → sin(13°)

So let's compute each (2l+1)*sin(δ_l):

For l=0: (0*2 +1)=1 → 1 * sin(90°) = 1 * 1 =1
l=1: 3 → 3 * sin(67°)
l=2: 5 →5 * sin(55°)
l=3:7 →7 * 0.5 =3.5
l=4:9 →9 * sin(13°)

Now, calculating each sin value:

sin(67°) ≈ 0.9205
sin(55°) ≈ 0.8192
sin(13°) ≈ 0.22495

So compute each product:

l=0: 1 *1 =1

l=1:3 *0.9205 ≈2.7615

l=2:5 *0.8192≈4.096

l=3:7 *0.5=3.5

l=4:9 *0.22495≈2.02455

Now, sum all these:

1 +2.7615 =3.7615

3.7615 +4.096=7.8575

7.8575 +3.5=11.3575

11.3575 +2.02455≈13.38205

So the sum is approximately 13.38205.

Multiply by 1/(2π): 13.38205 / (2 * 3.1415926535) ≈13.38205 / 6.283185307 ≈2.130.

Wait, wait, wait. Because 6.283 is approximately 2π.

Wait, 13.38205 /6.283185307 ≈ let's compute.

13.38205 /6.283185307 → let's compute 6.283185307 * 2 =12.56637. 12.56637 is 6.283185 * 2.

13.38205 - 12.56637 =0.81568.

So 2 + (0.81568 /6.283185) → 0.81568 /6.283185 ≈ 0.13.

So total is approximately 2.13.

Wait, but wait, 6.283185307 * 2.13 → 6.283185 *2=12.56637; 6.283185 *0.13=0.816814 → sum 13.383184, which is about 13.383, which matches our sum of 13.38205.

So Im(f) ≈ 2.13.

Wait, but the options are in the order of hundreds or tens of thousands of fm. Hmm, wait, how does that make sense? Because 2.13 is much smaller than the options given.

Wait, did I miss a factor somewhere? Because the options are like 177.675 fm, which is about 1.777e2, which is about 100 times the number I got.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation because of the units. Wait, what's the formula again?

Wait, I think the formula for the scattering amplitude f is given in terms of the differential cross-section, but perhaps I forgot a factor that comes from the relation between the scattering amplitude and the cross-section.

Wait, the scattering amplitude f has units of length (in natural units where ħ=1, c=1, etc.), measured in femtometers (fm). So in this problem, the final answer is in fm.

Wait, but in the calculation, each term is (2l+1)*sinδ_l, summed, then multiplied by 1/(2π). Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor from the Legendre polynomial or something else. Let me think again.

Wait, the general expression for f(θ, φ) is (1/(2π)) * sum_{l,m} (e^{i δ_l} -1) (2l +1) Pl^m (cosθ) e^{i m φ}.

But in our case, the target is spin-
