Okay, so I have this NMR problem in front of me, and I need to figure out which compound it is among the four options. Let me think through this step by step.

The question gives me the 1H NMR data. Let me look at each of the signals provided:

1. 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)
2. 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
3. 2.1 ppm (3H, s)
4. 1.6 ppm (3H, d)

Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the integration tells me the number of protons, the splitting tells about neighboring protons, and the chemical shift gives an idea about the environment of the protons.

Starting with the singlet at 2.1 ppm. A singlet with 3H probably indicates a methyl group attached to something that doesn't split its signal. Since acetate esters have a methyl group (like OAc), that's probably the acetate part. So that's the OCH3 group in the acetate ester, right? So the structure is an acetate ester, which makes sense because all the options are acetates.

Next, looking at the other signals. The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with a coupling constant J of 16 Hz. That's a large coupling, which suggests it's a trans coupling, perhaps between two protons that are across each other, like in a double bond. Wait, wait, double bonds can cause coupling between protons on adjacent carbons. So maybe this is a vinyl proton?

Then there's the 5.5 ppm peak, a doublet of quadruplets? Or maybe it's a doublet of something else. Wait, the description says "dq" which I think stands for doublet of quadruplets? Or maybe I'm misreading. Oh wait, perhaps it's a doublet with some splitting, maybe from two neighboring protons. Or maybe it's a doublet with more complex splitting.

Wait, let me think about the structure. The possible compounds are propenyl or butenyl acetates, either cis or trans. The propenyl group would be CH2CH2CH3, but wait, propenyl would be CH2CHCH2? No, wait. Propenyl has a double bond. So propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2-. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's see: propenyl is CH2CH2CH3 with a double bond somewhere. Wait, actually, propenyl groups are typically CH2=CH-CH2- or CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- but in reality, propenyl is CH2=CH-CH2-O- or something like that? Wait, perhaps I should draw it out.

Wait, the four options are propenyl or butenyl acetates, either cis or trans. So propenyl is CH2CH2CH3 with a double bond between carbons 1 and 2. So structure for propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Wait, no, acetate is OAc-O- attached to the propenyl group. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc? Or maybe CH2CH2CH3 with the double bond elsewhere.
