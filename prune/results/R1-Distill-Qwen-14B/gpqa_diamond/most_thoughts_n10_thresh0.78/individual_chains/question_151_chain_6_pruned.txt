Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, so I'll have to think carefully.

Alright, the question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, to be zero given the state of the system. The state is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). And the operator P is a 3x3 matrix with specific elements. 

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators. The eigenvalues of these operators are the possible outcomes of measurements. So, to find the probability of getting a certain result, like 0, I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to that eigenvalue and then compute the overlap with the given state.

But wait, the state given here is a column vector. I should check if it's a normalized state. Let me calculate the norm of the state vector. The vector is (-1, 2, 1). So the norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). That means the state isn't normalized. Hmm, but in quantum mechanics, states are supposed to be normalized. I wonder if I need to normalize it first. Or maybe the problem is set up such that it's already normalized? Let me think again. Oh no, 1^2 + 2^2 +1^2 is 1+4+1=6, so the vector's length is sqrt(6). So if I have to use this as a quantum state, I should probably normalize it. Because otherwise, the probabilities might not add up to 1.

Wait, but the question is about calculating the probability of measuring 0. So perhaps the state doesn't need to be normalized before applying the operator. Or maybe the operator's action takes care of that. Hmm, I'm a little confused here.

Let me write down the given state. It's a column vector with components [-1, 2, 1]^T. Let me call this vector |ψ>. The observable P is given as a 3x3 matrix. The first row is [0, 1/√2, 0], second row [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], third row [0, 1/√2, 0]. So the matrix P looks like this:

Row 1: 0   1/√2   0
Row 2: 1/√2 0   1/√2
Row 3: 0   1/√2   0

I need to find the probability that measuring P gives 0. So I have to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, and then find the square of the inner product between |ψ> and each of these eigenvectors. The sum of the squares will be the probability.

But wait, maybe it's easier to find the eigenstates of P and see which ones correspond to eigenvalue 0. Let's try to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.

The matrix P is a symmetric matrix, so it's Hermitian, which makes sense for an observable. The eigenvalues will be real.

To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) = 0.

Let me write P - λ I:

Row 1: -λ   1/√2    0
Row 2: 1/√2  -λ    1/√2
Row 3: 0    1/√2   -λ

The determinant of this matrix will be the characteristic equation. Let's calculate it.

The determinant for a 3x3 matrix can be calculated by expanding along the first row.

So:

-λ * det [ [-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ] ] - (1/√2) * det [ [1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ] ] + 0 * something.

Wait, so first term: (-λ) multiplied by the minor for element (1,1), which is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix:

[-λ, 1/√2]
[1/√2, -λ]

The determinant of this is (-λ)^2 - (1/√2)^2 = λ² - 1/2.

Second term: the element is (1/√2) at (1,2), with a negative sign because of the cofactor. So the cofactor is (-1)^(1+2) = -1. So the term is (-1/√2) multiplied by the determinant of the minor matrix for (1,2). The minor is:

[1/√2, 1/√2]
[0, -λ]

The determinant of this is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) = -λ / √2.

So the second term is (-1/√2) * (-λ / √2) = (λ)/(2).

And the third term is 0, so it doesn't contribute.

Putting it all together:

det(P - λ I) = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2) = 0.

Wait, let me write that as:

-λ (λ² - 1/2) + (λ)/2 = 0.

Let's expand the first term:

-λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = 0.

Wait, because (-λ)(λ²) is -λ^3, and (-λ)(-1/2)
