Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to reach a certain speed. Hmm, I need to find the energy when the speed is 0.96c. Let me think through this.

First, the nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Li is lithium, right? So the regular lithium nucleus has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, making it Li-6. Wait, but wait. The problem says "Li with 3 neutrons," which would be Li-6 because it has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass number A is 6.

So, the nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. Relativistic speeds, so I'll definitely need to use the relativistic energy equations. 

I remember that the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times mc squared, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma equals 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). 

So the formula for gamma would be 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Plugging in v as 0.96c, let's compute that. 

v is 0.96c, so v² is (0.96)^2 c². Let me calculate that: 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 minus 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... wait, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. Because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 divided by 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, wait, 0.28 is 7/25. So 1/(7/25) is 25/7, which is approximately 3.5714. So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy of the nucleus is needed. The nucleus is Li-6, so its mass is the mass of 6 nucleons. Each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c². Wait, but wait, the actual mass of Li-6 might be slightly less because the binding energy holds the nucleus together. Oh wait, but in particle physics, when calculating the rest energy, we usually take the sum of the individual protons and neutrons, or the atomic mass? Hmm. Wait, the problem says "the nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons," so perhaps we're to assume that it's Li-6 nucleus, which has a mass of approximately 6 times the mass of a proton (or neutron), but actually, the exact mass of Li-6 is known.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the mass of a lithium nucleus as approximately 6 * (mass of a proton). Wait, but the actual mass of a proton is about 938 MeV
