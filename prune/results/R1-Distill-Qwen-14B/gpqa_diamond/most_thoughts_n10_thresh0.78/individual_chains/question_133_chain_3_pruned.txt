Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem about orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see. The question says we have a solution with 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C, and we need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-.

Wait, orthophosphate is the PO4^3- ion. But I remember that in aqueous solutions, phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH. The H3PO4 has three dissociation steps. The given Ka values are Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 =6.2e-8, Ka3=1.8e-12.

So, the substances we're dealing with are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me write down their formulas. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K+ H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2Na+ and HPO4^2- plus the water. Wait, but the formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O, so when it dissolves, it gives 2Na+ and HPO4^2- plus the water molecules, but in solution, the water doesn't affect the ions.

So, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution. But wait, I think these can interconvert based on the pH. Because H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can lose another to become PO4^3-.

But wait, in this solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-; I think the solution is a buffer solution, but I'm not exactly sure. Wait, no, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the salts will influence the pH, and we can calculate the pH first, then determine the predominant form of phosphate.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the solubility or the concentration of PO4^3- directly. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the question is about orthophosphate ions, which are PO4^3-.

So, the first step is to find out the concentrations of each of these salts in the solution.

We have 1.00 grams of each salt. Let's compute their molarities.

The volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters.

For KH2PO4 (molecular weight 136.09 g/mol):

Moles = mass / molecular weight = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol.

Concentration (M) = moles / volume (L) = 0.007348 / 0.2 = 0.03674 M.

So [H
