Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons are used to accelerate charged particles, like protons, by using a magnetic field and an electric field that changes direction. But wait, a synchrocyclotron is a type of cyclotron, so it must have similar principles but maybe with some differences. Let me think about how they work.

The problem says that a proton is injected with negligible kinetic energy at t=0. So initially, its speed is almost zero. Then it undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy of T1 = 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0], where U0 is 190 kV and Φ0 is π/4.

Wait, but in a cyclotron, the particles move in a magnetic field and the electric field is applied across the gaps between the D-shaped boxes. The acceleration happens as the particle crosses the gap. Oh, right, the frequency of the electric field has to match the particle's orbital frequency for it to keep getting accelerated each time it crosses the gap.

But wait, this is a synchrocyclotron. I think synchrocyclotrons are used for particles where the cyclotron frequency changes with energy, unlike the regular cyclotron which works when the frequency is fixed. So maybe the frequency here is adjusted as the proton's speed increases.

But the problem gives U(t) as a function of time, which suggests that the frequency ν is fixed because the argument of the cosine is 2πν t plus a phase. So perhaps in this case, the frequency is adjusted to match the proton's changing orbital frequency as it gains energy.

Wait, but how do I find the number of revolutions the proton makes? The question is about how many times it goes around the synchrocyclotron before reaching 950 MeV.

The kinetic energy is given as 950 MeV. The initial kinetic energy is negligible, so almost all of that comes from the acceleration in the synchrocyclotron.

I remember that in cyclotrons, the kinetic energy gained is related to the voltage and the number of times the particle is accelerated. Each time the particle crosses the gap between the Ds, it gets a kick of energy equal to the voltage multiplied by the charge. Since the voltage is alternating,
