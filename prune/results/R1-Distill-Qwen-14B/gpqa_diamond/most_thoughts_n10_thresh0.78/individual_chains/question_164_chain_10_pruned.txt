Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about binary star systems. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. 

The question says that there are two binary systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. The period is the time between two primary eclipses. Then, from spectroscopic observations, they found that the radial velocity (RV) variations are sinusoidal, and the amplitudes are given. For system_1, the amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, they're 15 km/s and 10 km/s.

The question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. So, I need to find the mass of each system and then compare them.

Wait, I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocities of the stars are related to their masses. The more massive star would have a smaller velocity, right? Because the center of mass is closer to the more massive star. Oh right, the mass ratio is inverse to the velocity ratio.

So the formula I think is about Kepler's third law for binary systems. The law relates the orbital period to the masses. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M1 + M2)) * a³, where a is the separation between the two stars. But wait, maybe I should think in terms of radial velocities first.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for each star is given by K = (v) = (2π * G)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )^(1), where i is the inclination angle. But since the system is eclipsing, the inclination is close to 90 degrees, so sin i is approximately 1. So I can ignore that for now.

In a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. The more massive star moves slower. So if K1 is the velocity amplitude of star 1, and K2 for star 2, then K1/K2 = M2/M1. Because their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses.

Wait, that's right. Because M1 * K1 = M2 * K2. Because the center of mass requires M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, where a1 and a2 are the semi-major axes of their orbits. And since velocity is proportional to distance traveled over time, and the orbital period is the same for both, so V = 2πa/P. So K1 = (2π a1)/P, K2 = (2π a2)/P. So K1/K2 = a1/a2 = M2/M1. Because M1 a1 = M2 a2 → a1/a2 = M2/M1.

So, if K1 is the velocity of star 1, and K2 the velocity of star 2, then K1/K2 = M2/M1. So, M1/M2 = K2/K1.

So, for system_1, K1 is 10 km/s, K2 is 5 km/s. So M1/M2 = K2 / K1 = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1 = 0.5 * M2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the total mass is M1 + M2. Let me think. 

In system_1, the two RV amplitudes are 10 and 5. So, K1 = 10, K2=5. So, K1/K2 = 2. So M2/M1 = 2 → M1 = M2/2. So the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = (M2/2) + M2 = 3M2/2.

Wait, but alternatively, perhaps the ratio is M2 over M1. Let me get this right. So K1 = M2/(M1 + M2) * (some function of period and separation). Wait, perhaps I should think about the mass function.

Wait, the mass function is f(M) = (M2³ sin³i)/( (M1 + M2)² ), and from radial velocities, we can compute f(M). But, if I don't know the inclination, it's hard. But in this case, since both systems are eclipsing, i is 90 degrees, so sin i = 1. 

But wait, in the problem, we're given the RV amplitudes for both stars. So for each system, we can find the mass ratio from their velocity amplitudes.

In system_1, the two stars have velocities 10 and 5. So, star 1 has velocity 10, star 2 has 5. So, as per earlier, K
