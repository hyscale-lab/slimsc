Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because buffer solutions can be a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read the question again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that there's a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³ (which is 200 mL) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given, and at 25°C, we need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2- I think). Oh wait, no, wait. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in the solution, the phosphate species would depend on the pH. Hmmm. But in this case, the salts provided are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So those are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- respectively.

Wait, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it can dissociate into different forms. So I'm a little confused. Oh wait, maybe orthophosphate refers to the HPO4^2- ion? Or is it the H3PO4? I think I should double-check that. The problem says "orthophosphate ions," which I believe are the HPO4^2- ions. Because H3PO4
