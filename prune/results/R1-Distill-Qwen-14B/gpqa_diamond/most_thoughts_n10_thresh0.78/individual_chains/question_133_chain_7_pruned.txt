Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question carefully.

The problem states: We have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters). This solution contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25°C, and the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in this solution. The Ka1, Ka2, and Ka3 values for H3PO4 are provided as 7.5x10^-3, 6.2x10^-8, and 1.8x10^-12, respectively.

Hmm, okay. So, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. Phosphoric acid is a triprotic acid, meaning it can donate three protons. The reactions go like this:

H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

Since we're asked about the concentration of PO4^3- ions, which is the deprotonated form after all three dissociations, I think this is the third ionization step.

But wait, the solution contains two different salts: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So, let me figure out what each of these salts dissociate into.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So, the formula is K+ + H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When dissolved, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions, plus the water of crystallization which probably doesn't affect the solution's ionic content much. So, the important ions are Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So, the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Wait a second, that's interesting. Because in solution, the phosphate species can interconvert depending on the pH.

The presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- suggests that the solution is a buffer solution. But wait, are they in a ratio that makes it a buffer for a particular step? Let me think.

H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can donate a proton to become PO4^3-. So, the solution may involve some equilibrium between these species.

But
