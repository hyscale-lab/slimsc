Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon, right? All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light, which has a wavelength λ, is shining along the z-axis, and we're looking at the far field where intensity maxima and minima occur. The question is about the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Hmm, so as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes more like a circle. But wait, no, wait. Wait, if all apothems are the same, and N is going to infinity, maybe the shape becomes a circle with radius equal to the apothem? Or wait, the apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. As N increases, the apothem would approach the radius of the circumscribed circle. So maybe when N is infinite, the aperture is a circle of radius 'a'?

But wait, the problem says 'the angular distance between the first two minima'. For a circular aperture, the far-field diffraction pattern (Fraunhofer diffraction) has a central bright spot (the Airy disk) and the first minima occur at certain angles. So if this polygon becomes a circle as N approaches infinity, the problem reduces to finding the angular distance for the first minima in a circular aperture.

Wait, but the options include 1.220 λ/a, and I remember that the first minimum for a circular aperture occurs at
