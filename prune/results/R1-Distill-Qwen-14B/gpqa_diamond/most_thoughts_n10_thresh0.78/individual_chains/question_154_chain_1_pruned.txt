Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the unknown compound is based on the spectral data provided. Let's see, the options are A, B, C, D. Each is a different organic compound, so I need to match the spectral data to one of them.

First, let me recap the given data. The mass spec shows a molecular ion peak at m/z 156 with 100% intensity, and another peak at 158 with 32%. Hmm, molecular ion is usually the molecular weight. So 156 is the molecular weight. The other peak at 158 could be a fragment or maybe an isotope. Wait, but 158 is two units higher. Chlorine has an atomic weight around 35, so maybe the molecule has a chlorine atom. Let me think: 156 plus 2 would be 158, but wait, that's if there's a Cl. Chlorine has two main isotopes, about 75% 35Cl (mass 35) and 25% 37Cl (mass 37). So the molecular ion at 156 would have a possible peak at 158 as well if the molecule has a Cl. So that's an indication that there's a Cl somewhere in the structure.

Next, the IR data. A broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is likely a carbonyl group. So maybe a ketone, aldehyde, carboxylic acid, or ester? Wait, but the broad peak suggests maybe a carboxylic acid, because their O-H is broad. Alternatively, an alcohol's O-H would be broad but maybe less intense. Also, aldehydes have a strong absorption around that region too, but the 1720 is more like a carbonyl, which could also be from an acid or ester.

Then the 1H NMR data. The peaks are at 11.0 ppm as a singlet (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm as a doublet (d, 2H), and 7.72 ppm as another doublet (d, 2H). 

Let me think about what these NMR signals could mean. A singlet at 11 ppm is likely an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid -OH. Wait, but carboxylic acid protons are usually broad, not a sharp singlet. Wait, but in the IR we saw a strong sharp peak at 1720, which might be an ester carbonyl or a ketone. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a aldehyde. But aldehydes typically have a peak around 9-10 ppm, but sometimes higher. But wait, 11 ppm is a bit high for an aldehyde. Alternatively, could it be an acidic proton, like a phenolic O-H. But phenolic O-H protons are around 5-7 ppm, so not matching. Unless it's something else.

Wait, another thought. If the 11 ppm is a carbonyl oxygen adjacent proton, but that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps it's a formate ester or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents.

Looking at the NMR peaks: two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, the two protons on each adjacent carbon are equivalent and give a doublet each. So for example, in a para-substituted benzene, like p-xylene, the two sets of doublets would each integrate to 2H. But in this case, the substituents would have to be in the para positions.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see the structures.

Option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure: benzene ring with Cl at position 4 and a COOH group at position 1. The benzoic acid would have a COOH group, which would have a broad peak in the IR around 2500-3300 (O-H stretch) and a strong carbonyl at ~1700. Also, the NMR would show a COOH proton, which is usually a broad peak. But in the given NMR, the 11 ppm is a singlet, which might not fit.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again about the NMR. 11 ppm as a singlet for 1H. If it's a COOH, that proton is usually around 10-12 ppm, but a broad peak. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde. Let's think about the options.

Option C is Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is OCl-CO-O-Ph. Wait, no. Wait, chloroformate would be Cl-CO- something. Oh wait, phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the structure would have a COCl group attached to a benzene ring. So in that case, the COCl group would have a carbonyl at around 1720, which matches the IR. The NMR would have the aromatic protons. Let me think: the aromatic protons in para substitution would show as two doublets, which matches the 8.02 and 7.72 ppm peaks. But what about the 11 ppm peak? In chloroformate, there's a Cl attached to the carbonyl, but the other oxygen is an ester. The H on the carbonyl would be adjacent to Cl, but wait, in OPh-CO-O-Cl? No, that's not right. Wait, no. Phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. No, wait, chloroformate is (Cl)CO-O-R. So in this case, the phenyl group is attached to the oxygen. So the structure is O=C(O-Ph)Cl. So the carbonyl is at 1720. Now, the NMR would have aromatic protons. If the substituent is in the para position, the two aromatic doublets would be as observed. But what about the 11 ppm peak? Chloroformate might have an -OCl group, but the protons... Hmm, maybe the 11 ppm is not from the chloroformate. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking at the options again, let's check each.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure is benzaldehyde with Cl at position 3 and OH at position 2. The aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm. But in this case, the NMR has a 11 ppm, which is a singlet. Also, the IR would show a strong carbonyl (aldehyde) around 1720. The broad peak from 3500-2700 might be the phenolic OH. But if it's a benzaldehyde, the aldehyde would have a peak around 9.5-10, but maybe 11 is possible. Also, the 2-hydroxy would be acidic, so the OH might be a broad peak. But in the NMR, that peak is a singlet at 11. So if that's an aldehyde proton, then the aldehyde would appear as a singlet. Alternatively, maybe the OH is at 11, but that depends on its environment.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl at position 2, COOH at position 1. So the benzoic acid would have a COOH group. The NMR would show a broad peak for the COOH proton, around 10-12 ppm, but in the data, it's a singlet at 11. So that could fit. The aromatic protons would be two doublets in para positions. Wait, but in 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are at 1 and 2 positions. So the ring would have two substituents adjacent to each other. So the aromatic protons would not be in a para arrangement. Let me draw that. Benzoic acid is a ring with COOH at position 1. If Cl is at position 2, then the ring has substituents at 1 and 2. So the aromatic protons would be meta to each other. So in that case, the NMR would show more complex splitting, perhaps a triplet or something else. So the NMR given has two doublets, which suggests a para substitution, which would be the case if substituents are at positions 1 and 4, for example.

So let's think about the options again.

Option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. So, COOH at position 1, Cl at position 4. The benzoic acid would have a COOH group, so in the IR, a broad O-H stretch and a strong carbonyl. The NMR would have the COOH proton at around 11 ppm as a singlet? Or as a broad peak. Wait, but in the data, the 11 ppm is a singlet. Benzoic acid's COOH proton is usually around 10-12 ppm and is a broad peak. But in the data, it's a singlet, which is sharp, so maybe not.
