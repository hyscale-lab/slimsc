Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a Ca-EDTA complex. The given concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the stability constant, K for Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about that complicating things. Temperature is 25°C, but I think that's standard, so maybe no effect here.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, and the concentration is given as 0.02 M. So the complex is [CaEDTA]^2- or something like that. The stability constant K tells me how stable the complex is. A high K means the complex is very stable, so it doesn't dissociate much.

The problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. So I think I can model this using the stability constant expression. The Ca-EDTA complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- (or some form). Wait, EDTA has different forms based on pH, but the question says the pH is ideal. I think the problem assumes that EDTA is in its Y^4- form, which is the fully deprotonated form. So the reaction would be:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-

The stability constant K is given by [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = K.

Wait, but I'm given the concentration of the complex as 0.02 M. So initially, [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. Since K is very large (5e10), the complex doesn't dissociate much. So the concentrations of free Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would be very small.

So let me set up the variables. Let’s say the concentration of free Ca²+ is x, and the concentration of free EDTA^4- is y. But wait, the initial complex is 0.02 M, and if it dissociates a little, then the concentrations would be:

[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - (x + y?) Wait, no. Wait, each dissociation releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-. So if the complex dissociates by s, then:

[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - s
[Ca²+] = s
[EDTA^4-] = s

Because each mole of complex gives one mole of each. So in this case, s is the amount dissociated.

But wait, because K is so large, s should be very small compared to
