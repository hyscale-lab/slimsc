Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about the hydrogen atom. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions. Hmm, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels through photon emissions or absorptions, right?

So the setup is that the state |3,0,0> decays to |1,0,0> through two dipole transitions. Each transition would involve a change in the quantum numbers, I think. Dipole transitions have selection rules, so that's probably key here.

Let me recall the selection rules for dipole transitions. For hydrogen-like atoms, the selection rules are: Δl = ±1, and Δm = 0, ±1. Also, Δn can be any integer except zero, but in this case, it's going from n=3 to n=1, so that's a Δn of -2.

Wait, but since it's a two-step process, each transition must follow the selection rules. So the first transition is from n=3 to some intermediate state, then from there to n=1.

Let's think about the possible intermediate states. The initial state is |3,0,0>, so l=0, m=0. The first transition must follow Δl = ±1. So l can go to 1 or -1, but since l is non-negative, it's l=1. So the first state after transition would have l=1, and m can change by 0 or ±1. So m could be -1, 0, or +1.

So the possible intermediate states after the first transition would be |2,1, m>, but wait, no, wait. The first transition is from n=3 to n=2, or maybe n=3 to n=1? No, wait, because from n=3 to n=1 is a Δn of -2, which is a bigger change. But dipole transitions only allow Δn = ±1, right? Because higher changes would require higher multipole moments. Wait, but no, wait. No, wait, dipole transitions are electric dipole, which have Δl=±1, but Δn can be any integer, as long as it's allowed by the l change. Hmm, perhaps that's incorrect. Wait, no, the selection rules for electric dipole (l=1) transitions are Δl = ±1, and Δn can be any non-zero integer, but in practice, for each transition, the change in n must be such that the energy allows it, but I think actually, the standard selection rules are that for each transition, Δn can be ±1, but wait, no, no, that's incorrect. I think the selection rules for electric dipole transitions are Δl = ±1, and Δm = 0, ±1, but Δn can be any integer except zero, but for the transition to be allowed, the change in n must be such that the transition is possible via a photon emission or absorption. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, in the case of hydrogen
