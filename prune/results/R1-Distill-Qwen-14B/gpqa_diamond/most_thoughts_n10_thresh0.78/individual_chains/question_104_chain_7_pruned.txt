Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth as the planet orbits it, and this causes a shift in the spectral lines.

The question says that two stars have the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The key difference is the shift in the spectral lines: planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift.

Wait, so what determines the size of the Doppler shift? I think it depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Oh wait, no, more precisely, the semi-amplitude of the RV signal (K) is given by some formula. I remember that K depends on (M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) * (something with the orbital period), but I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, maybe I should recall the formula for the RV semi-amplitude. Let me think. The formula is K = (v) where v is the star's velocity. The exact formula might be K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / (M_star^(1/3)) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / ( (P) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ) * something. Oh wait, I think the formula is K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) or something like that. Alternatively, since M_p is much smaller than M_star (because Neptune's mass is much less than the Sun's), we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

Wait, maybe I can simplify this. Since both stars have the same mass (same as Sun) and the planets have similar masses (both Neptune-like), the main difference is the RV shifts. The RV shift (K) is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3)) ). But assuming the inclination i is the same (since the shifts are observed), and M_p and M_star are the same for both planets, then K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3).

Wait, wait, wait. Let me get the formula right. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K =
