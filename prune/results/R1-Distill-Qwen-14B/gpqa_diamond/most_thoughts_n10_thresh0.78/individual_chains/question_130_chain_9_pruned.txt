Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy and redshift. Hmm, let me think about what I remember. The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. They want the lower limit on the redshift for these objects to be detectable with optical ground-based telescopes.

Wait, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission is in the ultraviolet range. But wait, Lyman alpha is actually the series limit for hydrogen, right? So when it's absorbed, it's called the Lyman alpha forest in quasar spectra. But the thing is, when the hydrogen is at a high redshift, the absorption moves into the visible spectrum, which ground-based telescopes can detect.

So, the Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is 0.1216 micrometers, or 121.6 nm. This is in the far ultraviolet. But if the hydrogen cloud is at a redshift z, then the observed wavelength would be lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + z). So, to be in the optical range, which is roughly 400-700 nm, we need 1216 * (1+z) to be within that range.

Wait, but wait. If the quasar's light is being absorbed by the hydrogen, and we detect that absorption line in the quasar's spectrum, then for the absorption to be in the optical (so that ground-based telescopes can see it), the Lyman alpha wavelength must have been redshifted into the optical.

So, the Lyman alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms (0.1216 microns) in the rest frame. To get it into the optical, which is about 0.4 to 0.7 microns, let's calculate the minimum redshift.

We need 0.1216 * (1+z) >= 0.4 microns (since 0.4 microns is the lower end of optical). So 1+z = 0.4 / 0.1216 ≈ 3.287. So z ≈ 2.287. But wait, this would be for the Lyman alpha to be at 400 nm (violet end). But maybe the quasar's light is observed in the optical, so the absorption line must lie within the range where the telescope can observe. So, the lower limit would be when the Lyman alpha is at the start of the optical window.

But wait, not all optical is accessible from the ground. The atmosphere has cutoffs, right? I think the Earth's atmosphere is opaque to wavelengths below about 300 nm. So if the Lyman alpha line is redshifted into the optical, it has to be above 300 nm. Wait, no—wait, the atmosphere is opaque to certain UV wavelengths, but when you have redshifted UV lines into the optical, they can be observed. So perhaps it's more about the telescope's capability.

Wait, no, ground-based telescopes can't observe
