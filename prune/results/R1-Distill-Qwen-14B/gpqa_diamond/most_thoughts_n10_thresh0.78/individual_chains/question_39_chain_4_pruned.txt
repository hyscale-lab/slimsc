Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the value of 'a'. Let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The problem says that each particle's wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Interesting, so the wave function has both real and imaginary parts. But wait, the wave function in quantum mechanics is usually written as Ψ(x) = something, right? So here, it's Ψ(x) = a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i. Hmm, but I remember that for a wave function to be physically meaningful, it must be normalizable. That is, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1.

Wait, but each particle can only be found between x=1 and x=3. So when they took measurements, all particles were found between x=1 and x=3, and nowhere else. So the wave function must be zero outside this interval, but the given expression is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait a second, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait, wait, perhaps the wave function is non-zero (or has a non-zero probability) only between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is given in that region, but outside that, it's zero. But the given expression is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So maybe the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, and that's where this expression applies.

But wait, the problem says that when measuring, none were found at x<1 and x>3. So the wave function must be zero outside that interval. But in the interval x=1 to x=3, the wave function is given by that expression. So to normalize the wave function, the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |Ψ(x)|² dx must equal 1.

Let me write down the wave function: Ψ(x)
