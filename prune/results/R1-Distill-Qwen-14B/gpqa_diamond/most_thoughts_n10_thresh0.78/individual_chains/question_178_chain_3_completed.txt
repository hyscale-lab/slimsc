Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let me think through this.

First, the given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which I remember is the antisymmetric combination of gamma matrices. Right, that's the definition for the sigma matrices, often used in things like the Pauli equation or when dealing with spinor fields and electromagnetic interactions.

So the question is about the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. I'm a bit rusty on my QFT, but I'll try to recall.

I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of a field or coupling constant determines renormalizability. The general rule is that a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have mass dimension less than or equal to 4. Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, the mass dimension of the coupling must be less than or equal to 4 for the theory to be renormalizable because higher dimensions would lead to nonrenormalizable interactions, which require an infinite number of counterterms.

So first, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should look at the dimensions of each part of the Lagrangian.

The Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4, because in four spacetime dimensions, the action (which is the integral of the Lagrangian) must be dimensionless (in natural units where ħ = c = 1). So the Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4.

So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 as well because the terms are added together.

So let's break down the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

First, the fields. The Dirac spinor ψ has a mass dimension of 3/2. Because in four dimensions, the spinor field ψ has dimension (4-1)/2 = 3/2. That's a standard result. So ψ̄ is the adjoint, which has the same dimension as ψ, so 3/2.

Next, σ_{μν} is made from gamma matrices. The gamma matrices are dimensionless. Because they're matrices, but in terms of mass dimension, they don't contribute. The commutator of two gamma matrices is still a gamma matrix, so σ_{μν} is dimensionless.

F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. The field strength tensor F^{μν} has a mass dimension of 2. Because for electromagnetism, the gauge field A_mu has mass dimension 1. The field strength is ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu, so each derivative ∂ is dimension 1 (since ∂ ~ ∂/∂x, and x has dimension -1 in mass units), so each term in F is ∂A, which is 1 + 1 = 2. So F has dimension 2.

So let me put it all together. The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ, ψ, F.

So each field's dimension:

ψ̄: 3/2

σ_{μν}: 0

ψ: 3/2

F^{μν}: 2

So the four fields' dimensions sum to 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2 = 3/2 + 3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. So the product of the fields has mass dimension 5.

Wait, but the Lagrangian term is κ multiplied by this product. So the entire term has dimension [κ] + 5 = 4, because the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So solving for [κ], [κ] = 4 - 5 = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. That narrows down the options to either A or C.

Now, about renormalizability. The general rule is that a coupling constant with negative mass dimension implies that the interaction is nonrenormalizable. Because in four dimensions, renormalizable couplings must have dimension ≤4. Wait, wait, no. Wait. The mass dimension of the coupling determines the renormalizability. For a term in the Lagrangian of the form g φ^n, the mass dimension of g is [g] = 4 - n [φ], where [φ] is the dimension of the field φ. For the term to be renormalizable, [g] must be ≥ 0. Because if [g] is negative, you need higher and higher order terms, leading to nonrenormalizable interactions.

In our case, [κ] is -1, which is less than zero. So the interaction term is not renormalizable because the coupling has a negative mass dimension. That means the theory is nonrenormalizable.

So putting it together: κ has dimension -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. Looking back at the options, option C says [κ]_M is -1 and the theory is not renormalizable. So the correct answer must be C.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of the Lagrangian
In four spacetime dimensions, the Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}$ must have mass dimension 4 to ensure the action (an integral of $\mathcal{L}$) is dimensionless. Each term in the Lagrangian must also have mass dimension 4.

### Step 2: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The Dirac spinor field $\psi$ has mass dimension $\frac{3}{2}$.
- The adjoint spinor $\bar{\psi}$ has the same mass dimension as $\psi$, $\frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ for electromagnetism has mass dimension 2.
- The $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ tensor, being a commutator of dimensionless gamma matrices, is also dimensionless.

### Step 3: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ must have mass dimension 4. Summing the dimensions of the fields:
\[
[\bar{\psi}] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]
Thus, the dimension of $\kappa$ is:
\[
[\kappa] = 4 - 5 = -1.
\]

### Step 4: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimension. Since $[\kappa] = -1 < 0$, the interaction term is nonrenormalizable. This implies the theory requires an infinite number of counterterms to handle divergences.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable. The correct answer is:
