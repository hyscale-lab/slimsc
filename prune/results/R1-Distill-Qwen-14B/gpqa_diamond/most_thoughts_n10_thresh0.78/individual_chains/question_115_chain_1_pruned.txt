Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the angle between the two photons after an electron and positron annihilate. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the setup. There's an electron moving to the right (left to right on the horizontal axis) with a Lorentz factor of 4. Then there's a positron moving to the left (right to left) with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. The photons have the same energy and their directions are measured. One is upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So gamma is equal to E/(m c²), where E is the total energy. Since both particles are electrons (and positrons are just the opposite charge), their rest mass is the same. So for the electron, gamma is 4, so its energy is 4 m c². The positron has gamma 2, so energy 2 m c².

But wait, when they annihilate, the total energy should be conserved. So the total energy before annihilation is the sum of the electron's and positron's energies. Electron: 4 m c², positron: 2 m c². Total is 6 m c².

After annihilation, since they produce two photons, each photon has energy 3 m c²? Because 6 divided by 2 is 3. Oh, but wait, the problem says both photons have the same value, which fits with that.

But wait, energy is just one part. Momentum must also be conserved. Since they're moving along the horizontal axis (let's say the x-axis), and the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions, which suggests they have both x and y components.

Let me think about momentum. The initial momentum is the sum of the electron's and positron's momenta. For relativistic particles, momentum p is gamma m v. Wait, but since gamma is given, maybe it's easier to compute p in terms of gamma and m.

The electron is moving to the right, so its momentum is positive. The positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is negative. So I need to calculate their momenta.

For the electron: gamma is 4. The momentum p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. But wait, v can be found from gamma. Alternatively, since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)), but maybe it's easier to calculate p in terms of gamma and m. I remember that for a particle, E² = (pc c)² + (m c²)². So, for each particle, E = gamma m c², and p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / c. Or,
