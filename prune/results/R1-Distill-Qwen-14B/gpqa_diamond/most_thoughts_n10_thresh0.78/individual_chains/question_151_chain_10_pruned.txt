Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a particular observable in a system. Oh right, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by matrices, and the state of the system is a vector. The probability is calculated using the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues of the observable matrix. Wait, wait, but I'm a bit rusty on the exact steps. Let me think.

So the state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Oh wait, wait, does that mean it's a three-dimensional vector? So the state vector is |ψ> = [-1; 2; 1]. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, right? Because the probabilities have to add up to 1. So I should check if this vector is normalized. Let me calculate its norm. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6), so the state vector is not normalized. That's something to keep in mind.

The observable is given by matrix P. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Wait, so P looks like this:

[ 0       1/√2      0      ]
[1/√2     0      1/√2   ]
[ 0       1/√2      0      ]

Hmm, what's the structure of this matrix? It's a 3x3 matrix. I think this might be a symmetric matrix, which is good because observables should be Hermitian. Let me check symmetry. The element at (1,2) is 1/√2, and (2,1) is same. (2,3) is 1/√2, (3,2) is same. So yes, it's symmetric, hence Hermitian, which is correct for an observable.

So the possible eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes. The problem asks for the probability of getting 0 as a result. So I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, and
