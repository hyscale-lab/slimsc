Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that cyclohexanone is treated with bromine, forming product 1. Then 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide to make product 2. Next, 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine to get product 3. Finally, 3 is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride to form product 4. The question is about how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)7.

Hmm. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to figure out each reaction step. Starting with cyclohexanone. So cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. When you treat a ketone with bromine, what happens? I remember that ketones can undergo various additions. Wait, bromine (Br2) in a certain solvent. Oh right, in the presence of a base, like maybe in a ketone, it could lead to the formation of a dibromide, but wait, that's not the usual case. Another possibility: Maybe it's a conjugate addition? Or perhaps a bromination via enol formation.

Wait, I think when cyclohexanone is treated with bromine, it's a case of the acid-catalyzed addition of bromine, but wait, in ketones, the addition is more likely without acid. Or maybe the enol bromination. Wait, I'm not too clear. Let's think: Cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. When you add bromine, maybe it's an addition reaction. But wait, without any catalyst, maybe it's a diaddition across the carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's a bromination but that's more for aromatic rings, which cyclohexanone isn't. So perhaps the first step is the addition of bromine to the carbonyl.

Wait, but when a ketone like cyclohexanone reacts with Br2, it typically undergoes a 1,2-addition or 1,4-addition. Oh wait, wait. Wait, no, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh! Wait, I think when ketones react with bromine in a non-polar solvent, it's a mechanism where the enol is formed
