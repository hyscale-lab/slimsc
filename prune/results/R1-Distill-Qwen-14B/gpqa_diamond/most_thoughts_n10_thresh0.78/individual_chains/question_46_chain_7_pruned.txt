Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. And I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. Hmm, I remember Grubbs catalyst is involved in some kind of ring-closing metathesis, right?

Wait, wait. Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis, which is a process where alkenes exchange parts. Ring-closing metathesis would form a ring by connecting two double bonds, but wait, in this case, the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)CH2? No, wait, wait. Let me draw this out. The formula for pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would have a methyl branch on the third carbon. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, no, that's 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me count the carbons. Pent means five carbons. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. Then C3 is CH with a methyl group. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, wait. No, wait. Let me think again. 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's six carbons. Wait, no, pentane has five carbons. So maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)CH2? No, that doesn't add up. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The formula for 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that's six carbons. Wait, maybe the correct structure is:

Wait, pentane is five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be: the main chain is five carbons, with a double bond starting at carbon 1, and a methyl group on carbon 3. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's five carbons? Let
