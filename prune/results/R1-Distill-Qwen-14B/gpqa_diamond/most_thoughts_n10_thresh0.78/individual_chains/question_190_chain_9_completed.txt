Okay, so I have this chemistry question about nucleophilicity in an aqueous solution. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question asks me to arrange five nucleophiles from the most reactive to the least reactive. The nucleophiles given are:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. Hydroxide (OH⁻)
3. Propionate (CH₂CH₂COO⁻)
4. Methanol (CH₃OH)
5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻)

The options are A, B, C, D with different orders. I need to figure out the correct order.

First, I remember that nucleophilicity depends on the solvent. Since the question specifies aqueous solution, which is a polar protic solvent, nucleophilicity trends are different from what they are in a polar aprotic solvent.

In polar aprotic solvents, nucleophilicity generally follows the order of basicity because the solvation is less strong. But in polar protic solvents, the nucleophiles are solvated (surrounded by solvent molecules), which can hinder their reactivity. Stronger bases are usually better nucleophiles, but in polar protic solvents, the ability to shed the solvent molecules (solvation) plays a big role. So, the more polarizable the nucleophile and the weaker the solvation, the more nucleophilic it is.

Let me list the given nucleophiles along with their characteristics:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: This is an alkoxide ion (O⁻) with a bulky substituent (4-methyl). Alkoxides are strong bases. Bulky groups can sometimes hinder reactions (steric hindrance), but in terms of basicity, it's a strong nucleophile.

2. Hydroxide ion (OH⁻): Also an alkoxide. Strong base, but in aqueous solution, it's quite solvated. But wait, in water, it's the conjugate base of water. So, in water, it's less nucleophilic than it might be in a different solvent. But compared to other ions here, maybe it's more nucleophilic than weaker bases.

3. Propionate ion (CH₂CH₂COO⁻): This is the conjugate base of propionic acid. It's a weaker base than hydroxide or alkoxides because it's an anion of a weak acid. So, propionate's nucleophilicity would be lower compared to stronger bases.

4. Methanol (CH3OH): This is a neutral molecule, an alcohol. It's a poor nucleophile in aqueous solution because it's not deprotonated. Nucleophiles that are neutral and in a protic solvent are usually less reactive because they don't have a negative charge to attack.

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻): The conjugate base of ethanethiol. Thiols are weaker acids than alcohols, so their conjugate bases are stronger. Wait, no—thiols are stronger acids than alcohols. Because S is bigger, it can stabilize the negative charge better. So, ethanethiol (HS-H) is a stronger acid than ethanol (OH-H). So, HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻? Wait, wait, no. If the acid is stronger, its conjugate base is weaker. So, if ethanethiol is a stronger acid (lower pKa) than ethanol, then the HS⁻ ion is a weaker base. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Acidity: stronger acid means conjugate base is weaker. So, for example, HCl is a strong acid, Cl⁻ is a weak base. So, if ethanethiol is a stronger acid than ethanol, then HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. But wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

Wait, let's get the pKa values right. For alcohols and thiols:

Water has a pKa around 15.5. Ethanethiol (HS-H) has a pKa around 10. So, it's a stronger acid than water. Propionic acid has a pKa around 4.88. So, propionate is a weaker base than hydroxide. Methanol has a pKa around 19.7, so its conjugate base (methoxide) would be stronger than hydroxide. But wait, wait; methanol is a weaker acid than water, so its conjugate base is stronger. Wait, that's the opposite. So, the stronger the acid, the weaker the conjugate base.

Wait, let me correct that. The stronger the acid (lower pKa), the weaker the conjugate base. So, since ethanethiol has a lower pKa (~10) than ethanol (~19.7), ethanethiol is a stronger acid. Therefore, HS⁻ is a weaker base than CH3O⁻. But hydroxide (OH⁻) has a pKa of H2O (15.5), so it's a stronger base than HS⁻. So, comparing HS⁻ to OH⁻: OH⁻ is a stronger base.

So, the nucleophilicity in polar protic solvents is influenced by both basicity and solvation. So, the stronger bases are better nucleophiles, but they are also more solvated. So, in polar protic solvents, the more polarizable and less solvated the nucleophile, the better it is.

Wait, but I've also heard that in polar protic solvents, the nucleophilicity order for common ions is: I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻. Because F⁻ is the strongest base but is highly solvated. So, in such solvents, less solvated (more polarizable) nucleophiles are better.

So, for the given nucleophiles, let me list the order of their basicity and how solvated they are.

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻): pKa of ethanethiol is ~10. So, HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻ (pKa 15.5 of H2O) but stronger than propionate (pKa ~4.88 for propionic acid). Wait, no: propionate is the conjugate base of propionic acid (pKa ~4.88), so propionate is a stronger base than HS⁻, because propionic acid is weaker than ethanethiol. Wait, wait, no.

Wait, pKa of acid: lower (stronger acid) → weaker conjugate base. Propionic acid has pKa ~4.88. So, its conjugate base (propionate) is stronger than a base from a weaker acid. Ethanethiol's pKa is ~10, so HS⁻ is a weaker base than propionate. Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again.

If acid A has a lower pKa (stronger acid) than acid B, then the conjugate base of A (A⁻) is weaker than the conjugate base of B (B⁻). So, propionic acid (pKa 4.88) is a stronger acid than ethanethiol (pKa ~10). So, propionate (A⁻) is a weaker base than HS⁻ (B⁻). Hmm, wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if acid A is stronger than acid B, then the conjugate base of A is weaker than the conjugate base of B. So, propionic acid (A) is stronger than ethanethiol (B). So, propionate (A⁻) is weaker base than HS⁻ (B⁻). No, that's correct. So propionate is a weaker base than HS⁻. Wait, but then why is HS⁻ considered a better nucleophile?

Wait, but in a polar protic solvent, the strength of the base isn't the only factor; solvation also matters. So, stronger bases are more solvated. But in polar protic solvents, nucleophilicity can be inversely related to basicity because the strongest bases are more tightly solvated.

So, let's compare the nucleophiles:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: It's an alkoxide ion, a strong base. But it's bulky. Bulkiness can affect reactivity—like in SN2 reactions, bulky groups can hinder backside attack. But in terms of nucleophilicity in solution, the basicity is high, but the bulky substituent may slow it down.

2. Hydroxide (OH⁻): Strong base, but in aqueous solution, it's well-solvated, which makes it less nucleophilic than it could be.

3. Propionate (CH₂CH₂COO⁻): Weaker base than hydroxide and ethanethiolate. Wait, no, earlier thought was that propionate is weaker than HS⁻. Wait, earlier conclusion was that propionate is a weaker base than HS⁻ because propionic acid is stronger. So, propionate is a weaker base than HS⁻. So, propionate's nucleophilicity would be lower than HS⁻.

4. Methanol (CH3OH): Neutral, so it's a poor nucleophile in aqueous solution. Its conjugate base (methoxide) is a strong base, but in solution as CH3OH, it's not deprotonated much, so it's not a good nucleophile.

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻): Stronger base than propionate, but weaker than hydroxide. But in polar protic solvents, the nucleophilicity can be influenced by solvation. Thiols are less solvated than hydroxide because S is larger, and the solvent molecules (water) can form weaker interactions with HS⁻ compared to OH⁻. So, HS⁻ might be a better nucleophile than OH⁻ in aqueous solution.

Wait, but that contradicts what I thought earlier. Let me think again about HS⁻ vs OH⁻ in aqueous.

I remember that, in general, in polar protic solvents, the nucleophilicity order is: I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻ because of the balance between basicity and solvation. Similarly, for O and S nucleophiles, S is less electronegative and larger, so the HS⁻ ion is less solvated than OH⁻, making it a better nucleophile in such solvents.

So, in aqueous solution, HS⁻ is a better nucleophile than OH⁻. Because even though OH⁻ is a stronger base, HS⁻ is less tightly solvated, making it more available to attack.

So, let's reorder the nucleophiles based on their nucleophilicity in aqueous solution.

We have:

HS⁻ (5) > OH⁻ (2) > 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1) ?

Wait, cyclohexanolate is a strong base but also bulky. How does that affect its nucleophilicity?

Wait, the 4-methylcyclohexanolate is an alkoxide, so a strong base. But the steric hindrance (bulky group) might reduce its nucleophilicity because in solution, the bulky group slows it down. So, perhaps in terms of nucleophilicity in solution, it might be less reactive than HS⁻ and OH⁻, but more reactive than propionate and methanol.

Alternatively, considering that 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a bulky base, perhaps its nucleophilicity is lower than that of less hindered bases like HS⁻ and OH⁻.

Wait, but in a polar protic solvent, the order of nucleophilicity based on how well they are solvated and their basicity:

Stronger bases that are less solvated would have higher nucleophilicity. For example, HS⁻ is less solvated than OH⁻ because S is bigger and forms weaker hydrogen bonds. So, HS⁻ is a better nucleophile in aqueous solution than OH⁻.

Then, comparing 4-methylcyclohexanolate (1) with OH⁻ (2): the cyclohexanolate is a strong base but bulky. So, in solution, how does that affect it? Bulky bases might have lower nucleophilicity because of steric hindrance. So, perhaps 4-methylcyclohexanolate is less nucleophilic than HS⁻ and OH⁻ but more than propionate.

But wait, the cyclohexanolate is an alkoxide, same as OH⁻. So, perhaps the cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻ because of its structure? Or not. Wait, the strength of the base depends on the stability of the conjugate acid.

Wait, the 4-methylcyclohexanol's pKa would be around 19.7 (similar to ethanol) or higher? Because cyclohexanol is more acidic than ethanol? Wait, no. Let me think: Cyclic alcohols generally have lower acidity than acyclic ones because the conjugate base (alkoxide) is more stabilized in cyclic structures due to less strain. Hmm, wait, no: wait, cyclohexanol's pKa is about 19.9, which is similar to ethanol (19.7). So, 4-methylcyclohexanol would have similar acidity, so its conjugate base (the cyclohexanolate) is a strong base, similar to OH⁻.

Wait, but compared to OH⁻, the cyclohexanolate is a stronger base, because cyclohexanol is less acidic than water? Wait, wait, no. Water has a pKa of ~15.5. So, cyclohexanol has a pKa around 19.7, which is higher. So, cyclohexanol is a weaker acid than water. Therefore, its conjugate base (cyclohexanolate) is a stronger base than OH⁻.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me get the pKa values correct.

- Water: pKa ~15.5
- Ethanol: pKa ~19.7
- Cyclohexanol: pKa ~19.9
- Methanol: pKa ~19.7
- Propionic acid: pKa ~4.88
- Ethanethiol: pKa ~10

So, cyclohexanol is a weaker acid than ethanol (pKa 19.9 vs 19.7). So, the conjugate base (cyclohexanolate) is a stronger base than ethoxide (ethoxide is the conjugate base of ethanol). Similarly, the propionate's conjugate acid (propionic acid) has a pKa of ~4.88, so propionate is a weaker base than cyclohexanolate.

So, the cyclohexanolate (1) is a stronger base than OH⁻ (since OH⁻ is the conjugate base of H2O, pKa ~15.5, which is lower than cyclohexanol's pKa). Wait, wait, no. Wait, cyclohexanol has a higher pKa (19.9) than water (15.5). So, the conjugate base of cyclohexanol (cyclohexanolate) is a stronger base than OH⁻, which is the conjugate base of water.

So, cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻, which is a stronger base than HS⁻ (since HS⁻ is the conjugate base of ethanethiol, pKa ~10). Wait, no: the conjugate base's strength is inversely related to the acid's strength. So, the stronger the acid, the weaker the conjugate base.

Ethanethiol (pKa ~10) is a stronger acid than water (pKa ~15.5), so HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻.

Similarly, cyclohexanol (pKa ~19.9) is a weaker acid than water, so cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻.

So, the order of basicity (strength of base) is:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (strongest base)
2. OH⁻
3. HS⁻ (weaker than OH⁻)
4. Propionate (weaker than HS⁻)
5. Methanol (as a neutral molecule, it's a poor nucleophile)

But in polar protic solvents, the nucleophilicity isn't just based on basicity because solvation plays a role. So, stronger bases are more solvated, which can make them less nucleophilic.

So, in aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity is often opposite to the order of basicity because the strongest bases are more solvated. But this isn't always the case for all nucleophiles.

Wait, but for HS⁻ and OH⁻, even though OH⁻ is a stronger base, HS⁻ is less solvated because S is larger and forms weaker hydrogen bonds. So, HS⁻ is a better nucleophile in aqueous solution than OH⁻.

Similarly, comparing 4-methylcyclohexanolate (1) to OH⁻ (2), the cyclohexanolate is a stronger base but more bulky. How does bulk affect nucleophilicity in solution? In solution, steric hindrance reduces the ability to attack, so a bulky base might be less nucleophilic. So, perhaps the cyclohexanolate is less nucleophilic than OH⁻ despite being a stronger base because it's bulkier.

Wait, but wait. If the cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻, but in solution, it's more solvated. Or perhaps in solution, its solvation is similar to OH⁻, but it's bulkier, making it less reactive. So, the order could be:

HS⁻ (5) > OH⁻ (2) > 4-methylcyclohexanolate (1) ?

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because the cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻, but in solution, it may be less solvated or more? Or maybe the steric bulk makes it less reactive. Hmm, perhaps I need to think of it differently.

Alternatively, let's consider the order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution for these nucleophiles.

From what I know, in aqueous solution, the order is usually:

HS⁻ > RO⁻ (like ethoxide) > HO⁻ > other weaker bases.

Wait, no. Wait, in aqueous solution, the nucleophilicity order for common nucleophiles is influenced by both basicity and solvation. For example, F⁻ is a stronger base than I⁻ but is a worse nucleophile in aqueous solution because it's more solvated.

So, among the given nucleophiles:

1. 4-methylcyclohexanolate: strong base, but bulky. So, in solution, perhaps it's a good nucleophile but not the best because of bulk.

2. OH⁻: strong base, but in solution, more solvated than HS⁻.

3. Propionate: weaker base than HS⁻ and OH⁻.

4. Methanol: neutral, so poor nucleophile.

5. HS⁻: weaker base than OH⁻ but better nucleophile in solution because less solvated.

So, putting it all together, the order from most to least reactive (nucleophilicity) should be:

5 (HS⁻) > 2 (OH⁻) > 1 (cyclohexanolate) > 3 (propionate) > 4 (methanol).

Wait, but wait. Let me think again about the cyclohexanolate. It's a stronger base than OH⁻, so perhaps in solution, despite being bulkier, it's more nucleophilic than OH⁻? Or does the bulkiness outweigh the basicity?

I think that in a polar protic solvent, the more polarizable and less solvated the nucleophile, the more nucleophilic it is. So, HS⁻ is less solvated than OH⁻, so it's a better nucleophile. But cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻. How do these factors balance?

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the concepts. Let's look for a rule. In polar protic solvents, the nucleophilicity order for some common nucleophiles is: I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻. So even though F⁻ is the strongest base, it's the worst nucleophile in such solvents because it's the most solvated.

Similarly, for other nucleophiles: the less the solvation, the better the nucleophilicity.

So, comparing HS⁻ and OH⁻, since S is larger, HS⁻ is less solvated than OH⁻. So, HS⁻ is a better nucleophile.

Now, comparing 4-methylcyclohexanolate (1) to OH⁻ (2):

If 1 is a stronger base than 2, but in a polar protic solvent, it's more solvated, making it a worse nucleophile than 2? Or does the base strength override solvation when comparing OH⁻ and cyclohexanolate?

Wait, cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻ (because its conjugate acid has a higher pKa). So, in a polar aprotic solvent, it would be a better nucleophile. But in a polar protic solvent, which factor is more important: solvation or base strength?

I think that in polar protic solvents, solvation has a bigger impact. So, a stronger base is more solvated, making it less nucleophilic. Therefore, OH⁻ is a better nucleophile in aqueous solution than 4-methylcyclohexanolate.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about this. If cyclohexanolate is a stronger base, it would be more willing to donate electrons, but it's more solvated. So, is the effect of solvation more significant than the basicity, or vice versa?

I've read that in polar aprotic solvents, nucleophilicity correlates with basicity because solvation isn't as strong. But in polar protic solvents, the order is different because the stronger bases are more solvated, which reduces their nucleophilicity.

So, for two strong bases in a polar protic solvent, the one that is less solvated will be a better nucleophile.

In our case, 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻. But is it more or less solvated?

Wait, larger ions are less solvated because they form weaker bonds. Alkoxide ions are generally more solvated than thiolates. Wait, no. I think the strength of solvation depends on the ion's charge and polarity. HS⁻ has a larger size (S is bigger than O), so it's less solvated than OH⁻.

So, perhaps 4-methylcyclohexanolate is more solvated than HS⁻ but less than OH⁻? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the order of solvation is: OH⁻ > 4-methylcyclohexanolate > HS⁻.

Because O is smaller than S, OH⁻ can form stronger hydrogen bonds with water (the solvent), making it more solvated than HS⁻.

So, in that case, the nucleophilicity order in aqueous solution would be:

HS⁻ (5) > 4-methylcyclohexanolate (1) > OH⁻ (2) > propionate (3) > methanol (4).

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

HS⁻ (5) > OH⁻ (2) > 4-methylcyclohexanolate (1) > propionate (3) > methanol (4).

But wait, that doesn't make sense because 1 is a stronger base than 2. Oh, but in aqueous solution, maybe the solvation makes 2 less reactive than 1, but wait, 1 is more solvated?

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me think about the options given.

Looking at the options, option D says order is 5,2,1,3,4. So, 5 (HS⁻) is first, then 2 (OH⁻), then 1 (cyclohexanolate), then 3 (propionate), then 4 (methanol).

But earlier analysis suggests that HS⁻ is first, then cyclohexanolate (stronger base) might be second, but in solution, maybe OH⁻ is less nucleophilic than cyclohexanolate? Or is it the other way around?

Alternatively, perhaps in the order, the strongest nucleophilicity in aqueous solution is:

HS⁻ (5) > OH⁻ (2) > 4-methylcyclohexanolate (1) > propionate (3) > methanol (4).

But why would OH⁻ be more nucleophilic than 1? Because OH⁻ is less solvated than 1? Or because 1 is bulkier?

Alternatively, maybe the order is:

HS⁻ (5) > 4-methylcyclohexanolate (1) > OH⁻ (2) > propionate (3) > methanol (4).

But I'm not certain. Let me think about HS⁻ vs OH⁻. I remember that in aqueous solution, thiolate ions are better nucleophiles than hydroxide ions because they are less solvated.

So, HS⁻ is more nucleophilic than OH⁻.

Now, comparing 4-methylcyclohexanolate (1) and OH⁻ (2). Since 1 is a stronger base, but in aqueous solution, perhaps it's more solvated, making its nucleophilicity lower than OH⁻. Or maybe the bulkiness makes it less reactive than OH⁻.

Wait, cyclohexanolate is a strong base but bulky. In a substitution reaction, bulkiness can slow down the reaction because of steric hindrance. So, in solution, perhaps its nucleophilicity is lower than OH⁻ despite being a stronger base.

So, the order would be:

5 (HS⁻) > 2 (OH⁻) > 1 (cyclohexanolate) > 3 (propionate) >4 (methanol).

But looking at the options, option D is 5,2,1,3,4.

Which matches this order.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻, but in solution, maybe OH⁻ is more nucleophilic because it's less solvated? No, wait, OH⁻ is more solvated, but perhaps the bulky cyclohexanolate is so hindered that it's less reactive.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4-methylcyclohexanolate is less nucleophilic than OH⁻ because it's more bulky, making it a worse nucleophile in solution.

So, in the order, after HS⁻, comes OH⁻, then comes cyclohexanolate, then propionate, then methanol.

So, the order would be 5 > 2 >1>3>4.

Looking at the options, option D is: 5,2,1,3,4. So, option D.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 5,2,1,3,4. So that's the order I was thinking.

But wait, let me think about propionate (3). Propionate is the conjugate base of a weak acid (propionic acid, pKa ~4.88), so it's a weaker base than HS⁻ (pKa of ethanethiol is ~10). So, propionate is a weaker base than HS⁻ and OH⁻. So, in solution, propionate is a weaker nucleophile.

Methanol (4) is neutral, so it's a poor nucleophile.

So, the order from most to least reactive nucleophile in aqueous solution is:

5 (HS⁻) > 2 (OH⁻) >1 (cyclohexanolate) >3 (propionate) >4 (methanol).

Looking at the options, option D is option 5,2,1,3,4.

But let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 5,2,3,1 and 4

B) 2,5,1,4 and 3

C) 2,5,3,4 and 3

D)5,2,1,3 and4.

Yes, option D is 5,2,1,3,4.

So, the correct answer would be option D.


To determine the nucleophilicity of the given nucleophiles in an aqueous (polar protic) solvent, we consider both their basicity and solvation effects. In polar protic solvents, stronger bases are generally more solvated, which can reduce their nucleophilicity. Additionally, steric hindrance and polarizability play roles in determining reactivity.

### Analysis of the Nucleophiles:
1. **4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1)**: This is a strong base (conjugate base of a weak acid, cyclohexanol, pKa ~19.9). However, it is bulky, which can reduce its nucleophilicity due to steric hindrance. In aqueous solution, it is more nucleophilic than propionate and methanol but less than HS⁻ and OH⁻.

2. **Hydroxide (OH⁻) (2)**: OH⁻ is a strong base (conjugate base of water, pKa ~15.5). In aqueous solution, it is well-solvated, which reduces its nucleophilicity compared to HS⁻. However, it is more nucleophilic than 4-methylcyclohexanolate due to less steric hindrance.

3. **Propionate (CH₂CH₂COO⁻) (3)**: Propionate is a weak base (conjugate base of propionic acid, pKa ~4.88). It is less nucleophilic than both HS⁻ and OH⁻ due to its weaker basicity and greater solvation.

4. **Methanol (CH₃OH) (4)**: Methanol is a neutral molecule, making it a poor nucleophile in aqueous solution. Its conjugate base (methoxide) would be a strong nucleophile, but methanol itself is not deprotonated in this case.

5. **Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) (5)**: HS⁻ is a moderately strong base (conjugate base of ethanethiol, pKa ~10). In aqueous solution, it is less solvated than OH⁻ due to sulfur's larger size and weaker hydrogen bonding, making it the most nucleophilic among the given nucleophiles.

### Nucleophilicity Order in Aqueous Solution:
- **HS⁻ (5)**: Most nucleophilic due to its balance of moderate basicity and reduced solvation.
- **OH⁻ (2)**: Second due to its strong basicity, though it is more solvated than HS⁻.
- **4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1)**: Third due to its strong basicity but significant steric hindrance.
- **Propionate (3)**: Fourth due to its weaker basicity and greater solvation.
- **Methanol (4)**: Least nucleophilic as a neutral molecule.

### Correct Answer:
The correct order of nucleophilicity is **5 > 2 > 1 > 3 > 4**, which corresponds to **Option D**.

Answer: D
