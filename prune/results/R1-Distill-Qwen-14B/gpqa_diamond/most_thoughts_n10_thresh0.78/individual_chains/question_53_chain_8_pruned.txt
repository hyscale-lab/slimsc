Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think carefully.

The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The given data includes FTIR and 1H NMR spectra.

First, let's look at the FTIR part. It shows peaks indicating an ester group. Esters have a strong absorption around 1740 cm⁻¹ due to the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, the compound has an ester functional group.

Now, the 1H NMR spectrum has six signals. Let me parse what each signal implies.

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the substitution pattern can influence the NMR signals. For example, if the substituents are para to each other, the aromatic protons would split into two sets. Maybe two doublets or two singlets depending on symmetry. If they are ortho or meta, the splitting would be different. Wait, but di-substituted can also lead to more than two signals if the substituents are not symmetrical. In this case, two signals mean that the aromatic protons are split into two environments. So perhaps it's a para substitution because that symmetry would lead to two sets of two equivalent protons each, giving two singlets? Or maybe each proton is split into two different environments. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure but the key is that there are two signals.

2. Two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically on double bonds, like in an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group and often an adjacent ethylene group. Wait, maybe the structure has an ester group attached to a double bond somewhere else. Alternatively, perhaps there's a vinyl group attached to the aromatic ring. 

Wait, the ester group is O-C-O, right? So, an ester is R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, no, that's not right. An ester is R-O-CO-R'. So, the structure might be something like a benzene ring with two substituents, one of which is an ester group. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group, and the other is another group, like an ethylene group or something else.

Wait, but the NMR has two vinyl-H signals. Vinyl protons are on a double bond. So maybe the substituents are an ester and an ethylene group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are such that one is an ester and the other is an ethenyl (vinyl) group.

Wait, but let me think about the ester group's structure. Esters are like RCOOR'. The R and R' can be alkyl or aryl. If the ester is attached to the benzene ring, the RCOOR' part would be the substituent.

But in the NMR, the two vinyl-H are a doublet and a doublet of quartets. That suggests coupling between two sets of protons. So, maybe there's a vinyl group adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ester.

Wait, perhaps the ester is part of a substituent that has a double bond. For example, if the substituent is something like OCOCH2CH2O... No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's an allyl ester. Or perhaps the substituent is an ester with a
