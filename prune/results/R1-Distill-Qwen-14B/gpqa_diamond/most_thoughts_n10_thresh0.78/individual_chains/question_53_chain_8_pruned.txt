Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it says.

The question is about an aromatic compound. The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered ring, so it's something like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group, which means there's an -O-CO-O- or an ester functional group. Wait, no, esters are typically R-O-CO-O-R, but in IR, the carbonyl (C=O) stretch is a strong peak around 1700 cm⁻¹, and the ester usually has a peak around 1250 cm⁻¹ for the C-O stretch. So the presence of these indicates an ester.

Looking at the NMR data: 1H NMR shows six signals. Wait, six signals, each with different multiplicities. Let's unpack this.

The six signals are:
1. Two aromatic H signals.
2. Two vinyl H signals: one is a doublet, the other is a doublet of quartets.
3. Two –CH3 groups.
No –CH2 groups, so that's important.

Hmm. So the structure must have an ester group, and the ring has two substituents.

Let me think about possible structures. A di-substituted benzene with ester groups? Or maybe one substituent is an ester group and the other is something else.

Wait, but esters are typically substituents like RCOOR'. So if the ring has two substituents, perhaps one is an ester group and the other is something else. Or maybe both substituents are part of the ester.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ester is part of a substituent on the ring. For example, maybe one substituent is an ester group, like OCOOR, and the other substituent is something else. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are both part of a larger group, like a vinyl group.

Wait, but in the NMR, there are two signals for vinyl H. That suggests perhaps two sets of vinyl protons, maybe from two different substituents. Or maybe one substituent has two types of vinyl protons.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester, and another is a vinyl group.

Wait, the NMR indicates two aromatic signals, so the di-substituted benzene has two distinct sets of aromatic protons. That implies that the substituents are in positions that cause the ring to have two different types of aromatic Hs. For example, if the substituents are para to each other, the aromatic Hs would be equivalent, but if they are ortho or meta, maybe not. Wait, wait, if it's di-substituted, the ring's symmetry depends on the substituents.

Wait, for example, if the two substituents are para, the aromatic protons would be in two sets (like in para-substituted benzene, you get two sets of Hs if the substituents are in positions that make the ring less symmetric). Wait, no, in para substitution, the structure is symmetrical.
