Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question involves a spin 1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, I remember that spin-1/2 particles are like electrons or something similar, right? They have intrinsic angular momentum, and that relates to their magnetic moment.

The problem says the particle's magnetic moment mu is equal to gamma times Sz. Oh wait, gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, I think. And Sz is the z-component of the spin angular momentum. So mu = γ S_z. Right.

Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction, and the particle's moment is aligned with it. So that means the system is in an eigenstate of Sz, probably. Then suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. Wait, so the initial state is when the field was along Z, and after the field is turned off and another turned on in Y. 

The question is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillating. What's the oscillation frequency?

Hmm. So when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian of the system changes. I think the energy levels will change, and the state of the system might no longer be an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

Let me think about the steps. Initially, the particle is in a state aligned with B along Z. So the spin is up along Z, perhaps. Then the field is changed to Y, so the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y. Wait, the magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field, so the Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B. But since mu = gamma S_z, and B is along Y, H should be proportional to S_y. Alternatively, perhaps H is proportional to gamma S · B, but since B is along Y, it's gamma B S_y.

Wait, let me clarify. The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -μ·B. So if μ is γ S, then H = -γ S · B. So when B is along +Y, H = -γ B S
