Okay, so I have this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, I need to figure out how the orbital periods of the two planets compare. Let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detects the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull.

Planet #1's spectral line shifts by 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's is 7 milliangstroms. I remember that the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us, which relates to the planet's orbit.

Wait, the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star. So the velocity semi-amplitude (K) is what we measure. The formula I recall is K = (v) which is related to the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period and distance. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

I think the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) ) ) * ( (1/( (4π²) ) )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(0.5)) ) ) )? Wait, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, I remember that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) ), but I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: the RV method gives the velocity of the star, which is related to the planet's orbital velocity. Since the star and planet orbit their common center of mass, the star's velocity (K) is inversely proportional to the planet's mass if the planet is much less massive than the star. But in this case, Neptune's mass is much smaller than the Sun, so M_p << M_star. So we can approximate M_p + M_star ≈ M_star.

So the formula for K would be approximately K ≈ ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/1) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) )? Wait, maybe that's not the exact form.

Alternatively, I think the formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2πG) / (c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can ignore M_p in M_star + M_p, so it's approximately:

K ≈ ( (2πG)^(1/3) * c^(-1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think in terms of the proportionality. Since both stars have the same mass (solar masses) and the planets have similar mass (Neptune), the ratio of their velocities (K) would relate to the ratio of their orbital periods.

The RV method gives K, the semi-amplitude. So K is inversely proportional to the orbital period to the 1/3 power, or something like that. Because from Kepler's third law, the period P is related to the semi-major axis a and the sum of the masses (but since M_p is negligible, it's M_star).

Kepler's third law in this context is P² = (4π² G)^(-1) * (a³ (M_star + M_p)) ) ≈ a³ / (G M_star). But wait, the exact form might vary depending on the units. Alternatively, using the version with P in years, a in AU, M in solar masses: P² = a³ / (M_star), but that's when using units where G and other constants are incorporated. But perhaps for this problem, the exact formula isn't needed since the masses are the same for the stars, and the planets' masses are similar.

Wait, but the question is about how the orbital periods relate given the shifts in their spectral lines. So K is the star's velocity due to the planet. So K is the amplitude of the star's velocity. So K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star) )^(1/ something) ) times something else.

Wait, I think the correct formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) ) ) * ( (1/( (4π²) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P))^(1/3) )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think about using the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude. From what I remember, the formula is:

K = ( ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) * ( (1/( (4π²) ) )^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(P) )^(1/3) )

But since M_p is much less than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p sin i) / (M_star)^(2/3) ) )^(1) ) * (1/(4π²))^(1/3) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) )

Wait, perhaps I should look for the relationship between K and P. Let's see, since K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) * (1/P^(1/3)) ), assuming sin i is 1 (edge-on orbit, which is the case for maximum K). But in this problem, both planets have similar masses, and the stars have the same mass. So M_p and M_star are the same for both planets.

So K1 / K2 = ( (M_p1 sin i1) / (M_star1^(2/3)) ) * (1/P1^(1/3)) ) ) / ( (M_p2 sin i2) / (M_star2^(2/3)) ) * (1/P2^(1/3)) ) )

But since M_p1 ≈ M_p2, M_star1 = M_star2, and sin i is probably the same (but the question doesn't specify, so perhaps we can assume sin i is the same, or that the inclination is the same for both. Alternatively, it's possible that it's not given, but since the question doesn't mention it, perhaps it's safe to assume that sin i is the same for both, or that it's not a factor in the ratio. Alternatively, perhaps it cancels out because we're looking for the ratio of P2 to P1.

Wait, the problem says both shifts are of the same spectral line, so perhaps the same wavelength, same instrument, etc. Hmm.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of the orbital periods, which is P2 / P1. Let me think.

Given that K1 is 5 milliangstrom, K2 is 7 milliangstrom. So K2 = (7/5) K1.

But K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)) ), because K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)), given that M_p and M_star are the same. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, K is related to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) ) * some constant. Because the formula is K = ( (G M_p (sin i)) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) * (1/( (4π²) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3) ) )

So because M_p << M_star, then M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so we can write K ≈ (G M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1/( (4π²)^(1/3) )) ) * (1/(P^(1/3) ) )

So K ∝ (M_p sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

But in this problem, M_p is the same for both planets (since both are similar to Neptune), M_star is the same for both stars (solar masses), and I think sin i is the same (but the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps it's not a factor or maybe it's the same for both, so it cancels out).

So K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)) )

So K1 / K2 = (1/(P1^(1/3))) / (1/(P2^(1/3))) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3) )

Because K1 = 5, K2 =7, so K1/K2 = 5/7.

But K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) )

So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Taking both sides to the power of 3:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1

So P2/P1 = (5^3)/(7^3) ) = (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.364 times that of planet #1. Which means P2 is shorter than P1.

Wait, but the question asks: "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?"

So P2 is shorter, so the ratio is 0.364 times as long. So the answer would be approximately 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check the steps.

- Both stars same mass.

- Both planets same mass.

- So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So K1 = 5, K2=7.

So K2/K1 = 7/5.

But since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Because K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)), so K2 = K1 * (P1/P2)^(1/3)

So K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3) → (7/5) = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Raise both sides to power 3: (7/5)^3 = P1/P2 → 343/125 = P1/P2 → P2 = (125/343) * P1 ≈ 0.364 * P1

So P2 is 0.364 times P1. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter, so it's how many times longer? 0.36 times as long, which is option A.


To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). Using the radial velocity method, \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), given that the masses of the stars and planets are the same, and the orbits are circular.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) by the formula:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Given that \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) for planet #1 and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) for planet #2, the ratio of their semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{7}{5}
\]

Since \( K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), the ratio of the periods \( P_2 \) and \( P_1 \) can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \left( \frac{P_1}{P_2} \right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging for \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \), we have:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{K_1}{K_2} \right)^3
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{5}{7} \right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This means planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's period by a factor of ~0.36.
