Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle annihilation. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. The reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Wait, p is a proton and p̄ is an antiproton. So when a proton and antiproton annihilate each other, they produce some other particles here, which are A⁺ and A⁻. Each A has a mass of 300 MeV.

The question is asking for the velocity of particle A. The options are given in terms of c, the speed of light. So the answer is going to be some fraction of c, like 0.86c or similar.

I remember that in particle reactions, conservation laws are key. So I should probably think about conservation of energy and momentum here. Since the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, that might imply that initially, the proton and antiproton are at rest? Or wait, no—the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps the system's initial momentum isn't zero. Or maybe the initial velocity is small enough that it can be treated as non-relativistic? Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe the initial kinetic energy is low, but I'm not sure if that affects much. Alternatively, perhaps the initial momentum is negligible because the antiproton's speed is small, so we can approximate it as being at rest. But I'm not entirely certain. Let me think.

Assuming that the initial momentum is zero—maybe the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving very slowly. Or perhaps it's the other way around. Wait, the problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe the initial momentum isn't zero, but perhaps it's moving so slowly that relativistic effects are minimal. Hmm, but not sure.

Wait, the question is about the velocity of particle A. So let's think about the conservation of energy and momentum.

First, let's note the masses involved. The proton mass is about 93
