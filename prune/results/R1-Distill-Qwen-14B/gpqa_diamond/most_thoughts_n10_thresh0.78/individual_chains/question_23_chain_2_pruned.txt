Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down. The question is about a reaction involving a specific compound reacting with hydrogen bromide (HBr). Then, after some time, TLC analysis shows two new products. I need to figure out which option correctly identifies the products.

The starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Hmm, I should probably draw the structure to visualize it better. So, benzene ring with an ether group (O-) attached. The other part of the ether is a butenyl group: but-3-en-1-yl. So, the substituents are on the third carbon? Wait, the butenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2O- attached to benzene? No, wait, but-3-en is four carbons, double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. But-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond starting at C3. Oh wait, no, the butenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but the double bond is between C2 and C3? Or wait, maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with the double bond at the end. Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the structure correctly.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl group: the double bond is between C3 and C4, but wait, but has four carbons. So, numbering from the end, the first carbon is attached to oxygen. So, positions would be 1, 2, 3, 4. So, the double bond is between 3 and 4, which would be the other end. Wait, but that seems unusual. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2 but with a double bond between C2 and C3? No, wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C3 and
