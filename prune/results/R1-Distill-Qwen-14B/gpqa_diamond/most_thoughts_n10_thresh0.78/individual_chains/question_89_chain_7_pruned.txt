Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. Hmm, I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halides on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they typically undergo an elimination reaction, probably E2, to form an alkene. So the product after this step should be an adamantane derivative with a double bond, right?

Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid, and the NMR and IR data are given. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which I think is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. But wait, elimination gives an alkene, which doesn't have a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong. Oh wait, another possibility: when dihalides react with strong bases, sometimes they can form epoxides under certain conditions, but KOH is more of an elimination agent. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation forming an alkene, but then where does the carbonyl come from?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. KOH is a strong base. If the dihalide is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, then each Br is on adjacent carbons? No, wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Brs on carbons 1 and 3, which are diagonally opposite. So elimination would not form an alkene because they're not adjacent. Oh wait, wait a second. Oh, no, wait. If the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, like 1,2-dibromo, then elimination would form a double bond between them. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane is not adjacent. So maybe elimination isn't possible. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination. If KOH is in excess, perhaps it's a substitution reaction. Oh, but for substitution, you need a good leaving group and a possible mechanism. Wait, but with vicinal dihalides, the base might cause an elimination, but if they're not adjacent, perhaps it's a different reaction. Maybe the base causes the formation of a carbene? No, I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation but in a way that forms a ketone. But wait, in that case, if the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, but with two Brs, perhaps the structure breaks down. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me check the NMR data.

The product 1 has an N
