Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

So, the problem is about an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 grams. They were heated to 200°C without air. Then a mixture of gases formed, which was passed through several tubes. The results are given about the weight gains and losses in each tube, and finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remained under standard conditions.

Hmm, the question is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Alright, let's break it down. First, I'll try to understand what's happening in each step.

When salts A and B are heated without air, they probably decompose. The decomposition produces a mixture of gases. Let me think about what gases could be formed. Maybe CO2, H2O, NH3, or something else? But given the subsequent steps, I can figure out what the gases are.

The gases pass through three tubes:

1. Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent, I think. So it probably absorbs water. The weight of this tube increased by 3.60 grams. So maybe the gas here was water vapor (H2O). Because Mg(ClO4)2 would react with H2O to form Mg(ClO4)2·xH2O, increasing the mass. So the mass gain of 3.60g is the mass of water absorbed. So the H2O in the gas contributed 3.60g.

2. Tube №2: Ca(OH)2 solution. But the weight didn't change. If the gas passed through here was CO2, then the Ca(OH)2 would react with CO2 to form CaCO3 and water. But why didn't the weight change? Oh, because when CO2 dissolves in Ca(OH)2 solution, it forms a precipitate. If the tube is just a solution, maybe the mass change isn't measured because the precipitate is formed in the solution, so the solution's mass increases. But in the problem, it says the weight of the second tube hasn't changed. Hmm, that seems contradictory. Alternatively, maybe the gas wasn't CO2. Or perhaps another possibility.

Wait, another thought: if the gas wasn't CO2, maybe the gas was something else that doesn't react with Ca(OH)2 solution. Wait, but what's the next tube.

3. Tube №3: Red-hot copper. The weight increased by 0.80g, and CuO is formed. So probably, the gas here is CO, because CO would react with hot copper to form CO2 and Cu. The reaction is: CO + Cu → CuO + CO2 (but I think it's more accurate to write the balanced equation: 2CO + 2Cu → 2CuO + CO2). Wait no, wait: the reaction of CO with Cu is 2CO + Cu → CuO + CO2. So the mass increase would correspond to the oxygen added from CO. Alternatively, maybe it's H2 reacting, but that seems less likely.

Wait, but the gas entering tube 3 is the remaining gas after tube 2. So perhaps the gas entering tube 3 is CO, which reacts with Cu to form CuO.

Let me also think about gas C, which is the remaining gas after all these steps. It's 2.24 liters at standard temperature and pressure (STP), which is 1 mole, since 22.4 L is 1 mole. So 2.24 L is 0.1 moles. So gas C is 0.1 moles.

Wait, but let me think about the gases in order. The initial mixture of gases is passed through tube 1 (Mg(ClO4)2), which traps H2O. Then, tube 2 (Ca(OH)2 solution), which would trap CO2. Then tube 3, which reacts with CO. The remaining gas is C, which is 0.1 moles.

So, let's outline:

After tube 1: The H2O is absorbed, so the rest of the gases go to tube 2.

After tube 2: The CO2 is absorbed. So any CO2 in the gas would be removed here.

After tube 3: CO is reacted, and the remaining gas is C.

So, the initial gases likely included H2O, CO2, CO, and maybe another gas, perhaps NH3 or something else that doesn't react in these steps.

Wait, but let me think about the reactions in each tube.

Tube 1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant. It reacts with water vapor to form Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O. So any water in the gas is captured here, leading to a mass increase of 3.60g. So the mass of H2O is 3.60g.

H2O has a molar mass of 18 g/mol. So 3.60g / 18g/mol = 0.2 mol of H2O.

Tube 2: Ca(OH)2 solution. Any CO2 in the gas would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water. The reaction is CO2 + Ca(OH)2 → CaCO3↓ + H2O. But the problem says that the weight of tube 2 didn't change. Hmm, why is that? Because the solution's mass would increase as CaCO3 precipitates. Oh, but maybe the tube is set up so that it doesn't measure mass change, perhaps it's just allowing the gas to pass through, and the Ca(OH)2 is in a setup that doesn't add to the tube's mass. Or perhaps the gas didn't contain CO2. Alternatively, maybe the CO2 was completely absorbed, but the tube's mass didn't change because the amount was too small or the setup didn't measure it. But the problem says that the tube's weight hasn't changed. Wait, perhaps the gas that entered tube 2 didn't contain CO2. Hmm, that complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe the gas after tube 1 doesn't have CO2, so the tube 2 doesn't react. But then, what's the composition of the gas after tube 1?

Wait, maybe the initial gases include H2O, CO2, and CO, but then after tube 1, the H2O is removed, leaving CO2 and CO. Then, in tube 2, CO2 is removed, leaving CO. Then, in tube 3, CO is reacted, leaving nothing? But the problem says gas C remains, which is 0.1 moles. So perhaps gas C is something else, like NH3, which doesn't react with any of the setup.

Wait, but NH3 is a gas and would pass through all the tubes without being absorbed. But let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial gases are H2O, CO2, and NH3. Then, tube 1 removes H2O (3.60g), tube 2 removes CO2 (but the weight didn't change, maybe because the CO2 was 0 moles? Or because the setup doesn't measure it properly). Then, NH3 passes through all, but then in tube 3, nothing happens. But the remaining gas is NH3, which is 0.1 moles. But why would tube 3 not react with NH3? Because NH3 is a weak base, but the copper is hot. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the initial gases are H2O, CO, and another gas, say, NH3. Let me think.

Wait, let's try to write down all the possible gases and their reactions.

Assume that the initial decomposition produces H2O, CO2, and CO. Let me go through each step.

- Tube 1 absorbs H2O, which is 3.60g (0.2mol).
- The remaining gases are CO2 and CO.
- Tube 2: if CO2 is present, it would react with Ca(OH)2, which is in solution.
