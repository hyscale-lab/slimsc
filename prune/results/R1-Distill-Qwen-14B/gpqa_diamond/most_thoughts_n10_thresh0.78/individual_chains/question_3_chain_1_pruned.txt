Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. It's about finding the expectation value of an operator for a spin-half particle. Alright, I remember that expectation values are like the average outcome you'd expect from many measurements. 

The particle is in a superposition state: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh wait, I should check if that's normalized. Let me square the coefficients and add them. 0.5 squared is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4, which is 0.75. Adding 0.25 and 0.75 gives me 1, so yes, it's normalized. Good, that makes sense.

The operator given is 10σz +5σx. I think σz and σx are the Pauli matrices. The expectation value of an operator is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator and |ψ⟩ is the state vector.

I can split this into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. So I need to find the expectation values of σz and σx separately.

First, σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value of σz should be easy. The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is the probability of measuring +1 times +1 plus the probability of -1 times -1. Let me see, the state is 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. So the coefficients are c_up = 0.5 and c_down = sqrt(3)/2.

The expectation value for σz is (c_up)^2 * (+1) + (c_down)^2 * (-1). Let me calculate that. (0.5)^2 is 0.25, multiplied by +1 gives 0.25. (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4, multiplied by -1 gives -0.75. Adding them gives 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Now for σx. Oh wait, σx is a bit trickier because it's not diagonal in the σz basis. The Pauli matrices are:

σz = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

σx = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]

So to find ⟨σx⟩, I need to compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩. Let me write the state |ψ⟩ as a column vector. 

|↑⟩ is [1; 0], |↓⟩ is [0; 1]. So |ψ⟩ is 0.5 [1; 0] + (sqrt(3)/2)[0; 1] → [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

Multiply by σx: σx |ψ⟩ = [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]. 

Then, ⟨ψ| is the conjugate transpose, but since the coefficients are real, it's [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So the inner product is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] · [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5] = 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5.

Calculating that: 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 is sqrt(3)/4, and same for the other term. So adding them gives sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660... So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, but wait a second. Alternatively, another way to compute expectation value is (probability of +1 in σx measurement - probability of -1 in σx measurement). But since σx has eigenvalues +1 and -1, the expectation is sum of probabilities times eigenvalues.

But wait, actually, for spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of σx can also be found using the components. Alternatively, maybe I can find the expectation value using the state's components. Let me think. The state is a linear combination of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. But σx is the Pauli x matrix, which swaps the |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ states, and introduces a phase in some cases. Wait, in the σx eigenbasis, the states are |+x⟩ and |−x⟩, which are (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)/sqrt(2) and (|↑⟩ - |↓⟩)/sqrt(2), respectively. Since our state is a combination of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value directly.

But the method I did earlier gave me sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866. Hmm. Let me double-check that calculation.

So ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2) multiplied by σx multiplied by (0.5, sqrt(3)/2)^T. Wait no, I
