Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit unsure where to start, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem states that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition, specifically 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of the σz operator. The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. Hmm, okay, expectation values. I remember that for an operator, the expectation value is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator and |ψ⟩ is the state.

So the operator here is 10σz +5σx. I think I can compute the expectation value by splitting it into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ plus 5⟨σx⟩. That should simplify things because expectation values are linear.

First, I need to find the expectation value of σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, maybe this will be easier. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. So, the expectation value of σz would be the probability of being in |↑⟩ times +1 plus the probability of being in |↓⟩ times -1.

Wait, the state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. Let me square the coefficients to get the probabilities. The coefficient for |↑⟩ is 0.5, so (0.5)^2 is 0.25. For |↓⟩, it's (√3/2), so squared is (3/4) which is 0.75. So the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Got that.

Now, the 10σz part contributes 10 * (-0.5) = -5 to the expectation value.

Next, I need to find ⟨σx⟩. Oh, σx is the Pauli x matrix. Its eigenstates are different, though. I remember that σx has eigenstates that are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Alternatively, maybe I should compute ⟨σx⟩ directly using the state given.

The Pauli matrices are:

σx = [[0, 1],
       [1, 0]]

Wait, but when you apply σx to |↑⟩, I think it becomes |↓⟩ and vice versa. Let me think. Oh right, σx |↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σx |↓⟩ = |↑⟩.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value using the state vector. The state is a column vector, right? Let me represent |↑⟩ as (1,0) and |↓⟩ as (0,1). So the state |ψ⟩ is [0.5, (√3)/2]^T.

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩. Let me compute that.

So, let's compute σx |ψ⟩. σx is a 2x2 matrix with 0s on the diagonal and 1s off. So,

σx |ψ⟩ = σx * [0.5; (√3)/2] = [ (√3)/2 , 0.5 ]^T. Because the first element is 0*0.5 +1*(√3/2) = (√3/2), and the second is 1*0.5 +0*(√3/2) = 0.5.

Then, ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is the inner product of [0.5, (√3)/2] with [ (√3)/2 , 0.5 ].

So, that's (0.5)(√3/2) + ( (√3)/2 )(0.5 ) = (√3/4) + (√3/4) = √3/2.

Wait, √3 is approximately 1.732. So √3/2 is about 0.866.

So ⟨σx⟩ is approximately
