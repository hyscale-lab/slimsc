Okay, so I have this physics problem about particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that for a particle in a 1D infinite well, the energy levels are quantized. Oh right, the formula is E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), which is given as E multiplied by n squared, since E is defined as π²ħ²/(2mL²). So E_n = n² E.

Wait, the problem says there are four identical spin-1/2 particles. Since they're spin-1/2, I think they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So each quantum state can hold only one electron, right? But wait, in a 1D well, the quantum numbers are just n, the principal quantum number. So each state is determined by n, and each n can have multiple particles if the spin allows.

Wait, no. Because in a 1D well, the quantum state is just n, and spin doesn't come into play for the spatial part. So for each n, there are two possible spin states: up and down. So each n can hold two particles, since spin-1/2 allows for two electrons with opposite spins in the same spatial state.

So the four particles must fill up the lowest energy levels with as few energy levels as possible, considering the Pauli exclusion.

Let me think about how the particles fill the states.

The ground state would be the lowest energy, so each particle will occupy the lowest possible available states.

The first energy level is n=1, which can hold two particles (since spin up and down
