Okay, so I have this question about cosmology and redshifts. Hmm, let me think. The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.

Wait, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. But wait, no, in this case, it's absorption, right? So if the hydrogen is neutral, it absorbs the light at the Lyman alpha wavelength. So the quasar emits light, and when that light passes through a neutral hydrogen cloud, the hydrogen absorbs it at 1216 Angstroms. But that's in the rest frame of the hydrogen. What about from our perspective?

Redshift comes into play here. The observed wavelength would be longer if the cloud is moving away (redshifted). So the quasar's emitted light at Lyman alpha would be observed at a longer wavelength. But wait, the question is about when the absorption happens. So when the quasar's light passes through the hydrogen cloud, the cloud imprints an absorption line at its own rest frame Lyman alpha wavelength. But from our perspective, since the cloud is moving (due to the expansion of the universe), the observed wavelength would be longer.

So the observed wavelength lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + z). Here, lambda_emit is 1216 Angstroms.

But wait, ground-based optical telescopes can't observe wavelengths beyond about 1 micrometer, right? Or wait, no, optical telescopes cover from about 400 nm (violet) to around 700 nm (red). Wait, 1 micrometer is 10,000 Angstroms, which is infrared, so optical is up to about 700 nm, which is 7000 Angstroms.

So the observed wavelength must be within the optical range for the ground-based telescope to detect it. So lambda_obs must be less than or equal to 7000 Angstroms, because beyond that, it's infrared
