Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question involves two reactions using mCPBA on different alkenes. Then, combining the products and running them on HPLC columns—both standard and chiral. The goal is to determine how many peaks each chromatogram would show.

First, let me recap what mCPBA does. I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. Peracids are commonly used in epoxidation reactions. So when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. Oh wait, but wait—epoxidation can also lead to some stereochemistry depending on the starting material.

Reaction 1 uses (E)-oct-4-ene. Reaction 2 uses (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with one equivalent of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. So I need to think about what each reaction produces.

Epoxidation with mCPBA typically proceeds via an electrocyclic mechanism. For alkenes, the mechanism is such that the epoxide forms with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene because the peracid adds across the double bond in a concerted manner. Wait, no, actually, the formation of the epoxide would lead to a trans addition because the peracid adds across the double bond in a way that the oxygen atoms end up on opposite sides. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up some concepts here.

Wait, no. The epoxidation reaction adds an oxygen across the double bond, forming an epoxide. The stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's geometry. For an E-alkene, when it becomes an epoxide, the substituents on each carbon of the epoxide will be on opposite sides because the addition is trans. Similarly for a Z-alkene, the substituents end up on the same side in the epoxide? Wait, no—wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe for each alkene, the mCPBA adds in such a way that the configuration of the epoxide corresponds to the starting alkene's geometry. Oh wait, I think the addition is such that the epoxide's stereochemistry depends on the starting alkene's configuration. Let me think about it.

Wait, I think that when you epoxidize an E-alkene, the resulting epoxide will have a trans configuration. But wait, no. Let me get this straight. For example, take (E)-but-2-ene. Adding mCPBA would form an epoxide where the two new oxygen-bearing groups are on opposite faces. So the configuration of the epoxide would be trans, but wait, how does that relate to the starting alkene's E or Z configuration?

Wait, perhaps the epoxidation of an E-alkene leads to a trans epoxide, and a Z-alkene leads to a cis epoxide. Or is it the other way around? Hmm, maybe I should draw it out.

Wait, another approach. Let's consider
