Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I remember that when atoms are in a star's photosphere, their excitation levels relate to the temperature of the star. Oh right, this is about Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which means the gas behaves according to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I need to find the correct equation relating their temperatures T1 and T2.

Wait, the excitation levels are about the population of energy states. The Boltzmann equation comes into play here. The population ratio between two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, I think the energy difference is E2 - E1 = 1.38e-23 J. Let me denote the energy difference as ΔE = E2 - E1. So the ratio for star 1 is n1/(n_ground) = something, and for star 2 it's n2/(n_ground).

Wait wait, the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So the excitation level (n_upper/n_lower) ratio is higher for star_1. Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 and star_2 as R2. So R1 = 2 * R2.

But wait, the question says "twice as excited", which I think refers to the population in the excited state compared to the ground state. So R1 = (n_upper)/(n_lower) = 2 * R2. Alternatively, maybe the ratio is the population in the specific level compared to another, so maybe R1 = 2 R2.

But to proceed, the main point is that the excitation ratio depends on temperature. So using the Boltzmann equation:

n_upper/n_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( - ΔE/(k
