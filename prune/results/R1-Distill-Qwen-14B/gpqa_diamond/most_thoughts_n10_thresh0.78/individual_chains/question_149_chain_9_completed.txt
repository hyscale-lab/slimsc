Okay, so I have this NMR and LC-MS question here. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum looks mostly correct except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling, so maybe it's not due to neighboring protons.

Then looking at the LC-MS, the crude compound shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. So both have the same m/z, which suggests they're the same mass. But why would there be two peaks?

Hmm, what's the possible issue here. Let's think about the options provided.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If it's a precursor, the mass would be higher than the expected product, right? Because a precursor would have more mass, maybe from an un-cleaved starting material. But the question says both peaks have the same mass as expected, so this might not fit.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular weight, so the mass spectrum would match. But in NMR, if the compound is a racemic mixture, wouldn't the NMR show a singlet if the protons are in a symmetric environment? Wait, but in the NMR, the alpha-proton is showing two peaks. Enantiomers would have identical NMR spectra because they're mirror images. So if the compound is a racemic mixture, the NMR should look normal, not have two peaks. Unless... could it be that the alpha-proton is chiral and in each enantiomer, the chemical shift is slightly different? But wait, in an achiral environment, if the molecule is a racemic mix, the peaks would overlap. Oh, but if the molecule is resolved into enantiomers, then each would have their own peak in the chromatogram. But in the NMR, if you have a racemic mix, the signals would average and you wouldn't see two peaks for the same proton. So maybe this isn't the issue.

Option C: Double coupling during amide bond formation. I'm not exactly sure what that means. Double coupling usually refers to a situation where a proton is coupled to two different sets of equivalent protons. Like maybe in a situation where a proton has two different coupling partners, leading to more splitting. But in this case, the integrals add up to 1H, so maybe it's a case of a double bond or something else. Wait, but the question says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So perhaps double coupling isn't the reason.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they'd have different NMR spectra. In the NMR, each isomer would have their own set of peaks. But wait, the question says the two peaks for the same alpha-proton are present. So perhaps in each diastereomer, the alpha-proton has a slightly different chemical shift. Let me think. If the compound has a stereocenter elsewhere, affecting the alpha-proton's environment. So in each diastereomer, the alpha proton's environment is different, so their shifts are different. But why would they have equal integrals? Because each diastereomer is present in equal amounts. So each contributes their own peak, adding up in the integral. But wait, the total is 1H, so each must be 0.5H. That would make sense. 

But then in the LC-MS, if the two diastereomers have the same mass, which they do since diastereomers have the same molecular weight. But how? Wait, no, diastereomers have same molecular weight but different physical properties. So the LC-MS would show two peaks of the same mass, which matches the question. 

But wait, another thought: the crude compound has two peaks in LC-MS, same mass, same intensity. So same molecular formula. So maybe it's a diastereomeric mixture. Or maybe it's a racemic mix, but wait, enantiomers wouldn't split the NMR into two separate peaks for the same proton. Hmm.

So in the NMR, the two peaks are for the same proton in each isomer. So in each diastereomer, the alpha-proton is in a slightly different environment, giving a different shift. So the NMR would show two peaks. Since the diastereomers are present in equal amounts, the integral would be 1H in total. 

Wait, but if it's a racemic mixture, the NMR would not show two separate peaks for the same proton. Because each enantiomer has the same environment for that proton, so the shifts would be the same, leading to a single peak. But if it's diastereomers, the environment is different, so the shifts are different. So NMR would show two peaks. So this aligns with the observation.

So the possible answer is D: mixture of diastereoisomers.

Another thought: Could it be a result of isotopic peaks? No, because isotopic peaks would be much smaller in integral and appear as a cluster, not two separate peaks.

Alternatively, maybe the crude product has some by-products, but the question states that LC-MS shows the same mass as expected, so it's not impurities.

So putting it together, the most likely explanation is that the compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers. So option D is the correct answer.


The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts, equal integrals (totaling 1H), and a coupling pattern that rules out spin-spin coupling. The LC-MS analysis of the crude compound reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, consistent with the expected molecule. The goal is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

### Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: The compound is contaminated with a precursor**  
   A precursor would have a higher molecular weight than the expected product. However, the LC-MS data indicates that both peaks have the same mass as the expected compound, ruling out contamination with a precursor.  

2. **Option B: The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**  
   Enantiomers have identical molecular weights and would produce the same mass spectrum. In an NMR spectrum, a racemic mixture of enantiomers would not result in two separate peaks for the same proton, as the environments for that proton would be identical in both enantiomers. Therefore, this explanation does not align with the observed NMR data.  

3. **Option C: 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction**  
   Double coupling refers to a proton being coupled to two different sets of protons. However, the question explicitly states that the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as an explanation. Additionally, double coupling would not explain the presence of two distinct peaks with equal integrals in the LC-MS spectrum.  

4. **Option D: The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**  
   Diastereoisomers have the same molecular weight but different physical and chemical properties. In the LC-MS spectrum, the two peaks with the same mass are consistent with the presence of diastereoisomers. In the NMR spectrum, the two peaks for the same alpha-proton arise because the environments of the alpha-proton differ slightly in each diastereomer, leading to distinct chemical shifts. The equal integrals (totaling 1H) suggest that the two diastereoisomers are present in equal amounts. This explanation aligns with both the NMR and LC-MS data.

### Conclusion:  
The most likely explanation for the observations is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.

Answer: D
