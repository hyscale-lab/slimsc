Okay, so I've got this question about meiosis and genetic syndromes. Hmm, let me try to think this through. The question is about Klinefelter's syndrome and why its phenotypic consequences are less severe compared to Down's syndrome.

Wait, I remember that Klinefelter's is when a boy has an extra X chromosome, so his karyotype is XXY. Down's is when there's an extra chromosome 21, so trisomy 21. Both are due to errors in meiosis, right?

The question is about why Klinefelter's has less severe effects. So what's the difference in how these conditions affect the body?

I think Down's syndrome is caused by trisomy of an entire chromosome, which leads to a lot of issues because every cell has an extra chromosome 21. That affects many genes and leads to significant developmental problems. But Klinefelter's is from an extra X. Wait, but X is a sex chromosome, and males usually have XY. So having an extra X might not express as many problems because, in males, the X is usually inactivated. Oh, right, like in females with Turner's syndrome, they have only one X, but Klinefelter's is the opposite.

Wait, but how does that relate to the molecular mechanisms? The question is about why the phenotypic consequences are less prominent. So maybe it's because the extra X can be inactivated, similar to how X inactivation happens in
