Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = 1/2 m ω² r², which I know is the form for a harmonic oscillator. The force here obeys Hooke's law, so the potential is like a 3D version of a spring.

The question has two parts: finding the energy of the third excited state and determining how many linearly independent eigenfunctions have the same energy eigenvalue.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum harmonic oscillators, the energy levels are quantized. Since it's three-dimensional and isotropic, the energy levels depend on the quantum numbers in each direction. Wait, but in the 3D isotropic case, it's usually treated as a sum of three 1D oscillators. So the total energy would be the sum of energies in each direction.

In 1D, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n + 1/2) ħω, where n is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...). So for three dimensions, the total energy should be E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Alternatively, I've heard this expressed in terms of the principal quantum number N, where N = n_x + n_y + n_z. Then E = (N + 3/2) ħω.

So the energy depends on N, which is the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Now, the states with the same N have the same energy and form a degenerate level. The degeneracy here is the number of different ways to write N as the sum of three non-negative integers n_x, n_y, n_z.

Wait, the question is about the third excited state. Wait, wait. The ground state is the lowest energy, which would be N=0. The first excited state would be N=1, second would be N=2, third excited would be N=3. So the third excited state corresponds to N=3.

Thus, the energy should be E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. Looking at the options, that's option A and C, which have (9/2)ħω.

Now, the second part: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue? That is, the degeneracy of the level. The degeneracy is the number of distinct ways to get N=3.

So how many non-negative integer solutions are there to the equation n_x + n_y + n_z = 3? I think this is a combinatorial problem, specifically the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation a + b + c = N, which is (N+2 choose 2). For N=3, that would be (3+2 choose 2) = 5 choose 2 = 10. Wait, that's right. So the degeneracy is 10.

So the energy is (9/2)ħω and the degeneracy is 10. Now looking at the options, option A says (9/2)ħω and 10. Option C has the same energy but 3, which can't be right.

Wait, wait, but wait a second. I'm thinking about the order of excited states. Let me double-check. The ground state is N=0, which is the lowest. The first excited state is the next possible, which would be the smallest N higher than 0. The possible N after 0 are 1, 2, 3, etc. So the third excited state would indeed be N=3.

Wait, let me think again. Ground state is the zeroth excited state, right? So the ground state is N=0, first excited N=1, second excited N=2, third excited N=3. So yes, yes. So energy is (3 + 3/2) ħω. So that's 9/2 ħω. So the energy part is correct.

Now, the degeneracy: number of states for N=3. As I thought, the number is (3 + 2 choose 2) = 10. So option A must be the correct answer because it has 10 eigenfunctions. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: (9/2)ħω, 10. That's correct.

Other options: option C has energy correct but degeneracy 3, which doesn't fit. The other two options have different energies, so I can ignore them.

So the correct answer should be option A.


The problem involves a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, where the potential is given by \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \). The energy levels in such a system are determined by the quantum numbers \( n_x, n_y, n_z \), which correspond to the radial directions in the three-dimensional space. The total energy is given by:

\[
E = \left(N + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega,
\]

where \( N = n_x + n_y + n_z \) is the principal quantum number. The degeneracy of each energy level corresponds to the number of ways \( N \) can be expressed as the sum of three non-negative integers \( n_x, n_y, n_z \), which is given by the combinatorial formula:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{N + 2}{2}.
\]

The question asks for the energy of the third excited state and the degeneracy of that state. The ground state corresponds to \( N = 0 \), the first excited state to \( N = 1 \), the second excited state to \( N = 2 \), and the third excited state to \( N = 3 \). Substituting \( N = 3 \) into the energy formula:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

The degeneracy for \( N = 3 \) is calculated as:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{3 + 2}{2} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \), and the degeneracy is 10. Among the given options, only option A matches these values.

Answer: A
