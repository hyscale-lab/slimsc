Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting from compound A and ending with compound E. I need to identify what E is based on the given reactions and the options provided. Also, there are some hints, so I should definitely consider those.

Let me break down the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints given are:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, while E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

Hmm, okay. Let's think about each step and what each reaction implies.

Starting with the first reaction: A + HCN → B. HCN is a nucleophile and typically adds to carbonyl groups. So, A likely has a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde). The reaction could be a nucleophilic addition, forming a cyanohydrin. But wait, HCN can also undergo other reactions. Alternatively, if A is a nitrile, but no, because HCN adding to a nitrile wouldn't make sense. So more likely, A is a carbonyl compound.

Second, compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd. That suggests a hydrogenation reaction. If B has a triple bond, maybe from a nitrile or another unsaturated group, the reduction would form a single bond. Alternatively, if B has a carbonyl group, the Pd/H2 would reduce it. Wait, but if A is a ketone, adding HCN would form a cyanohydrin (which has an -OH and a -CN group adjacent). Then, when B is hydrogenated, perhaps the double bond is reduced. Wait, let me think—maybe B is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone? Or perhaps a nitrile?

Wait, maybe the initial step isn't a cyanohydrin. Let me think again. Another possibility is that A is an aldehyde. HCN adds to aldehydes to form cyanohydrins, which are geminal diols (with OH and CN on the same carbon). Alternatively, perhaps A is a ketone. Let's say A is a cyclohexanone or something similar. Then HCN would add to form a cyanohydrin. But then, what's the next step?

Moving to the second reaction: B is hydrogenated. For example, if B has a C≡N group, hydrogenation would reduce it to CH2NH2, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, if B has a double bond, hydrogenation would add H2 across it. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the first step isn't adding HCN to a carbonyl. Another possibility is that A is a nitrile, but HCN adds where? Maybe that's not right. Alternatively, maybe A is an ester, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at hint a: A reacts with a phosphorous ylide to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting a ylide with a carbonyl group. So, this suggests that A has a carbonyl group, and the Wittig reaction forms an alkene.

So, when
