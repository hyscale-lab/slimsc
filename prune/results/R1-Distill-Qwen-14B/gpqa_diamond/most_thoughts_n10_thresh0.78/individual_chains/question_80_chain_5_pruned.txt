Okay, so I've got this question here about an algorithm that transforms DNA sequences into numbers. Hmm, let's see. The examples given are AGG -> 115 and TGCTGA -> 176. I need to figure out what the value is for the sequence ACAGTGACC. The options are A) 315, B) 185, C) 333, D) 351. 

Wait, how do I approach this? I remember that DNA sequences are made up of nucleotides: A, T, C, G. Maybe the algorithm is converting each nucleotide to a number and then summing them up or doing something else. 

Let me look at the first example: AGG -> 115. There are three nucleotides here. Let's break it down. AGG has A, G, G. If each letter corresponds to a number, what numbers would they be? A is 1, T is 2, C is 3, G is 4, maybe? Wait, that might not fit because if A is 1, G is 4, then AGG would be 1 +4 +4 =9. But the output is 115, which is way bigger. So that can't be it.

Alternatively, perhaps each nucleotide is represented by a two-digit number. Like A=10, T=20, C=30, G=40. Let's test that. AGG would be 10 +40 +40 =90, which is still not 115. Hmm.

Wait, another idea: maybe each base is mapped to a single digit, but perhaps it's their position in the sequence multiplied by their value. Or perhaps it's the sum of each base's value times its position. Let me think. 

Wait, wait, another possibility: each nucleotide is converted to a number using a different base. Like, perhaps A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4, but then the number is formed as a base-5 number. Oh, wait, but that might not add up. Let's see the first example: AGG is A (1), G (4), G (4). So in base 5, that would be 1*5^2 +4*5^1 +4*5^0 = 25
