Okay, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the hydrogen atom. So the question is about the decay of a certain state and the transition probabilities.

First, the state given is |3,0,0⟩. I remember that in hydrogen atom notation, the states are given as |n, l, m⟩. So n is the principal quantum number, l is the azimuthal (or angular momentum) and m is the magnetic quantum number.

The state |3,0,0⟩ is decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. So, the decay process isn't direct; it goes through an intermediate state. I need to figure out what that intermediate state is and the probability of each step.

Dipole transitions are governed by selection rules. For electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are:
- Δl = ±1 (change in angular momentum)
- Δm = 0, ±1 (change in magnetic quantum number)
- Δn can be any integer except zero, but in practice, transitions are usually between adjacent or nearby n levels.

So starting from |3,0,0⟩, the initial state has n=3, l=0 (s orbital), m=0. The first transition would have to change l by ±1. Since l starts at 0, it can only increase by 1, so l becomes 1 in the intermediate state. So the intermediate state must have l=1.

So the possible intermediate states would have n=2 or n=4 perhaps, but since we're going to n=1 in two steps, probably n=2. So n decreases from 3 to 2 in the first transition. Wait, but the second transition goes from n=2 to n=1, right? Hmm, let's think.

Wait, first transition: 3 → something, then that something → 1. The possible intermediate states after the first transition would have n=2 because you can't go from 3 to 1 in a single dipole transition (since Δn can't be more than 1 in dipole, I think). Or wait, is that correct? Wait, the selection rule for n is that it can change by any amount as long as it's not zero, but wait no—I think I might be mixing this up. Wait, in the selection rules for electric dipole, the change in n can be ±1, ±2, etc., but in reality, for hydrogen, the allowed transitions are where l changes by ±1, so n can change accordingly, but the probability for larger changes is lower. But in this case, since it's a two-step process, each step is a dipole transition.

So the first transition is from n=3, l=0 → n=2, l=1, because l must change by +1. And then the second transition goes from n=2, l=1 → n=1, l=0 because l can decrease by 1.

So the intermediate state is |2,1,m⟩. Now, what are the possible m values for the intermediate state?

In the first transition, the initial m is 0. The selection rule for m allows m to change by 0, +1, or -1. So for the first step, m could go to -1, 0, or +1. But the initial state is m=0, so possible m in the intermediate state are m= -1, 0, +1.

Then, for the second transition, the m in the intermediate state must lead to m=0 in the final state. So the second transition's Δm must bring m from whatever it was in the intermediate state to 0. So for example, if in the intermediate state m is 1, then in the second step, it must change by -1. If m is 0, then it can stay the same. If m is -1, it must change by +1.

But wait, each transition is a dipole, so each transition must obey the Δm rules. Let's see.

So possible intermediate states are |2,1, -1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1,1⟩.

Then, let's look at each option.

Option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3.

Option B: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4.

Option C: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4.

Option D: It seems D's text is cut off. Oh, looking again, option D says "⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 2/3". Wait, maybe the initial state is |3,0,
