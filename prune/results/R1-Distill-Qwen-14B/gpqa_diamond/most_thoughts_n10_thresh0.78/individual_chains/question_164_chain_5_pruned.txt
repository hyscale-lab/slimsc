Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. I remember that binary stars orbit a common center of mass, and when they eclipse each other, we can use that to determine some of their properties.

The question says there are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, system_1 has a period of 2 years, and system_2 is 1 year. Right.

Then, they mention spectroscopic observations giving radial velocity (RV) variations. In system_1, the stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. Oh, wait, so each star's velocity varies sinusoidally, right? So that means the bigger star would have a smaller velocity, since it's more massive and orbits more slowly. Or wait, no, the less massive star would have a higher velocity because it's moving faster around the center of mass.

Similarly, in system_2, the RV amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. So again, the more massive star would have a smaller velocity.

The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. So, the mass ratio or mass sum? Wait, the problem says to consider the mass of a system as the sum of the two stars. So, I need to find the total mass of each system and then find the ratio.

Wait, how
