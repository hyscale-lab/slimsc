Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully and break it down.

Okay, the question involves a series of reactions starting with trans-cinnamaldehyde. The reactions are:

1. Treatment with methylmagnesium bromide to form product 1.
2. Product 1 is treated with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) to form product 2.
3. Product 3 is treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-16-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO at elevated temperature to form product 3.

Wait, no, the third step says product 3 is treated, but the product is also called product 3. I think that's a typo and they probably meant product 2 is treated to form product 3. Or maybe it's a step beyond, but the question is about product 3. Let me clarify that.

The question is, how many carbon atoms are in product 3? The options are A)14, B)10, C)12, D)11.

First, I need to figure out each reaction step and how the structure changes each time. Let's start with trans-cinnamaldehyde.

Trans-cinnamaldehyde is an aldehyde with a double bond. The structure is CH₂=CH–C(O)H. Wait, no, wait. Cinnamaldehyde is the aldehyde form of cinnamic acid. So, structure is Ph–CH₂–C(O)H? No, wait. No, cinnamaldehyde is Ph–CH₂–CHO? No, wait. No: cinnamic acid is Ph–CH₂–COOH, and cinnamaldehyde would be the aldehyde version, so Ph–CH₂–CHO? Wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, cinnamaldehyde is the aldehyde. Its structure is benzaldehyde with a propenyl group. Wait, no, no. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is actually benzaldehyde with a propenyl group attached to the aldehyde. So, the structure is (E)-3-phenylprop-2-enal. So, the aldehyde group is on C2, and the double bond is between C1 and C2, with a phenyl group on C1. So, the structure is CH₂=CH–C(Ph)=O? No, wait. Wait, the aldehyde is RCHO. So, R is CH₂–CH2–Ph? No. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is (E)-3-phenylprop-2-enal. So, it's:

Ph

CH₂–CHO

No, wait. No, more accurately, it's CH₂=CH–C(Ph)–CHO? No, that can't be right. Let me correct that. The correct structure of trans-cinnamaldehyde is Ph–CH₂–CH₂–CHO? No, that would be a single bond. Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is (E)-3-phenylpropenal. So, the structure is Ph–CH₂
