Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me think through it carefully.

The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in qubit space. The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. But wait, what does this particular matrix look like?

I think the standard basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩ are like the computational basis. So, |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix with 1 in the (1,1) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has 1 in (2,2). So adding them together, each would have a 1 in their respective corners. Multiplying each by 1/2, the resulting matrix would have 0.5 in (1,1), 0.5 in (2,2), and zeros elsewhere.

Wait, density matrices have certain properties. They're Hermitian, positive semi-definite, and have trace 1. Let me check. The trace of ρ here is 0.5 + 0.5 = 1, which is correct. Also, all eigenvalues should be non-negative. Since it's a diagonal matrix with 0.5 and 0.5, that's definitely positive. So it's a valid density matrix.

Now, what's the geometrical position in qubit space? Oh, I think this refers to the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. For a pure state |ψ⟩, the Bloch vector has components (x, y, z) which correspond to the coefficients in the state's representation.

But wait, this is a density matrix, so it could represent a mixed state. If it's a pure state, the density matrix would be a projector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. Here, ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2, which is a classical mixture of the two basis states. So this is a mixed state, and on the
