Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what’s being asked.

So, the problem has two reactions, and I need to pick the right reagents from the options provided. The reactions are:

1. Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.
2. 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (in the presence of H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options for A and B are given as either H3O+, CH3COOH, NaHSO3, or HCl.

Hmm, I think I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's probably a nucleophilic substitution. Wait, but wait—NaCN is a source of CN⁻ ions. So, the first reaction is probably a substitution where the ketone acts as a leaving group. Or wait, no—wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone. So that's (CH3)2CO. Reacting with NaCN. Oh wait, no, wait—NaCN is a nucleophile. But the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure of that would be something like CH2(CO2H)(CN)CH3? Wait, no. Wait, but wait: butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So the structure is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH3? No, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so the carbonyl is on the second carbon. So it's (CH3)2C=O.

When you add NaCN, which is a cyanide nucleophile, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, the product is a nitrile and has a hydroxyl group. Hmm, wait, butan-2-one plus NaCN gives a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a substitution where the ketone is converted into an alcohol after the cyanide substitution.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case of the cyanide adding to the carbonyl, forming an addition product, which then undergoes some elimination or other reaction. Wait, but the product has both a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group. Wait, let me think about it. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Structure: The nitrile is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl and a methyl group. So it's (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Oh, no, wait: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon.

Wait, but the formula: butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the substituents are on the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2(C(OH)CH2CH3)CN? No, wait, maybe it's CH2(C(OH)CH(CH3))CN? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH(CH3))2C(OH)CN? Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me think about the reaction mechanism.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN, which is a nucleophile. When a ketone reacts with a cyanide, perhaps it's a nucleophilic addition. So the cyanide would attack the carbonyl carbon, forming an addition product. The mechanism would be: ketone + CN⁻ → addition product, which then could proton
