Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to figure it out. The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars compared to each other. Hmm, I remember that when we talk about elemental abundances in stars, we often use something called dex, which I think stands for decimal exponent. Oh right, it's like logarithmic scales.

Let me read the question again carefully. So, we have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass. But maybe the mass isn't directly relevant here since the question is about elemental abundances. 

The given data are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Wait, the notation here is [Element/Element]_star, which represents the logarithm of the ratio of their abundances relative to the Sun. For example, [Si/Fe] is log10(n_Si / n_Fe) - log10(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) = 0.3. 

The photospheric composition of the Sun is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7

Wait, what does this mean? Oh, because 12 is a base number, so subtracting 12 gives the value after the log. So for the Sun, log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5. Similarly, log10(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5.

Wait no, wait. Let me think. The way the notation works is [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X_sun/n_Y_sun). So, for the Sun, [X/Y] would be zero because n_X/n_Y is the same as the solar value. But in the problem, they are giving the Sun's composition as:

12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, log10(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5.

But wait, what's the point of this? I guess we need to find the [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] for each star, and then find the ratio of silicon in each. 

Wait, the question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and
