Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying the product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A to D, all organic compounds. 

First, I need to figure out what Compound X is based on the given IR and NMR data. Then, I'll think about the reaction conditions to determine the product.

Looking at the IR data: the peaks around 3400–2500 cm-1 usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches. But since there's no mention of amines here, maybe it's an O-H group, like a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. The peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which suggests a carbonyl group like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So, benzene rings are probably present.

Now, the 1H NMR data. Let me break it down peak by peak.

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm. That's a strong indication of an aldehyde proton. Wait, or could it be a carboxylic acid proton? Hmm, carboxylic acid protons are usually around 10-12 ppm and broad. But the presence of a carbonyl and an aromatic ring suggests maybe a substituted benzoic acid or something similar.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility is an aldehyde. But aldehyde protons are deshielded and appear around 9-10 ppm. The 10.5 seems a bit high for an aldehyde. Maybe it's an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid, but then the IR has a peak at 1720, which would fit a carboxylic acid (usually around 1700 cm-1). But wait, some sources say that the carbonyl for carboxylic acids can be a bit higher than that, maybe 1720. So that could fit.

Looking at the other peaks:

8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): This looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublets suggest coupling between two pairs of equivalent protons. So maybe a para-substituted benzene, like para-methyl or something else. Wait, the integration is 2H each, so perhaps a substituent in the para position. For example, in para-substituted benzene, like p-methyl, the protons ortho to the substituent would be as a doublet.

But wait, if there's a substituent at para, the aromatic protons would typically be as a doublet of doublets, but in the case of a substituent that is de-shielding, maybe a carbonyl group, the protons could be split into two doublets. Like in benzoic acid, the para positions would have H's that are deshielded.

Wait, another thought: the 8.0 and 7.2 ppm could be from a para-substituted benzene ring with an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl. Because benzoic acid would have the ring protons deshielded. The ortho protons to the COOH group would be around 8.0, and the meta would be lower? Or perhaps para-substituted with something else.

But wait, looking at the substituents, perhaps the aromatic ring is attached to a carbonyl group. So, maybe it's a benzene ring with a carbonyl substituent and another group.

Continuing the NMR:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet integrating to one proton. That could be a methine (CH) group adjacent to some substituents. Maybe part of a CH2CH2 group or something more complex.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): A multiplet integrating to two protons. Perhaps part of a chain, like a CH2 group next to a CH or another group.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet integrating to three protons. That's probably a methyl group attached to a CH, like a CH(CH3) group. Because the splitting suggests it's next to a CH group. For example, in isopropyl groups, the central CH is split into a triplet, but here it's a doublet, so maybe a different arrangement. Wait, wait. The 1.4 ppm is a doublet, 3H. So perhaps it's a methyl attached to a CH2 or CH. Wait, what about in a butyl group? Let me think.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating to three protons. That's typically a methyl group at the end of an ethyl chain, like CH2CH3. So that suggests maybe a longer chain with a terminal methyl.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has a benzene ring with substituents, a carbonyl group, and some alkyl chain.

Wait, let me think about the IR again. The 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, then the O-H would be broad and around 2500-3000 as well. Wait, the IR goes from 3400–2500 cm-1. So maybe that's the O-H stretch, which is broad, and the 1720 is the carbonyl.

So maybe Compound X is a benzoic acid derivative. Let's see.

Looking at the NMR, the 10.5 ppm peak would be the carboxylic acid proton. But wait, in the NMR, it's a broad singlet (bs). That matches a carboxylic acid proton.

So, the structure might be something like a para-substituted benzoic acid with an alkyl chain.

Wait, but looking at the other peaks. The 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggest a para substitution. So perhaps the benzoic acid is in position 4, and there's another substituent attached as well.

Wait, but looking at the alkyl chain parts:

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is perhaps a CH group next to another CH2 or CH. The 1.
