Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar atmospheres and elemental abundances. Hmm, I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the given data:

Star_1: Mass is 1.5 times the Sun. Its [Si/Fe] ratio is 0.3 dex. [Fe/H] is 0. So, that means the iron abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as the Sun. Wait, [Fe/H] is the logarithmic abundance ratio, right? So if it's 0, that's solar.

Star_2: Mass is 1.2 times the Sun. [Mg/Si] is 0.3 dex. [Mg/H] is 0. So magnesium relative to hydrogen is solar here.

The Sun's photosphere has:

12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So, log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5). Similarly, for Mg, log10(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5. So nMg/nH is 10^-5.

Wait, how do these relate to the stars' compositions?

I think for each star, I need to compute the abundance of silicon relative to hydrogen, and then find the ratio Star_1's Si to Star_2's Si.

Wait, but the
