Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what compound E is. Let's see, the question describes a series of reactions starting from compound A and ending at E. Plus, there are some hints provided. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, let me outline the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form B.
2. B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
3. C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
4. D loses an inert gas to form E.

And there are two hints:

Hint a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

Hint b) The IR spectrum of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, while E's is around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are four different ketones, since the IR peaks are in the range of carbonyl groups (C=O). So, E is a ketone, probably.

Wait, but let me think about each step.

Starting with reaction 1: A + HCN → B.

HCN usually adds to carbonyl groups. So if A is a ketone, adding HCN would form a cyanohydrin. Wait, no—cyanohydrin is when a ketone reacts with HCN to form a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group attached. Alternatively, maybe the carbonyl is something else.

But wait, looking at the IR peaks: A has a peak around 1750, which is typical for a ketone (maybe a bit higher if it's something like an aldehyde, but aldehydes are around 1700 but can be higher). So A is likely a ketone.

So when a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. So B would be a secondary alcohol with an adjacent cyano group, but wait, maybe it's more about the structure. Alternatively, maybe A is an ester or nitrile? No, wait, A's IR is 1750 which points towards a carbonyl, more likely a ketone or maybe an ester. But let's see.

Then, reaction 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. H2 with Pd is hydrogenation. So if B has a nitrile group (from HCN addition), then hydrogenation of nitriles would typically yield amines, but wait, no. Wait, HCN adds to the carbonyl to form a cyanohydrin. So B would have an -OH and a -CN group adjacent.

Wait, no, let me think again. When a ketone (A) reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. The structure would be something like (R)2C(OH)CN. So B would have a hydroxyl and a cyano
