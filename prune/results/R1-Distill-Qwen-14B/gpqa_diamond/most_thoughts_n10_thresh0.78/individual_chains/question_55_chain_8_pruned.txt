Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Hmm, let me think. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are different propenyl and butenyl acetates. I remember that the structure of these compounds affects the NMR signals, especially the splitting patterns and chemical shifts.

The given NMR data is: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz), 5.5 ppm (1H, dq), 2.1 ppm (3H, s), 1.6 ppm (3H, d).

Wait, so let's break this down. The 2.1 ppm singlet with 3H—probably the acetate group's methyl (OAc, so O-C-O and CH3). That makes sense because the methyl in acetate is usually around 2 ppm as a singlet.

The 1.6 ppm doublet with 3H—maybe a methyl group adjacent to something that splits it. Like maybe in an ethyl group or part of an allylic system. Hmm.

Then there are two signals in the aromatic region: 7.0 and 5.5. Wait, but wait, acetates are esters, so the structure is something like CH2CH2COOCH3 or similar. Wait, no, more accurately, the structure would be something like R-O-CO-O-R? No, wait, no—no, wait, acetates are R-O-CO-CH3. So the ester group is O-CO-O- attached to an R group.

Wait, actually, the structure is R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait. No, wait, I'm getting confused. Acetate is the ester where the acid is acetic acid. So the structure is R-O-CO-CH3. So R is the alkyl or alkenyl group attached to the oxygen of the ester.

Wait, the options are propenyl and butenyl acetates. So propenyl is CH2CH2CH2? No, wait. Wait, propenyl would be CH2CH2CH3 with a double bond, right? Like, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- but wait, no—actually, propenyl would be CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond somewhere. Hmm, maybe it's CH2=CHCH2OAc or CH2CH=
