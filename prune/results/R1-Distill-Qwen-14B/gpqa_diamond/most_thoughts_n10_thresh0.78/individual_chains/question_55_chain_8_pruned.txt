Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my spectroscopy, but let's think this through. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are all some form of propenyl or butenyl acetates, either cis or trans.

Alright, let's break down the NMR data. The peaks are:
- 7.0 ppm, 1H, doublet (d), J=16.0 Hz
- 5.5 ppm, 1H, doublet of quadruplets (dq)
- 2.1 ppm, 3H, singlet (s)
- 1.6 ppm, 3H, doublet (d)

I remember that acetate esters typically have an ester group, which in the structure is OAc. So the compound is probably something like R-O-CO-OCH2CH3 or similar? Wait, no, acetate is the ester, so it's R-O-CO-OAc, but wait, acetate is OAc, so the structure is (R-O)COOCH3 maybe? Or wait, no, wait, acetate is the ester derived from acetic acid, so the structure is probably R-O-CO-OCH2CH3? Wait no, wait. Acetic acid is CH3COOH, so the acetate ester would be R-O-CO-OCH3. Or maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's R-O-CO-OCH2CH3. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up things.

Wait, no, the acetate ester would have the structure R-O-CO-OCH2CH3? No, wait, the general formula is R-O-CO-R', where R' is from the acid. For acetic acid, R' is CH3. So the structure would be R-O-CO-CH3. Oh wait, no, that would be the ester. So the ester group is O-CO-O, but wait, actually, the ester is formed from the acid and the alcohol. Let me think. Acetic acid is CH3COOH. When it forms an ester with, say, ethanol, it's CH3COOCH2CH3. So the ester group is O-CO-O, connected to the R group from the alcohol. So in this case, the acetate ester would have a structure like R-O-CO-OCH2CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, the ester is R-O-CO-R', where R' is from the acid. So since it's acetate, R' is CH3. So the structure would be R-O-CO-CH3? Wait, that can't be right because that would make the ester as R-O-COCH3, which is a methyl ester. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me clarify: the ester is formed from the alcohol (R-OH) and the acid (R'-COOH). The ester would be R-O-CO-R'. So for acetic acid, R' is CH3, so R-O-CO-CH3. So the ester would have an O-CO-O group, but wait, no, that's incorrect. The structure is R-O-CO-R'. So for acetate, it's R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, wait: the ester is where the -OH of the alcohol is replaced by an OR' group, where R' is from the acid. So perhaps R-O-CO-O-R', but I'm getting confused. Let me think of an example. Ethyl acetate is CH3COOCH2CH3. So the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH3. So the ester group is O connected to the carbonyl (C=O) and then the OR' group. So in this case, R is CH3 (from acetic acid) and R' is CH2CH3 (from ethanol). So in the unknown compound, the ester group would be O-CO-O connected to an R and an R' group. But wait, no, the structure is R-O-CO-R', so the ester is O-CO-O.

Wait, maybe that's not the right approach. Let's think about the NMR signals.

Looking at the signals:

The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling, which suggests a trans coupling. Also, in aromatic regions, but this is at 7.0, which could be a vinyl proton. Wait, but 7.0 could also be an aromatic proton, but wait, acetates are typically esters, so maybe the structure is an enol acetate or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an allyl or propenyl acetate.

The 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quadruplets. That's a bit more complex
