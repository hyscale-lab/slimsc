Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the emission of a particle by a bound system of two nucleons. Hmm, the question involves quantum numbers like isospin, angular momentum, spin, and parity. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The problem says the initial state is a 1S0 state for the NN system. That notation (1S0) is a bit tricky, right? I remember that the general term symbol is (2S+1)LJ. So in this case, 1S0 would mean S=0 because 2S+1=1 implies S=0. The L here is S, which is the orbital angular momentum, and J is 0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

The system emits a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. So the initial parity is that of the NN state, and the emitted particle's parity is -1. Wait, but the parity of the system before emission must be considered. The parity of the NN system in the 1S0 stateâ€”since L is 0, the parity is (-1)^L which is (-1)^0 = 1. So the initial parity is +1.

After emission, the parity will change. The parity of the final state (NN plus X) must be the product of the intrinsic parities of the NN state, the X particle, and the spatial part. Wait, or is it just the product of the intrinsic parities and the orbital angular momentum part? Hmm.

Wait, the intrinsic parity of the initial NN system? Or is the NN system in a state with their own orbital angular momentum and spin? Oh, the initial state is 1S0, so that's spin S=0 and orbital L=0, so their intrinsic parity is 1 since for two nucleons, their combined parity is (-1)^L * (parity of each nucleon). But since each nucleon has parity +1 (they are fermions, but for identical particles in the same state, their combined parity is... wait, I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should think about the parity of the emitted particle and the orbital angular momentum of the decay.

Alternatively, when a particle is emitted, the parity of the decay process is determined by the product of the intrinsic parities of the initial and final states, and the orbital angular momentum between the two systems.

Wait, the initial state is NN in 1S0, which has parity P_initial = (-1)^L * (intrinsic parity of each nucleon). Wait, each nucleon has spin 1/2, but their intrinsic parity for the two-particle system is a bit tricky. Wait, for identical particles, the parity is (-1)^L multiplied by the product of their intrinsic parities. But for two identical nucleons (like two neutrons or a proton and neutron?), the parity is (+1) for the spin part if they are in a symmetric or antisymmetric state? Wait, no, parity is a separate quantum number from spin.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me focus. The initial state is 1S0, which is L=0, S=0. The parity of this state is (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1. So P_initial = +1.

When the system emits a particle X, which has intrinsic parity P_X = -1. Let's denote the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X relative to the NN system as l. The parity of the emitted particle and the orbital part contribute to the overall parity.

Wait, the parity conservation in such processes is about the initial and final states. Wait, but parity isn't necessarily conserved in weak interactions, but here, I think this emission is via the strong or electromagnetic force, where parity is conserved. So the total parity before and after should be the same.

Wait, the initial parity is +1. The final state is the NN state plus the emitted particle X. The parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN state (which is T=0, so perhaps it's in a state with certain quantum numbers), the parity of X, and (-1)^l where l is the orbital angular momentum of X relative to the NN system.

Wait, no. The parity of the entire final system (NN in some state and X) would be P_final = [P_NN'] * P_X * (-1)^l, where P_NN' is the parity of the final NN state, and l is the orbital angular momentum of X relative to the NN system.

But wait, the initial parity is P_initial = P_NN_initial = +1. After emission, the final parity must equal the initial parity because parity is conserved. So:

P_initial = P_final.

So,

+1 =
