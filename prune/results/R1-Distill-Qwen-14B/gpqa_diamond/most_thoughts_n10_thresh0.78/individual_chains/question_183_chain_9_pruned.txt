Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this. But I'll give it my best shot. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. The options are A) 1, B)3, C)5, D)0.

Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated using the formula: Degree of Unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens. But since the product doesn't mention any halogens or nitrogens, I can ignore X and N.

So I need to figure out what the product looks like after this reaction. The reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me draw the structure to visualize.

The parent ring is cyclohexene, meaning it has one double bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 5. Position 2 has a formyl group (CHO), and position 5 has a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂ maybe? Or wait, vinyl is CH₂=CH- so it's a double bond attached. So the structure has a cyclohexene ring with substituents at 2 (CHO) and 5 (vinyl group), and a carboxylic acid group at position 3? Wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is at position 3, which is one of the double bond positions.

Wait, cyclohex-3-ene means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. So the ring has a double bond at 3-4. Then positions 2 and 5 have substituents.

So the starting molecule has a cyclohexene ring with a formyl group (CHO) at C2, a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂? No, wait. Vinyl is CH₂=CH- as a substituent. So the substituent at C5 is a vinyl group which has a double bond. So the substituent is CH₂=CH- attached to the cyclohexene ring.

And the carboxylic acid is at C3, as part of the ring. So the molecule is a six-membered ring. Let me count the rings and double bonds.

The cyclohexene ring has one double bond (so that's one). The vinyl substituent at C5 is another double bond (so that's two). The formyl group is a CHO, which doesn't have any double bonds; the carboxylic acid is COOH, which is a carbonyl (so another double bond, making it three). Wait, or does the carboxylic acid contribute a double bond? Yes. So in the starting molecule, the total degree of unsaturation is 3.

Wait, but wait, the formula for the degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So maybe I should calculate that for the starting molecule to confirm.

Let me count the atoms in the starting molecule. The parent is cyclohexene, which is C6H10. But wait, the substituents: 2-formyl adds a CHO, which is CHO (so replacing a H, so the formula becomes C7H9O. Wait, but then there's the carboxylic acid. Let me think again. Let's not get confused. Let's count each part.

The cyclohexene ring has 6 carbons. The substituents:

At C2: formyl group (CHO) adds 1 C and 1 O.

At C5: vinyl group (CH₂CH₂? No, vinyl is CH₂=CH-. So that's two carbons attached as a substituent, with a double bond. So that's 2 Cs and a double bond.

At C3: the carboxylic acid group is -COOH. So that's 2 O's and another double bond (the carbonyl).

So total carbons: 6 (ring) +1 (CHO) +2 (vinyl) = 9 C? Wait, the ring is 6, but the substituents may add more. Wait, the formyl is at C2, so that's a substituent on the ring, so the ring remains 6 carbons. So the substituents are:

- At C2: CHO (1 C)
- At C5: CH₂-CH₂? No, wait, vinyl is CH₂=CH- attached to the ring. Wait, vinyl group is -CH₂CH₂? No, no, the vinyl group is -CH₂-CH₂? No, no, wait. The vinyl group is the group where the substituent is attached to the ring at one end and has a double bond. So it's -CH₂-CH₂-? No, wait, no. Let me correct that. The vinyl group is CH₂=CH– attached to the ring. So the substituent is a propene group? No, wait, no. Wait, vinyl is like CH₂=CH-, so the substituent is –CH₂–CH₂– with a double bond? No, it's –CH₂–CH₂– with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So the substituent is a CH₂–CH₂ group with a double bond, so it's a double bond in the substituent.

So the substituents:

C2: CHO (1 C)

C5: CH₂=CH– (2 C)

C3: COOH (which is a carbonyl group, so that's another double bond.)

Wait, but the ring itself has a double bond (cyclohexene). So that's one. The vinyl substituent has another double bond. The formyl group has a double bond (C=O). The COOH group has a double bond (C=O). So that's four double bonds? Or wait, the COOH group is a carbonyl, so that's another double bond.

So in the starting molecule, how many double bonds are present?

1. Cyclohexene ring (1 double bond)
2. Vinyl substituent (1 double bond)
3. Formyl group (1 double bond)
4. Carboxylic acid group (1 double bond)

So four double bonds. Plus, any rings? The cyclohexene is a six-membered ring, which counts as one ring (so one double bond equivalent). Wait, no, wait. The ring is a ring structure, which is a form of unsaturation. So a ring counts as one degree of unsaturation, which is equivalent to a double bond.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as each ring or double bond contributing 1, and triple bonds contributing 2, etc.

So for the starting molecule:

- Cyclohexene has one double bond (so 1)
- The vinyl substituent has another double bond (another 1)
- The formyl group has a carbonyl (another 1)
- The carboxylic acid has a carbonyl (another 1)

So that's four double bonds. Plus the ring (the cyclohexene is a ring but with a double bond already considered). Wait, no. The cyclohexene ring is a ring and a double bond. So wait, a six-membered ring with a double bond is considered as two degrees of unsaturation: one for the ring and one for the double bond. Or wait, no. Wait, a cyclohexene has one double bond, not two. Because the ring is a single structure. So in the cyclohexene, the ring itself is one degree (since it's a six-membered ring, not a fused ring or anything), and the double bond is another. So in total, the ring contributes one, the double bond contributes one, so two.

Wait, but that's getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count the degree of unsaturation using the formula.

So let's compute the degree of unsaturation (DoU) for the starting
