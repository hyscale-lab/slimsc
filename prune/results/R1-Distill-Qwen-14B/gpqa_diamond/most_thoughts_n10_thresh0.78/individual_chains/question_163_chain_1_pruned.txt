Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let me take a deep breath and try to break it down step by step.

The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid. Hmm, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, so when it reacts with an acid, it should form a salt and water. Since the acid is monobasic and strong, I think it would donate one H+ ion, like HCl or HNO3. The reaction should look something like Fe(OH)3 + H+ → Fe^3+ + H2O.

Wait, let's get the reaction right. Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, so adding a strong acid will neutralize it. The reaction should produce Fe^3+ ions and water. So the balanced equation would be Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. Oh, right, because each OH- needs an H+ to become water. So each Fe(OH)3 molecule has three OH- groups, so three H+ are needed.

Now, the problem gives me 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. I need to find out how many moles that is. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3... Let's calculate. Iron (Fe) has an atomic mass of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen (O) is 16, and Hydrogen (H) is 1.008. So for each Fe(OH)3 molecule: 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1.008) = 55.85 + 3*(17.008) → 55.85 + 51.024 = 106.874 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 mol. Let me double-check that calculation. 0.1 divided by 106.874... Hmm, approximately 0.0009357 moles.

Each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ because of the reaction I wrote earlier. So the moles of H+ needed are 3 * 0.0009357 ≈ 0.002807 mol.

The acid solution is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 mol per liter. Since volume is in cm³, and 1 liter is 1000 cm³, the concentration is 0.1 mol/dm³ or 0.1 mol/L.

We need to find the volume of this acid that contains 0.002807 moles of H+. Using the formula: moles = concentration × volume (in liters). So volume = moles / concentration.

So volume = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L. Converting that to cm³ (since 1 L = 1000 cm³), that's 28.07 cm³. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³, which is very close. So that's the minimum volume needed for the acid.

But wait, the problem mentions a total volume of 100 cm³. Oh, right, the solution's total volume is 100 cm³, which is 0.1 L. So when I add the acid, the total volume is fixed at 100 cm³. Wait, no, the total volume after adding the acid? Or is it that the solution's volume including the acid and the Fe(OH)3 is 100 cm³? Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.

Wait, the question says "dissolve (at 25°C) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume." So the solution after dissolving has a total volume of 100 cm³. But when adding the acid, the acid's volume is added to the solution. Wait, no, that's not necessarily correct because sometimes when you mix solutions, the volumes can change, but in dilute cases, you can approximate the total volume as the sum. But here, maybe it's better to proceed with the calculation as is.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The question asks for the minimum volume of the acid needed to prepare the solution, which has a total volume of 100 cm³. So when you add the acid, it's part of the 100 cm³. Or wait, no. The 100 cm³ is the total volume of the resulting solution, which includes the Fe(OH)3 and the acid solution.

Alternatively, perhaps the Fe(OH)3 is being dissolved in the acid such that the total volume is 100 cm³. So the volume of acid added plus the volume of the Fe(OH)3 solution (if any) equals 100 cm³. Wait, but the problem says "100 cm3 total volume." Maybe the volume of
