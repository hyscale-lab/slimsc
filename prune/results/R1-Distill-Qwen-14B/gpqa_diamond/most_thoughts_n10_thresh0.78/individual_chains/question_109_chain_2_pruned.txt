Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and partial waves. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. Alright, the question is about a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. I remember that Pauli statistics require certain conditions on the quantum numbers of the final state.

The problem states that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Oh wait, T is the isospin, S is the spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum. So if the final NN state has T=0, I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed based on conservation of angular momentum and parity.

The initial state is 1S0. Breaking that down: the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0 would mean S=0 (since 2*0+1=1), L is the spectroscopic notationâ€”S is 0, so L=0. J is 0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

The system emits particle X. So the final state NN must have some quantum numbers. The initial state's parity is based on the product of the intrinsic parity of the nucleons and the orbital angular momentum. But wait, I'm not sure about this part. Oh right, the parity for a two-body system is (-1)^L multiplied by the product of their intrinsic parities. Wait, but each nucleon is a fermion, so each has intrinsic parity -1. So the product is (-1)*(-1)= +1. So the parity is (-1)^L_initial. Since initial L is 0, parity is +1.

But the emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of the final state (after emission) must be considered. Wait, the parity is conserved? Or is it that the parity of the entire system (initial and emitted) must be conserved? Hmm, in strong interactions, parity is conserved, but wait, particle emission could involve some parity considerations.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the conservation of parity. The initial parity is +1. The emitted particle X has parity -1. So the parity of the final state (NN and X) must be the same as the initial, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, when considering the decay, the parity of the NN state and the X's parity combine in a certain way.

Wait, but parity is a multiplicative quantum number. So the initial state's parity is P_initial = P_NN_initial * P_X_initial. Wait no, that's not right. The initial state is just the NN system, so the emitted X is a new particle. Hmm, perhaps the parity of the decay process should be considered: the parity of the initial state equals the parity of the final state. So P_initial = P_final.

The initial state of the NN system has parity P_initial = (-1)^L_initial * (intrinsic parities product). As I thought earlier, L_initial is 0, so
