Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read through it carefully and break it down step by step.

So, the question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. A precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K, which I think is around 4 degrees Celsius because 273 K is 0°C, so 277 K is about 4°C. I remember that water freezes at 273 K, so this B might be something that's solid at just above that, maybe ice? Or perhaps something else.

The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. So, perhaps when a keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. I'm not exactly sure what that implies yet, but maybe it's an ester or something else.

Substance X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So, X has an isotope that's heavier than the usual. Also, X and its analogs are used as reagents in organic chemistry. That makes me think of something like a strong base or a reagent that's used in reactions like saponification or maybe in Grignard reactions. Wait, Grignard reagents are organometallic, like Mg-based. But they're used with haloalkanes, maybe? Or perhaps X is something like a hydroxide or oxide.

Wait, another thought: if X is reacting violently with a liquid Y, what liquids react violently? Maybe liquid Y is water. Because metals like sodium or potassium react violently with water. So if X is a metal, then perhaps it's sodium or potassium. But wait, the product gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let me think about that.

If W's molecule has equal neutrons and protons per molecule, maybe it's a molecule like H2O or NH3? Wait, H2O: each molecule has 2 H (each with 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and O (8 protons, 8 neutrons in the common isotope). So total: 2 H contribute 2 protons and 0 neutrons. O contributes 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So total protons: 10, neutrons: 8. Not equal. Alternatively, maybe it's CO2? Carbon has 6 protons, 6 neutrons (in C-12), O has 8 each. So CO2 would have 6 + 8*2 = 22 protons, and 6 + 8*2 = 22 neutrons. So 22 each. So that would fit: W is CO2. But wait, CO2 is a gas, so that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe W is CH4? No, because CH4 would have 6 (C) + 4*1 (H) = 10 protons, and 6 (neutrons in C) + 0 (H) = 6. Not equal.

Wait, what about H2? No, because each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. So H2 would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons. Not equal. What about O2? Each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. O2 molecule would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So that would satisfy the condition: same number of protons and neutrons in the molecule. So W could be O2, but O2 is a diatomic gas, but it's not a product of a reaction between a metal and water, I think. Because when metals like sodium react with water, they produce H2 gas.

Wait, when metals like sodium react with water, they produce hydrogen gas (H2) and sodium hydroxide. So if Y is water, the reaction is 2 Na + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + H2↑. So in that case, W would be H2. But H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons, which isn't equal. Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Another possibility: maybe the reaction is between a metal and an acid, like HCl or H2SO4. Let's say Y is an acid. Then the reaction would produce H2 gas. But again, that doesn't satisfy the neutron-proton condition.

Wait, perhaps W isn't H2. Let me think again. What other gas could be formed in such reactions? Like CO2. How? Maybe if Y is a carbonate, but that's less likely. Or maybe if Y is something else.

Wait, another approach: the gas W's molecule has equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's list possible gases and see.

Take CO2 as an example: each CO2 molecule has 1 C (6 protons, 6 neutrons) and 2 O (8 each). So total protons: 6 + 2*8=22. Total neutrons:6 + 2*8=22. So yes, 22 each. So CO2 would fit. So if W is CO2, what reaction would produce that
