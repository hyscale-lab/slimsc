Okay, so I have this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism, right? That's when a compound has chiral centers, making it able to rotate plane-polarized light. Chiral centers are carbons attached to four different groups. So, I need to check each compound given to see if they have any chiral centers or other sources of asymmetry.

The question lists four compounds, and the options are combinations of which ones show optical isomerism. Let me take it one by one.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings connected at position 1 and 1'. The substituents are at 2 and 6 positions on each ring. Wait, so each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. Wait, the structure is that each phenyl ring is attached to a methyl ester at position 2 and a nitro group at 6. 

Since it's a biphenyl, are there any chiral centers? The central atom is the one where the two phenyl rings are connected. That's a carbon bridge? Wait, no, biphenyl is two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. So the central bond is between the two carbons (each attached to a benzene ring). Or wait, no, each benzene is connected via a single bond, so the central structure is like C6H4-C6H4? Wait, but each benzene ring is connected to another ring in a 1,1' fashion, meaning that the two benzene rings are connected by a single bond between their respective C1 positions. So, the structure is two benzene rings attached at their C1 positions.

Now, the substituents are at the 2 and 6 positions of each benzene. Since each substituent is on the same ring, perhaps the molecule as a whole is symmetrical or not. Let's imagine each ring has a nitro at 6 and a methyl ester at 2. Are the two rings identical? Because each has the same substituents in the same positions relative to the connecting point.

Wait, if each ring is symmetric, then perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, so no optical isomerism. Alternatively, maybe the arrangement leads to an asymmetric center. Hmm, but the central point is a single bond, which can rotate. So if the substituents are on opposite sides or in a way that creates a plane of symmetry, there might not be a chiral center.

Wait, but in biphenyls, the substituents can create a chiral axis or something. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a plane of symmetry making the molecule achiral. If the two rings are mirror images, then
