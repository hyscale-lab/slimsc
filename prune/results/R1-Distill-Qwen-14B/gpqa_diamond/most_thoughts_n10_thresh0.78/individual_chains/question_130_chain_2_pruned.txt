Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about redshift and detecting objects with neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm, let me think. The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. And I need to find the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.

Wait, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission is at 121.6 nm, which is 1216 Angstroms, right? But wait, wait, no, wait. Oh wait, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. So 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. Oh yeah, that's correct. Lyman alpha is the transition in hydrogen where an electron drops from n=2 to n=1, emitting a photon at 121.6 nm, which is in the far ultraviolet.

So when a quasar's light passes through a neutral hydrogen cloud, the hydrogen absorbs this specific wavelength, creating a absorption line. But wait, for the cloud to be in front of the quasar, the quasar must be at a higher redshift than the cloud. So the absorption line we observe is at a longer wavelength than 1216 Angstroms because of the redshift.

But the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So, when can we detect this absorption with optical telescopes? Optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet light because the atmosphere absorbs it. So if the absorbed wavelength shifts into the optical range, we can detect it.

Wait, optical wavelengths are about 400-700 nm. So the Lyman alpha absorption line, which is 121.6 nm (1216 Angstroms), needs to shift into this range. So the rest wavelength is 1216 A, and after redshift, the observed wavelength lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + z), where z is redshift.

So we need lambda_obs >= 400 nm (since that's the lower end of optical). Wait, but maybe 400 is the lower
