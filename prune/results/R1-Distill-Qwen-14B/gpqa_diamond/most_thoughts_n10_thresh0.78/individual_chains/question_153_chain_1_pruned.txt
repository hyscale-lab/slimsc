Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Michael addition reaction, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking a beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me break down each part of the question.

The first reaction is between dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). Sodium ethoxide is a strong base, so it probably deprotonates the malonate to form the enolate. Dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOEt)2. When the enolate forms, the negative charge is on the alpha carbon, making it a good nucleophile.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of this is CH2=CH-(p-tolyl)COOEt, but wait, actually, the (E) configuration would have the substituents on opposite sides. So the acrylate is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester. The enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta carbon of this acrylate. 

When the nucleophile (enolate) attacks, the beta carbon would add the malonate's group. So the product would have the malonate group attached to the beta position. Let me draw this out. The acrylate has a structure like COOEt-CH2-CH2-p-tolyl? Wait, no. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CHCOOEt but with the p-tolyl group on the third carbon. Wait, no, the formula is more like CH2=CH-(p-tolyl)COOEt? Or maybe it's CH2=CH-CO-OEt with a p-tolyl group on the same carbon as the double bond. Hmm, wait, wait—maybe I should think in terms of numbering.

The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is probably CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. So the double bond is between C2 and C3, with the p-tolyl group on C3 and the COOEt on C2. Because the formula is (E), the substituents (p-tolyl and COOEt) are on opposite sides.

When the enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the beta position (the C3), which is the p-tolyl group attached. Wait, no—the double bond is between C2 and C3. The alpha carbon is C2, and the beta is C3. So the enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta carbon (C3). So the product would have the malonate group added to C3.

Wait, but the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OEt? No, wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOEt. So the structure is CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-C(O)OEt? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR, right? But 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon. So maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CH(p-tolyl)COOEt? That doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps I should think of it as CH2=CH-CO-OEt with the p-tolyl group on the same carbon as the COOEt. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CH-(p-tolyl)COOEt. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-COOEt, but I'm getting a bit stuck on that. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CO
