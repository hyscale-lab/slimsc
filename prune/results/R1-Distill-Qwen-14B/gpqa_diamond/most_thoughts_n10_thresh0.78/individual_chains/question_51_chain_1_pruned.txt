Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about the potential energy of a charge near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me try to recall what I know about conductors and electric potential.

Alright, the setup is a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. We're supposed to find the net potential energy of the system. The options are given, so I need to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that when a charge is placed near a conductor, it induces charges on the conductor. Since the sphere is grounded, electrons can move freely. So when a positive charge q is placed near it, the induced charges on the sphere will have negative charges on the side closer to q and positive on the opposite side? Wait no, wait. Wait, the induced charges should be opposite to the charge. So if q is positive, the sphere's near side will have negative induced charges, and the far side positive? Or wait, no. Grounded means the sphere is connected to the earth, which is a conductor. So when q is placed, the sphere's nearby surface will have induced negative charges, and since the sphere is grounded, any excess charge will leave, but wait. Wait, no, the sphere is neutral to start with, so when you bring a positive charge q near it, the induced charges are negative on the near side and the sphere's other side will have positive induced charges. But since it's grounded, the positive charges can leave the sphere, so the net result is that the sphere's surface will have induced negative charges equal in magnitude to q. Or wait, maybe not. Wait, no, because the sphere is neutral. So when a positive charge is brought near, the induced charges are negative near the charge and positive on the other side. But since the sphere is conducting and neutral overall, the induced negative charges must equal the positive induced charges. But because it's grounded, the positive charges can leave, so the sphere ends up with an induced charge of -q? Or is it something else?

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again. The sphere is initially neutral. When a charge q is brought near, the electric field of q induces a charge distribution on the sphere. The induced charge on the sphere would have a negative charge on the side closer to q and positive on the opposite. But since the sphere is neutral overall, the total induced charge must be zero. So the positive charge on the far side must be +q, and negative on the near side -q. But because the sphere is grounded, the excess positive charges can flow away. Wait, no, if the sphere was neutral, the induced charges must sum to zero. So if the near side has -q, the far side must have +q. But since it's grounded, the positive charges can leave via the ground. So the sphere would end up with a net charge of -q? Or wait, perhaps not. Let me think.

Wait, no. The sphere is neutral. Bringing a charge q near induces a charge distribution. The sphere's total charge must remain zero. When the external charge q is placed, the induced charges are such that the near surface has -q and the far surface has +q. But because the sphere is grounded, the +q on the far surface can flow
