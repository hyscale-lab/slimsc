Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the orbital period ratio between Planet3 and Planet1. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem states that there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're using the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variations. I remember that TTV is a method used to detect exoplanets by looking at the variations in the timing of a planet's transit as seen from Earth. But maybe that's not super relevant here; the question seems more about their orbital periods and temperatures.

The key data given are the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses, and the albedo for all is 0.3, same as Earth. I'm supposed to find by what factor Planet3's orbital period is larger than Planet1's.

Let me jot down the given ratios:

- Temperature ratio Planet1 to Planet2 is ~1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4. Wait, no, wait. The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. Does that mean T1 is 1.4 times T2, or the other way around? Oh, wait, the wording says "between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4." Hmm, so it's either T1/T2 =1.4 or T2/T1=1.4. The way it's phrased, I think it's T1 over T2 is 1.4, so T1 is hotter than T2. Because if the ratio is about 1.4, I guess Planet1 is hotter.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 2.3. So T2/T3 =2.3, so Planet2 is hotter than Planet3. So, T3 is colder than Planet2.

They also have mass ratios: Planet1 to Planet2 is ~1.15; so M1/M2 =1.15. So Planet1 is more massive than Planet2. And the mass ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 1.35, so M2/M3=1.35, meaning Planet2 is more massive than Planet3.

But wait, how does mass relate to orbital period? Hmm. I'm not sure if mass affects the period directly. I remember Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis and the mass of the central star. So if I can find the ratio of semi-major axes, I can find the period ratio.

Wait, the problem doesn't mention the central star's mass. Hmm, but I think in Kepler's third law, the period depends on the mass of the star and the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M)) * a³, where M is the mass of the star. But if all the planets are orbiting the same star, then M is the same for all, which simplifies things.

So if I can find a ratio of semi-major axes (a3/a1), then I can find the ratio of periods using Kepler's law.

But how do I find a3/a1 from the given temperature and mass ratios?

The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:

T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π² D² σ) ) ]^(1/4)

Wait, wait, no, more accurately, the equilibrium temperature equation is T = T_star * ( (R_star / (2 D) )^2 ) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4) )^(-1/2) ?

Wait, maybe a better approach. The equilibrium temperature formula is given by:

T = T_earth * ( L / L_sun )^1/4 * ( a / a_earth )^(-1/2) * ( (1 - a) / (1 - a_earth) )^(1/4 )

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as T = T_eq = ( (S (
