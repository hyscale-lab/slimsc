Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each represented by 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. The task is to find the normalized eigenvector's elements from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators like these have eigenvectors corresponding to their eigenstates. Since the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, the direction vector n must lie in that plane. So, the direction can be represented using spherical coordinates, perhaps, but maybe I don't need the exact angles since the problem is about the form of the eigenvector.

Wait, the operator is given along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So, the direction vector n can be parameterized by angles theta and phi. Since it's in the x-z plane, the angle phi (azimuthal angle) is zero, I think. So, n would be along a direction making some angle theta with the z-axis. So, n = (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) but wait, in x-z plane, phi is zero, because it's in the x-z plane. So, phi is 0, so n becomes (sinθ, 0, 0) plus cosθ in z? Wait no, wait. Wait, in spherical coordinates, the position vector is (r sinθ cosφ, r sinθ sinφ, r cosθ). But for x-z plane, phi is zero, so the direction becomes (sinθ, 0, cosθ), assuming r=1. So, n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

But wait, the operator P is along this direction n. So, the operator P would be P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z), where each component is the matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, P
