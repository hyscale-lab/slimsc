Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider so that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. 

Wait, the nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Let's break that down. Lithium usually has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass I can look up or calculate.

Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. Since the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light (0.96c), I should use the relativistic energy equations. I think the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared).

So, the first thing I need to find is the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a lithium-6 nucleus is approximately, wait, I remember that the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c² and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². But wait, maybe it's better to look up the exact mass. Alternatively, I can calculate it using the atomic mass.

Wait, the mass of Li-6 isotope. I think the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.014 atomic mass units (u). So I can convert that to kilograms or use the conversion factor to MeV/c².

Wait, 1 atomic mass unit is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.014 u is 6.014 * 931.5 MeV. Let me calculate that. 6 * 931.5 is 5589, and 0.014 * 931.5 is about 13.04. So total is approximately 5602 MeV, which is 5.602 GeV.

Wait, but wait. The mass of the nucleus is slightly less than the sum of protons and neutrons due to binding energy. Hmm, but for heavy ions like Li-6, the binding energy isn't super huge, but maybe I should consider it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the rest mass as given by the sum of protons and neutrons, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem just wants me to use the atomic mass, including electrons?

Wait, the nucleus is Li-6, so it has 3 protons, 3 neutrons, and 3 electrons? No, wait, the nucleus itself is just the protons and neutrons. Because when you talk about atomic mass, it includes electrons, but the nucleus is the protons and neutrons. So I think the mass of the nucleus (just protons and neutrons) would be roughly 3*(proton mass + neutron mass). But wait, the exact mass might be a bit different because of the binding energy.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the rest mass as given by the formula, but I might have to recall the exact mass of Li-6 nucleus. Alternatively, maybe I can just use the formula without worrying about exact numbers because the problem gives options, so perhaps the exact calculation isn't too crucial. Wait, but maybe I should proceed with the approach step by step.

So, let's outline the steps:

1. Find the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus.
2. Calculate the Lorentz factor gamma at v = 0.96c.
3. Multiply rest mass energy by gamma to get the total energy.

But wait, the problem is about the energy of the collider
