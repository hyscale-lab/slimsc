Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state of a particle can be expressed as a combination of eigenstates, and probabilities are calculated using the square of the absolute values of the coefficients.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh wait, but I need to find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of another operator whose matrix is given. Let me think about that.

First, I think I should normalize the state |alpha>. To do that, I need to calculate the norm (the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients). The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). 

Calculating the absolute square for (1+i): |1+i|² = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Similarly, for (2-i): |2 - i|² = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5. So the sum is 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), because the norm is sqrt(7), so the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait, but the question is about the probabilities of the eigenstates of a different operator. The matrix A has elements A_ij where A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Oh wait, so the matrix is 2x2 because the state is in a two-level system (up and down). So the matrix would look like:

A = [ [0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0] ]

Is that right? Because when i≠j, A_ij is ħ/2, else 0. So the diagonal elements are zero, and off-diagonal are ħ/2. 

Hmm, this matrix A is a 2x2 anti-diagonal matrix. I think this corresponds to the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So A = (ħ/2) * X.

But wait, eigenstates of the Pauli X are the states (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? Because X is the spin flip operator. So the eigenstates of A would be the same as those of X, but scaled by ħ/2.

Wait, no. The eigenstates of the operator are determined by the matrix itself. So since A is proportional to X, the eigenstates are the same as X's. So I need to find the overlap between the given state |alpha> and these eigenstates.

But wait, another approach is to find the eigenstates of A and express |alpha> in terms of them, then the probabilities will be the square of the amplitudes.

Alternatively, perhaps I can diagonalize A to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Let's find the eigenvalues of A. The matrix A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. The characteristic equation is det(A - λ I) = 0.

So ( -λ ) * ( -λ ) - (ħ/2)^2 = 0 → λ² - (ħ²/4) =0 → λ² = ħ²/4 → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are
