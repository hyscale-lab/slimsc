Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I remember that the CMB is this radiation leftover from the Big Bang, right? And it's all around us. The problem says that high-energy gamma-rays annihilate with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The reaction is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-. I need to find the energy of the gamma-rays whose lifetime in the universe is limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV.

Wait, so the question is about the energy threshold where this process becomes significant enough to limit the gamma-rays' lifetime. I think this has to do with the photon density and the cross-section for this annihilation process.

I remember that the mean free path of a photon (or in this case, a gamma-ray) is the distance it travels before interacting. If the mean free path is small compared to the size of the universe, then the photon's lifetime is limited by this process. So the lifetime τ is related to the mean free path λ by τ = λ / c, where c is the speed of light. If λ is small, τ is small, meaning the gamma-ray doesn't last long in the universe.

The mean free path λ is the inverse of the interaction rate, which is n * σ * v, where n is the number density of target photons, σ is the cross-section for the interaction, and v is the relative velocity between the gamma-ray and CMB photons.

But wait, since both are photons, their velocity is the speed of light in the same direction, so the relative velocity is negligible. Oh, wait, no. Because in the frame of the CMB, the gamma-ray is moving at a high speed, so perhaps it's better to think in the center-of-momentum frame or something. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, the cross-section for photon-photon annihilation into electron-positron pairs. I think there's a formula for that. I recall that the cross-section σ for this process depends on the energy of the photons involved. For high-energy photons, the cross-section increases, but there's also a threshold energy required for the process to happen.

The threshold occurs when the combined energy of the two photons is just enough to produce the electron-positron pair. The rest mass energy of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, so each pair needs at least 1.022 MeV in total. But wait, in this case, the problem is about when the gamma-ray photon has enough energy to interact with a CMB photon (which has low energy, 1e-3 eV) to produce the pair.

So the condition is that the sum energy in the center of mass frame must be at least 2m_e c^2, which is about 1.022 MeV. Let me think about the energy in the lab frame: the gamma-ray has energy E, and the CMB photon has energy ε = 1e-3 eV.

In the center of mass frame, the total energy is sqrt( (E + ε)^2 - (p E + p ε)^2 ), but since photons are massless, their energy equals their momentum times c. So for the two photons, their momenta are in opposite directions if they're moving towards each other, but if they're moving in the same direction, as in the case where the gamma-ray is moving through the CMB, which is isotropic, then perhaps the relative motion is different. Hmm, maybe I should use the invariant quantity s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. Wait, but if the photons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite, so p2 would be negative, but if they're moving in the same direction, their momenta add.

Wait, no. The CMB is isotropic, so from the gamma-ray's frame, the CMB photons are coming at it from all directions, but on average, the head-on collisions are the most likely to have high center-of-mass energies. So perhaps we can consider the case where the two photons are moving directly towards each other, so their momenta are opposite, and their energies add in the center-of-mass frame.

So the invariant s is (E_γ + ε)^2 - (p_γ c - p_ε c)^2, since the momenta are opposite. Wait, no, because E = p c for photons. So for photon 1 (gamma-ray): E = p_γ c, and photon 2 (CMB): ε = p_ε c. Since they're moving towards each other, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is E_γ + ε, and the total momentum is p_γ - p_ε (since directions are opposite). So s = (E_γ + ε)^2 - (p_γ c - p_ε c)^2. Let's calculate this:

s = (E_γ + ε)^2 - (p_γ c - p_ε c)^2
But p_γ c = E_γ, and p_ε c = ε. So substituting:
s = (E_γ + ε)^2 - (E_γ - ε)^2
Expanding both squares:
= [E_γ² + 2 E_γ ε + ε²] - [E_γ² - 2 E_γ ε + ε²]
= 4 E_γ ε.

So the square of the center of mass energy squared is s = (E_γ + ε)^2 - (E_γ - ε)^2 = 4 E_γ ε.

Wait, but in the case where the photons collide head-on, that formula holds. So for the process to occur, the center of mass energy must be at least 2 m_e c². Therefore:

sqrt(s) >= 2 m_e c^2
→ sqrt(4 E_γ ε) >= 2 m_e c^2
→ 2 sqrt(E_γ ε) >= 2 m_e c^2
→ sqrt(E_γ ε) >= m_e c^2
→ E_γ ε >= (m_e c^2)^2
→ E_γ >= (m_e c^2)^2 / ε

Oh! So that gives the minimum energy E_γ for which the annihilation can occur. Because in this case, ε is given as 1e-3 eV. So plugging in:

E_γ = ( (0.511 MeV)^2 ) / (1e-3 eV )

Wait, but we need to make sure the units are consistent. Let me convert everything to eV.

1 MeV = 1e6 eV. So 0.511 MeV is 511,000 eV.

So m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 5.11e5 eV.

So (m_e c²)^2 = (5.11e5 eV)^2 = (5.11)^2 * 1e10 (eV)^2 ≈ 26.11e10 (eV)^2.

Divide by ε = 1e-3 eV:

E_γ = 26.11e10 (eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = 26.11e13 eV = 2.611e14 eV.

Wait, but wait, that's 2.6e14 eV, which is 2.6e8 GeV. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. Wait, no: 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, right? So 2.611e14 eV is 261.1 GeV. But none of the options are anywhere near that. The options are all around 1e5 GeV. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me double-check the calculation. Because 26.1e10 eV squared divided by 1e-3 eV gives E_γ in eV.

Wait, (5.11e5 eV)^2 is (5.11e5)^2 = (5.11)^2 * 1e10 = 26.1e10 (eV^2). So 26.1e10 (eV²) / (1e-3 eV) = 26.1e13 eV. Which is 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e5 GeV. Wait, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. So 2.61e14 eV is 2.61e5 GeV, which is 2.61e5 GeV.

But looking at the options, option C is 2.6e5 GeV. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure. Did I get the formula right?

Wait, the formula I derived is E_γ = (m_e c^2)^2 / ε.

Wait, because when s = (E_γ + ε)^2 - (E_γ - ε)^2 = 4 E_γ ε = (2 m_e c^2)^2.

So 4 E_γ ε = (2 m_e c^2)^2 → E_γ = ( (2 m_e c^2)^2 ) / (4 ε ) → E_γ = (4 m_e^2 c^4 )/(4 ε ) → E_γ = (m_e c^2 )^2 / ε.

Yes, that's correct.

So plugging in the numbers:

(0.511 MeV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = (0.511^2 * 1e12 eV²) / 1e-3 eV → 0.261121e12 / 1e-3 = 0.261121e15 eV → 2.61121e14 eV → 2.61e14 eV is 2.61e5 GeV.

Which is option C: 2.6e5 GeV.

So the correct answer should be C.


To determine the energy of high-energy gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by their annihilation with CMB photons, we analyze the process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$. The key is to calculate the threshold energy of the gamma-ray photon $E_\gamma$ required for this interaction to occur. 

The invariant quantity $s$ in the center-of-mass frame is given by:

\[
s = (E_\gamma + \epsilon)^2 - (p_\gamma c - p_\epsilon c)^2,
\]

where $E_\gamma$ is the energy of the gamma-ray photon, $\epsilon$ is the energy of the CMB photon, and $p_\gamma$ and $p_\epsilon$ are their momenta. For photons, $E = pc$, so $p_\gamma c = E_\gamma$ and $p_\epsilon c = \epsilon$. Substituting these into the expression for $s$, we get:

\[
s = (E_\gamma + \epsilon)^2 - (E_\gamma - \epsilon)^2.
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
s = 4 E_\gamma \epsilon.
\]

For the annihilation to occur, the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}$ must be at least equal to the threshold energy required to produce an electron-positron pair, which is $2m_e c^2$ (where $m_e$ is the electron mass). Thus:

\[
\sqrt{s} \geq 2m_e c^2.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
s \geq (2m_e c^2)^2.
\]

Substituting $s = 4E_\gamma \epsilon$:

\[
4E_\gamma \epsilon \geq (2m_e c^2)^2.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{\epsilon}.
\]

The rest energy of the electron is $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 511,000 \, \text{eV}$. The average energy of a CMB photon is $\epsilon = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$. Substituting these values:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{(511,000 \, \text{eV})^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}}.
\]

First, calculate $(511,000)^2$:

\[
(511,000)^2 = 261,121,000,000 \, \text{eV}^2.
\]

Now divide by $10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{261,121,000,000 \, \text{eV}^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} = 2.61121 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Convert to GeV (since $1 \, \text{GeV} = 10^9 \, \text{eV}$):

\[
E_\gamma \geq 2.61121 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV} = 2.61121 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

This rounds to approximately $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$**.

Answer: C
