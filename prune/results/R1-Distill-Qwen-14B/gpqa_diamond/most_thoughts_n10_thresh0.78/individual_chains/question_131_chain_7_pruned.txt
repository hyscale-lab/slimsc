Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it carefully and think through the steps.

The question involves a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that's dehydrated to form an anhydride. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products, major and minor, both with the formula C13H16O3.

The NMR data is given: the anhydride has a single peak in 1H NMR at 7 ppm and two peaks in 13C NMR at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Then, the major and minor products have 2D NOESY spectra. The major has a cross-peak, minor doesn't. The question is about which resonances are connected in the major product's spectrum.

Alright, breaking this down.

First, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. When dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. Dehydration of a diacid typically forms an anhydride via elimination of water. The structure of the anhydride would have a five-membered ring, probably, since cyclic anhydrides are more stable.

Looking at the NMR data for the anhydride: 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. That's probably the protons from the carbonyl groups. Wait, in a cyclic anhydride, the carbonyl protons are usually around 7 ppm. But if it's a single peak, maybe it's a symmetrical structure where the two protons are equivalent. So, perhaps the anhydride has two equivalent protons, like in a five-membered ring, making them equivalent, hence a singlet.

The 13C NMR has two peaks: one at 137 ppm and another at 165 ppm. 137 ppm is around where a carbonyl carbon would be, but wait, no. Wait, the carbonyl carbons in an anhydride would be around 165-175. Wait, but the 137 ppm is lower; that's more like an sp3 hybridized carbon attached to an oxygen, maybe an ester or ether or something else. Hmm.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the 137 ppm is the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. Oh, or maybe it's the bridgehead carbons in the anhydride ring.

Wait, the anhydride structure. For example, if the dicarboxylic acid is HOOC-(CH2)n-COOH, when dehydrated, it becomes a cyclic anhydride. Wait, but the original had a cis-alkene. Oh, wait, the starting material is a diacid with a cis-alkene. So upon dehydration, it's forming an anhydride, probably with the alkene becoming part of the ring.

Wait, maybe the diacid is something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but if the middle is a cis-CH2CH2, no, that wouldn't form an anhydride. Wait, perhaps it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a cis-alkene elsewhere. Wait, no, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. So maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, but where is the alkene? Oh, wait, perhaps it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's not an alkene. Alternatively, maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH with the middle being a CH2-CH2- group, but that doesn't have a double bond. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no. Wait, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. So perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that doesn't have a double bond. Wait, maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH with the middle having a double bond. Oh wait, perhaps it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's not helpful. Maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond in the middle, making it a diacid with a cis double bond, so something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH with the middle as CH2=CH-.

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond between the middle carbons. So, maybe HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-COOH, but that's a diacid with a double bond in the middle, and the configuration is cis.

When this is dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The dehydration would involve losing a water molecule between two of the carboxylic acid groups. Wait, but the original has two carboxylic acid groups on each end, and a cis-alkene in the middle.

Wait, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's without a double bond. Or is the diacid something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that doesn't have the alkene. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck
