Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound X is based on the given NMR data after a reaction. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the reaction details: Compound X is treated with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, often used in epoxide ring-opening reactions, but wait, in this case, maybe it's acting as a catalyst for some kind of elimination or perhaps a different reaction. Hmm, wait, no, another thought: Oh! It's also a common reagent used in the Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings. Alternatively, wait, another possibility: It's used in the formation of epoxides. Oh wait, no, that's more like the Prilezhaev oxidation. Let me think again. Oh, wait, maybe it's involved in acid-catalyzed processes, but I'm a bit rusty on that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a tetrahedral amine, like used in some ring-opening reactions. Hmm.

But wait, the product's NMR spectra are given. Let me look at them. The 1H NMR shows several signals. Let's list them out:

- δ 2.28 (3H, s): A singlet for 3H. That could be a CH3 group attached to something that doesn't split the signal, maybe an electronegative atom or a quaternary carbon.
- δ 2.31 (3H, s): Another singlet for 3H. So two separate CH3 groups as singlets. That might indicate two different methyl groups attached to different parts of the molecule.
- Then, the aromatic region: δ 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

Wait, the aromatic protons. Let me think about splitting. A doublet for 1H, then a doublet of 2H, another doublet of 1H, and another doublet of 2H. That could suggest a conjugated system with substituents causing coupling. Maybe a styryl group or something similar.

Looking at the 13C NMR data:

- 21.3 (s, 1C): That's a very low shift for a carbon. Maybe a methyl group attached to something like oxygen, like in an epoxide or an ether. Wait, 21.3 is about where a methyl adjacent to an oxygen would be. For example, in an epoxide, the adjacent CH3 would be around δ 20-25.
- 28.4 (s,
