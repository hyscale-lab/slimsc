Okay, so I've got this physics question about Maxwell's equations in a universe where magnets can have isolated north or south poles. Hmm, I remember that in our world, magnets always have both north and south poles; you can't isolate them. But I'm not entirely sure how that affects Maxwell's equations.

Maxwell's equations are four fundamental laws of electromagnetism. Let me try to recall what each one says. The first one is Gauss's Law for electricity, which relates the electric flux through a closed surface to the charge enclosed. The second is Gauss's Law for magnetism, stating that the magnetic flux through a closed surface is always zero. The third is Faraday's Law of electromagnetic induction, dealing with the circulation of the electric field. And the fourth is Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition, which involves the curl of the magnetic field and displacement current.

In our universe, magnets can't have isolated poles. So, Gauss's Law for magnetism says that the divergence of the magnetic field B is zero. That equation is ∇·B = 0. But in this parallel universe, magnets can have isolated poles. So, that must mean that this equation is different. If there are isolated north and south poles, then the magnetic flux through a closed surface isn't zero anymore. So Gauss's Law for magnetism would change. So equation number two is different.

Wait, what about the other equations? Faraday's Law, equation three, says that the curl of E is proportional to the negative rate of change of B. I don't think that would change just because poles are isolated. Similarly, Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition involves the curl of H and the displacement current. That also probably remains the same unless there's a change in how currents are defined, which the question doesn't suggest.

Wait, but Maxwell's equations in our universe are:

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. ∇·B = 0
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. ∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t

So, if in this universe, equation 2 changes. What's equation 2 about? It's about the divergence of B. So the first equation (div E) is about charge, and equation 2 (div B) is about magnetic monopoles.

So in a universe with magnetic monopoles, equation 2 would become ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. So equation 2 is definitely different.

What about equation 3? Faraday's law depends on changing B fields. If B can have sources and sinks (magnetic monopoles), does that affect the curl of E? I think Faraday's law is about how changing B induces E fields, which is about the curl. So equation 3 might not change. Because it's about the relation between E and changing B, not the existence of monopoles.

But wait, another thought. If there are magnetic charges, how does that affect the curl of E? In our case, equation 3 says that the curl of E is -∂B/∂t. But if B has sources and sinks, perhaps the relation changes? Or maybe not, because Faraday's Law deals with the induced E fields due to changes in B, regardless of where the B comes from. So equation 3 might stay the same.

So which equations are modified when you have magnetic monopoles? I think only equation 2 is changed. But wait, another point: Maxwell's equations in the presence of magnetic charges would also affect Ampère's Law. Because in Ampère's Law, the divergence of H is J_free, but if there are magnetic currents, that might change.

Wait, no, Ampère's Law is about the curl of H. The presence of magnetic monopoles would affect the divergence of B, not the curl of H. Or would it? Let me think.

In the presence of magnetic monopoles, the equations become:

∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m (equation 2)
∇×E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m (if there are magnetic currents)

Wait, no, I'm not sure. Let me recall. Without magnetic monopoles, equation 3 is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. But with monopoles, I think equation 3 might get an extra term related to the magnetic current. Because if you have a magnetic current, that would affect the induced electric fields. So equation 3 might change.

Alternatively, perhaps equation 4 (Ampère's Law) is modified. Wait, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, the equations are modified in two places: equation 2 and equation 3.

Because, in the standard formulation, the equations are:

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. ∇·B = 0
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. ∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t

If magnetic monopoles exist, equation 2 becomes ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m.

Equation 3 would become ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m, where J_m is the magnetic current density. Because magnetic charges would create additional terms in the Faraday's Law.

Wait, I think that's correct. So two equations change: equation 2 (div B) and equation 3 (curl E). So which option corresponds to that?

Looking at the options:

Option A) The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. So only equation 2 is different. But in reality, equation 3 changes too. So option A is incorrect.

Option B) The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field. So equations 3 and 2. That seems to fit. So B is a candidate.

Option C) The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field (equation 4) and the flux of the electric field (equation 3). But if equation 4 is about the curl of H, which isn't directly affected by monopoles. So C might not be correct.

Option D) The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field. So equation 2 and equation 4 (curl of B). Wait, equation 4 is about the curl of H. The curl of B... Wait, in equation 4, the integral form is Ampère's Law, which is ∮ B · dl = μ₀ I_enc + μ₀ ε₀ ∂Φ_E/∂t. But in terms of the equations, the curl of H is J + ∂D/∂t.

Wait, no. The curl of B is not one of Maxwell's equations. Because in Maxwell's equations, it's the curl of H equals J plus displacement current. So equation 4 is about H, not B.

So, the equations that would change are equation 2 and equation 3. So which option says that?

Option B says: the ones related to the circulation of the electric field (equation 3) and the divergence of the magnetic field (equation 2). Yes, that's correct. So the answer is B.

Wait, but let me make sure. So the question is: which equations are different? In a universe with isolated magnetic poles, which of Maxwell's equations change.

In our universe, equation 2 is ∇·B =0. With monopoles, equation 2 becomes ∇·B=μ₀ rho_m. Equation 3 becomes ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m. So two equations change: 2 and 3.

Looking at the options, option B says the ones related to the circulation of the electric field (equation 3) and the divergence of the magnetic field (equation 2). So yes, option B is correct.


In a universe where magnets can have isolated north or south poles, Maxwell's equations would differ from our current understanding. In our universe, Gauss's Law for magnetism states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero (∇·B = 0), which reflects the absence of isolated magnetic poles. However, in this parallel universe, the existence of magnetic monopoles would modify this equation to ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. This means the divergence of the magnetic field is no longer zero, and equation 2 is altered.

Additionally, the presence of magnetic monopoles would also affect Faraday's Law of electromagnetic induction. In our universe, Faraday's Law is expressed as ∇×E = -∂B/∂t, which relates the curl of the electric field to the time-varying magnetic field. With magnetic monopoles, this equation would acquire an extra term related to magnetic current density, becoming ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m. Thus, equation 3 is also modified.

The other two equations—Gauss's Law for electricity (∇·E = ρ/ε₀) and Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition (∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t)—remain unchanged because they pertain to electric charge and current, which are not directly affected by the presence of magnetic monopoles.

Given these changes, the two modified equations are:

1. The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field (∇·B = 0 becomes ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m).
2. The one related to the circulation of the electric field (∇×E = -∂B/∂t becomes ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m).

Thus, the correct answer is the option that specifies these two equations are different.

Answer: B
