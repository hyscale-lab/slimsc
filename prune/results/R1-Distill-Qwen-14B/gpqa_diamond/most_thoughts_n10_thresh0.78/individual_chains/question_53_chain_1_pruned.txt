Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, it's probably benzene with two substituents attached. The FTIR shows an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O), so the IR peak around 1700 cm^-1 is probably the ester. That makes me think that one of the substituents is an ester group, like O-C-O connected to an alkyl group.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: there are six signals. The signals are divided into three groups: two aromatic Hs, two vinyl Hs (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two CH3 groups. Oh, and no signals for CH2 groups. So, that means the structure doesn't have any methylene groups (CH2), which suggests that the substituents might be such that any CH2 groups are either not present or perhaps in a part that's not giving a peak here.

Let me think about the structure. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, let's imagine where the substituents are. Maybe the substituents are opposite each other (para), or adjacent (ortho), or meta. But wait, the NMR suggests certain kinds of Hs.

The aromatic Hs: two signals. So, maybe the substituents are in such a way that there are two sets of aromatic protons. For example, if the substituents are para, then the ring might have two equivalent sets of Hs. Wait, no, para substituents would lead to two sets of two Hs each. Let me think again.

Wait, in o-, m-, p- disubstituted benzene rings, the number of distinct H environments can vary. For para, two substituents opposite each other would leave the ring symmetric. So, the aromatic Hs would be in two sets: each pair being equivalent. That would make two signals in the NMR. So that matches with the two aromatic H signals. So the substituents are probably para.

Now, the other substituent besides the ester. Wait, wait. No, the ester is one substituent. Oh, wait, wait, the compound is di-substituted, so two substituents on the benzene ring. One is an ester group, the other is something else.

Wait, but the NMR shows signals for vinyl H and CH3. So perhaps the other substituent is an ethyl group attached via a double bond, like an alkene. Because vinyl Hs are typically from CH2=CH- something. But then, the CH3 groups: two signals, so maybe two different methyl groups. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester (like O-CO-O) and the other is an ethyl group attached via a double bond, or maybe a propenyl group.

Let me think about the substituents. If one substituent is an ester, say O-CO-O-R, and the other substituent is perhaps an allyl group. Wait, but the NMR has two CH3 signals. So maybe the substituent is a propyl group, but that would have CH2 groups, which are not present in the NMR. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a methylene group, but again, that would have CH2 groups.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is an allyl ester? Or maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to something else. Wait, let's think about the NMR data again. The vinyl Hs: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. That suggests some coupling between these Hs. Maybe a trans coupling?

Wait, the vinyl group might be part of a substituent like CH2=CH- something. But then, the CH2 would appear as a quartet if coupled with another CH2 group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group, but that would complicate the NMR.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a methoxy group? No, the IR shows an ester, so that's another oxygen-containing group. Maybe the other substituent is a methyl group attached in some way.

Wait, but there are two CH3 signals. So, two different CH3 groups. So, perhaps each substituent is contributing a methyl group. For example, the ester group is O-CO-O-R, where R is a methyl group, and the other substituent is a CH3 attached directly to the ring. But wait, if the substituents are ester and methyl, then the ring would have ester (O-CO-OR) and methyl (CH3) groups. Let's think about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester (like O-CO-OCH2CH3) and a vinyl group, but that might complicate things.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like para-substituted benzene with one substituent as an ester (like O-CO-OCH2CH3) and the other substituent as a vinyl group attached to a methyl, like CH2=CH2CH3. But wait, that would have CH2 groups, which the NMR doesn't show. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, another approach: let's count the number of hydrogens. The molecular formula could be C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.

The benzene ring has 6 carbons, but in the di-substituted case, two substituents are attached. So the substituents would contain the remaining carbons.

Let me count the carbons. The substituents are two groups. Suppose each substituent is an ester group and another group. Wait, no, the ester group is one substituent, and the other substituent is something else.

Wait, wait. Let's think about the structure. The compound is di-substituted, so two groups attached to benzene.

One substituent is the ester group: R-O-CO-O-R' ? No, wait, ester is R-O-CO-R', where R and R' are alkyl groups. But in this case, perhaps it's more like benzene with an ester substituent, which would be O-CO-O-R attached to the benzene.

Wait, no, wait. The ester group in the substituent would be like an alkyl ester attached to the ring. So, for example, benzene-O-CO-R, where R is an alkyl group. So, the substituent is O-CO-R attached to the benzene ring.

So, let's say the substituent is O-CO-R, where R is a methyl group. Then, the other substituent is another group.

But wait, the NMR has two CH3 signals. So, perhaps the ester has a methyl group (R=CH3), and the other substituent is a group that has another methyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is something like CH2COO, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the degrees of unsaturation. The formula is supposed to be one of the given options. Let's take each option and calculate the degrees of unsaturation.

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N.

For C11H12O2: DoU = (2*11 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (24-12)/2= 6. The benzene ring contributes 3 DoU (since it's a 6-membered ring with three double bonds equivalent). So 3 DoU from benzene, so the substituents contribute 3 DoU.

If benzene is di-substituted, the substituents could each contribute some DoU. For example, an ester group (O-CO-O-R) doesn't contribute any DoU beyond what's in the benzene. Wait, the ester is O-CO-O-R, which has a carbonyl group (one DoU). So each ester substituent adds one DoU. So if one substituent is an ester (1 DoU) and the other is, say, a vinyl group (another DoU?), then total DoU would be benzene (3) + ester (1) + vinyl (1) = 5. But that's less than 6. Hmm.

Wait, maybe let's take option D: C11H12O2. So 11 C, 12 H, 2 O.

DoU is (2*11 +2 -12)/2 = (24-12)/2=6.

Benzene is 3 DoU. The substituents: if one is an ester (which has a carbonyl, 1 DoU), and the other substituent is a group with 2 DoU, perhaps a double bond. So total substituent DoU would be 3. That adds up to 6. So that's possible.

Alternatively, the substituents could have a total of 3 DoU. For example, an ester (1 DoU) and another substituent with 2 DoU. Like maybe a vinyl group (double bond, 1 DoU) and a ring? No, probably not. Alternatively, substituents could be an ester and a cyclopropane? Unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached to the ring, which would contribute one DoU. So substituents: ester (1) and vinyl (1
