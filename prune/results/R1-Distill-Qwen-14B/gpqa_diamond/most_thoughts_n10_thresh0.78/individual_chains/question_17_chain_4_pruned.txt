Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. So the Ca-EDTA complex is formed, and the concentration of free calcium ions would depend on the formation constant and the initial concentration of the complex.

Wait, the problem says the solution is 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration, let's call it [Ca-EDTA], is 0.02 M.

I think the formation constant K is for the reaction where Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- combine to form the complex. So the reaction would be:

Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−

And the formation constant K is given by:

K = [CaEDTA] / ( [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] )

But wait, in this case, the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA^2−. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. We're trying to find the concentration of free Ca^2+ ions.

But wait a second, EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, meaning each EDTA molecule can bind to a metal ion. Also, in solution, EDTA exists in different protonated forms. But the problem says the pH is ideal, so maybe we don't have to worry about that, and we can assume that the concentration of EDTA^4- is sufficient for the complex formation.

Wait no, the problem says the pH is ideal. I think that implies that the EDTA is in the correct
