Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located in the qubits space. The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). The options are four different points in some space, r=(1,1,0), etc.

Wait, I remember that the density matrix is a way to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Pure states are described by density matrices that are projectors, like |ψ><ψ|, but when it's a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture of these projectors. 

So, the given ρ is a mixture of |0> and |1>. Specifically, it's (|0><0| + |1><1|) divided by 2. That must mean it's an equal mixture of the two basis states. So each state is equally probable, right?

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I think this refers to the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Pure states lie on the surface of the sphere, and mixed states are inside.

In the Bloch sphere, any qubit state can be represented as a vector r = (x, y, z), where each component corresponds to the real part of the Pauli matrices. The density matrix ρ can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector.

Wait, let me write that correctly. The general form is ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ) / 2. So, if we can express the given ρ in this form, then r would be (r_x, r_y, r_z).

Given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let's expand |0><0| and |1><1|. The standard basis states |0> and |1> can be written in matrix form. |0> is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1> is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So, |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ becomes (I)/2.

Wait, that's interesting. So ρ is (I/2). But according to the general form, that would imply that the r·σ terms must be zero. Because (I + 0)/2 is I/2. So the Bloch vector r would be (0,0,0). Because all the terms r_x σ_x, etc., are zero. So the density matrix corresponds to the completely mixed state, which for a qubit is the point at the origin in the Bloch sphere. Or wait, no — the density matrix is (I/2), which is the maximally mixed state, and in Bloch sphere terms, that's the center, so r is (0,0,0).

So looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). Option B is (0,0,1), which would be the state |1>, I think. But wait, no, the state |1> would have a density matrix |1><1|, which would correspond to (I + (0,0,1)·σ)/2. So that would be I/2 + σ_z/2. Which is a density matrix with (1,1,1,0) in matrix form, wait no, let me calculate:

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So if r is (0,0,1), then r·σ is σ_z. So (I + σ_z)/2 is [[1,0],[0,0]] for |0>, right? Because (I + [[1,0],[0,-1]]) / 2 equals [[(1+1)/2, 0], [0, (1-1)/2]] which is [[1,0],[0,0]], which is |0><0|. Wait, no, that's not matching. Wait no, wait for r=(0,0,1), the density matrix is (I + σ_z)/2. So that gives [[ (1+1)/2, 0 ], [0, (1-1)/2 ] ] which is [[1,0],[0,0]], which is |0><0|. Hmm, but that's a pure state, not a mixed one.

Wait, but in our problem, ρ is (|0> + |1>)/2, which is (I)/2. So what's the Bloch vector for that?

Wait, I think I should write ρ in terms of the Pauli matrices. So ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. Let's compute it for the given ρ.

Given that ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let's compute this matrix.

|0><0| is:
[[1,0],
 [0,0]]

|1><1| is:
[[0,0],
 [0,1]]

Adding them gives:
[[1,0],
 [0,1]]

So ρ is 1/2 * [[1,0],[0,1]]
