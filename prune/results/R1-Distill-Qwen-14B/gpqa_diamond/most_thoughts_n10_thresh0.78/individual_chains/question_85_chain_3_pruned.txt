Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about two planets orbiting a star and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors, like the star's temperature, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo.

Wait, the question says both planets have the same albedo, so albedo won't affect the ratio. That's good, that factor cancels out. So the main things to consider are the star's characteristics and the planets' distances.

But wait, the problem mentions the transit method and radial velocity (RV) method. Oh right, the transit method gives the radius of the planet because we measure the dip in the star's brightness. The RV method gives the mass because it measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull.

But how does that help me find their distances? Oh, because knowing the mass and radius, maybe I can find the orbital period through other methods. Wait, but the question doesn't give us the periods directly. Hmm.

Wait, the RV method gives the velocity of the star in its orbit around the barycenter. The shift in the spectral lines (like the [OI] line) relates to this velocity. The amount of shift depends on the mass of the planet and the distance between the star and the planet.

Oh wait, the RV data here gives the maximum periodic shift. The RV shift is related to the mass of the planet and the star, as well as the distance between them. But I think the formula for RV semi-amplitude is something like K = (v) = (G * (M_p) * sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) * (1/(P * (1 - e^2)^(0.5)))^(1/3)). Wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, I think the RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( (G * P) / (2π c) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )) )

Wait, but maybe a better approach is to realize that for two planets, the RV shifts are given, and we can find the ratio of their semi-major axes. Because the RV semi-amplitude is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (a_p) / ( (1 + M_p/M_star) ) )^(1/3) ), but wait, that might get complicated. Alternatively, the RV shift is inversely proportional to the planet's orbital period? I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Maybe I should think of the relation between the RV semi-amplitude and the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/( (P * (1-e²)^(0.5)) ) )^(1/3)) * (1)/( (2π c) )^(1/3) )? I'm not
