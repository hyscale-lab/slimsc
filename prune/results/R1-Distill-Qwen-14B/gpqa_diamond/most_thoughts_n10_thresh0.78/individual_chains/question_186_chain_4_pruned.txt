Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement, right? It typically involves 1,5-dienes rearranging into another 1,5-diene, but maybe that's not all. Let me think.

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Wait, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is like a norbornane structure. So the molecule has a bicyclic system with a bridge. The substituents are a vinyl group and an azabicyclo structure. Oh wait, it's 2-vinyl, so the vinyl is attached to the second carbon of the bicyclo system.

So the structure of 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene is norbornene with a nitrogen in the ring. And then there's a vinyl substituent on the second carbon. That might set up the diene for the Cope rearrangement.

Wait, the Cope rearrangement requires a 1,5-diene. So I need to imagine where the double bonds are. The molecule has a bridge, so let me try to draw it mentally. The bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene has double bond between carbons 5 and 6, perhaps? Because norbornene typically has a double bond in that position.

So the structure has a bridge, like two rings. The substituents are at positions 1 and 4. Wait, the configuration is (1S,4R), but I'm not sure if that affects the product so much as the possibility of different products if there are stereoisomers, but the question is about the product structure, not the stereochemistry necessarily.

The vinyl group is at C2. So the molecule is 2-vinyl, meaning a CH2CH2 group attached at C2. Wait, but vinyl is CH2=CH-, so that's a substituent with a double bond. So the 2-azabicyclo structure has a double bond in the ring (as hept-5-ene
