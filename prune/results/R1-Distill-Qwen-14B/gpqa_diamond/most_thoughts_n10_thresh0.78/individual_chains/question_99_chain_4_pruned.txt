Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out what the correct answer is. Let's see, the question involves identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. Hmm.

First, I'll start by looking at the FTIR spectrum provided. The question says there's a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in the IR around that region usually indicate O-H stretching. Oh right, that's like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Then, there's a strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹. That's a carbonyl group, probably a ketone or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but wait, carboxylic acids typically have a broad O-H peak and a strong carbonyl. So maybe that's what we're looking at here.

So the compound probably has both a carboxylic acid group and some other substituents. Now, looking at the options, all of them seem to have a carboxylic acid (COOH) group. So that's consistent.

Next, I'll look at the 1H NMR data. The question states that there are several peaks, none of which correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So this means we don't have any double bonds with adjacent hydrogens, like in alkenes or aromatic rings. So the structure is probably not containing any vinyl groups.

In the 1H NMR, two specific signals are noted. One is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complicated. I'm trying to remember how splitting works in NMR. Each neighboring set of equivalent protons can split a signal. The more neighboring groups, the more splitting occurs.

Let me think about each option:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the structure here is something like two CH groups each attached to a methyl and ethyl group, then a CH2 connected to COOH. Wait, no, wait: The formula is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So that might be two CH groups, each branching from a central carbon, each attached to a CH3 and C2H5. So it's like:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

Wait, that would make the two central CH groups each with two substituents: a methyl and ethyl. So each of the two CH groups is adjacent to each other, and each has two substituents. So, each CH would have two neighboring groups?

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like:

The molecule has a central structure where two CH groups are attached to each other. Each of these CH groups is connected to a methyl and an ethyl group. Then, there's a CH2 connected to COOH.

Hmm, so the central part would be something like:

   CH(CH2CH3)
