Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this looks like a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it's written in terms of dx and dy. But pseudosphere is a term I think is related to hyperbolic geometry. Oh, right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But wait, in two dimensions, the pseudosphere is an example of a space with a metric of constant negative curvature.

The question is asking about the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. Wait, radius in the context of a pseudosphere, I think that refers to something like the curvature radius. For hyperbolic spaces, there's a concept of the radius related to the curvature. The curvature K is related to the radius r by K = -1/r². So if r is 2, then K would be -1/(2)^2 = -1/4. But how does that tie into the metric here?

Looking at the metric, it's written in a form that's similar to the metric of a hyperbolic space. The general form of hyperbolic metric in Poincaré coordinates is usually something like ds² = (dr² + r² dθ²)/(1 - (r²/R²)) or something like that, but wait, that's for a different coordinate system. Alternatively, in
