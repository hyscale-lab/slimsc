Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I need to figure out which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. Hmm. Let me read through the question again.

So, the problem is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis and looked at the target gene in all mutants. The mutations are found in the beginning of the sequence, in the first exon area.

The question is asking which mutation would most likely eliminate the compound. I think the key here is that the gene is responsible for synthesizing the compound, so if we can disrupt its function, the compound won't be made. But how do mutations affect gene function?

Looking at the options, I need to analyze each mutant's sequence and see what kind of change they have. The wild-type and mutant sequences are provided. Let's compare them.

First, the wild-type (intact) gene starts with 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So let's compare each nucleotide. Let's count the letters:

Looking at the first few nucleotides:

Wild type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA
Mutant 1:    ATG TTT CTA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA

Wait, let me compare each position.

Looking at the first few letters after ATG:

Wild: TTTCTCGCT...

Mutant1: TTTCTACGC...

Wait, wait, maybe I should look for where the differences are. Let me line them up:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...
Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Hmm, so in mutant1, the fourth triplet (CTC in wild) becomes CT A. Let me see the exact spots.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me write the wild and mutant sequences side by side, starting from the beginning.

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …
Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC …

So, looking at the differences:

At position 3-5: Wild is CTC, mutant is CTA. So, the third codon in the mRNA would be CTC (which is leucine) vs. CTA (also leucine). So that's a silent mutation; no change in amino acid.

Next, position 6-8: Wild is GCT (which is alanine), mutant is GCT. Wait, no, wait. Let me see: wild has GCT, and mutant1 has GCT? Wait, perhaps I'm not looking correctly.

Wait, wait. Wild: ...CTC GCT GGT...

Mutant1: ...CTA GCT GGT...

Ah, so the fourth triplet is CTC in wild, and CTA in mutant1? Wait, no. Let me see the exact nucleotides.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compare the sequences letter by letter.

Wild: starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT
