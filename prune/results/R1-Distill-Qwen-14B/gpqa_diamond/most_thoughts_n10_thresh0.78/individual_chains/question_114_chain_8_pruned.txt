Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question involves two reactions and selecting the right reagents from the options given.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A to D, each with different A and B reagents.

Hmm, let me think about what these reactions are. The first reaction looks like a nucleophilic addition to a ketone. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So adding NaCN and some reagent A. NaCN is a nucleophile, so maybe it's a nucleophilic addition.

Wait, in ketone additions, the nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon. But then, what happens after that? The usual path would be protonation, then... Oh, wait, maybe it's a substitution. Or perhaps it's a condensation reaction.

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's draw that structure. So, it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but substituted. Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure is (CH(CH3)(OH))CH2CN? Or maybe (CH3)2C(OH)-CH2CN? Wait, but butanenitrile is four carbons with a nitrile group. So the structure would be:

The main chain is four carbons, with the nitrile on the first carbon, and the hydroxy and methyl on the second. So, structure would be CH2CN-CH(CH3)(OH). Wait, or maybe it's the second carbon being the one with both groups. So, (CH3)2C(OH)-CH2CN? No, that would be longer. Wait, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, so four carbons including the nitrile. So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be:

The nitrile is on the first carbon (since butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but I'm getting a bit confused on the numbering). Alternatively, maybe it's:

The structure is (CH3)2C(OH)-CH2CN, but that's five carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think about the reaction.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN would typically do a nucleophilic addition. The mechanism would be attack of the CN- on the carbonyl carbon, forming a cyanohydrin. Then, perhaps deprotonation and protonation steps.

Wait, but the product here is 2
