Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about the decay of a hydrogen atom's |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state through two dipole transitions. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, the energy levels are determined by the principal quantum number n. The states are denoted as |n, l, m>, where l is the angular momentum quantum number and m is the magnetic quantum number.

Dipole transitions involve changes in the angular momentum. For an electric dipole transition, the selection rules are: Δl = ±1, and Δm = 0, ±1. So the atom emits or absorbs a photon, and the electron moves between states that differ in l by one unit.

The initial state here is |3,0,0>. We're looking for a two-step transition to |1,0,0>. So the process must go through an intermediate state.

Let's think about the first transition from n=3 to a lower n. Since it's a dipole transition, l must change by ±1. The initial l is 0 (s orbital), so after the first transition, l can become 1 (p orbital). So the first transition must go to a state with l=1.

So the first step is |3,0,0> → |2,1, m>, or maybe |3,0,0> → |something else>. Wait, n can decrease by 1 or more, but for a dipole transition, the steps are usually one level at a time. Hmm. Wait, no, dipole transitions can have Δn = ±1, but wait, no—dipole transitions have Δn = ±1 in the non-relativistic case. Or is it?

Wait, I think I got that wrong. Actually, for electric dipole transitions, the selection rule for n is Δn = ±1. Oh, wait, no, that's not correct. The selection rule for electric dipole transitions is Δn = ±1. So wait, that's not correct. Wait, no, wait: The selection rule for the principal quantum number n is that Δn can be ±1, ±2, etc., but for electric dipole transitions in hydrogen, the transitions are usually between adjacent n levels. Because the matrix elements for the dipole operator vanish unless l differs by ±1, and n differs by 0, ±1. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The selection rules for hydrogen's electric dipole transitions are:

- Δl = ±1
- Δn = any, but for hydrogen, the dominant transitions are between adjacent n levels because higher-order transitions are less probable. Hmm, but the question just says two dipole transitions, so it's possible to have more steps, but the question is about a two-step process.

Wait, but the initial state is n=3, l=0. The final state is n=1, l=0. So to go from n=3 to n=1 in two steps, each step would involve a change of n by 1. So first step
