Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. It's about expectation values of an operator, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through.

Okay, the problem says a spin-half particle is in a superposition state: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And the operator is 10σz + 5σx. We need to find the expectation value of this operator.

First, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated using the formula ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator and |ψ⟩ is the state vector.

Since the operator is a sum of two terms, 10σz and 5σx, the expectation value will be the sum of the expectation values of each term. So,

⟨O⟩ = ⟨10σz⟩ + ⟨5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩.

So I can calculate each expectation separately.

Let me start with ⟨σz⟩. Because |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward. The σz operator has eigenvalues +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩.

The state |ψ⟩ is a linear combination: a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩ where a=0.5 and b= sqrt(3)/2. So ψ = [a, b]^T in the σz basis.

The expectation value of σz is given by ψ† σz ψ. But since σz is diagonal in this basis, it's just the sum of |a|^2*(+1) + |b|^2*(-1).

Calculating |a|^2: (0.5)^2 = 0.25. |b|^2: (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (3/4) = 0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Then 10⟨σz⟩ = 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now for σx. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix, which is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. Its expectation value would involve the off-diagonal elements. The expectation value of σx is given by ψ† σx ψ.

Let me compute this. Let me write out ψ as a column vector: [a; b] = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σx ψ is [b; a].

Then ψ† σx ψ = [a*, b*] [b; a] = a* b + b* a.

But since a and b are real numbers here (0.5 and sqrt(3)/2), it's just a*b + b*a = 2ab.

So 2ab = 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = 2*( (sqrt(3)/4) ) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Then 5⟨σx⟩ = 5*(0.866) ≈ 4.33.

Adding the two parts together: -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, but the options are A) -1.4, B)1.65, C)-0.7, D)0.85.

Hmm, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, wait, the operator is 10σz +5σx, so the expectation is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

⟨σz⟩ was (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25-0.75= -0.5. Correct.

So 10 * (-0.5) = -5. Correct.

For σx, I calculated 2ab: 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = (2)*(sqrt(3)/4 )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866. So 5 * 0.866 ≈4.33.

So total is -5 +4.33 =-0.67.

Looking at the options, the closest is C) -0.7. But wait, wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation with the exact value.

Wait sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732. So sqrt(3)/2 is 0.866.

So 5 * 0.866 is 4.33 exactly? Or is it 5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (5*sqrt(3))/2 ≈ (5*1.732)/2 ≈ (8.66)/2 = 4.33.

Yes, correct.

So -5 +4.33 is -0.67. Rounding to one decimal place would be -0.7, right? Because 0.67 is closer to 0.7 than 0.6.

So the answer would be option C, which is -0.7.

Wait, but let me think about another approach, maybe using the expectation value formula properly.

The state is |ψ⟩ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩.

So the density matrix is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. The expectation of O is Tr(O ρ).

But I think that's more complicated, and the way I did it earlier is correct.

Alternatively, another way to compute ⟨σx⟩ is to note that σx |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, and σx |↓⟩ = |↑⟩.

So when you apply σx to |ψ⟩, you get 0.5 |↓⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↑⟩.

The inner product of this with ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] · [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] ?

Wait, no, ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], and σx ψ is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

Wait, no, wait. Let me write it correctly.

Wait, σx |↑⟩ is |↓⟩, σx |↓⟩ is |↑⟩. So σx ψ is 0.5 |↓⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↑⟩. So as a vector, that's [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Then ⟨ψ | σx |ψ⟩ is the inner product of [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] with [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5] which is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866. So that's correct.

So yes, the calculation seems correct, leading to an expectation value of approximately -0.67, which rounds to -0.7.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle O \rangle = \langle 10\sigma_z \rangle + \langle 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) of \( \sigma_z \) have eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The state \( \psi \) is expressed as \( \psi = a|\uparrow\rangle + b|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). The probabilities are:
\[
|a|^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75.
\]
Thus, the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |a|^2(+1) + |b|^2(-1) = 0.25(1) + 0.75(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]
Therefore:
\[
10\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10(-0.5) = -5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) is represented by the Pauli matrix:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
In the \( |\uparrow\rangle, |\downarrow\rangle \) basis, the state \( \psi \) is \( \psi = [a, b]^T = [0.5, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}]^T \). The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is given by:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \psi^\dagger \sigma_x \psi = a b + b a = 2ab.
\]
Substituting \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \):
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2(0.5)\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]
Thus:
\[
5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5(0.866) \approx 4.33.
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
The total expectation value is:
\[
\langle O \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]
Rounding to one decimal place, \( \langle O \rangle \approx -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
The closest option is **C) -0.7**.
