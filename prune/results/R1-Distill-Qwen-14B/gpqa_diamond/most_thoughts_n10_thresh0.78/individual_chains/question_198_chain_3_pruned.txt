Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, that seems a bit odd. Stability constants usually increase with the number of ligands, but β4 is lower than β3. Maybe that's a typo, but I'll proceed as given.

The problem is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. I think blue refers to the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, which is the dithiocyanato one. Or wait, maybe it's another one? I'm not entirely sure about the color, but let's proceed.

So, the first thing I remember is that when a metal ion is in a solution with a ligand, it forms complexes with varying numbers of ligands. The stability constants tell us how likely each complex is to form. A higher beta means the complex is more stable.

So, the possible complexes are Co^2+, CoSCN^+, [Co(SCN)]^2+, [Co(SCN)]^3+, [Co(SCN)]^4+, and so on, but wait the β values given are up to β4=16. Wait, but the way stability constants are defined, each β represents the formation of the next complex. So β1 is for the first ligand, β2 for the second, etc.

Wait, wait—stability constants are typically given as the formation of each successive complex. For example, the first complex is M + L → ML, with β1 being the equilibrium constant. Then ML + L → ML2 with β2, and so on. So, the overall stability constant for [Co(SCN)]^n would be the product of β's up to n.

Wait, no—actually, each βn is the stepwise constant for adding the nth ligand. So the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands is the product of β1 to βn. Or wait, no—some sources define K as the overall for the complex, while others define β as the stepwise. So, for example:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ CoSCN^+ : β1 = [CoSCN^+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-])

Then CoSCN^+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ : β2 = [Co(SCN)_2^2+]/([CoSCN^+][SCN^-])

So the overall K for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is β1 * β2.

Wait, that makes sense. So to find the concentration of each species, we need to calculate each possible complex's concentration based on their respective overall K values.

But wait, the problem gives β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16
