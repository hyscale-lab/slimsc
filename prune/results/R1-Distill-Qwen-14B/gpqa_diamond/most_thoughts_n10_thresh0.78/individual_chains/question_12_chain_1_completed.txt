Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain decay process. Hmm, the reaction is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino, nu. And the Pi(+) is at rest. 

Alright, so the given data: the rest mass of Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and the mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Wait, but what about the neutrino? Oh right, neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass, almost negligible. So I think we can consider the neutrino's rest mass as zero for this problem. 

Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So after decay, the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum. That must mean that the muon and neutrino share the same magnitude of momentum but opposite directions.

I remember that when a particle at rest decays into two particles, their energies and momenta are related through the relativistic energy-momentum relation. So each particle's total energy squared is equal to the square of its rest mass plus the square of its momentum times c squared. But since neutrino's rest mass is zero, its energy is just pc (where p is momentum and c is speed of light, but units here are in MeV so maybe we don't need to worry about c). 

So let's denote the muon's momentum as p, then the neutrino's momentum is also p (in opposite direction, but since it's magnitude, it's same value). 

The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. 

So the muon's total energy is sqrt( (105.7)^2 + p^2 ), right? And the neutrino's energy is just p (since its rest mass is zero). So the sum of these two should equal 139.6 MeV.

So the equation is:
sqrt( (105.7)^2 + p^2 ) + p = 139.6

Hmm, okay, need to solve for p. Let me let x equal p. So:

sqrt(105.7² + x²) + x = 139.6

Subtract x from both sides:
sqrt(105.7² + x²) = 139.6 - x

Now square both sides to eliminate the square root:
105.7² + x² = (139.6 - x)²

Expanding the right side:
(139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 * x + x²

So:
105.7² + x² = 139.6² - 279.2 x + x²

Subtract x² from both sides:
105.7² = 139.6² - 279.2 x

Now compute 139.6 squared and 105.7 squared.

139.6 squared: Let's calculate that. 140^2 is 19600, but 139.6 is 0.4 less than 140. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

105.7 squared: Let's see. 100^2 is 10000. 5.7^2 is 32.49. And cross term is 2*100*5.7 = 1140. So (100 +5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

So plug into equation:
11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x

Let me rearrange:
279.2 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49
Calculate the right side: 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67

So x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let me compute that.

Dividing 8315.67 by 279.2. Let me approximate:

279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is slightly higher than 8315. So 30 would be a bit too much. Let me compute 279.2 * 29.8:

279.2 * 29 = 279.2 * 30 = 8376 minus 279.2 → 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8

Wait, maybe I should do it more accurately. Let me compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Well, 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8

Subtract that from 8315.67: 8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87

Now, 279.2 * 0.8 = 223.36. Hmm, but that's more than 218.87.

Wait, perhaps 29.8 is too high. Let me think. 279.2 * 0.78 = 217. (0.7*279.2=195.44, 0.08*279.2=22.336 → 217.776.)

So 29.78 → 29.78 *279.2 ≈ 29 * 279.2 = 8096.8, plus 0.78 * 279.2=217.776 → 8096.8 +217.776=8314.576, which is very close to 8315.67. So x ≈29.78.

Wait, the calculation was 279.2 x =8315.67 → x≈29.78. So p is about 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, neutrinos have energy p, which is 29.78 MeV. So the neutrino's energy is around 29.78 MeV, and that's its kinetic energy since its rest mass is zero. Or wait, no, the kinetic energy is the total energy minus rest mass. But for neutrino, rest mass is zero, so its total energy is its kinetic energy. So the neutrino's KE is about 29.78 MeV.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the muon's total energy is sqrt(105.7² + p²) = sqrt(105.7^2 + (29.78)^2). Let me compute that:

105.7^2 is 11172.49, 29.78^2 ≈ 886.7. So sum is around 12059.19. Square root of that is about 109.8 MeV (since 100^2=10000, 110^2=12100. Let me compute 109.8^2: 109^2 is 11881, 0.8^2 is 0.64, and 2*(109)(0.8)=174.4 → 11881+174.4=12055.4, plus 0.64=12056.04. Oh, pretty close to 12059.19. So sqrt is approximately 109.83 MeV.

So the muon's total energy is about 109.83 MeV. Its rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy is 109.83 - 105.7 ≈ 4.13 MeV.

Wait, that makes sense. The muon's kinetic energy would be around 4.13 MeV, and the neutrino's kinetic energy is approximately 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That's very close to what I just calculated.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure.

Compute p again:

We had 279.2 x =8315.67 → x=8315.67 / 279.2. Let me compute this more accurately.

Compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

279.2 * 29 = 8096.8 → 29 * 279.2 = 8096.8.

8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.

279.2 *0.78 → 279.2 *0.7=195.44, 279.2 *0.08=22.336 → total 217.776.

So 0.78 gives 217.776, which is a little less than 218.87. The difference is 218.87 -217.776 =1.094.

1.094 /279.2 ≈ 0.0039. So x ≈ 29.78 + 0.0039 → ~29.7839.

So about 29.78 MeV for the neutrino's energy (KE), which is option D's 29.8 MeV.

The muon's KE is 4.12, which matches option D. So the correct answer should be D.


To determine the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino in the decay process:

\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]

we use conservation of energy and momentum. The pion (\(\pi^+\)) is initially at rest, so its total energy is its rest energy: \(E_{\pi} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\). After the decay, the total energy is shared between the muon (\(\mu^+\)) and the neutrino (\(\nu\)).

### Key Equations:
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   \[
   E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}
   \]
   where \(E_{\mu}\) is the total energy of the muon, and \(E_{\nu}\) is the energy of the neutrino.

2. **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**:  
   For the muon:  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{m_{\mu}^2 c^4 + p^2 c^2}
   \]
   For the neutrino:  
   \[
   E_{\nu} = p c
   \]
   where \(p\) is the magnitude of the momentum of the muon and neutrino (equal in magnitude due to momentum conservation).

3. **Total Energy Equation**:  
   Substituting \(E_{\mu}\) and \(E_{\nu}\) into the energy conservation equation:  
   \[
   \sqrt{m_{\mu}^2 c^4 + p^2 c^2} + p c = m_{\pi} c^2
   \]

### Solving for \(p\):
Let \(x = p c\). The equation becomes:  
\[
\sqrt{m_{\mu}^2 + x^2} + x = m_{\pi}
\]
where \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\). Subtracting \(x\) from both sides:  
\[
\sqrt{m_{\mu}^2 + x^2} = m_{\pi} - x
\]
Squaring both sides:  
\[
m_{\mu}^2 + x^2 = m_{\pi}^2 - 2 m_{\pi} x + x^2
\]
Simplifying:  
\[
m_{\mu}^2 = m_{\pi}^2 - 2 m_{\pi} x
\]
Rearranging:  
\[
2 m_{\pi} x = m_{\pi}^2 - m_{\mu}^2
\]
\[
x = \frac{m_{\pi}^2 - m_{\mu}^2}{2 m_{\pi}}
\]

### Substituting Values:
1. \(m_{\pi}^2 = 139.6^2 = 19488.16 \, \text{MeV}^2\)  
2. \(m_{\mu}^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \, \text{MeV}^2\)  
3. Substituting:  
   \[
   x = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{2 \times 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

Thus, the neutrino's energy is \(E_{\nu} = x = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}\), and its kinetic energy is the same since its rest mass is negligible.

### Muon's Kinetic Energy:
The muon's total energy is:  
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{m_{\mu}^2 + x^2} = \sqrt{105.7^2 + 29.78^2} \approx 109.83 \, \text{MeV}
\]
The muon's rest energy is \(m_{\mu} c^2 = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\), so its kinetic energy is:  
\[
KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} c^2 = 109.83 - 105.7 \approx 4.13 \, \text{MeV}
\]

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. This matches **Option D**.
