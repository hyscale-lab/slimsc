Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it my best shot.

Alright, the question starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride has specific NMR peaks. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products, major and minor. Both have the formula C13H16O3. The NOESY spectra show a cross-peak for the major but not the minor.

So, first, I need to figure out what the starting anhydride looks like. The anhydride's 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm, and the 13C has peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.

Wait, 7 ppm for a singlet in 1H NMR... that's probably an aromatic proton, but wait, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Hmm, dehydration of a cis-dioic acid would form an anhydride. Let me think about the structure.

So, the diacid is HOOC-(CH2)n-CH2-COOH? No, wait, it contains a cis-alkene. Oh right, so perhaps it's a structure like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond. Wait, no, more accurately, maybe HOOC-CH2CH2-CH2-COOH isn't right. Wait, maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. Or maybe the double bond is in the middle. So, HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH doesn't have a double bond. Oh wait, maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond between the CH2 groups. Wait, perhaps it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond between the middle CH2's. So, HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH becomes, upon dehydration, an anhydride. But wait, dehydration of a diacid would typically form an anhydride by losing a water molecule between the two acid groups.

Wait, but if the original molecule had a cis-alkene, that suggests that perhaps the diacid is adjacent to the double bond. So maybe the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond in the middle. Wait, that would be HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but maybe that's not right. Alternatively, if the dicarboxylic acid is HOOC-CH
