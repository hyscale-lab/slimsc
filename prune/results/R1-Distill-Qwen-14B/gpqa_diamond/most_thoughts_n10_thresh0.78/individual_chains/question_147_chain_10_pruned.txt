Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about annihilation processes. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

The problem says: p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, and m_A c² is 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A) 0.77c, B) 0.96c, C) 0.91c, D) 0.86c.

Wait, okay, so this is an annihilation reaction. Proton and antiproton annihilate and produce two A+ and two A⁻ particles. Since it's an annihilation, energy and momentum must be conserved.

But wait, the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, so it's moving at a low velocity compared to the speed of light. That might mean that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. Hmm, but wait, protons and antiprotons have rest mass energy, right? Let me think: the rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². So if the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. That might simplify things, but I'm not sure yet.

The mass of particle A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. So the rest energy of each A is 300 MeV.

Let me think about conservation of energy and momentum. In the center of mass frame, maybe? Wait, but the antiproton is moving slowly. So perhaps in the lab frame where the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving slowly.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the only moving particle is the antiproton. Or wait, no, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly. So the initial momentum is just that of the antiproton. Since the proton is at rest, its momentum is zero. So the total initial momentum is just the momentum of
