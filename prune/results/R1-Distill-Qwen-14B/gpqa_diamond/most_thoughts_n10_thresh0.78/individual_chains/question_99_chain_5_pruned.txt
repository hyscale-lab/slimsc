Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The options are four different structures, and I need to figure out which one matches the given spectral data.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1 and a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1. Broad peaks around 3000 usually indicate O-H stretching, which is typical for alcohols or carboxylic acids. The strong absorption at 1700 suggests a carbonyl group (C=O). So putting those together, it's likely a carboxylic acid because the O-H in carboxylic acids stretches broadly, and the carbonyl is strong. Also, carboxylic acids have both these features.

So the compound is probably a carboxylic acid. That means the structure should have a COOH group somewhere. Let me check the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. Wait, so that's a CH2COOH at the end. So the COOH is on the end, a carboxylic acid. Yeah, that fits.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. COOH is at the end again. Hmm.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. Again, CH2COOH, so COOH is on the end.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. COOH is at the end.

So all options have a COOH group except... No, wait, all four options end with COOH or have it as the last group. So all are likely carboxylic acids. That makes sense with the IR data.

Next, the 1H NMR data. The problem states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens, which means there are no double bonds or triple bonds, so it's a saturated compound. So all the structures are probably without any unsaturated bonds, which they all seem to have—so that’s consistent.

Looking at the NMR spectrum:

- One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets (that's a mouthful).
- Another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

I'm not exactly sure what that means, but I think it's about splitting patterns. Let me try to understand the splitting.

In NMR, splitting occurs due to neighboring protons. Each neighboring set of equivalent protons splits the signal into a number of peaks equal to n+1, where n is the number of neighboring protons.

So a doublet is split by one proton (n=1), triplet by two, quartet by three, etc.

The first signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Let me parse that. Wait, actually, the order matters. It's like a doublet of (triplet of quartets), but I might be getting the order wrong. Alternatively, each split is applied in a certain order.

Wait, perhaps it's a doublet of triplets, which is then split into quartets. Or it's a quartet split into triplets, then into doublets. Hmm, maybe I should think about how many neighboring sets each proton is experiencing.

Alternatively, think about each splitting step. For example, a doublet of triplets would be each peak in the doublet being split into triplets, leading to a triplet of doublets, but I'm not so sure. Alternatively, each splitting is applied in a certain order.

Wait, no
