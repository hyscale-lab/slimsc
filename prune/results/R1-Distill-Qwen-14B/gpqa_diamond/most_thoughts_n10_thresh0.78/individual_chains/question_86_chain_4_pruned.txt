Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read through it carefully. Hmm, the question is about a chemist performing two reactions using two different reducing agents on unknown compounds. The goal is to figure out what the starting materials (A and B) are from the options given.

The products for both reactions are the same: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So each reaction gives a different enantiomer of the same product.

I remember that the stereochemistry of the product depends on the reducing agent used. From what I've learned, there are different conditions for the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols and for the reduction of esters or other carbonyl groups.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The product is a ketone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the starting materials must have been something that upon reduction would form this ketone. Oh, maybe the starting materials were esters or some other carbonyl compounds.

Wait, but the reactions are using two different reducing agents. One reaction uses LiBH4 with H+, and the other uses BH3 with H+. Wait, no, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. But BH3 is typically used for selective reductions, maybe in the presence of something else? Or maybe in a different solvent.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the specific reactions. Oh, right! LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce esters and ketones. But BH3 is usually used for the reduction of ketones but maybe not esters? Or wait, another thought: When you reduce an ester, the stereochemistry of the resulting alcohol depends on the reducing agent.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think about the reduction of epoxides or something elseâ€”no, probably not. Oh wait, maybe the starting materials are cyclic esters, like lactones. Because when you reduce a lactone, you get
