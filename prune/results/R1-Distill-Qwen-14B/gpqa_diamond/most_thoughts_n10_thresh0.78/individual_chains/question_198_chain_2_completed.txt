Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We're supposed to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, I remember that stability constants (β) tell us about the tendency of a complex to form. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So each β corresponds to a different complex. Let me think about the complexes here.

The complexes probably form as Co(SCN)n^2- where n is 1, 2, 3, 4. So the possible species are Co(SCN), Co(SCN)₂, Co(SCN)₃, Co(SCN)₄. Each has its own stability constant βn.

The problem is about calculating the fraction (or percentage) of the dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the one with two SCN- ligands, so Co(SCN)₂²+. So the percentage is of this species relative to all possible cobalt species.

I think the approach is to calculate the distribution of each complex based on their stability constants and concentrations. So first, I should probably write down the formation reactions and expressions.

The general formation for each complex would be:

Co²+ + n SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)_n²− with stability constant βn = [Co(SCN)n²−] / ( [Co²+][SCN^-]^n )

But wait, when considering the distribution, the overall concentrations depend on the βs and the initial concentrations of Co²+ and SCN^-.

But wait, the total Co concentration is 1e-2 M. So all the Co is either in the free ion form or in one of the complexes. Similarly, the SCN is 0.1 M, which is much higher than the Co concentration, so it's available in excess.

Wait, but when calculating the distribution, each complex's concentration can be expressed in terms of the free Co²+ concentration. Let me think about that.

Let me denote [Co²+] as x. Then,

[CoSCN] = β1 * x * [SCN]^1
[Co(SCN)₂] = β2 * x * [SCN]^2
[Co(SCN)3] = β3 * x * [SCN]^3
[Co(SCN)4] = β4 * x * [SCN]^4

But wait, the free Co²+ concentration is x, and all the complexes add up to the total Co concentration. So:

x + [CoSCN] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4] = c(Co) = 1e-2 M

But that's a bit complicated because each term is in terms of x and [SCN]. Hmm, but how much does the binding affect the [SCN]?

Wait, [SCN] is given as 0.1 M, which is much higher than the total Co concentration (1e-2 M is 0.01 M). So for each Co²+ ion, it can bind up to four SCN- ions. The total amount of SCN- that could be consumed is 4 * 0.01 M = 0.04 M, which is much less than the initial 0.1 M, so we can approximate [SCN] as constant.

So, [SCN^-] ≈ 0.1 M in each term.

So each complex's concentration becomes:

[CoSCN] = β1 * x * (0.1)
[Co(SCN)₂] = β2 * x * (0.1)^2
[Co(SCN)3] = β3 * x * (0.1)^3
[Co(SCN)4] = β4 * x * (0.1)^4

Then, the total Co is x + β1 x (0.1) + β2 x (0.1)^2 + β3 x (0.1)^3 + β4 x (0.1)^4 = 1e-2.

Factor out x:

x [1 + β1*(0.1) + β2*(0.1)^2 + β3*(0.1)^3 + β4*(0.1)^4 ] = 1e-2.

So, x = 1e-2 / [1 + β1*(0.1) + β2*(0.1)^2 + β3*(0.1)^3 + β4*(0.1)^4 ]

Hmm, let me compute each term in the denominator.

Compute each term:

β1*(0.1) = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

β2*(0.1)^2 =40 * 0.01 = 0.4

β3*(0.1)^3=63 * 0.001 = 0.063

β4*(0.1)^4=16 * 0.0001=0.0016

Sum these:

0.9 +0.4=1.3; +0.063=1.363; +0.0016=1.3646.

Add 1: 1 + 1.3646=2.3646.

So denominator is 2.3646. So x = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ ?

0.01 divided by 2.3646 is approximately 0.004224 M.

So x ≈ 4.224e-3 M.

Now, the concentration of each complex is:

[CoSCN] = 9 * x * 0.1 = 9 * 4.224e-3 * 0.1 = 9 * 4.224e-4 = 3.8016e-3 M.

[Co(SCN)₂] =40 * x * (0.1)^2=40 *4.224e-3 * 0.01 =40 *4.224e-5= 1.6896e-3 M.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me make sure. x is 4.224e-3. So:

CoSCN: β1 * x * 0.1 =9 * 0.004224 * 0.1 =9 * 0.0004224=0.0038016 M.

Co(SCN)₂: β2 * x * (0.1)^2=40 *0.004224 *0.01=0.00016896 M.

Co(SCN)3: β3 * x * (0.1)^3=63 *0.004224*0.001=63 *4.224e-6 =2.66112e-4 M.

Co(SCN)4: β4 *x*(0.1)^4=16*0.004224*0.0001=16*4.224e-8=6.7584e-7 M.

Wait, let me compute each:

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate each step again.

Calculating [CoSCN]:

9 * 0.004224 * 0.1 = 9 * 0.0004224 = 0.0038016.

[Co(SCN)₂]:

40 * 0.004224 * 0.01 =40 * 0.00004224=0.0016896.

Wait, wait that can't be right. Let me compute 0.004224 * 0.01 = 4.224e-5. Multiply by 40 gives 1.6896e-3, which is 0.0016896.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)3] =63 * 0.004224 *0.001=63 *4.224e-6 = 266.112e-6= 0.000266112.

Wait, no, wait: 0.004224 *0.001=4.224e-6. Multiply by 63: 4.224e-6 *63 ≈ 2.661e-4.

And [Co(SCN)4] =16 *0.004224 *0.0001=16 *4.224e-8= 6.758e-7.

Now, let's make sure that all these concentrations add up to 1e-2 M.

x is 0.004224.

Adding all:

x=0.004224

[CoSCN] =0.0038016 → total so far: 0.004224+0.0038016=0.0080256

+ [Co(SCN)₂]=0.0016896 → 0.0097152

+ [Co(SCN)3]=0.000266112 → 0.009981312

+ [Co(SCN)4]=0.0000006758 → approx 0.009982.

Wait, but our total Co is 1e-2=0.01 M. Oh wait, I think I messed up the calculation because the sum is 0.009982, which is less than 0.01. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate x.

Wait, the denominator was 2.3646, so x=0.01 / 2.3646.

Let me compute 2.3646 times 0.004224: 2.3646 * 0.004224 = Let's see:

0.004224 * 2 = 0.008448.

0.004224 * 0.3646 ≈ 0.004224 *0.3=0.0012672; 0.004224 *0.0646≈0.000273. So total ≈0.0015402. So total 0.008448 +0.0015402=0.009988, which is about 0.01. So yes, that's correct. So the sum of all complexes and free Co is about 0.01, so I think the calculation is correct.

Now, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think blue is Co(SCN)₂²+. So that's the second complex, which is [Co(SCN)₂], whose concentration is 0.0016896 M.

So the percentage is ( [Co(SCN)₂] / (total Co) ) * 100.

Total Co is 0.01 M.

So (0.0016896 / 0.01) *100 = 16.896%.

Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%, which matches this.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations because I might have miscalculated the [Co(SCN)₂].

Wait, let me re-calculate [Co(SCN)₂]:

β2 is 40, x is 0.004224, [SCN]=0.1.

So [Co(SCN)₂] = 40 * 0.004224 * (0.1)^2.

(0.1)^2 is 0.01.

So 40 * 0.004224 = 0.16896, multiplied by 0.01 → 0.0016896 M.

Yes, that's correct.

So 0.0016896 / 0.01 = 0.16896, which is 16.896%, so approximately 16.9%.

Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%.

So the answer should be D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, Co(SCN)₂²⁺, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants and the given concentrations. The total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16.

The complexes formed are Co(SCN), Co(SCN)₂, Co(SCN)₃, and Co(SCN)₄, with their concentrations expressed in terms of the free Co²⁺ concentration, denoted as \( x \). Using the stability constants and the approximation that [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M (since SCN⁻ is in excess), the concentrations of the complexes are:

\[
[\text{Co(SCN)}] = \beta_1 x [\text{SCN}] = 9x(0.1)
\]
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)}_2] = \beta_2 x [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40x(0.1)^2
\]
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)}_3] = \beta_3 x [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63x(0.1)^3
\]
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)}_4] = \beta_4 x [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16x(0.1)^4
\]

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of the free Co²⁺ and all complexes:

\[
x + [\text{Co(SCN)}] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_2] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_3] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_4] = 10^{-2}
\]

Substituting the expressions for the complexes:

\[
x + 9x(0.1) + 40x(0.1)^2 + 63x(0.1)^3 + 16x(0.1)^4 = 10^{-2}
\]

Factoring out \( x \):

\[
x \left[ 1 + 9(0.1) + 40(0.1)^2 + 63(0.1)^3 + 16(0.1)^4 \right] = 10^{-2}
\]

Calculating the terms inside the brackets:

\[
1 + 9(0.1) + 40(0.1)^2 + 63(0.1)^3 + 16(0.1)^4 = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

Thus:

\[
x = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 0.004224 \, \text{M}
\]

Now, calculate the concentration of Co(SCN)₂:

\[
[\text{Co(SCN)}_2] = 40x(0.1)^2 = 40(0.004224)(0.01) = 0.0016896 \, \text{M}
\]

The percentage of Co(SCN)₂ among all cobalt species is:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)}_2]}{\text{Total Co}} \times 100 = \frac{0.0016896}{0.01} \times 100 = 16.896\%
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, the percentage is approximately **16.9%**, which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
