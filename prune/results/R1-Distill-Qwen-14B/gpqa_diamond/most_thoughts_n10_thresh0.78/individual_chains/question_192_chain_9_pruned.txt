Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to electrostatics, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question says there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the main conductor's center. The cavity's radius is r, and r is less than R. So, the cavity is entirely inside the conductor.

Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the main conductor's center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Both L and l are greater than R. Also, the angle between l and s is theta.

The options are given, and I need to choose the right expression for E.

Hmm, okay. I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields. Since the conductor is uncharged, but there's a charge inside the cavity, I think that would induce some charge distribution on the conductor's inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, for a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the charges reside on the surface, right? And the electric field inside the conductor material (not cavity) is zero. But here, the cavity is inside, and there's a charge there.

So, when a charge is placed inside the cavity of a conductor, it induces charges on the inner surface of the conductor. But since the conductor itself is neutral, the inner surface will have an induced charge opposite to q, and the outer surface will have the same charge as q, because the total charge on the conductor is zero.

Wait, no. Wait, the conductor is neutral. So the total charge on it is zero. So if the inner surface has a charge of -q (because of the +q inside the cavity), the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance it out. Because the conductor is neutral overall: inner surface is -q, outer surface is +q, so total is 0.

But wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, the conductor is neutral, so the total induced charge on the conductor is zero. So when you have +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will have a charge of -q, because that's induced by the +q. Then, since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to make the total zero. Because inner is -q, outer is +q, so overall it's zero.

So the conductor's outer surface has a charge +q.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor. So the electric field at P would be due to the charge on the outer surface of the conductor, which is +q.

But wait, how does the charge distribution on the conductor look? Since the cavity is off-center, the charge distribution on the conductor's outer surface won't be uniform, right? Or is that not the case?

Wait, no. Oh, wait, wait. For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside depends only on the
