Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about isomers and some compounds. Hmm, I need to figure out which compound doesn't show tautomerism and which one exhibits optical isomerism. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions that constitutional isomers differ in structure, while stereoisomers differ in spatial arrangement. But the actual question is about tautomerism and optical isomerism.

Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism. The options given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I remember that tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen and the shift of a bond, like in keto-enol tautomerism. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups, right? Wait, wait—benzoquinone is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. So, I think benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism because it has adjacent carbonyl groups. But wait, no—tautomerism usually requires a conjugated system where a hydrogen can shift. Benzoquinone is a di-ketone. Let me think. For tautomerism, you typically need something like a keto-enol structure, where a hydrogen can move from one oxygen to another, causing the double bond to shift. In benzoquinone, the structure is two carbonyl groups on a benzene ring. So, perhaps the structure is such that tautomerism isn't possible because the necessary conjugated system isn't present? Or maybe the two carbonyls are too far apart? Alternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is the one that doesn't show tautomerism. Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups spaced at 1,3,5 positions. So, it's a six-membered ring with three ketones. How about tautomerism? I think that in the case of 1,3,5-tr
