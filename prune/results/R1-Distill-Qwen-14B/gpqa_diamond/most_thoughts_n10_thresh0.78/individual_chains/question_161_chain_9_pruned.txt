Okay, so I'm trying to solve this electron microscopy question. Let me think through it step by step. 

The scenario is about a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 1000 kV. Mike uses vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum, which is less than 10^-9 Torr. He did this because a vacuum reduces gas molecules in the sample compartment, which is good for electron microscopy since fewer gas molecules mean less scattering of electrons.

But despite the vacuum pumps, some gas particles remained, as detected by a mass spectrometer. Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? It depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and the volume of the compartment.

Now, when he starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes to λ2. The question is, what can we conclude about λ2 compared to λ1? And this happens even though the temperature remains the same.

Hmm. I remember that the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the pressure (P) and directly proportional to the average speed (v) of the gas molecules. The formula I think is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the gas molecules, and P is pressure. Oh wait, but wait, another way to write it is λ = (v_avg)/(√2 * π * n * d²), where n is the number density.

But wait, when the electron beam is on, does that affect the gas? Well, the electron beam is high-energy, 1000 kV. That's a lot. High-energy electrons can cause various effects. One possibility is that the electrons collide with the gas molecules, ionizing them or causing them to emit electrons—like in the process of secondary electron emission. 

Wait, but another thought: the electron beam itself is a source of energy. High-energy electrons can cause gas molecules to become ionized. So, when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might get ionized. If they become charged, they would behave differently in the vacuum. 

Ah, right. In a vacuum, charged particles (ions) are more likely to interact with the walls of the chamber or other charged particles. But wait, the scenario says that the sample compartment's temperature is the same, so thermal effects like increased molecular speed aren't changing. So why would the mean free path change?

Wait, the mean free path depends on the pressure and the cross-sectional area for collisions. If the gas becomes ionized, the effective cross-sectional area for collisions might change. But wait, more importantly, when a gas molecule is ionized, it becomes charged. Charged particles in a vacuum might experience different behavior. 

Alternatively, maybe the ionization causes the gas molecules to stick to the walls or other surfaces more effectively. But in an ultra-high vacuum, the mean free path is already very long because the pressure is so low. So any process that causes the gas molecules to stick or be removed more effectively would increase the mean free path, right?

Wait, but wait. When the electrons are present, perhaps the gas molecules are being bombarded, causing them to stick to the walls or the sample. Or perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to be pumped out more effectively, but that seems less likely.

Alternatively, could the electron beam cause the gas to become a plasma? Well, at such low pressures, maybe not a full plasma, but perhaps a low-density ionized gas. In that case, the mean free path might change because charged particles interact differently—maybe more collisions between ions and electrons, but how does that affect the mean free path for the gas molecules?

Wait, another angle: in the absence of the electron beam, the gas molecules are neutral. When the electron beam is on, it can cause them to ionize. So, the number of neutral molecules decreases, and ions increase. But ions have a different behavior. Do they contribute to the mean free path in the same way?

Wait, the mean free path λ1 was calculated based on the neutral gas. When
