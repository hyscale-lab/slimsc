Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if a star is closer, its parallax is larger, and if it's farther away, the parallax is smaller. Like, plx = 1/distance, or something like that. Wait, no, actually, the formula is plx (in parsecs) equals 1 over the distance in parsecs. So if a star is 1 parsec away, the parallax is 1 arcsecond. If it's 2 parsecs, 0.5 arcseconds, right.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, uniform in what sense? I think it means that the number density of stars is constant in space. Like, the same number per cubic parsec everywhere. So, number density n is uniform.

I need to find how the number of stars per unit parallax interval (like a slice) changes with plx. So, for a given plx range, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there?

Let me visualize. Parallax decreases as distance increases. So higher plx means closer stars, lower plx means farther away. So the number of stars in a certain plx interval would depend on the volume of space corresponding to that interval.

Wait, how do I relate plx to distance? Oh, right, plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So d = 1/plx. So for a given plx, the distance is 1/plx. So, if I have a parallax range dplx, that corresponds to a distance range. Let me calculate that.

Let me think about a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd. The volume of this shell would be the surface area multiplied by the thickness. The surface area of a sphere is 4πd². So the volume is 4πd² dd.

But wait, wait. Since the parallax is related to distance as d =
