Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between two planets. Alright, let me start by reading through the question again to make sure I get all the details right.

So, the setup is that there are two planets orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. The two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, have different masses and radii. Planet1 is 7 Earth masses and 1.7 Earth radii, while Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both are in circular orbits.

The question mentions detection via transit and radial velocity methods. Oh right, the transit method detects planets when they pass in front of the star, causing a dip in brightness. Radial velocity detects through the Doppler shift as the star moves due to the planet's gravity.

The data given here are about Doppler shifts. Planet1 induces a shift of up to 0.03 Å in the [OI] line at 6300 Å, and Planet2 causes a shift of up to 0.04 Å on the same line. Wait, but the RV method measures the velocity of the star, which relates to the planet's mass and the orbital period. Hmm.

But the question is about equilibrium temperatures. Oh, right, the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. The formula I remember is Te = [ ( L / (16πσ) ) * (1 - a) / d² ) ]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is the planet's albedo, σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and d is the distance between the planet and star.

Wait, but since both planets have the same albedo, 'a' cancels out when taking the ratio. So, the ratio of their temperatures will depend on the inverse square of their distances from the star.

But how do I find their distances? Because the problem gives Doppler shifts due to each planet. The Doppler shift in the RV method relates to the velocity of the star, which is due to the planet's gravitational influence. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ) * (1 / (1 AU) )^(1/3) ) * (1 year)^(-1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should recall the formula for the RV semi-amplitude. The formula is usually:

K = [ ( (G) * (M_p) * sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * ( (2π) / P ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the relation between velocity amplitude and planetary mass and orbital period.

Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(2/3) ) ) / (sqrt(1 - e²))

But since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that term is 1. So, K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) ) * (1/P)^(1/3) )

Wait, but in this problem, we can probably assume that M_p is much smaller than M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So for each planet, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3)) * (1/P)^(1/3) )

Wait, but K is given for each planet. So for Planet1 and Planet2, K1 and K2 are given. The star's mass is 1.5 solar masses. So, the question is, for each planet, how does K relate to their orbital periods and masses?

Wait, but the RV semi-amplitude K is the velocity of the star due to the planet. So the relation is K = (v) = ( (G * P ) / (2π) ) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M
