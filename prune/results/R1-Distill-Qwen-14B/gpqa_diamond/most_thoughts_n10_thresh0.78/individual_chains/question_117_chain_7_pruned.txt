Okay, so I have this chemistry question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism is when a molecule has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are carbons attached to four different groups. So the molecule can't be a plane mirror image of itself, which leads to enantiomers.

The question is asking which of the four moieties show optical isomerism. Let's go through each one step by step.

1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**. Biphenyl structures can sometimes have stereoisomerism if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image. But wait, I think biphenyls can have something called geometric isomerism (cis or trans) when the substituents are on both rings. But does that lead to optical isomerism? Oh wait, no. Because geometric isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism, but it's not optical isomerism. Optical isomerism requires chirality, which is when a molecule isn't superimposable on its mirror image due to a chiral center. But if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. Biphenyl rings have a central bond, so if the substituents are para on each ring, maybe it's symmetrical. Wait, in this case, substituents are at positions 2 and 2', and 6 and 6' are nitro groups. The molecule is symmetrical across the central bond? Let me visualize: if both 2 and 2' are substituted, and 6 and 6' as well. If both are on the same side or opposite, maybe the molecule has a center of symmetry. So perhaps no chiral centers here. So no optical isomerism. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong. Wait, are the substituents in positions
