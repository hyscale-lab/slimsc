Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. I'll take it slow and think out loud.

The question involves a series of reactions leading to a final product, and we need to determine how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present in that product. The options are A)8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

Hmm, let's break down the problem. The starting compound is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I remember that bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is norbornene, so that's the structure we're dealing with. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So the starting material is norbornene with a tert-butoxy substituent.

The first step is reacting this with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. So, what kind of reaction is this? Sodium iodide is a source of iodide ions, which are good nucleophiles. The dibromomethyl groups on cyclohexa-1,3-diene probably are leaving groups, so this looks like an elimination or substitution reaction.

Wait, but the diene has two dibromomethyl groups at positions 5 and 6. When this reacts with a diene like norbornene, perhaps it's a Diels-Alder reaction? Oh wait, the norbornene is a diene, and the other compound is a dienophile? No, wait, norbornene is a conjugated diene, but 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene is also a conjugated diene, isn't it? So maybe it's a [4+4] cycloaddition or something else. Hmm, but [4+4] is less common.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction. The dibromomethyl groups are good leaving groups (since they're leaving as Br- under SN conditions, but in this case, sodium iodide is present, which might cause an exchange. Wait, perhaps it's a ring-opening or some kind of coupling.

Wait, another thought: when dienes react with dienophiles, it's Diels-Alder. But here, the starting material is norbornene, which is a bicyclic diene, and the other component is another diene. Hmm, maybe not Diels-Alder. Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is something else.

Wait, maybe the 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a dienophile, and the norbornene is the diene. But wait, then the dienophile
