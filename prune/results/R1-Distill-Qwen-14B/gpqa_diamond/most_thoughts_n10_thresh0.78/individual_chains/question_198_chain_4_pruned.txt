Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read through it again and think about what I need to do. Hmm, it's about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in solution. The concentrations given are c(Co) = 10^-2 M and [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that stability constants (formation constants) indicate the tendency of a complex to form. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So higher β means the complex is more likely to form.

The problem is about the distribution of Co species in solution. The Co can form different complexes with SCN- ions. The complexes are probably [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) where n is 0 to 4. But wait, the question specifically mentions the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think that's [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ which is the blue one. So they're asking what percentage of all the Co species is this particular complex.

I remember that the fraction of each species can be found using the stability constants. The idea is to calculate the concentration of each possible complex relative to the free ion, then sum them all up to find the percentages.

Each complex can be represented as Co(SCN)_n^2−n. The formation of each complex step-wise. So the first complex is Co(SCN)^(+) maybe? Wait, no, let's think again. The initial ion is Co²+. SCN- is a ligand. So the first complex would be Co(SCN), which is CoSCN with charge 0? Or maybe Co(SCN) with a charge of 2+ - SCN is -1 each, so for n=1, charge is 2+ -1 = +1. Hmm, but I think the general formula is [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n). So for n=0, it's Co²+; n=1, [Co(SCN)]^+; n=2, [Co(SCN)_2]^0; n=3, [Co(SCN)_3]^-; n=
