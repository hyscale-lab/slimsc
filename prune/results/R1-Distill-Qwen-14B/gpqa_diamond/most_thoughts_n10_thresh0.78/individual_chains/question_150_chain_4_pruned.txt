Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Oh wait, molecular formula... let me calculate the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. So 2*8 +2 =18. 18-9=9. 9 -1 (N) = 8. 8 +1 (since O is treated as a substituent?) Wait, actually, the formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Since X (halogens) are zero here, it's (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2. That's (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a couple rings and double bonds.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 (t, 1H). That's a triplet around 9.7 ppm. High up, probably an aldehyde proton. But wait, the integration is 1H. So maybe an aldehyde group.

Then 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H). Those are likely two sets of doublets, suggesting a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. Each doublet would be two protons each, so perhaps two substituents on the ring, each causing the adjacent protons to split into doublets. So maybe two substituents on a benzene ring, each in the para positions relative to each other. Wait, no, actually, if two substituents are para, then each substituent would have two protons adjacent, giving each a doublet. Hmm, like if a benzene ring has two substituents, say, in the para positions, but each substituent is a group that deactivates the ring, causing the protons ortho to them to be deshielded.

Wait, but the first substituent's protons would be more downfield. So the 6.98 and 6.51 could be two sets of two protons each, which might be para-substituted benzene rings. Alternatively, perhaps each is part of a different substituent.

Wait, the next peak is 6.27 (bs, 2H). Broad singlet. 2H. What could that be? Maybe an enol proton? Or perhaps a di-substituted aromatic ring, but I'm not sure.

Then 3.66 (d, 2H). A doublet, integral 2H. That looks like a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom, like an oxygen. Maybe -CH2-O- something, or adjacent to a carbonyl.

Putting this together. So the molecule has an aldehyde group (the 9.72 ppm triplet). Then perhaps two aromatic rings, each with substituents. Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me see the structure. Let's count the carbons. The aldehyde is one. Then, perhaps a benzene ring (6 C) plus another substituent.

Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So 8 carbons. Let's think about possible structures. Maybe it's a substituted benzaldehyde with substituents. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene ring connected to a chain that includes the aldehyde and other groups.

Wait, the NMR shows two aromatic regions. The 6.98 and 6.51 could be two different aromatic environments. Alternatively, perhaps one is a para-substituted benzene and another is a di-substituted, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the NMR again, the 9.72 ppm is a triplet. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm as singlets. A triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. But wait, aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and don't have neighboring Hs. Unless... wait, maybe it's not an aldehyde. Another possibility: an acidic proton, like an enol or something else. Or
