Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this qPCR question. Let's see, I remember that qPCR is used to quantify DNA or RNA by measuring the amount of fluorescence during each cycle. The calibration curve helps determine the initial amount of target nucleic acid in a sample.

The scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He diluted it in a series and ran three technical replicates each. The efficiency is 100%, which means each cycle doubles the DNA perfectly. The R² is 1, so the data fits the curve perfectly. The slope is -3.3. Hmm, wait, I thought the slope for a standard curve is usually around -3.3 or -3.4 because of the log2 vs log10 thing. Oh right, because the standard formula is Ct = slope * log(target) + intercept. So a slope of -3.3 makes sense because log10(n) is converted to log2, which would change the slope.

Looking at the data, the Ct values for each dilution are pretty close but not exactly the same between replicates. Let's see the numbers:

At 100000 copies: 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. So average around 34.2. The next is 10000 copies, Ct is around 30.9. Then 1000: 27.6. 100 copies: 24.3. 10 copies: 21.

Wait, each dilution is a tenfold decrease. So the expected Ct should increase by about 3.3 cycles each time, because each tenfold dilution should lower the quantity by a factor of 10, and since efficiency is 100%, the Ct should change by log2(10) which is about 3.32. So the slope is -3.3, which aligns with that. So each tenfold dilution should lead to a Ct increase of about 3.3.

Looking at the data:

From 100000 to 10000: 34.2 to 30.9. The difference is about 3.3 (30.9 - 34.2 = -3.3), which makes sense.

10000 to 1000: 30.9 to 27.6. Difference is 3.3.

1000 to 100: 27.6 to 24.3. Again, 3.3.

100 to 10: 24.3 to 21. Oh wait, that's a difference of 3.3 as well. So each step is a 10-fold dilution, and the Ct increases by 3.3 each time. So the data seems consistent.

But the question is about the discrepancies in his results. The options are A to D.

Option A says qPCR can't quantify nucleic acids. But he got good R² and 100% efficiency, which suggests it's working. So A is not correct.

Option B: Ct values not in agreement with target. But his Ct values are as expected. So B is probably wrong.

Option C: Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, but each ten-fold leads to a 3.3 cycle change. So the dilution is exactly 3.3 cycles. So C is maybe incorrect? Or maybe it's phrased another way.

Wait, the question is about the discrepancies. But the data seems consistent, right? Because each dilution's Ct increases by 3.3 cycles. So why are there discrepancies? Or maybe the question is pointing out that the Ct values are as expected, and the options are talking about possible problems.

Wait, the data points look
