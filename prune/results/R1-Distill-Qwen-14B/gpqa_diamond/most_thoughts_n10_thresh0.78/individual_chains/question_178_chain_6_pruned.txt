Okay, so I've got this physics problem about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives a Lagrangian: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, where σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, I remember that the mass dimension is important for renormalizability. A theory is renormalizable if the coupling constant has a mass dimension ≤ 0, right? Or wait, wait. Wait, no. The general rule is that for a theory to be renormalizable, the coupling constants must have mass dimension ≤ 4 in 4 dimensions. Because in 4D spacetime, the action has to be dimensionless, considering the integration measure d^4x which has dimension -4 (since in natural units, [x^μ] = 1, so d^4x has [d^4x] = -4 because each dx is dimension 1 and you integrate four times). So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because the action is ∫ d^4x L, which is dimensionless.

Wait, no, wait again. The Lagrangian density itself must have mass dimension 4 because when you multiply by d^4x (dimension -4), the action becomes dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have [Lagrangian] = 4.

So each term in the Lagrangian has mass dimension 4. So in L_int, which is the interaction term, we have κ multiplied by some fields and other terms. Let's find the mass dimension for each part.

The fields: ψ is a Dirac spinor, so [ψ] = 3/2. Because in 4D, the Dirac field has mass dimension 3/2. Then ψ̄ is the same, [ψ̄] = 3/2.

Then σ_{μν} is a product of γ matrices. The γ matrices are dimensionless, right? Because they are just matrices, not operators with any mass dimension. So [σ_{μν}] is 0.

F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism or something similar. The field strength tensor F^{μν} is made from the derivatives of the gauge field A. So [F^{μν}] is the same as [∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ]. The derivative ∂ has mass dimension 1, and A has [A] = 1, because in Maxwell theory, the gauge field has dimension 1. So each term in F is [∂ A] = 1 + 1 = 2. So [F] = 2.

Putting it together, the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν} has mass dimension: [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F]. So 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2. Let's calculate that: 3/2 + 3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimension 5.

But the Lagrangian term is κ multiplied by this. So the entire term in the Lagrangian has dimension [κ] + 5. But wait, wait, no. No, wait. Because the Lagrangian term is κ times that product. So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. So:

κ times (ψ̄ σ ψ F) must have dimension 4. So [κ] + 5 =4 → [κ] = 4-5 = -1
