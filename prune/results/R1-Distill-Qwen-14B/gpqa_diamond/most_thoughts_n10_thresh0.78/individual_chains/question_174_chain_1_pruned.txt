Okay, so I've got this physics problem to work through. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. We need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the one calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Wait, wait. So the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. But since they have different masses, their velocities will be different.

First, I think I should figure out the rest masses of the two fragments. Let me denote the less massive fragment as m, so the other is 2m. The sum is m + 2m = 3m. But the sum is 99% of M, so 3m = 0.99 M. So m = (0.99 M)/3 = 0.33 M. So the two masses are 0.33 M and 0.66 M? Wait, wait, because 2m is the more massive fragment. So the more massive is 2m, which is 2*(0.33 M) = 0.66 M. Right, so fragment 1 is 0.66 M, fragment 2 is 0.33 M.

But wait, the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. So the rest mass energy of the original nucleus is 300 GeV. After fission, the rest masses of the two fragments sum to 99% of M, which is the initial rest mass. So their rest masses are less than the initial due to binding energy released, but here, it's given that the sum is 0.99 M, implying that each fragment's rest mass is a fraction of the initial.

Wait, but wait, the rest mass of the original is M. After fission, the sum of the rest masses is 0.99 M. So that's a 1% loss in rest mass, which probably goes into kinetic energy and other forms like radiation or maybe other particles, but the problem says "and nothing else," so maybe all the energy goes into kinetic? Or perhaps the problem is considering only the rest masses and kinetic energies of the two fragments, and the rest is ignored. Hmm, but the problem states that the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M, so the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV, so each fragment's rest mass energy can be calculated.

Wait, but the rest mass energy of each fragment is given by m1 c² and m2 c². The sum
