Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I need to figure out which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in a barley cultivar. Let me try to break this down.

The question says that the gene responsible has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis, which typically causes point mutations, usually by adding methyl groups to DNA bases, leading to transitions (like C to T or A to G). So probably, the mutations here are point mutations.

The intact gene's sequence is given, and so are the mutant sequences. The task is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. Since the compound is the product of this gene, if the gene is non-functional, the compound won't be made. So, we're looking for a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, probably by causing a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation) or a frameshift that changes the reading frame, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Looking at the sequences:

Intact gene starts with 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Let me write each mutant's first part:

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Wait, comparing to the intact gene, the first part of the mutant 1: the intact has TTTCTCGC, mutant 1 has TCTACGC. Hmm. Wait, the original is 'TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’ So let's look at each mutant's first exon.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look at the differences.

Mutant 1:
Original starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Let me compare each base. Let's see:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT ACG TGG TAC TT CTG TGG ATG AAC AT... Wait, maybe it's better to align the sequences.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for where the mutation occurs. Let's look for where the sequences differ.

Mutant 1:

Position where the original has TTTCTCGC, the mutant has TCTACGC.

Wait, let's index the positions:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant1: ATG TTT CT ACG TGG TAC TT CTG TGG ATG...

Wait, perhaps the change is at
