Okay, so I have this question about Feynman diagrams and loop calculations in quantum field theory. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it.

The question says that a colleague has a Feynman diagram with some numbers and constants written next to it. The note says alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. They want to know how many loops the diagram has.

I remember that in Feynman diagrams, the number of loops is related to the complexity of the diagram. Each loop contributes a certain factor to the calculation, and that shows up in the overall expression.

Wait, the general structure of loop integrals in perturbation theory includes factors from the loop integrals. For each loop, you typically get a factor of (1/(4π)^n), where n depends on the number of dimensions and the type of integral. Also, the number of loops affects the power of the coupling constants and other factors.

In four-dimensional spacetime (which the question says), the loop integrals contribute factors like (1/(4π)^L), where L is the number of loops. Wait, but I think each loop adds a 1/(4π)^2 factor. For example, a one-loop diagram would have (something) * (1/(4π)^2), a two-loop would have (1/(4π)^4), and so on. Because each loop contributes a 4-dimensional integral, which after regularization (maybe dimensional regularization) gives a 1/(4π)^something term.

Looking at the given expression, the denominator has (4pi)^6. So 4π raised to the 6th power. Let's see, how does that relate to the number of loops.

If each loop contributes a factor of (1/(4π)^2), then the number of loops L would be such that 2L = 6. So L=3. Because 2 loops would give 4, and three loops would be 6. So the number of loops is 3.

Wait, but let me think again. In QFT, each loop typically adds (1/(4π)^{d/2}) where d is the spacetime dimension. Wait, no, that's more for dimensional regularization. Alternatively, each loop in 4D would contribute a
