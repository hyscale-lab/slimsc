Okay, so I've got this NMR question here, and I need to figure out which two compounds are in the mixture. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says the solution is a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Then there are three singlets at 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Hmm. Let me think about the structure of these compounds. All the options are tetramethylbenzenes except for option C, which includes 1,4-diethylbenzene. Wait, no, 1,4-diethylbenzene would have two ethyl groups attached to the benzene ring. So that's something different to consider.

First, looking at the aromatic region. Two singlets each in a 1:1 ratio. So each compound must have a symmetrical structure that leads to a singlet. Because in an NMR, a singlet means there's no neighboring protons. So each aromatic compound in the mixture must have equivalent protons that produce a singlet.

Wait, wait. But there are two signals, each a singlet, in a 1:1 ratio. So each compound contributes one singlet, right? Because the mixture is 1:1, the integration would be 1:1 for each compound's aromatic protons.

Let me think about each option.

Option D is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene would have methyl groups at positions 1,2,4,5. So the structure is like two para positions (1 and 4) but also adjacent positions 2 and 5? Hmm, let me draw that.

Wait, benzene has six positions. So 1,2,4,5 would be like, positions 1,2,4,5. So substituting at positions 1, 2 (adjacent), 4 (across from 1?), and 5, which is adjacent to 4. Hmm, maybe the structure is symmetric.

Alternatively, maybe it's a para-substituted structure. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about each compound's symmetry.

For a benzene ring with four methyl groups, the structure could be various things. Let's see:

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: So the substituents are at positions 1,2,4,5. So that's two adjacent pairs? Like 1 and 2 are adjacent, and 4 and 5 are adjacent. Wait, but 4 is opposite to 1, right? Because in a benzene ring, 1 is opposite 4, and
