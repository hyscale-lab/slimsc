Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me jot down my thoughts.

The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. So, the compound is an aromatic ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows ester groups, which means there's an ester functional group present. Esters typically have carbonyl groups, so I'm thinking maybe it's something like a benzene ring with an ester substituent.

Looking at the NMR data: the 1H NMR spectrum has six signals. Let's break down each part.

First, the aromatic-H signals: two signals. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents can be in certain positions. Di-substituted benzene rings can have different substitution patterns like para, meta, or ortho. The number of signals in the aromatic region can tell me about the symmetry.

If it's para-substituted, there are two sets of aromatic protons. For example, in para-xylene, you have two types of aromatic Hs. Alternatively, if the substituents are in such a way that the ring has two equivalent environments, like in para, that would explain two signals. So that makes sense.

Next, the vinyl-H signals: two signals, one is a doublet and another a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically those on a double bond, like in an ester group. Wait, esters have carbonyl groups, but the vinyl might come from an alkene. Alternatively, in an ester, the R-O-CO-O-R' structure doesn't have a double bond. Oh wait, maybe the substituent isn't just an ester, but maybe there's a vinyl group attached elsewhere.

Wait, but the FTIR shows an ester peak, so ester is present. But the NMR has vinyl protons. So maybe the substituent is an ester group and another group with a double bond, like a vinyl group. Or perhaps the substituent is a group that has a double bond, such as an aromatic ester ring.

Alternatively, maybe the ester is attached in a way that creates a conjugated system. Hmm.

The two vinyl H signals: one is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. A doublet of quartets is a bit more complexâ€”maybe two neighboring groups? Wait, let's think about splitting. A vinyl group usually has two protons, each coupling with each other, which would give a doublet. But if there are other substituents, maybe the splitting is more complex.

Wait, another possibility: if the substituent is an ester that's part of a larger structure, like a benzene ring attached via an ester to another group. For example, maybe it's a benzene ring with two substituents: one ester group and another vinyl group. Or perhaps the ester is part of a substituent that has a double bond, like a propenoate ester.

Wait, but the ester group itself doesn't have vinyl protons. So perhaps the substituent is a benzyloxy group or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an acetyloxy group attached to the ring, but that wouldn't have vinyl H.

Hmm, maybe the substituent is a vinyl ester. Wait, but esters are usually R-O-CO-O-R'. If the R groups have a vinyl, like R being CH2CH2, but that's not a vinyl. Wait, maybe the substituent is a group like CH2CH2COO- but that's not a vinyl. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are such that one is an ester and the other is a vinyl group attached directly to the ring.

Wait, the problem says it's a di-substituted aromatic ring, so two substituents on the benzene. Each substituent could contribute to the NMR signals.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group (like OAc: acetate) and the other is a vinyl group, like a CH2CH3 or something else. But I'm not sure yet.

The other signals in
