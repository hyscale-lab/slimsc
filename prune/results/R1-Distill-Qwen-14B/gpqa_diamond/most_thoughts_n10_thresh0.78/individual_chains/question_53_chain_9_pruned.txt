Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the chemical formula of this di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. Let's see what I remember.

The question gives me some spectroscopy data: FTIR shows an ester group, so there's an ester functional group present. That usually means a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to an oxygen, with the structure R-O-CO-O-R... Wait, no, wait. Ester groups are typically R-O-CO-R, right? So the ester functional group has an oxygen connected to a carbonyl, which is connected to another R group.

Then, looking at the 1H NMR data. There are six signals:

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Hmm, a di-substituted benzene ring. Wait, in a benzene ring, the substituents can be in different positions. For a 1,2-disubstitution (ortho), the protons are in two different environments, so maybe two sets each with two protons? Or maybe one substituent is a meta director, but wait, the ring is 6-membered, so it's either benzene or something else like naphthalene. But the question says 6-membered, so it's benzene. Di-substituted benzene would have different splitting depending on substituents. Wait, but the number of signals matters. For di-substituted benzene, the number of aromatic protons can vary. For example, if the substituents are in the para position, the ring becomes symmetrical, and maybe the aromatic protons split into two doublets? Or maybe more. Let me think. If the substituents are para, you have two sets of aromatic protons: the ones ortho to each substituent and the ones meta. Wait, in para substitution, each substituent is opposite each other. So the ring would have two equivalent substituents, leading to two aromatic proton environments. Each substituent would have two protons adjacent (ortho) and two protons in the next position (meta), but in a para substitution, the ortho and para positions would be equivalent on either side. Wait, maybe if the substituents are para, the ring's remaining four protons are split
