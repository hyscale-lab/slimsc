Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that Compound X has certain IR and NMR data, and it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product from the given options.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually suggests the presence of an O-H or N-H stretch. But wait, the broadness here might indicate an O-H group, like in a carboxylic acid. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That makes me think of either a ketone or a carboxylic acid. But wait, the 1720 cm-1 is a bit lower than a typical carboxylic acid, which is usually around 1700. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or an acid chloride. Hmm, but the presence of a broad O-H peak could point towards a carboxylic acid.

Next, looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is very downfield. That's a strong indication of an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid proton. Since the integration is 1H, it's probably a carboxylic acid because aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm but can sometimes be a bit higher. Wait, but wait. The broad singlet (bs) at 10.5 ppm suggests it's a carboxylic acid, because aldehydes are usually sharp singlets, but maybe it's a broad peak if it's exchanging. So that's probably a -COOH group.

Looking further, there's a peak at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). Those are likely aromatic protons, probably in a para-substituted benzene ring. So the substituents are on the para positions. So that suggests a structure like para-substituted benzene.

Then, there's a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which is a multiplet. Maybe that's a CH adjacent to something electronegative, like an oxygen. Or maybe it's part of a chain attached to the benzene ring.

At 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), that's probably a CH2 group, maybe part of a chain attached to the aromatic ring. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a CH3 group attached to something, maybe a CH that's split into a doublet because of two neighboring protons. And finally, a triplet at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), which is likely a terminal CH3 group, like at the end of an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, the structure might be something like a benzene ring with a substituent that's a chain leading to a carboxylic acid. Wait, but the IR has a carbonyl at 1720, which is lower than a regular carboxylic acid (which is about 1700-1725 maybe? I'm a bit fuzzy on exact numbers). Wait, but wait, maybe it's an ester? Esters typically have a carbonyl around 1730-1750. So 1720 is a bit low for an ester, maybe more in line with a ketone, but then why the O-H peak?

Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, then maybe the carbonyl is around 1700, so 1720 could be a bit higher, but perhaps the environment affects the wavenumber. I'm a bit confused here. Wait, maybe it's an acid derivative, but I'll think more about the structure.

Looking at the NMR, the aromatic protons are in two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that's typical for a para-substituted benzene, where the substituent is in one position, and the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. So the substituent is probably a group attached to the benzene ring in the para position.

So, the substituent could be a chain. Let me think: we have a CH group (2.9 ppm, m, 1H), then a CH2 (1.7 ppm, m, 2H), then a CH3 (1.4 ppm, d, 3H) and another CH3 (0.9 ppm, t, 3H). Wait, that seems like a chain with a branch.

Let me imagine the substituent as a group attached to the benzene. It's something like CH2-C(CH2CH3)2? Or maybe a longer chain.

Wait, let me try to piece it together. The NMR for the CH3 groups: the 1.4 ppm is a doublet of 3H. That suggests that it's a CH3 attached to a CH that has two neighboring groups. So perhaps it's a CH(CH3) group, where the CH is attached to the benzene. Then, the CH2 at 1.7 ppm would be another CH2 group attached to that CH.

Wait, but the 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests it's a -CH2CH2CH3 group. Or maybe it's a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let me think: perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO
