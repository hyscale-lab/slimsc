Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and its energy states. Hmm, the question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. I remember that these models consider both the rotation and vibration of molecules as quantized states.

The problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon. We need to find the momentum of that photon that would cause the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state. The options are A to D, each giving a different momentum value.

Let me break down the given data:

Mass of X (Mx) is 20 amu. Oh wait, atomic mass units, right? And My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms. The angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Photons carry momentum, and when a molecule absorbs a photon, the energy of the photon should match the energy difference between two states.

So the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state for both rotation and vibration. But wait, no, the fundamental state in the rotation-vibration model refers to the lowest vibrational state with the lowest rotational state. So the molecule is in its ground state (v=0, J=0), maybe? Or perhaps it's the first vibrational state? I might need to clarify that.

Wait, no, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state. So the molecule is in the ground state,
