Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. Hmm. Particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles decay quickly and are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20 on average. One third of them reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Wait, so I think I need to relate the Lorentz factor to how far the particles travel before decaying. Because if a particle decays, it won't reach the detector walls. So the ones that reach the walls are those that haven't decayed yet when they travel the radius of the detector.

I remember that the distance a particle travels before decaying is related to its lifetime and velocity. Oh right, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. But from our frame, moving at high speed, the lifetime is dilated by the Lorentz factor, gamma. So the observed lifetime is gamma times the proper lifetime.

The distance traveled would be velocity times the lifetime. But velocity for ultra-relativistic particles is approximately the speed of light, right? So v ≈ c. So distance L = gamma * c * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime.

In the original case, with gamma = 20, one third of the particles reach the detector walls. That means the average lifetime allows them to travel 30 meters, but only one third make it. Wait, maybe I should think about the probability of decay.

Oh wait, decay processes are exponential. The probability that a particle hasn't decayed after time t is exp(-t/(tau)), where tau is the mean lifetime. But wait, tau is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime, tau_0. So tau = gamma * tau_0.

Time t is the time it takes for the particle to travel the radius of the detector, which is L = 30 meters. Time t = L / v ≈ L / c, since v is near c.

So the survival probability P is exp(- L/(c tau)). But tau is gamma tau_0, so:

P = exp(- L/(c gamma tau_0 )).

Wait, but in the problem, when gamma is 20, one third of the particles reach the walls. So P = 1/3. So:

1/3 = exp( - L/(c gamma tau_0) )

Taking the natural logarithm: ln(1/3) = - L/(c gamma tau_0 )

Which gives L/(c gamma tau_0) ) = ln(3)

So, L/(c tau_0) ) = gamma * ln(3)

But wait, when gamma increases, the exponential's exponent becomes less negative, so P increases. So when gamma is higher, more particles survive to reach the walls.

In the original case, gamma is 20, and P is 1/3. Now, we need to find the gamma needed so that P is 2/3.

So setting up the equation again:

2/3 = exp( - L/(c gamma tau_0) )

Taking ln:

ln(2/3) = - L/(c gamma tau_0 )

Multiply both sides by -1:

- ln(2/3) = L/(c gamma tau_0 )

Wait, but from the first case, we have:

L/(c gamma tau_0 ) = ln(3)

Because in the first case, the equation was:

L/(c *20 * tau_0 ) = ln(3)

So, substituting that into the second case:

From the second equation:

L/(c gamma tau_0 ) = ln(3) / (gamma / 20)

Wait, maybe it's better to write both equations.

First case: gamma1 = 20, P1 = 1/3.

So,

ln(1/3) = - L/(c gamma1 tau_0 )

Second case: gamma2 is what we need to find, P2 = 2/3.

So,

ln(2/3) = - L/(c gamma2 tau_0 )

Let me write each equation.

Equation1:

ln(1/3) = - L/(c *20 * tau_0 )

Equation2:

ln(2/3) = - L/(c gamma2 tau_0 )

I can divide equation2 by equation1 to eliminate L, c, and tau_0.

Let me see:

(equation2) / (equation1) = [ ln(2/3) ] / [ ln(1/3) ] = [ - L/(c gamma2 tau_0 ) ] / [ - L/(c*20 tau_0 ) ]

The negatives cancel, L, c, tau_0 all cancel. So:

[ ln(2/3) ] / [ ln(1/3) ] = (20) / gamma2

Let me compute ln(2/3) and ln(1/3).

ln(2/3) is ln(0.666...) which is approximately -0.4055.

ln(1/3) is ln(0.333...) which is about -1.0986.

So the ratio is (-0.4055)/(-1.0986) ≈ 0.369.

So,

0.369 ≈ 20 / gamma2

Rearranging:

gamma2 ≈ 20 / 0.369 ≈ 54.19.

So gamma2 is approximately 54, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the math.

Alternatively, perhaps using the natural logs more precisely.

ln(2/3) = ln(2) - ln(3) ≈ 0.6931 - 1.0986 = -0.4055.

ln(1/3) = -ln(3) ≈ -1.0986.

So yes, the ratio is (-0.4055)/(-1.0986) = 0.369.

So 0.369 = 20 / gamma2 → gamma2 = 20 /0.369 ≈ 54.2, which is 54. So the answer is A) 54.

Another way to think about it: since the survival probability is 2/3 when gamma is higher. The original gamma gives 1/3 survival. So as gamma increases, survival probability increases. So the required gamma should be higher than 20, but the options are A)54, B)68, etc. So A is higher than 20, so that makes sense.

Wait, but wait another thought. Is the survival probability proportional to 1/(gamma) or something else? Or perhaps I should think in terms of the relation between the two cases.

Wait, perhaps when gamma doubles, the survival probability increases, but not necessarily linearly.

In the first case, gamma1=20, P1
