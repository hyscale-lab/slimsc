Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, that's a 3-element vector, so it's a 3x1 matrix. So the system is in a 3-dimensional space, probably because the operators P and Q are 3x3 matrices.

The operators P and Q are given as square matrices. Let's note down their matrix elements.

Operator P:
- First row: 0, 1/√2, 0
- Second row: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2
- Third row: 0, 1/√2, 0

Operator Q:
- First row: 1, 0, 0
- Second row: 0, 0, 0
- Third row: 0, 0, -1

The question is, if we measure Q right after measuring P, what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, I think I remember that in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the system collapses into an eigenstate of the corresponding operator. So if we first measure P, then Q, the state after measuring P will influence the measurement of Q.

But wait, the question is about the probability of getting 0 in P and -1 in Q. So the steps are:

1. Measure P, get outcome 0. So find the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Then, the state collapses to that eigenvector. Then, compute the probability of measuring -1 in Q on this new state.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the probabilities step by step.

First, let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. Because when we measure P, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues, and the state collapses to the corresponding eigenvector.

So, operator P's matrix:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

What are the eigenvalues of P?

Hmm, finding eigenvalues involves solving det(P - λI) = 0.

Let me write down P - λI:

Row 1: [-λ, 1/√2, 0]
Row 2: [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0, 1/√2, -λ]

The determinant should be:

|P - λI| = (-λ) * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] + 0*(something).

Wait, this might get complicated. Maybe it's easier to notice the structure. Let's see if P is a symmetric matrix. Yes, since P is symmetric. So its eigenvalues should be real.

Alternatively, maybe P can be diagonalized more easily. Let me think about the structure. The matrix seems to have a pattern. The diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements follow a certain pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps P can be expressed in terms of some basis. For example, perhaps it's a permutation matrix scaled by 1/√2.

Wait, looking at the matrix P, it seems like it's swapping the positions. Let's see:

Row 1: 0 1/√2 0
Row 2: 1/√2 0 1/√2
Row 3: 0 1/√2 0

Hmm, perhaps this is a circulant matrix. Or maybe I can find its eigenvalues by considering the eigenvectors.

Alternatively, perhaps we can guess the eigenvalues. Let's think about what happens when we apply P to certain vectors.

What about the vector (1, 1, 1)?

P * (1,1,1) = (0*1 + (1/√2)*1 + 0*1,
               (1/√2)*1 + 0*1 + (1/√2)*1,
               0*1 + (1/√2)*1 +0*1 )

So each component becomes (1/√2, 2/√2, 1/√2 )

Wait, that doesn't seem to be a multiple of the original vector. So maybe not the eigenvector we thought.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.

Let me try e1 = [1,0,0]^T.

P*e1 = [0, 1/√2, 0]^T. Which is (1/√2) e2. So P*e1 = (1/√2) e2.

Similarly, e2 = [0,1,0]^T.

P*e2 = [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]^T = (1/√2)(e1 + e3).

Hmm, and e3 = [0,0,1]^T.

P*e3 = [0, 1/√2, 0]^T = (1/√2) e2.

Hmm, that's interesting. So maybe the eigenvectors are combinations of these.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the eigenvalues by considering the trace. The trace of P is 0, since all diagonal elements are zero. So the sum of eigenvalues is zero.

What about the determinant? The determinant
