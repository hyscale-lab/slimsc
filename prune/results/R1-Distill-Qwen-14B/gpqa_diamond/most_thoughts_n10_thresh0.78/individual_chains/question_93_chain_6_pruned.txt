Okay, so I'm trying to solve this qPCR question. Hmm, let me think. So, the scientist made a calibration curve using positive controls with known copy numbers. He ran serially diluted samples, each in three technical replicates. The efficiency was 100%, R2 was 1, and the slope was -3.3.

Wait, what do all these terms mean? Oh right, in qPCR, a calibration curve is made by plotting Ct values against the log of the starting quantity (like copies per microliter). The efficiency being 100% means each cycle perfectly doubles the DNA, so efficiency equation is 100% = (10^(1/E) - 1), but I think that's more about the calculation. R² being 1 means a perfect fit, so the data points should lie exactly on the line. Slope is -3.3— wait, the slope in a qPCR calibration curve is usually around -3.33 for a 100% efficient assay, because the formula is slope = -3.3219 / log(copy number base), so if the base is 10, it's -3.3219. So a slope of -3.3 makes sense here.

Now, the data given: the Ct values for each dilution. Let's look at them. For 100,000 copies, the Ct values are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The average would be around 34.2. For 10,000 copies, it's 30.6, 30.9, 31.2. Average about 31. So each 10-fold dilution (from 1e5 to 1e4) increases Ct by about 3.6. Wait, but in a perfect scenario, each 10-fold dilution should increase Ct by 3.3219 cycles (since each Ct is a log2 increase, and log2(10) is about 3.32). 

Wait, but the data shows a change from 33.9 to 30.6, which is a difference of about 3.3 cycles. Oh wait, from 33.9 to 30.6 is 3.3, because 33.9 minus 30.6 is 3.3. So each 10-fold dilution, the Ct increases by about 3.3, which aligns with the expected slope. But wait, the slope is -3.3, which usually is the slope when you plot Ct against log10 of copies. So the data seems to fit a perfect line with a slope of -3.3.

But the question is about the discrepancies in his results. The options are asking why there are discrepancies. Let me look at the options.

Option A: qPCR can't be used for quantification. No, that's not
