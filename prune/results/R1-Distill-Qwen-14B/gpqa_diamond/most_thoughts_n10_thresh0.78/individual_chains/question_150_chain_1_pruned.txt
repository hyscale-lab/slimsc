Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question gives a compound with molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and then a series of reactions are performed. I need to determine the final product from the given options.

First, I'll look at the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. The data is:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Let me think about each signal. The 9.72 ppm is a triplet, which might be an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm, so that fits. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. But wait, an aldehyde proton is usually a doublet because it's adjacent to only one CH2 group. Hmm, that's confusing. Or maybe it's part of a conjugated system?

Looking further, the 6.98 and 6.51 ppm are doublets. Those are likely aromatic protons. The 6.98 is a downfield shift, so that might be para-substituted phenyl groups, perhaps with electron-withdrawing groups nearby. The 6.51 is a bit upfield, so maybe it's a meta or ortho substitution, but considering the other signals, maybe it's another aromatic ring.

The 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for two protons. Broad usually indicates exchange, maybe like an -OH group? Or perhaps it's a vinyl proton adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, causing some broadening.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for two protons. That looks like a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, maybe oxygen. So perhaps a CH2-O structure.

Putting this together, maybe the compound has an aromatic ring and another aromatic ring attached. Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation formula: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So five degrees: likely two benzene rings (each contributes 4, but wait, no. Each benzene is 3 degrees (3 double bonds or one ring plus two double bonds). So two benzene rings would contribute 6 degrees. But here it's 5, so that can't be. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, molecular formula is C8H9
