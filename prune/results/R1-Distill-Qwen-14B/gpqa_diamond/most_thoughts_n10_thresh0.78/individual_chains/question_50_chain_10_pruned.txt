Okay, so I've got this question about quantum field theory and Feynman diagrams. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think this through. So the question is about figuring out how many loops a Feynman diagram has based on the "size estimate" expression given.

The expression is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. Alright, let's break down each part. I remember that in quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is related to the order of the process—specifically, the loop count affects the perturbative expansion order.

Wait, each loop typically contributes a factor of the coupling constant raised to a certain power, and also brings in factors from integrals, which often involve pi and other constants. I think the general idea is that the loop number relates to the number of vertices or propagators, but maybe more directly, each loop introduces a certain number of integrals, which would be reflected in terms like (4pi)^something in the denominator.

Wait, considering dimensional analysis and how loop integrals are handled. Each loop integral usually contributes factors like 1/(16 pi²) in four dimensions. Because the integral in four dimensions for a loop typically gives a term involving 1/( (4pi)^2 ) times some logarithmic terms or other functions, depending on the integral.

But how does that tie into the given expression? The denominator here is (4pi)^6. So if each loop brings a 1/(4pi)^2 factor, then 6 in the exponent would mean 3 loops because 2*3=6. So 3 loops would contribute (4pi)^6 in the denominator.

Wait, wait, but let me be precise. Each loop in a Feynman diagram contributes an integral that, when evaluated, brings a factor of 1/(16 pi²) or 1/( (4 pi)^2 ) multiplied by some function. So per loop, you get a 1/(4pi)^2 term. So if the denominator is (4pi)^6, then that would be 3 loops, since 3 * 2 = 6.

So looking at the expression: 1/(4pi)^6. That suggests three loops because 3 loops contribute (4
