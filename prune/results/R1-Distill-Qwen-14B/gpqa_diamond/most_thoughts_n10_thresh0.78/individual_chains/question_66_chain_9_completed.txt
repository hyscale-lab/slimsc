Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to think through this.

The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. So I need to remember what each of these symmetries entails and whether SMEFT operators are required to obey them.

First, I'll start by recalling what each symmetry is. Lorentz symmetry has to do with the invariance of the laws of physics under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. Since SMEFT is a field theory built using the same principles as the Standard Model, which is Lorentz invariant, SMEFT operators should also respect Lorentz symmetry. That makes sense because if the theory isn't Lorentz invariant, you might end up with issues in how different observers perceive physics.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare is a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations (like moving from one point to another in spacetime). The Poincare group includes all these symmetries. But wait, when we talk about operators in a theory, do they have to respect Poincare symmetry? I think that in the Standard Model, the theory is Poincare invariant, but when you add higher-dimensional operators (as in SMEFT), you can break some symmetries. But wait, no, SMEFT operators are constructed in a way that respects the symmetries of the Standard Model. So the operators are written in terms of the SM fields, which are Poincare invariant. So each operator must respect Poincare symmetry. Or wait, is Poincare symmetry automatically included because the theory is built in a way that respects it? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Because if Lorentz symmetry is respected, then Poincare would include that. But the question is whether all operators must respect Poincare symmetry. I think in SMEFT, the operators are built from the SM fields and their derivatives, so yes, they must be Poincare invariant because the SM is. So operators should respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetry. Wait, but Poincare includes Lorentz, so maybe the question is whether operators must respect Poincare. But I'm not entirely certain. Let's think again: in the Standard Model, all terms respect Poincare symmetry, so SMEFT as an effective theory should maintain that. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

Then, CP symmetry. CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. SMEFT doesn't necessarily respect CP symmetry. In the Standard Model, CP symmetry is approximate and not exactly conserved, especially in the electroweak sector. SMEFT can have terms that violate CP, like the Weinberg operator which is CP-even or others that might be CP-odd. So not all operators need to respect CP symmetry. Therefore, option 3 is not necessarily a symmetry that must be respected.

Lastly, CPT symmetry. CPT stands for Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. The CPT theorem states that in any Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, the product of C, P, and T symmetries must be a symmetry. So if the theory respects Lorentz symmetry, it must respect CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT is built respecting Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 must be respected.

Putting it all together: which of the options must be respected by all operators? So the operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4) symmetry. Wait, but earlier I was a bit confused about Poincare symmetry. Let me clarify. The SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translations. But the SMEFT operators are built as local operators, so they should respect Poincare symmetry. Because Poincare includes translations, which are about shifting in spacetime, and operators in a local theory should respect that by being constructed in a way that doesn't break it (like having terms that vary covariantly under translations). So yes, they must respect both Lorentz and Poincare.

Wait, but the options don't have an option that includes all three (1,2,4). Looking at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4.

Option D is 1,3,4. But 3 is CP which isn't necessarily.

So the correct symmetries that must be respected are 1, 2, and 4.

Wait, but I thought that operators in SMEFT are built from SM fields, which are Poincare invariant, and the operators themselves are products of SM fields and derivatives, so they are Poincare invariant. So yes, all operators must respect 1, 2, and 4.

Wait, but the original question is whether all operators must respect these symmetries. So for example, can an operator violate CP? I think yes. So Poincare is more than Lorentz symmetry. Because Poincare includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. So each operator must be a scalar under Poincare group.

Wait, but translation symmetry is automatically satisfied because the operators are written as local terms. So maybe the point is that the operators are built as Lorentz scalars, but whether they respect Poincare as a whole. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recall that in SMEFT, all operators are required to be Lorentz scalars (so they must respect Lorentz symmetry), and the frame of the theory is such that Poincare invariance holds, so the operators must be Poincare invariant as well. Also, since the theory is Lorentz-invariant, CPT symmetry is automatically respected.

So the correct symmetries that must be respected are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). So the options are: option C says 1,2,4. So the correct answer should be option C.

But wait, looking back at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So the answer is C.


The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). To answer this, we analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, as it builds upon the Standard Model, which respects Lorentz symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. Since SMEFT operators are constructed locally and covariantly, they respect Poincaré symmetry. Thus, all operators must also respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry is not necessarily respected by all operators in SMEFT. For example, some operators may explicitly violate CP symmetry, as seen in the Standard Model. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a strict requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The CPT theorem ensures that any Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, including SMEFT, must respect CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it automatically respects CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Among the given options, the correct choice is **C) 1, 2, 4**.

Answer: C
