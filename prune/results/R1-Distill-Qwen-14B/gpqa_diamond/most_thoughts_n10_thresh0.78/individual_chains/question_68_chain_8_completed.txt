Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm. The question is about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment in changing magnetic fields. I remember that spin-1/2 particles, like electrons, have their spin aligned with a magnetic field, which affects their energy levels.

Alright, the initial setup: the magnetic field is along the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment mu is gamma times Sz. So, mu = γ S_z. When the magnetic field is applied along Z, the particle's spin will align with it, meaning its state is an eigenstate of S_z. Right, eigenstates are the stationary states where measurements give definite values.

Then, the magnetic field is turned off and turned on again along the +Y direction. Both have the same magnitude B. So the first field is along Z, then they switch it to Y, same strength. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, what happens when the magnetic field changes? I think this is a problem involving time evolution under a Hamiltonian. Initially, the particle is in an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian when the field is along Z. But when the field switches to Y, the Hamiltonian changes, so the state is no longer an eigenstate, leading to time-dependent oscillations.

I remember that the energy levels of a spin in a magnetic field are given by E = -μ·B. Since μ here is γ S_z, when the field is along Z, the energy levels are E = -γ B S_z. For spin-1/2, S_z can be ± ħ/2. So the energies are ± (γ B ħ)/2.

But wait, when the field is switched to Y, the magnetic moment would interact with the B field along Y. So the new Hamiltonian is likely proportional to S_y. Let me think: the magnetic moment is mu = γ S, so the interaction energy is -μ·B. If B is along Y, then the Hamiltonian H becomes proportional to S_y. So H = γ B S_y (I think, but I should get the signs right. Maybe with a negative sign because mu·B is energy, but I think the direction is considered in the vector, so maybe H = -μ·B = -γ B S_z when B is along Z. Wait, no, mu is along the spin direction, and the energy is -mu·B. So when B is along Y, H is -γ B S_y. Or wait, wait—let me get this straight.

The magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma * S_z initially. But when the field is along Y, the moment would align with Y? No, the magnetic moment is a vector quantity. So the potential energy is U = -mu · B. So if B is along Y, U = -mu · B = -gamma S_z B Y-hat · Y-hat? No, wait, mu is a vector. If the field is along Y, then mu · B is gamma times S · Y-hat multiplied by B.

Wait, perhaps I should express S in terms of its components. S is a vector operator, so S = (S_x, S_y, S_z). So when B is along Y, the Hamiltonian H is proportional to S_y. Let me think again. The energy U is -mu · B. Since mu is gamma times the spin component along the field direction? Or is mu a vector that's aligned along the spin direction?

Wait, no. The magnetic moment mu is given as mu = gamma * S_z in the initial setup because the field is along Z. But in the problem statement, mu is defined as gamma * S_z, which suggests it's the z-component. But that might not be correct because the magnetic dipole moment for a spin is usually proportional to the spin operator S, not just S_z. Oh wait, maybe the problem says mu equals gamma times S_z, which would imply that the magnetic moment is along the z-direction. But that might not make sense if the field is then along Y. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, I think I made a mistake. The magnetic moment for a spin-1/2 particle is given by mu = gamma * S, where S is the spin vector operator (so a vector). So when the magnetic field is along Z, the potential energy is U = -mu · B = -gamma B S_z. That makes sense. But the problem says mu = gamma * S_z, which is a bit confusing because S_z is a scalar operator. Oh, perhaps the problem is oversimplifying, or perhaps mu is the z-component of the magnetic moment. Hmm, maybe the problem is considering mu as a vector whose magnitude is gamma * S_z, but that doesn't quite fit unless the field is along Z. Alternatively, perhaps mu is gamma times the vector S, so mu = gamma S. Then, when the field is along Z, mu_z is gamma S_z, which would make sense.

Well, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin vector. So mu = gamma * S, where S is the vector operator. Then, the energy is U = - mu · B. So when B is along Z, the energy is U = -gamma B S_z. When B is along Y, U = -gamma B S_y.

But wait, the initial state is when the magnetic field is along Z. So the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. Let's say the spin is in the up state along Z, which is |+z>, with S_z = ħ/2. So the initial state is |+z> before the field is switched.

Then, when the field is suddenly turned off and turned on along Y, the Hamiltonian changes. The state doesn't change instantaneously, so the wavefunction remains |+z> for an instant, but now the system evolves under the new Hamiltonian H = -gamma B S_y. Wait, but I think the sign might not matter much for the frequency, but I should pay attention.

Wait, let me double-check the sign. The potential energy is U = -mu · B. So if B is along Y, U = -gamma B S_y. So H = - gamma B S_y. Or wait, if mu is along the spin direction, then when B is along Y, mu · B would be mu_y * B, but mu is gamma S, so mu · B = gamma B S_y. So U = - mu · B = - gamma B S_y. So H = - gamma B S_y.

But for the purpose of finding the energy levels and the oscillation frequency, the sign might not matter because the energy difference will determine the frequency. Let me think about the time evolution of the state.

The state after the field is turned on along Y is the same as before the switch, which was |+z>. So we need to express this state in terms of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian. The new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, so its eigenstates are the eigenstates of S_y.

The eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the initial state |+z> can be written as a superposition of |+y> and |-y>.

Let me write |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>. I remember that the basis states can be rotated to find these relations. The standard way is to use rotation operators, but maybe it's easier to write the |+y> and |-y> states in terms of |+z> and |-z>.

The eigenstates of S_y are:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no, I think that's for S_x. Because S_x eigenstates are (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) for +x. S_y's eigenstates are similar but involve a phase factor. Wait, maybe it's |+y> = (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2) and |-y> = (|+z> - i |-z>)/sqrt(2). Or maybe the other way around. Let me think: the eigenstates of S_y are the same as for S_x but rotated by 90 degrees. So S_y is S_x rotated by 90 degrees about the z-axis. So the eigenstates would have a phase difference.

So, more accurately, the eigenstates of S_y are:

|+y> = (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - i |-z>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, let me check. The spin-up state in y direction should be a superposition of spin-up and spin-down in z, but with a phase factor. Because when you rotate the coordinate system by 90 degrees, the state picks up a phase.

So, if I have the initial state |+z>, which is (|+y> - i |-y>)/sqrt(2). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should write |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express the initial state |+z> as a combination of the new eigenstates. Since H is proportional to S_y, the energy eigenstates are |+y> and |-y>, with energies E_+ and E_-.

The initial state is |+z>, which can be expressed as a sum of |+y> and |-y> with coefficients a and b. Let me find a and b.

Expressing |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>:

|+z> = c_+ |+y> + c_- |-y>

We can solve for c_+ and c_- by taking inner products. Let's take the inner product with < +y |:

< +y | +z > = c_+ < +y | +y > + c_- < +y | -y > 

But < +y | +y > = 1 and < +y | -y > = 0. So c_+ is equal to < +y | +z >.

Similarly, c_- is < -y | +z >.

What is < +y | +z >? Let's use the expressions for |+y> and |-y>:

|+y> = (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2)
So < +y | +z > = [ < +z | + i < -z | ] / sqrt(2) ) * |+z> 
= (1 + 0) / sqrt(2) = 1/sqrt(2)

Similarly, < -y | +z > is the coefficient from |-y>:

|-y> = (|+z> - i |-z>)/sqrt(2)
So < -y | +z > = [ < +z | - i < -z | ] / sqrt(2) ) * |+z> 
= (1 + 0)/sqrt(2) = 1/sqrt(2)

Wait, that can't be right because |+y> and |-y> should be orthogonal to each other. Wait, let me recheck.

Wait, if |+y> = (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2), then the inner product < +y | +z > is (1 + 0)/sqrt(2) = 1/sqrt(2). Similarly, < -y | +z > is 1/sqrt(2). Hmm, but that would imply that |+z> is (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2), which doesn't match the earlier expressions. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the Pauli matrices to represent the states. For spin-1/2 particles, the spin states can be written as two-component vectors. Let me recall that the eigenstates of S_z are |+z> = [1; 0] and |-z> = [0; 1]. Similarly, for S_y, the eigenstates are |+y> = (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2) and |-y> = (|+z> - i |-z>)/sqrt(2).

So if |+z> is [1; 0], then:

|+y> = ( [1; 0] + i [0;1] ) / sqrt(2) ) = [1; i ] / sqrt(2)
|-y> = ( [1; 0] - i [0;1] ) / sqrt(2) ) = [1; -i ] / sqrt(2)

So, to find |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>, we can set up the equations:

|+z> = a |+y> + b |-y>

Which in vector form:

[1; 0] = a [1/sqrt(2), i/sqrt(2)] + b [1/sqrt(2), (-i)/sqrt(2)]

So equation 1: a (1/sqrt(2)) + b (1/sqrt(2)) = 1
Equation 2: a (i/sqrt(2)) + b (-i/sqrt(2)) ) = 0

From equation 2: i (a - b)/sqrt(2) = 0 → a = b

Substitute a = b into equation 1:

(a + a)/sqrt(2) = 1 → 2a / sqrt(2) = 1 → a = sqrt(2)/2 = 1/sqrt(2)

So a = 1/sqrt(2), b = 1/sqrt(2)

Thus, |+z> = (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2)

Wait, but from earlier, when I thought about |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |-z>, I thought |+y> = (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2). So then, if |+z> is expressed in terms of |+y> and |-y>, it's (|+y> + |-y> )/sqrt(2). But wait, because |+y> and |-y> are orthogonal, the coefficients should reflect that.

Wait, let me write this again. From the equations, |+z> = [1; 0], which equals a [1, i]/sqrt(2) + b [1, -i]/sqrt(2). So combining the components:

Top component: (a + b)/sqrt(2) = 1
Bottom component: i(a - b)/sqrt(2) = 0 → a = b.

So a = b = 1/sqrt(2), as before.

So |+z> = 1/sqrt(2) (|+y> + |-y> )

So the initial state is a superposition of |+y> and |-y> with equal coefficients.

Now, under the new Hamiltonian H, which is proportional to S_y. Let's write H = - gamma B S_y.

The energy eigenstates are |+y> and |-y>, with energies E_+ = (- gamma B) (ħ/2) and E_- = (+ gamma B) (ħ/2) ?

Wait, wait. S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

So H |+y> = (-gamma B S_y ) |+y> = (-gamma B (ħ/2)) |+y> → E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2)
Similarly, H |-y> = (-gamma B S_y ) |-y> = (-gamma B (- ħ/2 )) |-y> → E_- = gamma B (ħ/2 )

Wait, no. Let me re-express H correctly.

H is the Hamiltonian, which in this case is H = - mu · B. But mu is gamma * S, so H = - gamma B S_y.

So when H acts on |+y>, which has S_y = ħ/2, we have:

H |+y> = - gamma B (ħ/2) |+y> → E_+ = - gamma B ħ/2
Similarly, H |-y> = - gamma B (- ħ/2) |-y> → E_- = gamma B ħ/2

So the energies are E_+ = - (gamma B ħ)/2 and E_- = (gamma B ħ)/2.

Wait, but the time evolution of a state |psi> is given by |psi(t)> = exp( -i H t / ħ ) |psi(0)>

So the state |+z> at time t is:

|+z(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ exp( -i E_+ t / ħ ) |+y> + exp( -i E_- t / ħ ) |-y> ]

Plugging in E_+ and E_-:

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ exp( -i (-gamma B ħ/2) t / ħ ) |+y> + exp( -i (gamma B ħ/2) t / ħ ) |-y> ]

Simplify the exponents:

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) |+y> + exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |-y> ]

Now, the state is a superposition of |+y> and |-y> with time-dependent phases.

But we want to find the expectation value of S_z, which is the z-component of the spin (related to the magnetic moment, since mu_z = gamma S_z).

So <S_z> = < +z(t) | S_z | +z(t) >.

Let me compute this expectation value.

First, S_z in the |+y> and |-y> basis. Alternatively, since S_z is a Hermitian operator, I can express it in terms of the |+y> and |-y> basis vectors.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute the expectation value.

Expressing |+z(t)> as (1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{i gamma B t /2} |+y> + e^{-i gamma B t /2} |-y> ]

So to compute <S_z>, we have:

<S_z> = (1/sqrt(2))^2 [ e^{i gamma B t/2} < +y | S_z | +y > + e^{i gamma B t/2} < +y | S_z | -y > e^{-i gamma B t/2} + e^{-i gamma B t/2} < -y | S_z | +y > e^{i gamma B t/2} + e^{-i gamma B t/2} e^{i gamma B t/2} < -y | S_z | -y > ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value directly.

Wait, another approach: since the state is a superposition of |+y> and |-y>, which are eigenstates of H, the expectation value of S_z can be found by expanding the state in terms of |+y> and |-y>, then applying the operator.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I can find the expectation value by using the fact that S_z and S_y are components of the spin, and perhaps using the commutation relations. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value by considering the time evolution.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express S_z in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

The |+y> and |-y> states are eigenstates of S_y, so the matrix representation of S_z in this basis can be found.

Let me write the matrix for S_z in the basis {|+y>, |-y>}.

In the standard basis (|+z>, |-z>), S_z is diagonal with entries ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

But in the |+y>, |-y> basis, the S_z matrix can be found by expressing S_z in terms of the |+y> and |-y> states.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the matrix elements.

The matrix elements of S_z in the |+y>, |-y> basis are:

<S_z>_{+y, +y} = < +y | S_z | +y > 
Similarly for others.

We can compute these using the expressions for |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |-z>.

Recall that:

|+y> = (|+z> + i |-z>)/sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - i |-z>)/sqrt(2)

So let's compute < +y | S_z | +y >:

= (1/sqrt(2)) ( < +z | + i < -z | ) S_z ( |+z> + i | -z> ) / sqrt(2)
= (1/2) [ < +z | S_z | +z> + i < +z | S_z | -z> + i < -z | S_z | +z> + (i)^2 < -z | S_z | -z> ]

S_z |+z> = (ħ/2) |+z>
S_z |-z> = (-ħ/2) |-z>

So,

= (1/2) [ (ħ/2) < +z | +z> + i (ħ/2) < +z |-z> + i ( - ħ/2 ) < -z | +z> + (-1) ( - ħ/2 ) < -z | -z> ]

Simplify each term:

< +z | +z> = 1
< +z |-z> = 0
< -z | +z> = 0
< -z | -z> = 1

So,

= (1/2) [ (ħ/2)(1) + i (ħ/2)(0) + i (-ħ/2)(0) + (-1)(-ħ/2)(1) ]

= (1/2) [ ħ/2 + (ħ/2) ) ]

= (1/2) ( ħ/2 + ħ/2 ) = (1/2)( ħ ) = ħ/2

Wait, that can't be right because |+y> is an eigenstate of S_y, not S_z. So < +y | S_z | +y > shouldn't be ħ/2. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's recompute:

< +y | S_z | +y > = (1/2) [ (ħ/2)(1) + i (0) + i (0) + ( -1 ) ( ħ/2 ) (1) ) ]

Wait, I'm getting the last term wrong. The (i)^2 is -1, and < -z | -z> is 1, so the term is (-1) * (-ħ/2) * 1 = (ħ/2).

Wait, let's re-express:

The expansion:

= (1/2) [ (ħ/2)(1) + i(ħ/2)(0) + i( - ħ/2 )(0) + (-1)( - ħ/2 )(1) ]

So the first term is (ħ/2), the last term is (ħ/2). The other terms are zero.

So total is (1/2)( ħ/2 + ħ/2 ) = (1/2)( ħ ) = ħ/2.

Hmm, but that suggests that < +y | S_z | +y > is ħ/2, which would imply that |+y> is an eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue ħ/2. But that's not correct because S_z and S_y don't share eigenstates. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the expansion. Let me recompute < +y | S_z | +y >.

Alternative approach: Since S_z and S_y are components of the spin vector, which is a vector operator, we can use the identity S_z = (1/2) (S_+ + S_- ), where S_+ and S_- are the raising and lowering operators.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute < +y | S_z | +y > using the matrix representation.

In the standard basis (|+z>, |-z>), S_z is [[ ħ/2, 0 ], [0, - ħ/2 ] ].

The |+y> state is represented as [1, i]/sqrt(2), and |-y> as [1, -i]/sqrt(2).

So to find < +y | S_z | +y >, we can compute:

( [1, -i] / sqrt(2) ) * S_z * ( [1; i] / sqrt(2) )

= (1/sqrt(2)) (1 -i) * [ [ ħ/2, 0 ], [0, - ħ/2 ] ] * [1; i ] / sqrt(2)

First, compute the matrix multiplication:

S_z * [1; i] = [ (ħ/2)*1, 0; 0, (-ħ/2)*i ] = [ ħ/2; (-ħ/2) i ]

Then, take the inner product with [1, -i ]:

= (1/sqrt(2)) (1 - i) * [ ħ/2 * 1 + (- ħ/2 i )*(-i) ] / sqrt(2)

Wait, no, let me compute it properly.

Wait, S_z * [1; i] = [ (ħ/2)*1, 0; 0, (-ħ/2)*i ] = [ ħ/2 * 1, (-ħ/2) * i ]

Wait, no, the matrix multiplication is:

[ [ ħ/2 * 1 + 0 * i ],
  [ 0 * 1 + (-ħ/2) * i ] ]

= [ ħ/2, (- ħ/2 ) i ]

Then, the inner product with [1, -i ] is:

(1)( ħ/2 ) + (-i)( (- ħ/2 ) i )

= ħ/2 + (-i)( -i ħ/2 )

= ħ/2 + (-i^2 ħ/2 )

i^2 is -1, so:

= ħ/2 + ( - (-1) ħ/2 ) 

= ħ/2 + ( ħ/2 ) 

= ħ

Then, multiply by (1/sqrt(2)) and (1/sqrt(2)) from the outer [1, -i ] and the inner [1; i ].

So total factor is (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) = 1/2.

So < +y | S_z | +y > = (1/2) * ħ = ħ/2.

Wait, that can't be right because |+y> is an eigenstate of S_y, not S_z. So why is the expectation value of S_z in |+y> equal to ħ/2? That would mean |+y> is an eigenstate of S_z, which isn't the case. I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the inner product. Let me recompute the inner product step.

Wait, the inner product [1, -i ] times [ ħ/2, (-ħ/2) i ] is:

1 * (ħ/2) + (-i) * ( (-ħ/2) i )

= ħ/2 + (-i) * (-i ħ/2 )

= ħ/2 + (i^2) ħ/2 )

i^2 is -1, so:

= ħ/2 + ( (-1) ħ/2 )

= ħ/2 - ħ/2 = 0.

Ah, that's better. So < +y | S_z | +y > is zero. Similarly, I can compute other matrix elements.

So, let's recompute < +y | S_z | +y > correctly.

The inner product is [1, -i ] * [ ħ/2, (-ħ/2) i ].

= (1)(ħ/2) + (-i)( (-ħ/2) i )

= ħ/2 + (-i)(-i) (ħ/2 )

= ħ/2 + (i^2) (ħ/2 )

i^2 is -1, so:

= ħ/2 + (-1)(ħ/2 ) = 0.

So < +y | S_z | +y > = 0.

Similarly, let's compute < +y | S_z | -y >.

Compute S_z * |-y>:

|-y> is [1, -i ]/sqrt(2), so in vector form, [1; -i ].

S_z times this is:

[ [ ħ/2 * 1 + 0 * (-i) ],
  [ 0 * 1 + (-ħ/2) * (-i) ] ]

= [ ħ/2; ( ħ/2 i ) ]

Then, the inner product with < +y | is [1, i ] (as a row vector) multiplied by [ ħ/2; (ħ/2) i ].

= 1*(ħ/2 ) + i * ( ħ/2 i )

= ħ/2 + (i^2) ( ħ/2 )

= ħ/2 - ħ/2 = 0.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute this more carefully.

Wait, < +y | is [1, i ]/sqrt(2), and S_z |-y> is [ ħ/2; ( ħ/2 i ) ]

So the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) (1, i) [ ħ/2 ; ( ħ/2 i ) ] / sqrt(2)

Wait, no, the state |-y> is [1; -i ]/sqrt(2), so S_z |-y> is (ħ/2) [1; (-i) (-1) ] = (ħ/2) [1; i ].

Wait, perhaps I should compute S_z acting on |-y>:

S_z ( |-y> ) = S_z ( [1; -i]/sqrt(2) ) = (1/sqrt(2)) [ S_z |+z> - i S_z |-z> ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (ħ/2) |+z> - i ( - ħ/2 ) |-z> ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (ħ/2)|+z> + (i ħ/2 ) |-z> ]

= (ħ/2 sqrt(2)) ) [ |+z> + i |-z> ]

Wait, but |+y> is [ |+z> + i |-z> ] / sqrt(2), so S_z |-y> = ( ħ/2 ) |+y> ?

Wait, no, let me compute it correctly.

Wait, S_z |-y> = S_z ( [1; -i]/sqrt(2) ) = (1/sqrt(2)) ( [ ħ/2, 0 ]^T + (i ħ/2 ) [0, 1 ]^T )

Wait, S_z is diagonal matrix with entries (ħ/2, -ħ/2). So:

S_z * [1; -i] = [ (ħ/2)*1, 0; 0, (-ħ/2)*(-i) ] = [ ħ/2 ; ( ħ i ) / 2 ]

So S_z |-y> = [ ħ/2; ( ħ i )/2 ] / sqrt(2)

Now, the inner product < +y | S_z |-y> is [1, i ] / sqrt(2) multiplied by [ ħ/2; ( ħ i )/2 ] / sqrt(2)

= (1/sqrt(2)) (1, i) * ( ħ/2, ( ħ i )/2 ) / sqrt(2)

= (1/2) [ (1)( ħ/2 ) + i ( ħ i )/2 ]

= (1/2) [ ħ/2 + i^2 ħ/2 ]

= (1/2) [ ħ/2 - ħ/2 ]

= (1/2)(0) = 0.

Hmm, interesting. So all the diagonal elements are zero, and perhaps the off-diagonal elements are non-zero.

So now, let me compute < S_z(t) >.

The state |+z(t)> is expressed as:

|+z(t)> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ e^{i gamma B t/2} |+y> + e^{-i gamma B t/2} |-y> ]

So,

<S_z(t)> = < +z(t) | S_z | +z(t) > 

= (1/2) [ e^{i gamma B t/2} e^{-i gamma B t/2} < +y | S_z | +y > + e^{i gamma B t/2} < +y | S_z | -y > e^{-i gamma B t/2} + e^{-i gamma B t/2} < -y | S_z | +y > e^{i gamma B t/2} + e^{-i gamma B t/2} e^{i gamma B t/2} < -y | S_z | -y > ]

As we computed earlier, < +y | S_z | +y > = 0, < -y | S_z | -y > = 0.

So,

<S_z(t)> = (1/2) [ 0 + e^{i gamma B t/2} * 0 * e^{-i gamma B t/2} + e^{-i gamma B t/2} * 0 * e^{i gamma B t/2} + 1 * 0 ]

Wait, that can't be right because that would imply <S_z> is zero, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I made a mistake in the matrix elements.

Wait, perhaps instead of computing all these terms, I can approach it differently. Since the state is a superposition of |+y> and |-y>, which are eigenstates of H, perhaps the expectation value can be found using transition probabilities.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute d<S_z>/dt and find the equation governing its oscillation.

Wait, but perhaps I can use the time evolution of the state and compute the expectation value.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the oscillation frequency arising from the energy difference between the states |+y> and |-y>.

The energy difference between the two states is E_- - E_+ = (gamma B ħ/2) - (- gamma B ħ/2 ) ) = gamma B ħ.

The frequency of oscillation is given by the energy difference divided by Planck's constant (ħ), so frequency nu = (E_- - E_+)/ ħ = (gamma B ħ ) / ħ = gamma B.

Wait, but wait. The time evolution of a state that's a superposition of two energy eigenstates leads to oscillations in expectation values with a frequency equal to (E_2 - E_1)/ħ.

In this case, the initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2), which is a superposition of |+y> and |-y> with energies E_+ = - gamma B ħ/2 and E_- = gamma B ħ/2.

The time evolution of each component is multiplied by a phase factor e^{-i E t / ħ}.

So |+z(t)> = ( e^{-i E_+ t/ħ} |+y> + e^{-i E_- t/ħ} |-y> ) / sqrt(2)

So the phase difference between the two terms is (E_- - E_+ ) t / ħ.

The energy difference is E_- - E_+ = gamma B ħ.

So the phase difference is (gamma B ħ ) t / ħ = gamma B t.

The oscillation frequency is gamma B.

But wait, the expectation value of S_z might oscillate at that frequency.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: the Hamiltonian after the change is H = - gamma B S_y.

But the oscillation in S_z could be linked to the energy splitting between the states.

But perhaps I'm complicating things. Let me think about the transition probability. The state |+z> is a superposition of |+y> and |-y>, which are eigenstates of H. So the time evolution will cause the state to oscillate between these two states, leading to oscillations in observable quantities.

The oscillation frequency is determined by the energy difference between the two states divided by Planck's constant. So the energy difference is delta E = E_- - E_+ = (gamma B ħ/2 ) - (- gamma B ħ/2 ) ) = gamma B ħ.

Thus, the angular frequency is omega = delta E / ħ = gamma B.

But wait, the oscillation frequency in the question is the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the moment. So the average <mu_z> = gamma < S_z >.

So if < S_z > oscillates with frequency gamma B, then <mu_z> would also oscillate at the same frequency.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option B is gamma B, which would be the frequency.

But let me think again. When the state is a superposition of two energy eigenstates with energies E_+ and E_-, the expectation value of an observable that's not diagonal in the Hamiltonian will oscillate with frequency proportional to (E_- - E_+ ) / ħ. Since the energy difference is gamma B ħ, the frequency is gamma B.

So the oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the correct answer would be option B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The field is then switched to point along the $+y$ direction, and the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment is to be determined.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  
   When the magnetic field is along $+z$, the particle’s state is an eigenstate of $S_z$. After the field is switched to $+y$, the Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\gamma B S_y$, where $S_y$ is the spin operator in the $y$ direction. The eigenstates of $H$ are $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$, with eigenvalues $E_+ = \frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2}$ and $E_- = -\frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2}$.

2. **Initial State in the New Basis**:  
   The initial state $|+z\rangle$ is expressed as a superposition of $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$:  
   \[
   |+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+y\rangle + |-y\rangle \right).
   \]

3. **Time Evolution**:  
   After the field is switched, the state evolves as:  
   \[
   |+z(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{-iE_+t/\hbar} |+y\rangle + e^{-iE_-t/\hbar} |-y\rangle \right).
   \]  
   Substituting $E_+$ and $E_-$, this becomes:  
   \[
   |+z(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{-i\frac{\gamma B t}{2}} |+y\rangle + e^{i\frac{\gamma B t}{2}} |-y\rangle \right).
   \]

4. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**:  
   The $z$-component of the spin operator, $S_z$, is not diagonal in the $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$ basis. However, the oscillation of the expectation value $\langle S_z \rangle$ arises from the interference between the $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$ components. The oscillation frequency is determined by the energy difference between the two eigenstates:  
   \[
   \Delta E = E_- - E_+ = \gamma B \hbar.
   \]  
   The angular frequency of oscillation is:  
   \[
   \omega = \frac{\Delta E}{\hbar} = \gamma B.
   \]

5. **Magnetic Moment Oscillation**:  
   The magnetic moment in the $z$-direction is $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$. Since $\langle S_z \rangle$ oscillates with frequency $\omega = \gamma B$, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ also oscillates with the same frequency.

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment is $\gamma B$. This corresponds to **Option B**.
