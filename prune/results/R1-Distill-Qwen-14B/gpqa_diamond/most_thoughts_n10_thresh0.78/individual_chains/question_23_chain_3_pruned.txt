Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about a reaction involving ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene and hydrogen bromide. They used TLC and saw two new spots, meaning two products formed. I need to figure out which options are possible.

First, I should probably draw the structure of the starting material. The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Breaking that down, the benzene ring has an ether group (O-) attached. The other part is a butenyl group. Specifically, but-3-en-1-yl means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (if we number from the oxygen). Wait, no, butenyl is four carbons, right? So but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Let me see: O connected to C1, which is connected to C2 (double bond to C3), which is connected to two methyl groups (since it's 2,2-dimethyl). So the structure would look like:

O
|
O-C1 - C2 = C3 - C4
       |  (C2 has two methyl groups)
So the entire structure is benzene-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2?

Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? No, wait, but the butenyl chain is 4 carbons. The numbering is from the oxygen. So the group is O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but wait, with a double bond starting at position 3. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because butenyl is four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C3 and C4, but that's beyond the chain. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? But that's not possible because a four-carbon chain can't have a double bond starting at the third carbon. Oh wait, perhaps it's but-1-en-3-yl? No, the question says but-3-en-1-yl. Maybe I should think in terms of substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, because that would be but-2-en-1-yl. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the numbering.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2, but that doesn't have a double bond. Wait, no, the question says but-3-en-1-yl. Let me number from the oxygen. So the group is O-(CH2)-CH2-CH2-CH2-? Wait, but the double bond
