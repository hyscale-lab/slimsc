Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think this through.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using its FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The options are four different structures, all of which seem to have some sort of substituents and a carboxylic acid group. So, let's break down the information given.

First, the FTIR data: there's a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 and a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1. The broad peak at 3000 is probably O-H from a carboxylic acid because those O-H stretches are usually broad. The 1700 cm^-1 peak suggests a carbonyl group, which makes sense because carboxylic acids have a C=O stretch around there. So, that fits with the presence of a carboxylic acid group in all the options.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum. The question says that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So that rules out any double bonds or aromatic rings with H's, but all the options are probably branched alkanes with a COOH group. So no vinyl here, which matches the options since they don't seem to have any double bonds.

Now, looking at the splitting patterns in the NMR. There's one signal that's a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm, that's a complex splitting. Another signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. These splitting patterns suggest some coupling between protons on adjacent carbons, perhaps. Let's think about how that might happen.

Let me analyze each option's structure to see which NMR patterns make sense.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the structure is something like CH3-C(-C2H5)(H)-C(-C2H5)(H)-CH2COOH. Wait, maybe that's a cyclopropane? No, wait, maybe it's a geminal and vicinal arrangement. Alternatively, perhaps it's a structure where the central carbons each have two substituents.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So, the structure is CH3CH2-C(-C2H5)(H)-C(-C2H5)(H)-COOH. So the central two carbons each have a CH group attached to a C2H5 group.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So, the central two carbons each have a CH group attached to two CH3 groups.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So the structure is CH3CH2-C(-CH3)(H)-C(-CH3)(H)-COOH. So the central carbons each have a CH group with a CH3 attached.

So, all the options have a COOH group. Let's think about the structure in terms of symmetry and how the protons might split.

In the NMR, each set of equivalent protons would show a different signal, but perhaps in some cases, the splitting could lead to more complex patterns.

Looking at the NMR splitting: a doublet of triplets of quartets. Maybe this is due to coupling with two neighboring groups, each with multiple protons.

Let me consider Option D: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. Each of the two CH groups is attached to a CH3. So each CH has two neighboring groups. Let's look at the H's on the CH2 group (the one next to the COOH), perhaps.

Wait, wait. Let me draw the structure for each option.

Option D: The structure is CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So, the chain is something like:

CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Looking at the CH2 group (the CH3CH2 part), the two H's on the CH2 would be adjacent to the CH(CH3) group. The H's on CH(CH3) would have neighboring groups from both the CH2 and the next CH(CH3).

Wait, perhaps I should think about the NMR signals from each set of protons.

In Option D:

- The first group is CH3CH2-: the H's on the CH2 would be next to a CH group. So each H on the CH2 would couple with the H's on the adjacent CH. The CH has one H, so the splitting would be a triplet (n+1, where n=1). But wait, if the CH2 is next to a CH, which has one H, then the CH2 H's would be a triplet. But if there's another coupling, maybe with the next group?

Wait, the CH(CH3) groups are each attached to the central carbons. So each of these CH's is next to another CH. Let me think
