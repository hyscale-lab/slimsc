Okay, so I have this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So far, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet. Now they're asking what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm.

Wait, radioactive decay is a random process, right? Each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time, but it's independent of when it started. So I think the key here is understanding whether the probability is a half-life thing or if it's a constant probability.

Wait, the given probability isn't expressed in terms of half-life. It's 32% within 100 minutes. So maybe it's using the exponential decay formula. Let me recall: the formula for the probability of decay is P = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is time. Or maybe it's the cumulative distribution function for an exponential distribution.

Wait, but the question is about the probability that it decays within a certain time. So I think the 32% chance is the probability that it decays within the first 100 minutes. So, P(0 to 100) = 0.32.

But now, 50 minutes have passed, and it hasn't decayed
