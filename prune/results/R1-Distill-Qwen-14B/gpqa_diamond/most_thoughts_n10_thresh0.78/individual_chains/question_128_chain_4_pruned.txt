Okay, so I've just landed my first big job in a structural biology lab at Stanford. The PI has given me a task to produce and purify the Human P53 protein using E. coli BL21. The amino acid sequence is provided, and I have four plasmid options to choose from. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think through this carefully.

Hmm, proteins expressed in E. coli are often overproduced, and for that, the T7 promoter is commonly used because it's strong. The BL21 strain has the T7 RNA polymerase under the control of the lacUV5 promoter, which is induced by IPTG. So the plasmid should have a T7 promoter to initiate transcription of the gene.

Looking at the options, they all start with the same initial sequences: ATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAG... Wait, but wait, that's actually the amino acid sequence? No, wait, no. Wait, the options are plasmid DNA sequences, they start with ATG which is the start codon. So the question is, which plasmid's insert is the correct gene for P53.

Wait, but the problem is probably about the presence of a T7 promoter. Because the other parts of the plasmid (like origin, resistance) might differ, but the question is about the correct coding sequence for the P53 protein. Or maybe it's about the correct start codon and reading frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct plasmid has the correct RBS (ribosome binding site) and start codon. Wait, E. coli uses the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (RBS) before the start codon. Looking at the options, the plasmid sequences start with ATG, which is the start codon for methionine. So each option starts with ATG, but the sequences after that might differ.

Wait, the given amino acid sequence starts with MEEP... So the first amino acid is methionine (M), which aligns with the ATG start codon. So that's correct.

But looking at the plasmid options, I need to see which one matches the correct DNA sequence for the Human P53 protein. The given amino acid sequence is quite long, so I'll have to check which plasmid's ORF (open reading frame) translates into that sequence.

Wait, but the plasmid options are all very long. Each option has the same first few bases, but perhaps some are truncated. For example, option C and D have line breaks in the middle, but perhaps that's just formatting. Looking at the start, all options begin with ATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAG... So perhaps the difference is in the presence of the T7 promoter or RBS.

Wait, wait. I think the key is that the correct plasmid should have the T7 promoter for expression in BL21. BL21(DE3) strains have the T7 RNA polymerase under the lacUV5 promoter, which is induced by IPTG. So the plasmid must have a gene under the control of the T7 promoter.

Looking at the plasmid sequences, I need to see if they have a T7 promoter before the start codon. The T7 promoter is recognized by the T7 RNA polymerase, so it's a specific sequence.

Looking at the options, the start of each plasmid is ATG, which is the start codon. But wait, that's the start of the gene, not the promoter. The plasmid would have a promoter region before the ATG.

Wait
