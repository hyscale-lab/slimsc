Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The problem says we have 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, which is acetic acid. Then there's 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, a strong acid. And finally, 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. I need to figure out the pH after mixing all these together.

Wait, when mixing acids and bases, the first step is to determine whether it's an acid excess or a base excess. Because if one neutralizes the other completely, you'll have either a buffer solution or just a strong acid or base left.

So, let's break it down. Acetic acid is a weak acid, HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. But wait, Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba²+ and OH⁻ ions. So the OH⁻ will react with the H+ ions from both HCl and CH3COOH.

Hmm, but wait. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. HCl is a strong acid, so it does completely dissociate. Oh, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will completely dissociate as well.

So the plan is to find out the total moles of H+ from the acids and the total moles of OH- from the base, see which is in excess, and then compute the concentration of H+ or OH- accordingly.

Let me calculate the moles for each component.

First, for CH3COOH. It's 500 mL (which is 0.5 L) of 0.1 M. Moles = concentration × volume (L). So 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

But since it's a weak acid, it won't contribute a lot of H+ ions. Hmm, but wait, for now, maybe we can calculate the H+ from all sources and see if the OH- neutralizes all of it.

Next, HCl. It's 400 mL (0.4 L) of 0.2 M. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles of HCl. Since HCl is a strong acid, it will donate 0.08 moles of H+.

Then, Ba(OH)2. 300 mL (0.3 L) of 0.3 M. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba²+ and 2 OH⁻. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-. So moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Therefore, moles of OH- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but OH- will react with H+ from HCl and CH3COOH. So the H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. Let me see.

Wait, the OH- will first neutralize the H+ from the strongest acid, which is HCl. Because HCl is a strong acid and fully ionized, so it's the first to react.

So the OH- will react with H+ from HCl. Let's see how much H+ is from HCl:
