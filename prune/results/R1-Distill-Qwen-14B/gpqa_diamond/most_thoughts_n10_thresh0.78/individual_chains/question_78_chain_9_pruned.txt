Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember that potentials are related to electric and magnetic fields in Maxwell's equations. Let me think about what I know.

The question gives me a point charge q moving with a trajectory s(t). The position is r for the field point, and d is the vector from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. The velocity at tr is v.

I need to find the scalar potential V and vector potential A at time t, where t > tr. So, t is later than the time when the charge was at the position that generates the field. That probably means we're dealing with retarded potentials because the fields at a later time depend on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time.

Wait, right. Retarded potentials are used when the source is moving, because the effect at a later time depends on where the source was and its velocity. So the potentials are functions of the retarded time, which is earlier than the current time t.

Let me recall the expressions for the scalar and vector potentials. The scalar potential V is usually (q)/(4πε₀ r'), where r' is the distance from the charge to the observation point, but considering the retarded time. Similarly, the vector potential A is related to the velocity of the charge.

Wait, for a static charge, the scalar potential is straightforward. But when the charge is moving, the potentials are more complicated. The scalar potential V is indeed (q)/(4πε₀ r'), where r' is the distance from the charge's position at the retarded time to the field point. The vector potential A comes from the motion of the charge and is given by (μ₀ q v)/(4π c² r') times some unit vector, but I think it's actually (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) times the unit vector in the direction from the charge to the field point, divided by the same distance r'.

Wait, no, more accurately, the vector potential due to a moving charge is given by A = (μ₀ q)/(4π c²) * (v × r̂)/r, but wait, I think I'm mixing up the exact form. Alternatively,
