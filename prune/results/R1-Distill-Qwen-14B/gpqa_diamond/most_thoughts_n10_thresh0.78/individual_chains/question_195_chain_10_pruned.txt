Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the setup is that there are two planets orbiting a star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius and is in a circular orbit. It transits its star with an impact parameter of 0.2, and the star's radius is 1.5 times that of the Sun. The orbital period of this first planet is 3 days. Now, the question is about a second planet, which has a radius 2.5 times Earth's. We need to find the maximum orbital period this second planet can have so that it both transits and is occulted by the star. Both planets share the same orbital plane and have circular orbits.

Hmm. So, the key here is understanding the conditions for a planet to transit and to be occulted. I remember that a transit occurs when the planet passes directly in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. An occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so the planet's light is blocked, which we can detect as a slight decrease in the total light from the system if the planet emits its own light, but I think in this context, it refers to the planet passing behind the star, so it's no longer visible (if it's reflecting light) or contributes less to the total light.

But wait, for the second planet to be occulted, the star must pass in front of it from our perspective. So the planet must be in a position where the star can block it, which means the planet's orbit must be such that it sometimes is behind the star from our point of view. But since both are in the same orbital plane, their orbital periods must be such that their positions align for these events to occur.

Wait, but how do their orbital periods relate to each other for both transit and occultation to happen? I think this has to do with the orbital periods and their alignment. Maybe it's about the synodic periodâ€”the time between similar configurations as seen from Earth. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.

For a planet to transit, the planet must pass in front of the star. For transit to happen, the orbital plane must be edge-on enough, but in this problem, both are in the same orbital plane, so they probably have the same inclination, which is favorable for transiting. But the problem states that the first planet does transit, so the orbital plane is edge-on enough for that.

Wait a second, but the second planet also needs to transit and be occulted. So, when the second planet is behind the star, it's occulted, and when it's in front, it transits. So for both events to happen, the planet must have an orbital period that allows it to orbit in such a way that sometimes it's on the same side as us (transit) and sometimes on the opposite side (occultation).

Wait, but both planets are in the same orbital plane. So, if they have different orbital periods, their positions relative to each other and the star will change over time. The maximum possible period for the second planet would be when it can still have both events occur within its orbit.

But wait, what determines whether a planet can transit? The planet
