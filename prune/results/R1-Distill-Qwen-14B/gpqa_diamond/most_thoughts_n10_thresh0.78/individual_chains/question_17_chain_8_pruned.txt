Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution when it's a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions like Ca²+.

So the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and the pH is ideal, which probably means that EDTA is in its deprotonated form, making it a good chelator. The temperature is 25°C, so that's room temperature. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. 

Wait, formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-, and Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So that's the concentration of CaEDTA^2- ions. The question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions ([Ca²+]).

So, let's think about the dissociation of the complex. The complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. If the solution is 0.02 M in the complex, initially, without considering dissociation, [Ca²+] would be 0.02 M and [EDTA^4-] would be 0.02 M. But because Kf is so large (5e10), the dissociation would be very small. So the assumption is that the concentration of the complex doesn't change much, and the dissociation is minimal.

Wait, but how does the dissociation work here? The Kf is given, so we can set up the equation. Let me write it out.

Let me denote the concentration of the complex as C = 0.02 M. The formation constant Kf = [
