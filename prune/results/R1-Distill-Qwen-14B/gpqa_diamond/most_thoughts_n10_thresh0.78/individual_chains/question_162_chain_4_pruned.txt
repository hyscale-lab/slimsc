Alright, so I've got this problem here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me try to think this through.

Okay, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like the metric for a sphere, but with some scaling factors. Oh wait, but it's in two dimensions, right? Because the coordinates are x and y, so this is a 2D metric.

Wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere. Pseudosphere usually refers to a surface with constant negative curvature, like the tractricoid. But the term can sometimes be used in different contexts. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and they mean a sphere's area. Hmm.

Wait, the metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let me try to interpret this. The denominator 4 - x² - y² looks a lot like the equation of a sphere. If x² + y² < 4, then we have a sphere of radius 2, because 4 is 2 squared. So this metric is defined for points where x² + y² < 4. That makes sense because beyond that, the denominator would hit zero, which would be a problem.

But this is a two-dimensional metric. So we're dealing with a surface with this metric. What's the area? Well, in general, the area of a 2D surface
