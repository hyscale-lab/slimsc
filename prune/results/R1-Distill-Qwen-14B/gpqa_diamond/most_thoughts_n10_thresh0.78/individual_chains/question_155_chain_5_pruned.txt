Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem describes an operator P with components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these has a matrix form given in a 3x3 format. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. The system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The question is asking for the uncertainty ΔPz of the operator Pz.

Hmm, right. So, I think I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the expectation value of the square of the operator minus the square of the expectation value of the operator. So, ΔPz = sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²).

Wait, but first, I need to find the expectation value of Pz and the expectation value of Pz squared. Let me break it down.

Since the system is in a state |ψ⟩, which is the given column vector, we can compute these expectations.

First, let me write down the given matrices for Pz. The matrix for Pz has first row (ħ, 0, 0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-ħ). So, that matrix is diagonal. Because it's diagonal in the Pz basis, each diagonal element is the eigenvalue for the corresponding basis vector.

Wait, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz, which means that each basis vector corresponds to an eigenstate of Pz. So the state vector provided is expressed in terms of these basis vectors.

The state vector given is ψ = [ -1/2; 1/√2; -1/2 ].

Wait, but the basis is in terms of the eigenvectors of Pz, which I think are the standard basis vectors if Pz is diagonal. So, each component of ψ corresponds to the eigenvalue of Pz.

So, the first component is |ψ1|^2, the second |ψ2|^2, the third |ψ3|^2. Because the basis is orthonormal, the expectation value of Pz is the sum of |component|^2 times the eigenvalue for that state.

Wait, more precisely, the eigenvalues of Pz are:

Looking at the Pz matrix:

- The first diagonal element is ħ, so the eigenvalue for the first basis vector is ħ.
- The second
