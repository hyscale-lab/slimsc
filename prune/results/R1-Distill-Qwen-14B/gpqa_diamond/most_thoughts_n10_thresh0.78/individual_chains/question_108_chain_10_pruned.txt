Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of the hydrogen atom. Hmm. Let's parse what it's asking. We have a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis, which I think means the z-direction. The magnetic field has a value of 1 T, which is Tesla. The problem mentions small values of m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. 

We have to compare the paramagnetic coupling term's expectation value, ⟨H⟩, with the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen. The transition given has a wavelength λ of 0.4861 micrometers. The options are whether ⟨H⟩ is much greater than, much less than, equal to, or just greater than ΔE.

Alright, so I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that paramagnetism in atoms like hydrogen arises due to the interaction between the magnetic moment of electrons and an external magnetic field. The energy associated with this interaction is given by the Zeeman effect. 

Wait, the Zeeman effect is when an atom's spectral lines split in a magnetic field. But paramagnetic coupling—I think that's related to the same thing. The energy terms would be due to the magnetic interaction.

So the paramagnetic coupling term is the Zeeman term in the Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian for the Zeeman effect is H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For electrons, the magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B S, where g is the Landé factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and S is the spin operator. Oh wait, but wait, orbital angular momentum also contributes. Oh right, the total magnetic moment is μ = μ_orbital + μ_spin.

But in hydrogen, since it's a one-electron atom, the orbital and spin parts matter. But the question is about the paramagnetic coupling, which I think refers to the spin-orbit interaction or the interaction of spin with the magnetic field. Wait, no, paramagnetic coupling is specifically the interaction of the electron's spin magnetic moment with an external field. Oh wait, no, maybe it's the spin-orbit interaction, which is a different thing. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing things.

Wait, the problem says "paramagnetic coupling term". Paramagnetism is due to the response of the material's electrons to an external magnetic field. So the coupling term would be the Zeeman term, which is the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external field.

So the energy is H = - μ · B. For a magnetic field along the z-axis, this becomes H = -μ_z B. The magnetic moment μ_z is given by μ_z = g * (eħ)/(2m_e) * m_s, where m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number. Wait, no—it's probably better to express it in terms of the magnetic quantum number. For an electron in an orbital state with quantum numbers n, l, m_l, the magnetic moment due to orbital motion is μ_orbital = (eħ)/(2m_e) * m_l. Similarly, the spin part is μ_spin = g_s * (eħ)/(2m_e) * s_z, where g_s is the Landé factor for spin, which is approximately 2 for electrons.

But wait, for hydrogen, the ground state has l=0, so the orbital contribution is zero. Oh, but the problem says small values of m, so maybe m is the orbital quantum number m_l. If m is small, perhaps it's considering the spin part or some other effect. Wait, hydrogen's 1s state has l=0, so m_l can only be 0. So the orbital contribution would be zero, but the spin part would be m_s = ±1/2. So, in that case, the main contribution would come from the spin part.

Wait, but the problem says small m. So maybe m is the orbital magnetic quantum number m_l. If m is small, like m=1 or something. But for an electron in an s-orbital (l=0), m=0. For p orbitals, l=1, so m can be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, but the paramagnetic coupling term is between the magnetic moment and the field. So the expectation value ⟨H⟩ would be proportional to the magnetic moment in the state multiplied by B.

So, for hydrogen, the energy shift due to the magnetic field is given by the Zeeman effect. For each state, the energy shift is ΔE_zeeman = μ_B * B * m_j, where m_j is the total magnetic quantum number. But wait, what's the relation
