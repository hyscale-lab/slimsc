Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. I remember that this is about nuclear fission and relativistic vs. classical kinetic energy calculations. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

The problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then, it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. The more massive fragment has twice the mass of the other, and the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment and the one calculated classically.

Wait, so the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum after fission must be zero because momentum is conserved. That means the two fragments move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

Let me jot down what I know:

- Initial rest mass energy: 300 GeV. So, E_initial = M*c² = 300 GeV.
- After fission, two fragments: one is twice as massive as the other. Let their masses be m and 2m.
- Sum of rest masses: m + 2m = 3m. And this is 99% of M. So 3m = 0.99 M → m = (0.99 M)/3.

Wait, but what's M in terms of mass? Oh, because the initial nucleus's rest mass is M. So the rest masses of the fragments sum up to 0.99 M, which is less than M. That makes sense because some mass is converted into kinetic energy, right?

So initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV, which is M c² = 300 GeV. After fission, the total rest mass is 0.99 M, so the mass difference is 0.01 M. That missing mass must be converted into kinetic energy. So the total kinetic energy of both fragments would be 0.01 M c², which is 3 GeV (since 0.01 times 300 GeV is 3 GeV).

But wait, that's just the total kinetic energy. We need to find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. Then compare the correct relativistic value with the classical approximation.

Let me think about the velocities. Since it's fission, the fragments will have some kinetic energy. Because of conservation of momentum, their momenta must be equal and opposite. Let's denote their velocities as v1 and v2 for the more massive (2m) and less massive (m) fragments, respectively.

In the center-of-momentum frame, which is the rest frame of the original nucleus, so the total momentum after fission is zero. So, the momentum of the two fragments must cancel each other.

Momentum p is given by gamma m v. So, for each fragment, p1 = gamma1 * 2m * v1, and p2 = gamma2 * m * v2.

Since p1 = -p2 (they are opposite), we have gamma1 * 2m v1 = gamma2 * m v2. The masses can be factored in.

Wait, maybe it's easier to consider the velocities in terms of their directions. Let me suppose that the more massive fragment (2m) moves in the positive direction with velocity v, and the lighter one (m) moves in the negative direction with velocity u. So their momenta would be p = gamma_2m * 2m * v and p' = gamma_m * m * u. Since the total
