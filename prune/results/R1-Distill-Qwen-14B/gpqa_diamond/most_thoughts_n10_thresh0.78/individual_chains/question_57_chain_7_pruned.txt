Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electron scattering. Hmm, elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. I remember from my studies that when particles scatter elastically, their kinetic energy isn't lost, and the phase shifts are involved in calculating the scattering amplitude.

The question gives me phase shifts: δ0 is 90 degrees, δ1 is 67, δ2 is 55, δ3 is 30, and δ4 is 13 degrees. They also mention to ignore the rest, so I guess beyond δ4, which is l=4, we can consider those phase shifts zero.

The task is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I recall that the scattering amplitude f(θ) depends on the phase shifts. Oh wait, right. The general expression for f(θ) in terms of phase shifts is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * sum over l of ( (2l +1) * (e^{iδ_l} -1 ) * P_l(cosθ) ) ), where P_l is the Legendre polynomial.

But wait, the question specifies the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. When θ is zero, that's the direction of the incident beam. So I need to evaluate the imaginary part of f(0).

Let me think about the formula again. The scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l +1) [ e^{i δ_l} -1 ] P_l (cosθ)

Since we're evaluating at θ=0, cosθ is 1. So P_l(1) is 1 for all l, because P_0(1)=1, P_1(1)=1, etc. Wait, no. Wait, no, Legendre polynomials at x=1 are all 1, because P_l(1) = 1 for any l. So that simplifies things.

So f(0) becomes (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) (e^{iδ_l} -1 ) * 1.

So the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/k) sum (2l+1) Im( e^{iδ_l} -1 ).

But wait, since e^{iδ} = cosδ + i sinδ. So e^{iδ} -1 = (cosδ -1) + i sinδ. So the imaginary part is just sinδ_l.

So Im(f(0)) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin(δ_l)

Because beyond l=4, δ is zero, so their contributions are zero.

So now, I need to compute each term for l=0 to l=4.

Let's list the (2l+1) and sin(δ_l):

l=0: 2(0)+1=1, sin(90°). 90 degrees in radians is π/2, sin(π/2)=1.

l=1: 3, sin(67 degrees). Let me calculate that. 67 degrees. I'll convert to radians for calculation, but maybe I can just use a calculator value. Sin(67) is approximately 0.9205.

l=2: 5, sin(55 degrees). Sin(55) is about 0.8192.

l=3:7, sin(30 degrees) is 0.5.

l=4:9, sin(13 degrees) is approximately 0.22495.

So compute each term:

l=0: 1 * 1 = 1

l=1: 3 * 0.9205 ≈ 2.7615

l=2:5 * 0.8192 ≈4.096

l=3:7 *0.5 =3.5

l=4:9 *0.22495 ≈2.02455

Adding them up: 1 + 2.7615=3.7615; plus 4.096=7.8575; plus 3.5=11.3575; plus 2.02455≈13.382.

So sum is approximately 13.382.

Now, Im(f(0)) = (1/k) * 13.382.

But wait, what's k? Because k is the wave number. The relation between k and the energy is given by E = (ħ^2 k^2)/(2m), but I might have to compute k.

Wait, the electrons are 50 MeV. So their kinetic energy is 50 MeV. But wait, electrons have rest mass about 0.511 MeV, so 50 MeV is way higher, so relativistic effects are significant. Hmm, but maybe the question is non-relativistic? Wait, no, 50 MeV is way beyond the rest mass, so relativistic approach is needed.

Wait, but wait. The expression for k might be in terms of the energy. Let's think. The Compton wavelength is involved here? Or perhaps the calculation is done in the lab frame.

Wait, another approach. The wave number k is given by k = sqrt(2mE)/(ħ), but since the energy is given in MeV, I'll need to convert it into appropriate units.

Wait, perhaps it's better to recall that the electron mass m_e is 9.10938356 × 10^-31 kg, and ħ is approximately 1.0545718 ×10^-34 J·s.

But the energy E is 50 MeV. Let's convert that into joules.

1 eV is 1.60218 ×10^-19 J. So 50 MeV is 50e6 eV, so 50e6 * 1.6021
