Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see, the question is about identifying a compound based on its NMR data after a reaction. Hmm, the compound X is reacting with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Oh wait, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, often used in epoxide ring-opening reactions. Oh right, it's called DBU, I think. So the reaction is probably an acid-catalyzed epoxide opening, but without an acid, maybe it's a base-mediated process. Wait, no, DBU is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. So maybe it's used for elimination or deprotonation steps.

The product's NMR data is given. Let's look at that. The 1H NMR shows several signals: two singlets at 2.28 and 2.31 ppm, each integrating to 3H. Then a doublet at 6.75, another at 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), and 7.71 (2H, d). The 13C NMR has a bunch of signals, including a carbonyl at 197.7 ppm, which looks like a ketone or maybe an ester, but wait, 197 is more typical for a carbonyl like a ketone. But wait, in epoxides, the carbons are typically around 60-70 ppm. Hmmm, but the product's 13C has a 197.7, which suggests maybe a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the starting material is compound X, which is an epoxide. So when DBU is used, maybe it's a ring-opening reaction. Oh wait, wait. If the product has a carbonyl group, perhaps the epoxide
