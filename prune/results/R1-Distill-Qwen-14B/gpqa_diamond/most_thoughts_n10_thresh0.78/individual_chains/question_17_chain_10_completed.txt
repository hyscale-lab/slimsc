Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds metal ions like calcium. The problem gives me the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, so I don't think I have to worry about the EDTA protonation states or anything like that. 

Wait, what's the formation constant again? I think it's the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−, and K is [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). Right, K is 5e10, which is a really large number, meaning the complex is very stable. So the formation constant is Kf.

The solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. I'm assuming that's the concentration of the complex at equilibrium. So I need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in solution.

Let me think about the dissociation of the complex. The complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. So if the concentration of the complex is C (0.02 M), then the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4− will depend on how much the complex dissociates. But since K is so large, the dissociation should be very minimal, meaning the complex doesn't break down much. So the concentration of free Ca²+ should be really low.

Let me set up the equation. Let the concentration of free Ca²+ be x. Then, the concentration of EDTA^4− would also be x because each complex releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4−. The concentration of the complex would then be approximately 0.02 - x. But since K is so large, x is going to be very small, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So the equation becomes K = (0.02) / (x * x) = 0.02 / x² = 5e10.

Wait, solving for x. So 0.02 / x² = 5e10 → x² = 0.02 / 5e10 → x² = 2e-13 → x = sqrt(2e-13) → approximately 1.414e-6. Wait, but none of the options match that. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check again. K is 5e10. So, K = [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). [CaEDTA^2−] is 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] are both x. So 5e10 = (0.02)/(x²). Solving for x²: x² = 0.02 /5e10 → 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 /5e10 is (2/5)e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 1e-6 squared is 1e-12. Wait, sqrt(4e-13) = 2 sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5? Hmm, wait, perhaps it's better to compute it directly. sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, so 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7. Oh wait, that's about 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That must be the answer.

Wait a second, but why is x so small? Because K is so large, meaning almost all the complex stays intact, so free Ca²+ is very low, which makes sense. So the correct answer should be C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of the complex:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Here, \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \), and the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]\) is 0.02 M. Let the concentration of free \([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\) and \([\text{EDTA}^{4-}]\) both be \(x\). Since the dissociation is minimal due to the large \(K\), we approximate \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02\). Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

This value corresponds to the concentration of free calcium ions, \([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
