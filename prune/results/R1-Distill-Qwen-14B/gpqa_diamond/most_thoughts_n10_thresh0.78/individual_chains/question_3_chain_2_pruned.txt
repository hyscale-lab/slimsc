Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. It's about quantum mechanics, specifically dealing with spin-half particles and expectation values. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition of its spin-up and spin-down states. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2|↓⟩. Oh wait, I remember that the state vectors |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of the σz operator. So, they are the basis states for the Pauli matrices, right?

The question asks for the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. Hmm, expectation values. I think the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on identically prepared systems. The formula I recall is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator.

So, I need to find ⟨10σz +5σx⟩. I can split this into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩ because expectation values are linear, right? So, expectation of a sum is the sum of expectations.

First, let's tackle ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward. The expectation value of σz is the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

Wait, what are the eigenvalues of σz for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩? Oh, right, σz|↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩ and σz|↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩. So the eigenvalues are +1 and -1.

The given state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Let me check if this is normalized. The sum of the squares of the coefficients should be 1. So (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + (3/4) = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. Yep, it's normalized.

So, the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is |0.5|^2 * (+1) + |sqrt(3)/2|^2 * (-1). Let me compute that.

|0.5|^2 is 0.25, so 0.25 * 1 = 0.25. |sqrt(3)/2|^2 is (3/4) = 0.75, so 0.75 * (-1) = -0.75. Adding them: 0.25 + (-0.75) = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ = -0.5.

Then 10⟨σz⟩ is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now, the next part is ⟨σx⟩. Oh, σx is the Pauli X matrix. I remember that σx has eigenstates that are the superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, but since our state isn't an eigenstate of σx, we'll have to compute it directly.

The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so its action is to flip the spin states. The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is given by ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

Let me write the state as a vector. Since |↑⟩ is [1; 0] and |↓⟩ is [0; 1], then ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

So, let's compute ψ† σx ψ. Wait, ψ is a column vector, so ψ† is a row vector [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So, σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. When we multiply ψ† by σx, we get [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]. Then, multiplying by ψ, which is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2], we have:

(sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 + 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait a second. I'm not sure if I did the matrix multiplication correctly. Let me double-check.

Another approach is to compute ψ† σx ψ. So, ψ is [a; b], where a=0.5, b=sqrt(3)/2.

So, ψ† is [a*, b*], but since our coefficients are real, it's [a, b].

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when you multiply ψ† by σx, you get [b, a].

Then, multiplying by ψ, which is [a; b], you get (b*a) + (a*b) = 2ab.

Because (b, a) multiplied by (a, b)^T? Wait, no, let's see. Matrix multiplication: [b a] multiplied by [a; b

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about expectation values. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question says a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition state: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh wait, and these |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z-matrix. Right, because σz has those as its eigenstates with eigenvalues +1 and -1, or was it the other way around? I think |↑⟩ is the +1 eigenstate and |↓⟩ is -1.

The operator we're looking at is 10σz + 5σx. So the expectation value is the average outcome we'd expect if we measured this operator many times on the state. The expectation value formula is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So I'll need to compute this for 10σz +5σx.

Hmm, expectation values add up, so maybe I can compute the expectation values for each term separately and then add them. That should be easier. So let's write it as 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

First, compute ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value of σz in this state is just the probability of each state multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

The state is 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Let me square the coefficients to get the probabilities. 0.5 squared is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4. So, the probabilities are 25% and 75% respectively.

Wait, wait, actually, coefficients are (0.5, sqrt(3)/2). Squaring each, 0.25 and 3/4, which adds up to 1, so that's correct.

So for σz, the eigenvalues are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So 10⟨σz⟩ is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now the next part is ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix. Its eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. But calculating ⟨σx⟩ for a given state might be a bit trickier.

I remember that the expectation value of σx can be found using the inner product. Let me write down the state vector. Since we're dealing with spin-½ particles, the states can be represented as 2-component vectors. Let me choose the standard basis where |↑⟩ is (1,0) and |↓⟩ is (0,1).

So the state ψ is 0.5 |↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩, which as a vector is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

The σx matrix is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So to compute ⟨σx⟩, which is ψ† σx ψ.

Alternatively, since σx has eigenvalues +1 and -1, but that might not directly help here. Let
