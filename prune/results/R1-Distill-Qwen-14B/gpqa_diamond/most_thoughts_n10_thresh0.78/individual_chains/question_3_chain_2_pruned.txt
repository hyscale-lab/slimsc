Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about expectation values. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question says a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition state: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh wait, and these |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z-matrix. Right, because σz has those as its eigenstates with eigenvalues +1 and -1, or was it the other way around? I think |↑⟩ is the +1 eigenstate and |↓⟩ is -1.

The operator we're looking at is 10σz + 5σx. So the expectation value is the average outcome we'd expect if we measured this operator many times on the state. The expectation value formula is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So I'll need to compute this for 10σz +5σx.

Hmm, expectation values add up, so maybe I can compute the expectation values for each term separately and then add them. That should be easier. So let's write it as 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

First, compute ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value of σz in this state is just the probability of each state multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

The state is 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Let me square the coefficients to get the probabilities. 0.5 squared is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4. So, the probabilities are 25% and 75% respectively.

Wait, wait, actually, coefficients are (0.5, sqrt(3)/2). Squaring each, 0.25 and 3/4, which adds up to 1, so that's correct.

So for σz, the eigenvalues are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So 10⟨σz⟩ is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now the next part is ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix. Its eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. But calculating ⟨σx⟩ for a given state might be a bit trickier.

I remember that the expectation value of σx can be found using the inner product. Let me write down the state vector. Since we're dealing with spin-½ particles, the states can be represented as 2-component vectors. Let me choose the standard basis where |↑⟩ is (1,0) and |↓⟩ is (0,1).

So the state ψ is 0.5 |↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩, which as a vector is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

The σx matrix is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So to compute ⟨σx⟩, which is ψ† σx ψ.

Alternatively, since σx has eigenvalues +1 and -1, but that might not directly help here. Let
