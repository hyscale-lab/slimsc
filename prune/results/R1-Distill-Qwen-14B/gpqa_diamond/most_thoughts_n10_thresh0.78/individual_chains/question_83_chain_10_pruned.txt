Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A, B, C, D with different pairs of pH values.

First, I think I should figure out what happens during each of these steps. Let's start by understanding the initial dilution.

So, the initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) and the concentration is 0.05 M. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 liters). Since the amount of solute doesn't change, I can use the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

Calculating the diluted concentration:
M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.00002 m³ (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters, which is 0.00002 m³? Wait, no, perhaps it's easier to just use liters. So 20 mL is 0.02 L.

So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 0.02 L) / 0.04 L = (0.001 mol) / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Oh wait, 0.05 * 0.02 is 0.001 moles of acetic acid. Then divided by 0.04 L gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that. 0.05 M is moles per liter. So 0.05 mol/L * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Then the new volume is 40 mL (0.04 L), so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

So after dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, we're titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. So, the reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (a strong base) will produce its conjugate base, acetate ion (CH3COO^-), along with water.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid present initially. So, I need to find the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.

But wait, the question is about 25% titration and the equivalence point
