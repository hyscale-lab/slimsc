Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate, producing 2 photons. The energies of both photons are the same. One photon is moving in the upper-right direction, the other in the lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Hmm. So, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, and since energy and momentum must be conserved, that's probably what I need to use here.

First, let's think about the initial setup. The electron and positron are moving towards each other. Since they are each other's antiparticles, they annihilate upon collision. The electron has a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron has a Lorentz factor of 2.

Wait, Lorentz factor gamma is equal to 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So gamma tells us about their speeds. But for momentum and energy, I need to calculate their relativistic momentum and energy.

The electron and positron have the same rest mass, right? The rest mass energy is mc², which for electron is about 0.511 MeV. But since we're dealing with relativistic speeds, their energies and momenta will be higher.

So, for each particle, their total energy is gamma * mc², and their momentum is gamma * beta * m c. Since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, its momentum vector would be negative relative to the electron's direction.

Let me set up the coordinate system. Let's say the electron is moving along the positive x-direction, and the positron along the negative x (since it's coming from the right). So, their momenta would be opposite in direction.

But wait, in the problem statement, the electron is moving from the left, so along the positive x-direction, and the positron is moving from the right, so along the negative x. So, their momenta are in opposite directions.

Let me denote the electron as particle A and positron as particle B.

For particle A (electron), gamma is 4. So, its energy E_A = gamma * m c² = 4 * m c².

Its momentum p_A = gamma * beta * m c. Beta is v/c, so beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)). Wait, actually, beta can be found from gamma: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²), so 1 - beta² = 1/gamma², so beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

So for gamma=4, beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682.

Similarly, for gamma=2 (positron), beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So, the momenta are:

p_A = gamma_e * beta_e * m c = 4 * (sqrt(15)/4) * m c = sqrt(15) m c.

Similarly, p_B (positron) is gamma_p * beta_p * m c. Wait, but since it's moving in the opposite direction, the momentum is negative. So p_B = - gamma_p * beta_p * m c.

Gamma_p is 2, beta_p is sqrt(3)/2. So p_B = - 2 * (sqrt(3)/2) m c = - sqrt(3) m c.

So the total momentum before collision is p_A + p_B = sqrt(15) m c - sqrt(3) m c.

Wait, let me compute that numerically. sqrt(15) is about 3.872, sqrt(3) is about 1.732. So 3.872 -1.732 = 2.14 m c.

But wait, I should probably keep it symbolic for now. Let me compute it symbolically.

Total initial momentum P_initial = sqrt(15) m c - sqrt(3) m c = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] m c.

Wait, but wait: when the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative. So the electron's momentum is positive, the positron's is negative.

Wait, perhaps I should correct that. Let me re-express this:

Electron direction: positive x.

Positron direction: negative x.

So their momenta are p_A = (gamma_e * beta_e) * m c in +x, and p_B = - (gamma_p * beta_p) * m c in -x.

So, P_initial = p_A + p_B = [gamma_e beta_e m c] + [ - gamma_p beta_p m c ].

Which is [ (gamma_e beta_e) - gamma_p beta_p ] m c.

Wait, but wait, gamma_p is for the positron, which has the same mass as the electron, m. So gamma_e is 4, beta_e is sqrt(15)/4. Gamma_p is 2, beta_p is sqrt(3)/2.

So substituting:

gamma_e beta_e = 4 * (sqrt(15)/4 ) = sqrt(15)

gamma_p beta_p = 2 * (sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)

So P_initial = [ sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ] m c.

That's the total momentum before collision.

Now, after annihilation, we have two photons. Each photon's momentum is E/c, and the direction is determined by the angles.

But the problem states that the two photons have the same energy. So E1 = E2 = E_photon.

Each photon's momentum is p = E_photon / c.

The directions are upper-right and lower-right, so their angles from the x-axis are theta and -theta (symmetric about x-axis?), but wait, the problem says one is upper-right, the other lower-right. So their angles from the x-axis are, say, theta and 180 - theta, but wait no, because they are both in the right half-plane.

Wait, but in this case, let me think: after annihilation, the two photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions. So, one is at an angle theta above the x-axis, the other at angle phi below the x-axis. However, the problem states that their energies are the same, so their momenta magnitudes are equal.

Wait, but the problem states that the energies are the same, so each photon has energy E. So their momenta are E/c each, but in different directions.

The problem is to find the angle between the two photons' directions.

Wait, but both are moving towards the right, but one is above the x-axis, and the other is below. So the angle between the two is theta + phi, if, say, theta is the angle above the x-axis, and phi is the angle below.

But perhaps the problem is symmetric. Maybe the two angles are symmetric with respect to the x-axis.

Wait, perhaps the two photons are emitted symmetrically about the x-axis. So their angles are symmetric, say theta and -theta. Then the angle between them would be 2 theta.

Alternatively, perhaps they are emitted in such a way that the angle between them is 180 - 2 theta, depending on how their angles are arranged.

But let me think in terms of conservation laws.

Conservation of momentum and energy.

The total energy after annihilation must equal the total energy before.

The total momentum before is P_initial = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m c.

The total energy before is E_initial = E_A + E_B = 4 m c² + 2 m c² = 6 m c².

After annihilation, the energy is carried by the two photons, each of energy E. So total energy after is 2E.

So, 6 m c² = 2 E => E = 3 m c².

Each photon has energy E = 3 m c². So each photon's momentum is E/c = (3 m c²)/c = 3 m c.

So each photon's momentum magnitude is 3 m c.

Now, the direction of each photon: one is in the upper-right direction, the other in the lower-right. Let me define their angles from the x-axis as theta and -theta, respectively. So the angle between them is 2 theta.

Wait, but let me verify.

But how about the momentum vectors? Each photon's momentum vector has components (p_x, p_y) = (3 m c cos theta, 3 m c sin theta ) and (3 m c cos(-theta), 3 m c sin(-theta)) ) = (3 m c cos theta, -3 m c sin theta).

So total momentum after is the sum of these two vectors.

Let me compute that:

P_after_x = 3 m c cos theta + 3 m c cos theta = 6 m c cos theta.

P_after_y = 3 m c sin theta - 3 m c sin theta = 0.

Wait, so the y-components cancel each other out.

But the initial momentum has a y-component of zero, so that's consistent. So the P_after_y must be zero, which it is in this setup.

So, the x-component after must equal the initial P_initial.

We have P_after_x = 6 m c cos theta.

And this must equal P_initial = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m c.

So,

6 m c cos theta = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m c.

Divide both sides by m c:

6 cos theta = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

Cos theta = ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ) / 6.

Let me compute this value numerically.

Compute sqrt(15) ≈ 3.87298, sqrt(3) ≈ 1.73205.

So, sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.87298 - 1.73205 = 2.14093.

Divide by 6: 2.14093 /6 ≈ 0.35682.

So, cos theta ≈ 0.3568.

So theta ≈ arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69 degrees.

Wait, because cos(60) is 0.5, cos(70) is about 0.3420.

Wait, 0.3568 is between 69 and 70 degrees.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

cos(69 degrees) ≈ 0.3584.

Oh, wait, because 0.3584 is very close to 0.3568. So theta is approximately 69 degrees.

Wait, but let me compute it more precisely.

Using a calculator:

cos(theta) = 0.35682.

So, theta = arccos(0.35682) ≈ 69 degrees.

Wait, but let's compute it more accurately. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps it's exactly sqrt(15)-sqrt(3) over 6, which is maybe a known cosine value?

Alternatively, perhaps the exact angle isn't necessary, but to proceed.

So, the angle theta is approximately 69 degrees above the x-axis for one photon, and 69 degrees below for the other. The angle between them is 2 theta, which would be around 138 degrees.

Wait, but wait: if each photon is at theta and -theta, the angle between them is 2 theta. So 2 * 69 is 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138 degrees.

Wait, but let me be precise. Let me compute the exact value.

Compute (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) /6.

sqrt(15) ≈3.872983346, sqrt(3)≈1.732050808.

So sqrt(15)-sqrt(3) ≈2.140932538.

Divide by 6: 2.140932538/6≈0.3568220897.

So cos(theta)=0.3568220897.

What's arccos(0.35682)?

Let me think: 69 degrees is about 0.3584, as I mentioned. So 69 degrees is cos≈0.3584.

But 0.3568 is a bit less than that, so theta is a bit more than 69 degrees, perhaps 69.1 or so.

So 2 theta would be approximately 138.2 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138.

So that's probably the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the angles are symmetric. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: since the two photons have the same energy and their momentum vectors sum to the initial momentum, which is along x.

So, the total momentum after is P_after = (p1 + p2) = (p1_x + p2_x, p1_y + p2_y).

But since the initial momentum is along x, the y-components must cancel. So p1_y = -p2_y.

Given both photons have the same energy, their momenta magnitudes are the same: |p1|=|p2|=3 m c.

So, p1 = (3 m c cos theta, 3 m c sin theta )

p2 = (3 m c cos phi, 3 m c sin phi )

Wait, but the problem states that one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So their y-components are in opposite directions. So perhaps phi is in the lower-right, so sin phi would be negative.

Wait, perhaps if one is at angle theta above x, the other is at angle phi below x.

So, for example, p1 = (3 m c cos theta, 3 m c sin theta )

p2 = (3 m c cos phi, -3 m c sin phi )

But their energies are the same, so the magnitudes are the same.

But because of the collision, perhaps the system's momentum is along x, so the sum of the y-components must be zero.

So, 3 m c sin theta - 3 m c sin phi = 0.

Which implies sin theta = sin phi.

But since theta is above x and phi is below, perhaps theta = phi. Because sin(theta) = sin(phi) could mean theta = phi or theta = 180 - phi. But considering the photons are moving in opposite quadrants, phi would be negative theta.

Wait, perhaps theta = - phi.

So, then sin(theta) = - sin(phi).

But wait, in the equation, 3 m c sin theta + (-3 m c sin phi) = 0.

Wait, perhaps I should set it up again.

Sum of y-components: p1_y + p2_y = 3 m c sin theta (for upper photon) + 3 m c sin phi (but since it's lower, phi is negative, so sin phi is negative). So, 3 m c sin theta + 3 m c sin phi = 0.

Which implies sin theta + sin phi = 0.

So sin theta = - sin phi.

Which could imply phi = -theta, as sin(-theta) = - sin theta.

So, yes, the two photons are symmetric in theta and -theta.

So, the two photons' angles are theta and -theta, and the angle between them is theta - (-theta)= 2 theta.

So, total x-component:

p1_x + p2_x = 3 m c cos theta + 3 m c cos (-theta) = 6 m c cos theta.

Which must equal the initial momentum: (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m c.

So,

6 m c cos theta = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m c.

Cancel m c,

6 cos theta = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

Which is what I had earlier.

So, cos theta = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6.

Which is approximately 0.3568, leading to theta ≈ 69 degrees.

So the angle between the photons is 2 theta ≈ 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138.

So the answer should be C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation of the electron and positron, followed by the production of two photons. Conservation of energy and momentum are applied to determine the angle between the two photons.

### Step 1: Initial Momentum and Energy
The electron and positron move along the horizontal axis with Lorentz factors \( \gamma_e = 4 \) and \( \gamma_p = 2 \), respectively. Their rest mass is \( m \), and the speed of light is \( c \). The relativistic momentum and energy for each particle are:

- **Electron (A):**
  - Momentum: \( p_A = \gamma_e \beta_e m c \), where \( \beta_e = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_e^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{15}{16}} = \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4} \).
  - Momentum: \( p_A = 4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4} m c = \sqrt{15} m c \).
  - Energy: \( E_A = \gamma_e m c^2 = 4 m c^2 \).

- **Positron (B):**
  - Momentum: \( p_B = -\gamma_p \beta_p m c \), where \( \beta_p = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_p^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \).
  - Momentum: \( p_B = -2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} m c = -\sqrt{3} m c \).
  - Energy: \( E_B = \gamma_p m c^2 = 2 m c^2 \).

The total initial momentum is:
\[
P_{\text{initial}} = p_A + p_B = \sqrt{15} m c - \sqrt{3} m c = [\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}] m c.
\]

The total initial energy is:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = E_A + E_B = 4 m c^2 + 2 m c^2 = 6 m c^2.
\]

### Step 2: Final Momentum and Energy
After annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energies \( E_1 = E_2 = E \). The energy of each photon is related to its momentum by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \). Since the photons have the same energy, their momenta magnitudes are equal: \( |p_1| = |p_2| = \frac{E}{c} \).

The problem states that one photon moves in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right direction. Let the angles of the photons with respect to the x-axis be \( \theta \) (upper) and \( -\theta \) (lower). The momentum components of the photons are:

- Photon 1 (upper): \( p_1 = \left( p \cos\theta, p \sin\theta \right) \).
- Photon 2 (lower): \( p_2 = \left( p \cos(-\theta), p \sin(-\theta) \right) = \left( p \cos\theta, -p \sin\theta \right) \).

The total momentum after annihilation is:
\[
P_{\text{final}} = p_1 + p_2 = \left( 2 p \cos\theta, 0 \right).
\]

### Step 3: Conservation of Momentum
From conservation of momentum, the total momentum before and after the collision must be equal:
\[
P_{\text{final}} = P_{\text{initial}}.
\]
Thus:
\[
2 p \cos\theta = [\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}] m c.
\]

The momentum of each photon is \( p = \frac{E}{c} \). From conservation of energy, the total energy after annihilation is:
\[
E_1 + E_2 = 2E = 6 m c^2 \implies E = 3 m c^2.
\]
Thus:
\[
p = \frac{E}{c} = \frac{3 m c^2}{c} = 3 m c.
\]

Substituting \( p = 3 m c \) into the momentum equation:
\[
2 (3 m c) \cos\theta = [\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}] m c.
\]
Simplify:
\[
6 \cos\theta = \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}.
\]
\[
\cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( \theta \)
Numerically:
\[
\sqrt{15} \approx 3.872, \quad \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732.
\]
\[
\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3} \approx 3.872 - 1.732 = 2.140.
\]
\[
\cos\theta = \frac{2.140}{6} \approx 0.3568.
\]
\[
\theta = \arccos(0.3568) \approx 69^\circ.
\]

### Step 5: Angle Between the Photons
The two photons are symmetric about the x-axis, with angles \( \theta \) and \( -\theta \). The angle between them is:
\[
\text{Angle} = \theta - (-\theta) = 2\theta \approx 2 \cdot 69^\circ = 138^\circ.
\]

### Final Answer
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.
