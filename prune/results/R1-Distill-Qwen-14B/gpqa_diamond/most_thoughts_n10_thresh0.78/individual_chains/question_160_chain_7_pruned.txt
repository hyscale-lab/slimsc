Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like a regular N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, perpendicular to the aperture. The question is about finding the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field. The options are given, and we're supposed to approximate using tanθ ≈ θ because the angles are small.

Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about diffraction patterns. The far field diffraction pattern is basically the Fraunhofer diffraction. For a single slit, the minima occur at certain angles where the path difference leads to destructive interference.

Wait, but this isn't a single slit; it's an N-sided polygon. Oh, but when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. So in the limit as N approaches infinity, the aperture becomes a circular aperture. But wait, the question says N is infinitely large, so the shape is a circle.

Wait, no, wait. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon with N sides, the apothem is a. So for a polygon, each side has a certain length. Let me think about the relation between the apothem (a) and the radius (R) of the circumscribed circle. Oh right, R = a / cos(π/N). But as N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so R approaches a. So the radius of the circular aperture would be a when N is very large.

Wait, but I might be getting ahead of myself. Let me think again. The question is about the first two minima in the far field. For a circular aperture, the first diffraction minima (the first dark ring) occurs at an angle given by something like sinθ = λ/(π a), or wait, no. Let me recall the formula for the minima in circular diffraction. The minima (dark rings) occur when the path difference from the edges leads to destructive interference. The formula for the minima in a circular aperture is given by (nλ)/(2R) = sinθ, where n is an integer, for the nth minima. Wait, no, that might not be right. Or is it that for the mth minimum, mλ = 2 R sinθ or something like that.

Wait
