Okay, so I've got this physics question about radioactive decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says we have an atom that has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed. We need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, wait. So the initial 100 minutes probability is 32%. But 50 minutes have gone by without decay. So we're now looking at the remaining time, which is 150 minutes, but wait, no. Wait, the question says 'next 150 minutes.' Oh wait, no, wait. Let me read the question again.

So far, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So the remaining time we're considering is the next 150 minutes? Or is it 150 minutes total, meaning 100 minutes from the start? Hmm, the question says the probability within 100 minutes is 32%. But now, 50 have passed, so we're looking for the next 150. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because 150 is longer than 100. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, I think the initial setup is that the decay probability is 32% within 100
