Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these organic compounds show optical isomerism. Optical isomerism is when a compound has stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images, leading to different optical properties. These are also known as enantiomers. I remember that for a compound to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center or a plane of asymmetry, but wait—chiral centers are the main thing. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyls can sometimes have stereoisomerism. The biphenyl group has two benzene rings connected by a single bond. But wait, does that single bond allow for free rotation? If so, maybe they don't have stereoisomers. Oh, but wait, the substituents here are at 6 and 2 positions. Let me visualize: each phenyl ring has substituents at the 2 and 6 positions. The central bond between the two benzene rings is a single bond, so it can rotate. But if the substituents on each ring are in positions that can't be rotated into the same arrangement, that could create stereoisomers. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in such a way that they're not symmetrical, then the molecule could have a plane of asymmetry or a chiral center. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry, which would mean no optical isomerism. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. If the substituents are arranged in a way that creates no symmetry, then maybe there's a possibility of stereoisomerism. Oh wait, but wait—biphenyls can have what's called "dihedral" isomerism if the substituents are arranged in a way that their spatial arrangement is different. So for 1,1'-biphenyls, if the substituents are in positions that prevent rotation into the same arrangement, then they can have isomers. But I'm not entirely sure if this compound has that. Let me think about the numbering. The substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, and there are nitro groups at 6 and 2 on each ring? Wait, no, the formula is 6,6'-dinitro, meaning each ring has a nitro at position 6. And 2,2'-dicarboxylate, so each ring has a carboxylate at 2. So each ring would have substituents at 2 and 6. Wait, that's on the same ring. So each ring is substituted at 2 and 6, and the central bond is between the 1 positions of each ring. Wait, in biphenyl, each ring is connected at position 1. So if each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, maybe the arrangement around the central bond could lead to cis or trans isomerism. Because the substituents on each ring would be in certain positions relative to each other. For example, when the rings are connected, the substituents at 2 and 6 could be on the same face (cis) or opposite (trans). But wait, does that create a chiral center? Or is it more about the arrangement around the single bond? Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a center of symmetry. If the substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule could be achiral. But in this case, with the nitro groups on 6 and the carboxylate on 2, each ring has two substituents. If the arrangement leads to a non-superimposable mirror image, then it would have optical isomerism.

Option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's think about the structure. Propanoate means the ester is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, no, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CHOHCOOH. So the ester would be CH3CHOHCOOCH3. So the structure is:

O

O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-OH

CH3

Wait, no, wait. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. But 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3? Wait, no, 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3CH(OH)COO-. So the structure is
