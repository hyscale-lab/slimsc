Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the enthalpy of formation of a specific compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see what I can remember.

The compound is given as (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me try to parse its structure. It looks like a polyene with some substituents. Oh wait, maybe it's a molecule with multiple double bonds? Let me count the double bonds. I see two double bonds: one in the middle and another at the end. So that's two C=C bonds.

Enthalpy of formation usually relates to the bonds formed and broken. Oh right, the formula for calculating enthalpy of formation using bond energies is: 

ΔHf° = [sum of bond energies of reactants] - [sum of bond energies of products]

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the standard formula is the reverse. The enthalpy of formation is calculated by considering the energy used to break bonds in the reactants and the energy released when forming bonds in the products. So, it's the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the sum of products' bond energies. Or maybe it's the other way around. Let me think. Oh, right, the enthalpy of formation is the energy change when the compound is formed from
