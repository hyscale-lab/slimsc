Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it step by step.

Alright, the question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But wait, the problem is about their elemental abundances, so maybe the mass isn't super relevant here. Let's check.

The problem states that using the EW method and assuming LTE, they've determined some abundances. The given values are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is provided as:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5
12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7

I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, what's the ratio [n_Si, Star1] / [n_Si, Star2]?

Wait, but how are these abundance ratios calculated? I remember that the [X/Y] notation is a logarithmic scale. The brackets mean log10 of the ratio of X to Y abundances relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

So, the problem is about finding the abundance of Si in each star relative to H, but perhaps using the given ratios.

Let me break it down for each star.

Starting with Star_1:
We have [Fe/H]_1 = 0. That means the Fe abundance relative to H is the same as in the Sun. So log10(nFe1/nH1) = log10(nFe_sun/nH_sun) = 7.5 -12? Wait, wait. Oh wait, the Sun's value is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So the Sun's log(nFe/n
