Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams, is heated to 200°C without air. When heated, they form a mixture of gases. These gases are then passed through several tubes. Let me go through each part.

First, the setup: after heating, the gases pass through three tubes. The first tube has anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant and can absorb water vapor. So, if the gas has any moisture, this tube would gain mass. The result says the first tube's weight increased by 3.60 grams. So that suggests that the gas carried water vapor, which was absorbed by Mg(ClO4)2.

Second tube is Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas is CO2, it would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water. But the problem states that the weight of the second tube didn't change. That implies that no CO2 was present in the gas mixture. So the gas that passed through didn't react with the solution, meaning there's no CO2. So the gas must be something else, maybe H2O or another type, but wait, the first tube already took the water vapor.

Wait, but the third tube is red-hot copper. Copper is used to react with certain gases. Like, if the gas is H2S, it would react with copper to form CuS and release S, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the gas is H2, but I don't think so. Wait, another possibility: if the gas is water vapor, then the first tube would have captured it. The third tube's weight increased by 0.80 grams, which is CuO formed. So the gas that reacted with copper must have been H2. Because when H2 is passed over hot copper, it can cause the copper to react, producing water, but wait—no, more accurately, if H2 is combusted, but it's passed over hot copper, which is in an oxidizing environment. Wait, maybe it's carbon monoxide? Because CO reacts with Cu in certain conditions. Or another thought: when a gas like H2S is passed over hot copper, it might not react. Hmm.

Wait, the third tube's weight increased by 0.80g, and it's copper oxide that's formed. So perhaps the gas was H2. When H2 is passed over hot CuO, it reduces it to Cu, but wait no—H2 is a reducing agent. Let me think. If the gas was H2, and it passed over red-hot copper, I think it would react with any CuO present. But in this case, the copper is initially in its metallic form. So maybe the H2 doesn't react. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is water vapor, but that doesn't make sense because the first tube should have captured all the water. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the third tube
