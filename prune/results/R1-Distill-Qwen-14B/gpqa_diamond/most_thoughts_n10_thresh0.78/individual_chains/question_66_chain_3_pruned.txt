Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), and I need to figure out which of the given symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Hmm, I remember from my studies that SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible interactions allowed by certain symmetries, right?

The question gives four options: Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these. Let me think about each symmetry one by one.

First, Lorentz Symmetry. I think that in any relativistic theory, like the Standard Model or SMEFT, the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. Because if they didn't, the theory wouldn't be consistent with special relativity, which is a fundamental part of how physics works at high energies. So all operators in SMEFT should be Lorentz invariant. So option 1 is definitely a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare includes Lorentz plus translations. So if a theory is Lorentz symmetric and also translation symmetric, it has Poincare symmetry. But does SMEFT require all operators to have Poincare symmetry? I'm a bit unsure. Because SMEFT is an effective theory, maybe some operators are constructed in a way that they're local, but do they all have to respect Poincare? Wait, the operators in SMEFT are usually written as local operators, so I think they should respect Poincare symmetry. But wait, no, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory. Oh wait, noâ€”SMEFT is a high-energy effective theory, but the operators are local. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe Poincare symmetry is automatically included because Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry are part of it. So if the operators respect Lorentz, then combined with translation symmetry (which SMEFT probably does), then Poincare is also respected. So if 1 is correct, then 2 might also be correct. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe operators in SMEFT can have terms that are not Poincare invariant, but I don't think so. Because effective operators are built respecting
