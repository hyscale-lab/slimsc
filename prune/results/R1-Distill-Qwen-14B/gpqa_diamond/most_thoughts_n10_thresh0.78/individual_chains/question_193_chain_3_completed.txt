Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. And they're asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are in terms of r cubed, r fifth, r fourth, or r squared. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Parallax is the reciprocal of distance. Like, plx = 1/distance. So if the distance is larger, the parallax is smaller. Oh right, in parsecs, I think. So distance r is in parsecs, and plx (in arcseconds) is 1/r.

So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/plx^5. But since plx is 1/r, that means plx = 1/r. So plx^5 would be (1/r)^5 = 1/r^5.

So substituting, N ∝ 1/(1/r^5) = r^5. Wait, that's N proportional to r^5? But wait, no. Because N is the number. Wait, wait. Let me think again. If N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/r, then N is proportional to (r)^5. Because 1/(1/r)^5 is r^5.

But that seems a bit fast. Let me think about it more carefully. Let me write the relationship.

N = k / (plx)^5, where k is a constant.

Since plx = 1/r, substitute that in:

N = k / ( (1/r) )^5 = k * r^5.

So N is proportional to r^5. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So perhaps it's not about N as a function of r, but about the change as you move in r.

Wait, maybe it's about the density of stars, like the number per unit volume or per distance. Or perhaps the number per unit distance (like a column density). Let me think.

Suppose the number of stars is N, and the distance is r. The way the question is phrased might be tricky. It says the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k * (1/plx)^5. Since plx is 1/r, that becomes N = k r^5. So as r increases, N increases as r^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance. So if r increases by a small amount, how does N change? Maybe they're asking about the differential change, like dN/dr. Because if N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr is 5 r^4. But that's not one of the options. The options are in terms of r^something, but not derivatives.

Wait, no. The options are about the number of stars changing with r, per unit r. Wait, perhaps the way to think about it is the number of stars in a shell at radius r, with thickness dr. Like, the number per unit distance.

Wait, in 3D space, the number of stars in a thin shell at radius r would be the surface area of the shell times the thickness, multiplied by some density. But wait, in this question, the relation is given as number varying with parallax as 1/plx^5. So perhaps it's a 2D problem, not 3D. Because parallax is a 2D concept; it's about how much a star moves against the background as seen from Earth, which depends on the distance.

Wait, maybe this is about the number of stars in a certain area of the sky, not the entire volume. Because parallax relates to distance, but when you're observing a region of the sky, you're looking along the line of sight. So perhaps the number of stars per unit area in the sky would increase with distance in a certain way.

Wait, the number of stars observed in a region of the sky depends on how much of the volume you can see. Since volume increases with r^3, but if the density of stars varies, that affects it. But the question says the number varies as 1/plx^5. Let's go back to the basics.

Parallax is inversely proportional to distance: plx = 1/r (in parsecs). So plx in arcseconds. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5 = (r)^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So when you go to a larger distance, the number of stars increases as r^5. But wait, that doesn't make sense because as you look further away, the actual number of stars you can see should depend on the volume. Unless the density of stars increases.

Wait, but in this question, the number of stars varies with parallax in that way. So perhaps in this specific region, as you look further (higher r), the number of stars you see in that region increases as r^5. Hmm.

But the question is, how does the number of stars change with distance (per unit range of distance, r). So perhaps it's the rate of change of N with respect to r. So if N = k r^5, then dN/dr is 5 k r^4. So the number of stars increases with r^4 per unit r. But looking at the options, option C is r^4, but the options are about how the number changes, not the derivative.

Wait, no, the options are about the change with distance, per unit distance. So maybe the number of stars in a unit range of distance, which would be the number per unit distance, which is the derivative dN/dr.

Wait, but the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". So perhaps it's the number of stars per unit distance, which would be dN/dr. Because per unit distance, how much does the number change.

So, if N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr is proportional to r^4, which would be option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars is proportional to r^5, so when you go from r to r+dr, the number increases by 5 r^4 dr. So per unit dr, the change is proportional to r^4. Therefore, the change is approximately r^4 per unit r.

Looking at the options, that's option C.

Wait, but let me think again. Let me consider that the number of stars N as a function of parallax is given. So N = k / (plx)^5. Plx is 1/r, so N = k r^5.

So, how does N change as r increases by dr? The change in N, dN, would be 5 k r^4 dr. So the change per unit distance (dr = 1) is 5 k r^4. So the rate of change is proportional to r^4, so the number of stars per unit distance (the derivative) is ~ r^4.

So the correct answer would be option C, ~r^4.


The question states that the number of stars \( N \) in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto 1/\text{plx}^5 \). Since parallax \( \text{plx} \) is inversely proportional to distance \( r \) (i.e., \( \text{plx} = 1/r \)), substituting this relationship gives \( N \propto r^5 \). 

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance \( r \). This corresponds to the derivative \( dN/dr \), which represents the rate of change of \( N \) with respect to \( r \). Taking the derivative of \( N \propto r^5 \), we find \( dN/dr \propto r^4 \). 

Thus, the number of stars in the region increases with distance at a rate proportional to \( r^4 \) per unit distance. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
