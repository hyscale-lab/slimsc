Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the maximum speed of a particle in a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. 

Wait, so in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed would be straightforward. I remember that for a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². At the maximum speed, all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max². Solving that gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, this is the non-relativistic case. The question is about the relativistic scenario, so I need to think differently.

Oh right, in relativity, the energy isn't just kinetic plus potential; it's the total energy including rest mass energy. So the total energy E of the oscillator should be the sum of the rest energy (mc²) and the kinetic energy. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the oscillator's maximum speed relates to the total energy in a relativistic equation.

In relativistic mechanics, the total energy is given by E = gamma * mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The kinetic energy would then be E - mc². But I'm not exactly certain how the potential energy plays into this in the relativistic case. Oh, wait, the problem states that it's obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx, which suggests that the potential is still (1/2)kx². But I'm not sure if that's the case relativistically. Alternatively, maybe the potential is treated classically, but the kinetic energy is relativistic.

So the total mechanical energy E would be the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy. At maximum amplitude A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero because the mass is at rest (momentarily). But wait, no, wait. At maximum displacement A, the oscillator is at rest in the classical sense, so the velocity is zero. So at that point, all energy is potential. But when it passes through equilibrium (x=0), the potential energy is
