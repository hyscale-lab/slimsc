Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about a synthesized peptidic compound. The 1H NMR has two peaks for the same alpha-proton, but their integrals add up to 1H. So each must be about half. Also, the chemical shifts are similar, so maybe it's some kind of splitting but not from coupling because they ruled that out. Wait, what's coupling? Oh, right, spin-spin coupling between protons. So these two peaks aren't because of that.

Then, looking at the LC-MS. The crude compound shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass. So same molecular weight. Hmm, but why two peaks then?

The options are A to D. Let me think about each. Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, a precursor would have a different mass, right? Because it's the starting material before a reaction. But the LC-MS says both have the same mass. So probably not A.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, non-superimposable. They would have the same molecular weight and same retention times? Wait, in LC-MS, if the column is chiral, enantiomers would separate. But if it's a regular column, they might elute together. Oh, but the question says it's done at elevated temperature. Maybe the column's not chiral. So if the LC is achiral, enantiomers would appear as a single peak. Unless the mobile phase is such that they co-elute, but the question says two peaks. So maybe not B.

Option C: Double coupling during amide bond formation. Hmm, during synthesis, sometimes when forming an amide, if you have some byproduct or something goes wrong, like maybe a double coupling? Wait, doesn't that form a different structure, like an extra amide bond? Maybe that would give a different mass. But the mass spec is same. So maybe C is not the answer.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they'd have different retention times. So in LC-MS, two peaks with same mass, but different structures (like diastereomers) would appear as two. Wait, but diastereomers would have different mass? No, same molecular formula, so same mass. Oh, right, same molecular weight. So if they're diastereomers, they might have same mass but different structures. In NMR, diastereotopic protons can have different shifts. Wait, but the question says the same alpha-proton is causing two peaks. So maybe the alpha proton is in a diastereotopic environment? Or perhaps the splitting isn't about diastereot
