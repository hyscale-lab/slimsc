Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major products formed in two separate reactions. Let me break it down step by step.

Starting with the first reaction: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol reacting with THF, KH, and then H+. Hmm, I remember that THF is a solvent, and KH is potassium hydride, a strong base. So, the conditions here are probably for some kind of elimination or ring-forming reaction.

The starting material is a spiro compound. Spiro compounds have two rings connected through a single atom, which in this case is the spiro alcohol. The structure is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol, so I think the spiro is between a five-membered ring and a seven-membered ring or something like that. Wait, the spiro notation [3.5] means the two rings have 3 and 5 carbons respectively, so the spiro is between a 3-membered ring and a 5-membered ring? Or wait, maybe it's the sizes of the two rings connected. Hmm, maybe I should draw it out mentally. 

But regardless, the presence of a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached to the spiro alcohol suggests that when a base like KH is used, it might deprotonate the alcohol, forming an alkoxide. Then, in such conditions, especially with heat or other factors, elimination reactions can happen. Since the compound has a double bond (enol), maybe it's about forming a more stable carbocation or undergoing an E2 elimination.

Wait, but another possibility is that this is a conjugate addition. Alternatively, I remember that when a spiro alcohol is treated with a strong base, it can undergo a ring-opening or even form a bicyclic structure through some kind of cyclization. Oh wait, maybe this is a case for the Cope elimination? Or perhaps it's a pinacol-like rearrangement? Wait, no, pinacol rearrangement involves vicinal diols.

Wait, another thought: The compound has a spiro structure with an allylic alcohol. When treated with a base, the alcohol could be deprotonated, making it a better leaving group as an alkoxide, but then what? Alternatively, the base could abstract a proton leading to an elimination, forming a double bond elsewhere.

Alternatively, I remember that when a vinyl group is attached in such a way, it might undergo a [1,2] shift or some kind of elimination leading to ring formation. Wait, another possibility is that this is a vinylogous substitution. Or maybe it's a Claisen or Cope rearrangement.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is a spiro alcohol with a vinyl group. When treated with a strong base like KH, which is a good base but also a source of H- (hydride), maybe it's a deprotonation followed by a hydride transfer or some kind of addition.

Alternatively, thinking about the reaction conditions. THF is a good solvent for such reactions, often used in Grignard or organometallic reactions. But here, since it's KH, which is a strong base, perhaps the
