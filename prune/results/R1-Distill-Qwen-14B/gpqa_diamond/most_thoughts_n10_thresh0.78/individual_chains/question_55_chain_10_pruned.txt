Okay, so I've got this NMR question in front of me. The compound is either one of four esters: Cis-propenyl, Trans-propenyl, Cis-butenyl, or Trans-butenyl acetates. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that NMR splitting patterns can tell us a lot about the structure. The 1H NMR data given is: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16Hz), 5.5 ppm (1H, dq), 2.1 ppm (3H, s), and 1.6 ppm (3H, d). 

Let me break this down. The singlet at 2.1 ppm (3H) is probably the acetate group's methyl, since those are usually around that region. So that's the OAc part. Now, the other signals must be the propenyl or butenyl group.

Looking at the other peaks: the doublet at 7.0 ppm with a coupling of 16Hz. Wait, 16Hz is a pretty large coupling constant. That's typical for a vinyl group, like in an alkene. So a doublet suggests that this proton has one neighboring proton. 

Then there's the peak at 5.5 ppm, which is a doublet of quadruplets (dq). Hmm, that's a bit more complex. The splitting might come from coupling with two different sets of protons. Maybe it's a vinyl proton adjacent to another set.

So for propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2CH2COOCH3 or something similar. Wait, wait, no. Wait, propenyl is CH2CH2CH2? No, propenyl is CH2CHCH2, but more accurately, it's CH2=CHCH2-OAc or something else. Wait, no, wait. The ester is OAc-O- attached to the propenyl group. So the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait. No, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- so the ester would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

Wait, but more accurately, the structure for propenyl acetate is CH2=CHCH2OAc. Wait, but the substituents would affect the NMR.

Wait, let's think about the structure of each option. 

Trans-propenyl acetate would be where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituents (like the OAc and the CH2CH3) are on opposite sides. Wait, but propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- group. Wait, maybe not. Wait, propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-, so the ester would be CH2=CHCH2OAc. But wait, propenyl is CH2=CH2CH2? No, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw the structures mentally. For propenyl acetate, the structure is AcO-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, perhaps AcO-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait. Wait, no, wait. No, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me
