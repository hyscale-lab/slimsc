Okay, so I have this vector calculus problem, and I need to figure it out. Let's read through it again to make sure I understand.

The question says that there's a vector field f(r) that falls off radially as 1/r². So the magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. I need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.

Wait, so the integral is ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV, over the volume of the sphere. The options are given, and I have to pick the right one.

Hmm. I remember from my vector calculus class that there's something called the divergence theorem. Oh right, the divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux through the surface. So ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV equals ∫∫ f · dA over the surface.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the divergence directly and then integrate. Let me think about both approaches.

First, let's try to compute the divergence of f. Since the field is radial and depends only on r (the radial distance), I can use the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates. Divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field that's purely radial (only r component) is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² A_r), where A_r is the radial component.

Wait, so in general, for a vector field F, if F = F_r ȓ + F_θ θ̂ + F_φ φ̂, then the divergence is
