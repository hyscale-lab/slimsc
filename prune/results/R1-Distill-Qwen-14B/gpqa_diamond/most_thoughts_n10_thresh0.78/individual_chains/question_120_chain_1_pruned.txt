Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about the distribution of stars in the sky and how their numbers change with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, right? Let me think.

So, parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth when we look at it from different points in our orbit. The formula I recall is that distance (d) in parsecs is the reciprocal of parallax, so d = 1/plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, it's like how many stars you can expect to find as you look at a certain range of parallax values. The options are all inversely proportional to some power of plx, ranging from 1 to 4.

Wait, I think this has to do with the volume of space where stars are located. Because as parallax decreases (meaning the stars are farther away), the volume of space increases. Remember, the number density of stars isn't uniform with distance because the volume element expands.

Let me try to model this. The number of stars per unit volume is probably constant if stars are uniformly distributed. So, the number in a shell between distance d and d+dd would be proportional to the volume of that shell. The volume of a spherical shell is 4π r² dr, where r is the radius (distance) and dr is the thickness of the shell.

But wait, parallax is 1/d. So, if I let plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. If I change variables from d to plx, I need to express everything in terms of plx.

Let's see: The volume element in terms of d would be 4π d² dd. But since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx, and dd would be -d² dplx? Let me check. Because if plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So, the volume element becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx. Wait, let me double-check that substitution.

Wait, the shell volume is 4π d² dd. So substituting d = 1/plx:

d² = (1/plx)^2 = 1/plx².

And dd is the change in d. Since d = 1/plx, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So when plx increases, d decreases, hence the negative sign. But when considering the volume element, we can take the absolute value, so the volume becomes 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx?

Wait, no, because I think I messed up the substitution. Let me write it step by step.

Volume element dV = 4π d² dd.

Express dd in terms of dplx:

dd = - (1 / (plx^2)) dplx. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx, so dd/dplx = - (1/plx²) = - d².

So, dV = 4π d² * ( - d² dplx ) * (-1) [taking absolute value], so 4π d^4 dplx.

Wait, substituting d = 1/plx, d^4 = (1/plx)^4. So dV = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

But wait, that seems off because the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the volume. So the number of stars per unit plx would be proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me think again. The number of stars in a shell between d and d+dd is proportional to the volume of that shell, which is 4π d² dd. So, the number of stars N is N = n * 4 π d² dd, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume).

But if I have to express this in terms of parallax plx, which is 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, substituting:

N = n * 4 π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx^2) dplx )

But since we're considering positive changes, perhaps we take the absolute value, so N = n * 4 π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx = n * 4 π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, but this would mean that the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. However
