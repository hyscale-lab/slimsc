Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. But wait, there's more to it than that.

The question says both planets have the same mass but different orbital periods. Planet_1 has a shorter period, three times less than Planet_2. Oh, right, the period tells us about the distance from the star. Because a shorter period means the planet is closer in. Also, Kepler's third law comes into play here. But wait, the host stars have different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius, which is interesting.

I'm trying to remember the formula for the transit probability. I think the probability P is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by something else. Oh wait, actually, the geometric probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 - eÂ²))^(1/2), but since both orbits are circular, the eccentricity
