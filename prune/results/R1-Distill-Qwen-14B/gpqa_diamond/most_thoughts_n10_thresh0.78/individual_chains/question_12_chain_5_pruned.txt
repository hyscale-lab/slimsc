Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles after a pion decays. Hmm, let me try to unpack this. 

The problem says that a Pi-plus is at rest and decays into a mu-plus and a neutrino. The equation given is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. The rest masses are given: Pi-plus is 139.6 MeV, and the mu-plus is 105.7 MeV. I think the neutrino's mass is negligible, like zero or something, which might simplify things.

Wait, so the pion is at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero. Since momentum is conserved, the products must have equal and opposite momenta. So the muon and neutrino's momenta should cancel each other out. But because the neutrino has (probably) negligible mass, its momentum would be much higher, but I'm not sure yet.

The question is about the kinetic energy of each product. So I need to find the kinetic energies of the mu-plus and the neutrino. 

I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the energy is shared between the products. Let me think about the energy and momentum conservation.

The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay must be zero. So, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let's denote the muon's momentum as p and the neutrino's as -p. 

The energy of each particle is given by the relativistic equation: E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. But I think in this problem, they might be ignoring the c's for simplicity since all masses and energies are given in MeV and MeV/c² units. So maybe we can work in units where c=1. 

So, the energy of the muon would be sqrt(p² + m_mu²), and the neutrino's energy would be sqrt(p² + 0) = p, since its mass is zero.

The total energy is the sum of these two energies: sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p = 139.6 MeV.

Let me write that equation down:

sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p = M_pi.

Where M_pi is 139.6 MeV, and m_mu is 105.7 MeV.

Hmm, let me square both sides to eliminate the square root. Wait, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, I can rearrange the equation.

Let me denote sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = E_mu. So, E_mu + p = M_pi.

I can rearrange to E_mu = M_pi - p.

But E_mu is also sqrt(p² + m_mu²).

So,

sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = M_pi - p.

Squaring both sides:

p² + m_mu² = (M_pi - p)^2.

Expanding the right side: M_pi^2 - 2 M_pi p + p².

Subtract p² from both sides:

m_mu² = M_pi^2 - 2 M_pi p.

Rearranging for p:

2 M_pi p = M_pi^2 - m_mu².

So,

p = (M_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (2 M_pi).

Plugging in the numbers:

M_pi = 139.6 MeV, m_mu = 105.7 MeV.

Calculating numerator: (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2.

Wait, let me compute that. Let's see, 139.6 squared is 139.6 * 139.6. Let me calculate that. 140^2 is 19600, so 139.6 is a bit less. 139.6 * 139.6 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16. 

Wait, but wait, 139.6 is 1396 * 0.1, so perhaps I should compute 139.6^2 as (139 + 0.6)^2. Wait, perhaps I should just compute it accurately:

139.6 * 139.6:

= (140 - 0.4) * (140 - 0.4)
= 140^2 - 2 *140 *0.4 + 0.4^2
= 19600 - 112 + 0.16
= 19600-112=19488, plus 0.16 is 19488.16 MeV².

Similarly, 105.7^2: Let's calculate:

105^2 is 11025. 0.7^2 is 0.49. The cross term is 2*105*0.7 = 147. So (105.7)^2 = (105 + 0.7)^2 = 105² + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7² = 11025 + 147 + 0.49= 11172.49 MeV².

So numerator is 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 MeV².

Denominator is 2 * 139.6 = 279.2 MeV.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute that.

Hmm, 279.2 * 29 is 8096.8 (because 279 *30 is 8370, minus 279 gives 8091, so 29*279.2 is approx 8096.8). 8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87. So 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ ~0.783.

So p is approximately 29.783 MeV/c? Wait wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, 8315.67 / 279.2 = ?

Let me do division step by step.

279.2 * 29 = 8096.8.

8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87.

Now, 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.783.

So total p ≈ 29 + 0.783 ≈ 29.783 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Well, approximately:

279.2 * 29 = 8096.8.
