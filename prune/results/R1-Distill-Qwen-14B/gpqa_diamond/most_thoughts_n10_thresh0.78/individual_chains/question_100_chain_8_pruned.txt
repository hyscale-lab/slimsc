Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is a reaction sequence starting with Compound A, which is C3H6. Then it goes through several reactions forming compounds B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. At the end, I have to find out which statement about the products is incorrect.

First, I'll break down each step to figure out what each compound might be.

Step 1: Compound A (C3H6) undergoes bromination in CCl4 to form B. Hmm, C3H6 is propene or cyclopropane? Wait, propene is C3H6 (double bond), and cyclopropane is also C3H6 but a ring structure. But bromination in CCl4 usually refers to addition reactions. For propene, adding bromine (Br2) would be an addition across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane. But wait, if it's in CCl4, which is a non-polar solvent, and if the reaction is under certain conditions, maybe it's a substitution? No, wait, propene is more likely to undergo addition with Br2. So perhaps Compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: if A is cyclopropane, bromination might lead to substitution, but cyclopropane is less common, and propene is more likely for such reactions. So I'll go with propene adding Br2 to form 1,2-dibromopropane (B).

Step 2: Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C. Alcoholic KOH usually leads to elimination reactions. So if B is 1,2-dibromopropane, treating with KOH (alcohol) would likely eliminate two equivalents of HBr
