Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about the elemental abundances in two stars. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar chemistry, but let me try to think it through.

So the question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But wait, does the mass actually matter for this problem? The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres, so maybe the mass isn't directly needed. The problem mentions LTE and the EW method, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium and Equivalent Width method. Those are techniques used in spectroscopy to determine elemental abundances.

Alright, the given data points are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

So I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres. Let's unpack what each of these abundance notations means.

The notation [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of X to Y, minus the same ratio in the Sun. If [X/Y] is positive, X is more abundant relative to Y than in the Sun.

First, let's write down the Sun's photospheric composition. The problem states:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) = 7 -12= -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5.

Wait, but sometimes in these problems, [Fe/H] is given, which is the logarithm of the ratio of Fe to H compared to the Sun. So [Fe/H]_1 is 0, meaning Star_1 has the same Fe abundance as the Sun.

Let me think for Star_1. [Fe/H]_1 =0, so the Fe abundance is solar. So nFe/nH in Star_1 is same as in Sun, which is 10^(-4.5).

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3. So [Si/Fe] = log10(nSi/nFe) - log10(nSi/nFe)_sun =0.3.

Wait, I think [X/Y] is defined as log10( (nX / nY) / (nX/nY)_sun ). So [X/Y] = log( (nX/nY) / (nX_sun / nY_sun) ). So if [X/Y] is positive, X is more abundant relative to Y than in the Sun.

So for [Si/Fe]_1=0.3, this means:

log( (nSi_1 / nFe_1) / (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) ) = 0.3.

We can rearrange this to find the ratio nSi_1/nFe_1.

Same goes for [Mg/Si]_2=0.3. Let me handle each star one by one.

Starting with Star_1:

We know [Fe/H]_1=0. So [Fe/H] is log( (nFe_1/nH_1) / (nFe_sun/nH_sun) ) )=0.

Which implies (nFe_1/nH_1) = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) → nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun).

But wait, in the Sun, nH is the number density of hydrogen. But what about in Star_1? Unless Star_1's H abundance is the same as the Sun's, but wait, [Fe/H] is 0, which is [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) =0. So nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun. So nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1.

But since Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0, the ratio of Fe to H is solar. So nFe_1 = 10^(-4.5) * nH_1.

Wait, in the Sun, nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5). So in Star_1, nFe_1/nH_1 is same, so nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun).

But I don't know nH_1. However, for the purpose of finding the ratio of silicon in the two stars, perhaps I can express everything in terms of H.

Let me consider nX as the number density of element X.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log( (nSi_1/nFe_1) / (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) ) =0.3.

We can write this as (nSi_1 /nFe_1 ) = (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^(0.3).

We know that (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) is given by the solar abundance. Wait, the problem gives the Sun's [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], but not [Si/H]. Hmm.

Wait, let me think. The Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 1e-4.5.

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But what about silicon? The Sun's nSi isn't given. Hmm. Maybe we can find it using the Mg/Si ratio in Star_2, but that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the Sun's [Mg/Si] is 0, but I'm not sure.

Wait, in the problem statement, the [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3. So Star_2 has [Mg/Si] of 0.3. But for the Sun, I don't know [Mg/Si]. So perhaps I'm supposed to assume that in the Sun, [Mg/Si] is 0, so that the solar ratio is 1? Or perhaps I need to compute it.

Alternatively, maybe the Sun's [Mg/Si] is given in Star_2's data. Wait, no. Star_2's [Mg/Si] is 0.3, but the Sun's would be something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the Sun's [Mg/Si] based on the given data. Since for the Sun, nMg/nH = 1e-5, and nFe/nH=1e-4.5.

But wait, I don't have the Sun's nSi. Hmm, maybe I need to make an assumption. Or perhaps the Sun's [Mg/Si] is zero, implying [Mg/Si]_sun =0, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to approach each star's [X/H] and [
