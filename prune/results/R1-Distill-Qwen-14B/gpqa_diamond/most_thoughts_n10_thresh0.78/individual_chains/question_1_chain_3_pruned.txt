Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me read the question again.

The question says that two quantum states have energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find out which energy difference would allow us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A) 10^-9 eV, B) 10^-11 eV, C) 10^-4 eV, D) 10^-8 eV.

Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

In this case, the lifetimes given are the uncertainty in time (Δt) for each state. Wait, but wait—each state has its own lifetime. Oh, but wait, when we're talking about the energy difference between the two states, perhaps we should consider the uncertainty in the energy of each state to determine if they can be distinguished.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference (E2 - E1) between the two states. To distinguish them, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state, I suppose. Because if the energy difference is too small, the uncertainty from the lifetimes might make it hard to tell them apart.

So, let me think. For each state, the uncertainty in energy would be ħ divided by the lifetime. So for E1 with τ1=1e-9 sec, ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1, and similarly for ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So the energy difference should be significantly larger than the uncertainties in each state so that they can be resolved.

Wait, but perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the uncertainty in energy for each state and then ensure that the energy difference is larger than the sum or something. Or maybe the maximum uncertainty in the energy measurement would be the sum of the individual uncertainties, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty in the energy of either state, because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainty of one, you can't tell them apart.

Wait, I think the key here is to ensure that the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty in energy of each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you might not be able to tell them apart due to the uncertainty.

So let's compute the uncertainty in energy for each state.

The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So for E1: τ1 = 1e-9 sec. ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 ≈ 1.05457e-34 / 1e-9 = approx 1.05e-25 J. But wait, the options are given in eV, so I need to convert that to eV.

1 eV is 1.60218e-19 J. So,

ΔE1 = 1.05e-25 J / 1.60218e-19 J/eV ≈ (1.05e-25) / (1.6e-19) ≈ 6.56e-7 eV
