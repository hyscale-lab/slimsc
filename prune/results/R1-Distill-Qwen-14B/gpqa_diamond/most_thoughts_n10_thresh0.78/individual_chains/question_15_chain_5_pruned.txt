Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Let's try to think through it step by step. 

The question is about two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Researchers want to choose which one to observe because they have limited time and want the one with the highest chance of transiting. 

So, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its host star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and their orbital configuration. Specifically, the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbit is more edge-on relative to our line of sight. But wait, there's also another factor: the size of the star and the distance of the planet's orbital plane from our line of sight.

I think the formula for the transit probability (p) is something like p = (R_p / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))) ), but wait, I might be mixing up the terms. Oh right, for circular orbits, the eccentricity e is zero, so the denominator becomes 1. So the transit probability simplifies. 

Wait, also, the transit probability is the area of the star's disk that the planet can block when passing in front. The probability is given by (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by some factor that depends on the orbital parameters. Or maybe it's (R_planet + R_star) / a? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, I remember that the transit probability for a planet is roughly (R_p / a) * (R_star / a) )? No, perhaps not. Alternatively, the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_*)² multiplied by (a / (some other terms)).

Alternatively, I think the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_*)² multiplied by ( (a / (something)) ) ... Or maybe it's the other way around. I'm a bit shaky on the exact formula.

Wait, another approach. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. The probability depends on the ratio
