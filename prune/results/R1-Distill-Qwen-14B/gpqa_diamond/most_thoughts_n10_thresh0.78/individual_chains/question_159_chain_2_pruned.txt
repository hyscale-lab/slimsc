Okay, so I have this question about a quasar and its spectrum. Hmm, let me think. The question says that observations in the near infrared and optical spectrum show a peak at about 790 nm, and the flux drops at shorter wavelengths. Wait, what does that mean? Oh, right, when you observe an object, if the peak is redshifted, it tells us something about how far away the object is because of the expansion of the universe.

Wait, the peak at 790 nm—so what is the rest wavelength? Oh wait, I think quasars emit light at certain rest wavelengths, and if we see it at longer wavelengths, that's redshift. For example, if the emitted light is in the optical range but observed in the near-infrared, that's a redshift. Let me recall— visible light is around 400-700 nm. Near infrared starts around 700 nm. So a peak at 790 nm is in the infrared. So maybe the rest frame is around 500 nm? So the observed wavelength is longer, which implies redshift.

Wait, let me think. Let's say the rest wavelength is λ0, and observed is λ. So z = (λ/λ0) - 1. Oh wait, the question says that at shorter wavelengths <790 nm, the flux drops. So maybe the emitted wavelength is around 500 nm (like in the optical), but because of redshift, it's observed at 790 nm. So z = (790/500) - 1 = (1.58) -1 = 0.58.

Or wait, perhaps the rest wavelength is in the optical, say around 500 nm. So observed at 790 nm, which is longer. So the redshift z is (790/500) -1. Let me calculate that: 790 /500 is 1.58, so z is 0.58. So z is about 0.58.

Now, the question is about the comoving distance at scale factor a=1. Which is our current universe. So the comoving distance is the distance now, which depends on the redshift.

Wait, but how do I compute the comoving distance for a given redshift in the Lambda-CDM model? I remember that the comoving distance is given by the integral of c/(H0 * E(z)) dz, from 0 to z. Where E(z) is sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z)^3 + Ω_lambda*(1+z)^3w, but wait, what's the equation for E(z) in the standard model? Oh right, E(z) = [Ω_m (1+z)^3 + Ω_lambda (1+z)^{3(1+w)}]^{1/2}. But for dark energy modeled as a cosmological constant, w=-1, so the term becomes (1+z)^0=1. So E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m (1+z)^3 + Ω_lambda).

Wait, but in the given parameters, the matter density is 0.3, dark energy is 0.7, and the universe is flat (so Ω_m + Ω_lambda = 1, which they are 0.3+0.7=1, so that's correct). And the current Hubble constant H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc.

So the formula for comoving distance is D_c = (c/H0) * ∫ from 0 to z [1/sqrt(Ω_m(1+z')^3 + Ω_lambda)] dz'.

Hmm, but integrating this analytically is tricky. I think that for low redshifts (z <<1), E(z) ≈ sqrt(Ω_m (1 + 3z) + Ω_lambda). Because (1+z)^3 is approximately 1 + 3z when z is small. So for z=0.58, which is about 0.6, maybe it's not that small. Alternatively, maybe
