Okay, let's try to work through this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, so the question is about measuring observables P and Q in sequence and finding the probability of getting specific outcomes. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1), but wait, that doesn't look like a unit vector. Oh wait, I remember that quantum states are usually represented by column vectors that are normalized, meaning their length (the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components) should be 1. Let me check: (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, 1^2 is 1. So 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Oh, so the vector has a squared norm of 6. That means it's not normalized. So I think the actual state vector is this vector divided by the square root of 6. Because the norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized state is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T. Or maybe it's (-1, 2, 1) divided by sqrt(6) to make it a unit vector.

Next, the operators P and Q are given. Let's look at P first. The matrix for P has rows:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2).

Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Wait, so that's a symmetric matrix. Because the element (1,2) is 1/sqrt(2) and (2,1) is the same. Similarly, (2,3) is 1/sqrt(2), so (3,2) is also that. So it's symmetric, which means it's diagonalizable, and its eigenvectors are orthogonal. But I'm not sure if that's immediately helpful.

The operator Q is given by a diagonal matrix:

First row: 1, 0, 0.

Second row: 0, 0, 0.

Third row: 0, 0, -1.

So Q is a diagonal matrix, which makes things a bit easier. The eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, -1. The corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. So, for example, the eigenvector for eigenvalue 1 is (1,0,0), for 0 it's (0,1,0), and for -1 it's (0,0,1).

The question asks for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring Q just after P. Wait no, actually, the measurements are done in sequence: first P, then Q. But the wording says, "the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements." So first P is measured and gets 0, then Q is measured and gets -1.

Wait, no. Or is it that the measurements
