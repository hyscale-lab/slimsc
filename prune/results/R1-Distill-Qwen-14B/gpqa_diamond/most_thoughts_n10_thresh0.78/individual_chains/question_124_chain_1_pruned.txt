Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles moving through a detector. Hmm, alright, let's see. I need to find the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls, given that with a Lorentz factor of ~20, only one-third reach it.

Wait, wait. So the particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. These particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, so their Lorentz factor is around 20. But only about one third of them make it to the inner walls. Now, the question is, what Lorentz factor would we need so that two-thirds reach the walls instead.

Hmm. So the problem is about the particles' decay and their ability to reach the detector walls. I think it's related to the concept of time dilation and how much time they have before decaying.

So, particles are created at the center. To reach the inner walls, they need to travel 30 meters. But if they decay before that, they won't make it. So the key is the particle's proper lifetime (tau) and how it's dilated due to their velocity.

Wait, Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since they're ultra-relativistic, v is very close to c, so gamma is large.

The average lifetime of the particle as measured in the lab frame (gamma multiplied by tau) determines how far they can travel before decaying. So the maximum distance a particle can travel is c multiplied by gamma tau.

But wait, in this problem, the decay is fast, so particles are likely to decay before reaching the walls unless gamma is high enough. So let's model this.

The probability that a particle reaches the detector walls is the probability that it doesn't decay before traveling 30 meters. The decay follows an exponential probability distribution. The survival probability P is exp(-t/(gamma tau)), where t is the time it takes to reach the wall.

Wait, t is the time taken to reach the wall. Since the particle is moving at velocity v, t = R / v, where R is the radius, 30 meters. But since v is very close to c, we can approximate v as c for simplicity, especially since the problem says ultra-relativistic.
