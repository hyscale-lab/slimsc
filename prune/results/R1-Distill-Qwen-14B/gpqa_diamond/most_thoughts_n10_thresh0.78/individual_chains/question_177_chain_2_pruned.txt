Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully again.

The question says we have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Similarly, the mass is also 1.5 times larger. But when they looked at the wavelengths where the stars appeared brightest, they found the same. So the peak wavelengths are the same for both stars. 

They also measured the radial velocities as 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Hmm, wait, radial velocity... I think that's the speed at which the star is moving towards or away from us. But how does that affect the wavelength? Oh, right, that's the Doppler effect. If a star is moving towards us, the light it emits gets blueshifted, and if moving away, it's redshifted. But in this case, Star_1 has 0 velocity, so no Doppler shift. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. So the observed wavelengths would be shifted for Star_2.

But the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So the observed peak wavelengths are the same. But their actual temperatures (before any Doppler shift) might be different because of the velocity.

Wait, since they are black bodies, the peak wavelength is determined by their temperature. The peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature. λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if Star_2 is moving, its observed λ_max could be different.

Wait, but the question says that the observed wavelengths are the same. So Star_2's light is shifted, but somehow the observed λ_max is same as Star_1. So the actual temperature of the two stars must be same? Or is it different?

Wait, let me think. Star_1's λ_max is λ1, and Star_2's λ_max is λ2. But because Star_2 is moving, due to Doppler effect, the observed λ2_observed is different from the actual λ2. But the problem states that λ1 and λ2_observed are the same. So, the actual λ2 (the rest frame) must be different.

So, the observed λ_max for both stars is the same.

So, the actual λ_max for Star_2 is λ2 =
