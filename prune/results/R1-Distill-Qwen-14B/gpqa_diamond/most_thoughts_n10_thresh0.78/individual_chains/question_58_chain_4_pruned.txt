Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let me read the question again. It says, "Which of the following physical theories never requires regularization at high energies?" The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like when calculations result in infinite values which aren't physically meaningful. Regularization helps make these infinities manageable so that the results can be finite after renormalization.

So the question is asking which theory doesn't need this regularization when the energy scales are high. Let me think about each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a quantum theory that deals with particles as strings. Since it's a theory that's supposed to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity, it's supposed to be a theory of everything. But wait, do string theories require regularization? I recall that one of the advantages of string theory is that it doesn't have the same kinds of divergences as point particle theories. Because strings are extended objects, maybe the divergences that occur in other quantum field theories are tamed. So perhaps superstring theory doesn't need regularization when energies are high.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD becomes asymptotically free, meaning that at high energies (or equivalently, short distances), the coupling constant becomes small, making perturbative methods valid. But wait, does QCD require regularization? I think yes. Because even though it's asymptotically free, it still has to deal with renormalization. I remember that in QCD, things like the beta function are calculated, which involves renormalization group equations. So regularization is used there to handle loop divergences.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-established quantum field theory. I know that QED does require regularization because it has divergent loop diagrams. For example, the electron self-energy has divergent integrals, which are handled by regularization methods like cutoff regularization, dimensional regularization, etc. So QED definitely needs regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. This is the non-quantum version, so it's not a quantum field theory. Classical theories don't usually have the same issues with divergences because they don't involve the same mathematical structures as quantum theories. Wait, but can there be divergences in classical theories? Hmm, like in the case of point charges, you get issues with self-energy and such, but I think in classical electromagnetism, these are handled differently. But wait, classical E&M is a deterministic theory; it doesn't use the same renormalization techniques as quantum theories. So does it require regularization? Probably not, because regularization is a quantum field theory concept. So classical E&M doesn't need regularization.

Wait, the question is which theory "never requires regularization at high energies." So, which options are quantum theories and which are classical?
