Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through step by step. 

The question says we have a bunch of identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. The important part is that when they measure the position of the particles, none are found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So all the particles are confined between x=1 and x=3.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function describes the probability amplitude of a particle's position. The probability of finding the particle in a region is given by the integral of the square of the absolute value of the wave function, |ψ(x)|², over that region. Since no particles are found outside x=1 and x=3, the probability of finding the particle there must be zero. That means the wave function must be zero outside this interval.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Let me think about this. For the wave function to be zero outside x=1 to x=3, the expression must be zero in the regions x < 1 and x > 3.

So, let's consider x < 1. The wave function would be (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. For this to be zero, both the real and imaginary parts must be zero. The real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is (-0.5i). The imaginary part can't be zero unless the coefficient is zero. So 0.5i would have to be zero, which isn't possible unless a is... Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the wave function is being considered only in the region where it's non-zero. So the wave function is defined as (a/sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i for x between 1 and 3, and zero otherwise. But that doesn't make much sense because the wave function in between would have to satisfy certain conditions, like being continuous, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: normalization. The total probability must equal 1. So the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 should be 1. Because the wave function is zero outside, the integral over all space is just the integral from 1 to 3.

So |ψ(x)|² would be [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i ] multiplied by its complex conjugate. The complex conjugate is (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. So when we multiply them, the real part is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5i)(a/sqrt(1+x)) * (0.5i)(a/sqrt(1+x))... Wait, no, actually, when you multiply a complex number by its conjugate, you get the square of the real part plus the square of the imaginary part. Let me compute that.

ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5)i. So ψ*(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. Then ψψ* = (a / sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2. Because when you multiply (A - Bi)(A + Bi) you get A² + B².

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.25).

Then the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx should equal 1 (normalization condition).

So the integral is ∫ [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx from 1 to 3.

Let's compute that integral.

First, break it into two parts:

Integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3: a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3.

Integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3: 0.25*(3 -1) = 0.25*2=0.5.

So the first part: a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Wait, ln(4) is ln(2^2) = 2 ln2. So ln(4) - ln(2) = 2 ln2 - ln2 = ln2.

So the first integral is a² * ln2.

So putting it all together, the total integral is a² ln2 + 0.5 = 1.

So the equation is: a² ln2 + 0.5 = 1.

Solving for a²: a² = (1 - 0.5)/ln2 = 0.5 / ln2.

Compute that: ln2 is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 is about 0.721. So a² ≈ 0.721 → a ≈ sqrt(0.721) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that should be the answer.

But wait, did I make a mistake in calculating the integral? Let me double-check.

Wait, the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So when I compute |ψ|^2, I have (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 = a^2/(1+x) + 0.25. That's correct.

So the integral is a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3, plus 0.25 ∫1 dx from 1 to 3.

The ∫1/(1+x)dx is ln(1+x). Evaluated from 1 to 3: ln4 - ln2 = ln(4/2) = ln2. So that gives a² ln2.

The other integral is 0.25*(2) = 0.5. So a² ln2 + 0.5 =1 → a² = 0.5/(ln2).

Yes, that part seems correct.

And 0.5 divided by ln2 is approximately 0.5 /0.6931 ≈ 0.721. Square root of that is approximately 0.849, which rounds to 0.85. So option B is correct.


To solve the problem, we analyze the given wave function and apply the normalization condition for quantum mechanical wave functions. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is proportional to \(|\psi(x)|^2\), which is calculated as:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since no particles are found outside \(x = 1\) to \(x = 3\), the wave function is zero outside this interval. The normalization condition requires that the total probability over all space equals 1. Therefore, we integrate \(|\psi(x)|^2\) over \(x = 1\) to \(x = 3\):

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = \int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

Breaking this into two parts:

1. **First term**: \(\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx\)
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = a^2 [\ln(4) - \ln(2)] = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second term**: \(\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx\)
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
   \]

Combining these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 = \frac{1 - 0.5}{\ln(2)} = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.721
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.721} \approx 0.849
\]

This value rounds to \(a \approx 0.85\), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
