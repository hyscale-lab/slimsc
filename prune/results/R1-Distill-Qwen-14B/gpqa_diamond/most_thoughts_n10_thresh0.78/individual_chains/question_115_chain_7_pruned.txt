Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electrons and positrons annihilating and producing photons. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when particles and their antiparticles meet, they annihilate and produce photons. Since an electron and a positron are involved here, they should annihilate into gamma rays or something, but the problem says two photons.

The setup: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate into two photons. The energies of both photons are the same, and their directions are such that one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Wait, okay, Lorentz factor is gamma, so gamma for electron is 4, and for positron it's 2. But wait, positron is the antiparticle of electron, so same mass but opposite charge. But in terms of momentum, the positron moving right, electron moving left, but in the opposite directions.

First, maybe I should calculate the total momentum and energy before annihilation because conservation laws must apply. Since in the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum is zero, but wait, in this case, the electron and positron are moving towards each other but with different speeds and Lorentz factors.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the electron is moving left (from the left) along the horizontal axis, and the positron is moving right (from the right). So their directions are opposite. Or wait, no. Wait, the question says the electron is moving from the left along the horizontal axis, so to the right. And the positron is moving from the right along the same axis, so to the left. Because if you're moving from the right along the horizontal, you'd be going left. Or wait, maybe I should clarify: the directions. Hmm.

Wait, the question says the electron is moving from the left, so direction is to
