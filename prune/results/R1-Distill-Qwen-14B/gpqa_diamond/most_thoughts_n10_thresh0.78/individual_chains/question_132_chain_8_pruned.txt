Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that there's a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum has two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. I need to figure out which two compounds are present from the given options.

First, I should remember that the molecular formula C10H14 is for an aromatic compound. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get a sense of the structure. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2 = 8/2 =4. So four degrees of unsaturation. That means one benzene ring (which accounts for 3 degrees) and one double bond or ring, or maybe two rings... Wait, no, benzene is six-membered with three double bonds, so that’s three degrees. The remaining one would be another double bond or a ring. But for aromatic compounds, it's likely another benzene ring? No, wait, no—because the molecular formula is C10H14. Wait, benzene is C6H6. So each substitution adds a methyl group or something. But wait, the molecular formula is C10H14. Let me think: Benzene has 6 C and 6 H. So if I have two benzene rings, that would be 12 C, but the formula is 10. So that can't be. So another thought: Maybe it's a benzene ring with substituents that add up to four H's? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, no, maybe I should think about the possible structures. The options given are all tetramethylbenzenes and one diethyl benzene.

Looking at the options:

Option 1: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. So that's a benzene ring with four methyl groups attached at positions 1,2,4,5. So that would have the formula C10H14? Let me check. Benzene is C6H6. Each methyl is CH3. Four methyl groups would add 4*(CH3) = 4*C and 4*3 H =12 H. So the total would be 6+4=10 C, and 6 H (from benzene) + 12=18 H. Wait, that's C10H18. But our molecular formula is C10H14. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Did I make a mistake? Oh wait, maybe benzene with four methyl groups would have a formula of C6H6 + 4(CH3) = C10H14. Because benzene is C6H6, each methyl adds one C and three H. So four methyl groups: 4*(C and 3H) → 4C and 12 H. So total C:6+4=10, H:6+12=18. But wait, the formula is C10H14. So that's a problem. So how do we get C10H14?

Wait, perhaps some of the substituents are not methyl. Looking at the options, one is 1,4-diethylbenzene. Diethyl would be two ethyl groups. Each ethyl is two carbons, so two ethyl groups would add 4 C and 4*2 H? Wait, no, each ethyl is -CH2CH3. So each ethyl adds two carbons and 5 H (because each CH2CH3 has 5 H: CH2 has two, CH3 has three. Wait, no, wait: the ethyl group is -CH2CH3. The benzene is C6H5, so attaching an ethyl group would make C6H5CH2CH3. The formula for that would be C8H10. 8 C and 10 H. But our compound is C10H14. So if it's 1,4-diethylbenzene, that would be two ethyl groups on benzene. So two ethyl groups: adding 4 C and 10 H. So C6H6
