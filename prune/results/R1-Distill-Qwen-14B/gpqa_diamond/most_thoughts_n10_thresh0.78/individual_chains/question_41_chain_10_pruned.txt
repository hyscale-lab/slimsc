Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in moving glass. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam. And it's moving toward the observer. We need to find the speed of the light relative to the lab frame.

Wait, right. When dealing with light in different media, I remember that the speed of light depends on the medium. Oh right, the formula is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in vacuum (which is 1 here). But that's the speed in the medium when the medium is at rest relative to the observer.

But the glass is moving. So I think we need to consider how the motion of the medium affects the observed speed. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Does the speed of the medium add vectorially to the speed of light in it? Or is there a different approach?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the Doppler effect. Because if the source is moving towards the observer, the observed frequency changes. But wait, this isn't about frequency; it's about the speed of the light itself. Or is it related?

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the velocity addition in special relativity. Oh wait, no, because in this problem, the speeds are probably non-relativistic, given that the options involve linear terms in v. So maybe we can use a classical approach.

Wait, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. So from the lab frame, the light is moving through the glass which itself is moving. So maybe the speed of light in the glass as observed in the lab is the sum of the speed of light in the glass (v = c/n) and the speed of the glass (v).

Wait, but wait. If the glass is moving towards the observer, the light is moving towards the observer as well. So the observer sees the light moving at (v_light_in_glass + v_glass) ?

But wait, the direction matters. If the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, that's the same as the light beam moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. Wait, no, wait. The light is propagating through the glass, which is moving in the same direction as the beam.

Wait, the light is going in the same direction as the glass's movement. So from the
