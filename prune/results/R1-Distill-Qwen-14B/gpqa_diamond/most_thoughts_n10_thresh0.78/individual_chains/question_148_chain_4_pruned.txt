Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because these can be tricky. But let's take it step by step. I'll try to figure it out by breaking down the information given.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five of them, and each compound probably has a different structure or formula. Let me go through each part.

First, substance A1 is bright-red and decomposes at 293 K (which is about room temperature, 25Â°C) into A2 and fluorine gas. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Hmm, oxidizing xenon suggests that A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Xenon is a noble gas, and it can form compounds under certain conditions, like XeO3 or XeF4. But what about A1?

Wait, fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent. So maybe A1 is a compound that's oxidizing, like perhaps a fluoride with a high oxidation state. But wait, the decomposition produces fluorine. So maybe A1 is a compound that when decomposed, releases F2. So, for example, if A1 is a diatomic fluoride, but that wouldn't make sense. Wait, maybe A1 is a polyatomic fluoride that breaks down into F2 and another compound.

Wait, another point: A1 oxidizes xenon. Fluorine itself is a strong oxidizer, so maybe A1 is F2 in some form, but that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps A1 is a compound that releases F2 when it decomposes. Oh, wait! I'm thinking about the decomposition of a peroxide. For example, KClO3 decomposes into KCl and O2. So maybe A1 is a perfluoride, but wait, perfluorides are rare.

Alternatively, maybe A1 is a high-valent fluoride. Wait, when F2 is present as a product, perhaps A1 is a compound where fluorine is in a higher oxidation state, and upon decomposition, it breaks into F2. Wait, but F2 is already in
