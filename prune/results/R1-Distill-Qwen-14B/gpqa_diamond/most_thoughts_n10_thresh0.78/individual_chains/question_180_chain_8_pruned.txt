Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric potential energy in a system of charges. Hmm, I need to find the minimum energy of the system. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Wait, 2e is twice the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times 1.6 x 10^-19 coulombs. That's 3.2e-19 C each. But wait, 12 of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So point P is where one charge is fixed, and the others are 2 meters away.

I remember that the electric potential energy of a system of point charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. But wait, in an isolated system, I think the potential energy is calculated considering all pairs. The formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 q2) / r. Since all the charges are the same, I can calculate the total potential energy by considering each pair once.

Wait, but since all the 12 charges are at 2m from P, which is where the 13th charge is, each of those 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from the fixed charge at P. So there are 12 interactions where a charge at P (fixed) interacts with each of the 12 charges at 2m. But also, the 12 charges themselves are each 2m apart from each other? Or wait, no, because they are all at 2m from P, but their positions relative to each other might depend on how they are arranged. Hmm, assuming they are all at the same distance from P, perhaps they form a regular structure, maybe a sphere? But the exact arrangement might not matter because when calculating the total potential energy, we consider all pairs, including those between the 12 charges.

Wait, no, the problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So each of the 12 is 2m away from P. But their distances from each other
