Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

So, there's an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They made a super fast spacecraft that can go at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The aliens live about 150 years on average. They want to come to Earth. The question is, how long will it take for their 22-year-old astronaut to reach Earth from their point of view. The options are whether he'll die before getting here, or maybe about 72, 77, or 81 years.

Hmm. I think this has to do with special relativity, specifically time dilation. Because when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time moves slower for the traveler compared to someone stationary. So from Earth's perspective, the trip would take a certain amount of time, but from the astronaut's perspective, it's less.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the problem says to calculate from the astronaut's perspective. So I need to find the proper time, which is the time experienced by the astronaut.

Wait, but the astronaut is in the spacecraft. So the distance to Earth is the distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth, right? But wait, the problem doesn't give the distance. Hmm. Oh wait, maybe it's not necessary because perhaps they're using the speed to compute the time, but considering the relativistic effects.

Wait, no, without the distance, how can we compute the time? Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the distance is such that, without considering relativity, the trip would take a certain time, but with relativity, the astronaut's own clock measures less.

But wait, the problem doesn't provide the distance, so maybe I'm missing something. Oh, maybe the problem is considering the time from Earth's perspective and then using time dilation to find the astronaut's experienced time.

Wait, but the problem asks for the time from the astronaut's perspective. So maybe I need to find the proper time.

Wait, but I'm confused because the problem says the spacecraft is going at a constant speed of 0.99999987c. So the speed is extremely close to the speed of light.

Wait, but regardless, let's think about the distance. The Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth, if I remember correctly. So the distance is about 163,000 light-years.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give any specific distance, so maybe I'm supposed to calculate based on the speed given, not the actual distance. Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait
