Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit involved, but I think I can figure it out by breaking it down. Let me try to walk through my thoughts step by step.

Okay, the problem involves heating an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. The total weight is 7.20 grams. When heated without air, they form a mixture of gases. These gases are then passed through three different tubes. 

The first tube contains anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent, so it probably absorbs water. The weight of this tube increased by 3.60 grams. So that suggests that the gases passed through it had some water vapor. But wait, Mg(ClO4)2 is used for dehydration, so maybe the gas absorbed here is water. So the 3.60 grams might be the mass of water absorbed.

Next, the gas goes through a Ca(OH)2 solution. The weight of this tube didn't change. Hmm, Ca(OH)2 is used to absorb CO2, I think. If the weight didn't change, that might mean no CO2 was present. Or perhaps it was already removed before. Alternatively, maybe the CO2 was absorbed in a previous step.

Then, the gas passes through red-hot copper in tube №3. The tube's weight increased by 0.80 grams, and it formed CuO. Since copper reacts with certain gases, like CO or H2, when heated. Reaction possibilities: for example, CO would react with Cu to form CuO and CO2. Similarly, H2 would react to form H2O and Cu. Wait, but the product is CuO, so maybe it was CO. Because H2 would form H2O, but the gas after that would be H2O vapor, which would have been absorbed by Mg(ClO4)2, right? But in this case, the Mg(ClO4)2 already absorbed 3.60 grams. So maybe the CO is what reacted here.

Wait, let's think. The gas passed through tube 3, which is red-hot copper. So if the gas had CO, it would react: CO + 2Cu → 2CuO + C (but wait, is that correct? Wait, I think the reaction is CO + Cu → CuO + C, but maybe under certain conditions it's CO + Cu → CuO + C, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's 2CO + 2Cu → 2CuO + CO2. Or perhaps it's the oxidation state change. Let me think again. Copper is in the +2 oxidation state in CuO. CO is a reducing agent, so it would donate electrons. So Cu (metal, 0) oxidizes to Cu²+, so each Cu atom gains 2e-. CO (with C in +2) would be reduced to C (0), so each CO molecule gives up 2e- per molecule. So per Cu atom, you need one CO molecule. So the reaction is 2CO + 2
