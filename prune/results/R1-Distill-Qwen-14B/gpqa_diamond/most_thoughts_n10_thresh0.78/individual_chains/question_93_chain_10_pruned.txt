Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR and calibration curves. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He diluted it in a series and ran three technical replicates for each dilution. The efficiency is 100%, which I remember means the reaction is perfect—doubling every cycle. The R² is 1, so the data fits perfectly on the curve. The slope is -3.3; I think the slope in qPCR is related to the efficiency. The formula I recall is slope = ln(10)/E, where E is efficiency. Wait, since E is 100% (which is 1 in decimal), the slope should be ln(10) which is about 2.3. But here it's -3.3. Hmm, maybe I got the formula wrong. Alternatively, maybe the calculation is based on log base 10. Oh wait, the slope in the linear regression of Ct vs log concentration should be negative. With a slope of -3.3, that might indicate something about the efficiency. But wait, the efficiency is 100%, so maybe the slope should be -1 / efficiency? No, I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should come back to that.

Looking at the data: he has different concentrations, from 100000 copies down to 10. Each has three technical replicates. The Ct values are increasing as the concentration decreases, which makes sense because higher target amounts reach the threshold faster (lower Ct). So higher concentrations (100000) have higher Ct because it's diluted more? Wait no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, higher concentration means more copies, so it should amplify faster, leading to a lower Ct. Oh wait, no, wait: if the sample is more concentrated (like 100000 copies/μl), then you have more starting material. So the Ct would be lower because it reaches the threshold sooner. For example, in the data, 100000 copies have Ct around 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. Wait, but 10000 copies have Ct around 30.6, which is lower. So that makes sense—higher concentration (more copies) leads to lower Ct. Wait, but in the data, as the concentration goes down, the Ct goes up. So the data seems correct in that sense.

But the question is about the discrepancies in his results. So looking at the options, the answers talk about possible explanations for the results' discrepancies.

Option A: qPCR cannot be used for quantification. Well, that doesn't make sense because the question says the efficiency is 100% and R² is 1, so it's working perfectly. So A is probably not correct.

Option B: Ct values not in agreement with the target. Wait, if R
