Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about paramagnetic coupling and the energy levels of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I remember from my notes that paramagnetism involves the interaction of an atom's magnetic moment with an external magnetic field. The question is comparing the magnitude of this coupling term to the transition energy delta E of the hydrogen atom.

The problem states that the magnetic field B is parallel to Oz and is 1 Tesla, which is a pretty strong field, but I'm not sure if that's relevant yet. The orbital magnetic quantum number m has small values. Wait, m is the magnetic quantum number for orbital angular momentum, right? So m can be -1, 0, +1 maybe. Oh, but wait, for an electron in hydrogen, the orbital angular momentum quantum number l determines the possible m values. So m can range from -l to +l in integer steps. But the problem says m is small, so maybe m=0 or m=±1. But I'm not sure how that plays into the calculation.

The main thing is to compare the expectation value of the Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field (which is the paramagnetic term) with the transition energy delta E. The transition energy is associated with the wavelength given, which is 0.4861 micrometers. That's the wavelength of the Balmer series in hydrogen, specifically the H-alpha line. So delta E would be the energy difference between two energy levels in hydrogen, like n=2 to n=3 or something? Wait, no, H-alpha is  n=3 to n=2 emission, so the energy difference is E_3 - E_2, but since it's emission, the energy is positive when higher to lower. Wait, energy levels are negative, so E_3 is higher (less negative) than E_2. So delta E would be E_2 - E_3, but in magnitude, it's the absolute value.

So first, I need to find delta E. The energy levels of hydrogen are given by E_n = - (13.6 eV) * (1/n²). So let's compute that for n=2 and n=3. E_2 is -13.6/4 = -3.4 eV, and E_3 is -13.6/9 ≈ -1.511 eV. The transition energy delta E is E_2 - E_3 = (-3.4) - (-1.511) = -1.889 eV. But since we're taking magnitude, it's about 1.889 eV.

Wait, but I'm actually not certain about the exact transition. The problem says the wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nm. Let me check the known wavelengths. H-alpha is 656 nm, H-beta is 486 nm. Oh, so H-beta corresponds to the transition from n=4 to n=2. So for H-beta, n=4 to n=2. Let me calculate that.

E_4 = -13.6 / 16 = -0.85 eV. E_2 is -3.4 eV. So delta E is E_2 - E_4 = (-3.4) - (-0.85) = -2.55 eV. The magnitude is 2.55 eV.

Wait wait, no. The energy difference for the photon emitted is E_initial - E_final. But since the atom goes from a higher energy state to a lower one, E_initial is more negative. So delta E would be E_final - E_initial, but energy emitted is positive. Maybe I should compute it as delta E = (E_i - E_f). So E_i is higher (less negative) than E_f. So for n=4 to n=2, E_4 = -0.85 eV, E_2 = -3.4 eV. So delta E = E_2 - E_4 = (-3.4) - (-0.85) = -2.55 eV, but since energy is positive when emitted, delta E is +2.55 eV. So the magnitude is 2.55 eV. Alternatively, sometimes delta E is written as the absolute value, so 2.55 eV.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term. The Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field is the Zeeman term. The Zeeman effect is given by H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For orbital magnetic moment, μ = (e/(2m)) * L, so the expectation value is something like (e/(2m)) * <L_z> * B.

Wait
