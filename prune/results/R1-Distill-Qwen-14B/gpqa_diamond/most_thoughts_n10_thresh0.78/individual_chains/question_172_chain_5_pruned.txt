Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that this has something to do with the Boltzmann distribution and maybe the Saha equation. Let me try to break it down.

The problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which I think means we can use the Boltzmann equation for this scenario.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels in a gas to temperature. The formula is something like the ratio of populations n_i/n_j equals (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), right? Oh wait, but I think in this case, since we're looking at the same transition in two different stars, the ground state and excited state would be the same for both. So the g factors (statistical weights) might be the same, so they might cancel out.

So the ratio of the populations for star_1 and star_2 would be (n1/n2)_star1 = (n1/n2)_star2 multiplied by some function of their temperatures.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that in star_1, the excited level is twice as excited as in star_2. So let me clarify: if the number of atoms in the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2, then (n_excited)_1 = 2*(n_excited)_2. But the ratio (n1/n2) for each star would depend on their temperatures.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the populations in each star can be expressed using their respective temperatures. So for each star, the ratio between the excited level and the ground level is given by the Boltzmann factor.

Let me think. Let's denote the excited state as level i and the ground state as level j. Then the ratio of populations for star 1 is (n_i1 / n_j1) = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T1) ) * (g_i/g_j). Similarly for star 2, it's (n_i2 / n_j2)
