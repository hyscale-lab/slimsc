Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again and try to figure out what's going on.

The problem says that we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without air. When heated, only a mixture of gases is formed. These gases are passed through three tubes. The first tube is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. The second is Ca(OH)2 solution, and the third has red-hot copper.

The results are that tube 1's weight increased by 3.60 grams. Tube 3 gained 0.80 grams. The second tube's weight didn't change. After all that, only 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure.

The question is asking for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are numbers, so I suppose I need to figure out the formula of the salts or something about their composition.

First, I need to think about what's happening in each of these tubes. Let me go through each step.

Tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous. When gases pass through it, the Mg(ClO4)2 would absorb water if any moisture is present. Since the weight increased by 3.60g, that suggests that the gas(es) passed through had some water vapor. So maybe the gases produced include water?

Wait, but the mixture of gases formed when heating the salts—so what's happening? Heating salts often leads to decomposition, maybe producing gases like CO2, H2O, NH3, H2, etc., depending on the salts.

But wait, the initial salts are A and B. So perhaps when heated, they produce some gaseous products. Let's think about the tubes.

Tube 1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. It's a drying agent, so when it absorbs water, it gains mass. So if the first gas that passed through had water vapor, the Mg(ClO4)2 would react with it. The reaction would be: Mg(ClO4)2 + H2O → Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O, which increases the mass of the tube by the mass of the H2O absorbed.

So the weight gain in tube 1 is 3.60g, which equals the mass of H2O absorbed.

Wait, but if the gas is a mixture, perhaps the H2O is just one component of the gas. So maybe the initial gases include H2O vapor, which is captured by Mg(ClO4)2. So the 3.60g is the mass of H2O.

Next, tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. If any CO2 is present, it would react: CO2 + Ca(OH)2 → CaCO3 + H2O. But the problem says the weight of tube 2 didn't change. So that suggests that no CO2 was present in the gas
