Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the compound is based on the spectral data provided. Let me think through this step by step.

First, let me look at the information given. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is 100%. There's also a peak at m/z 158 with 32%. Hmm, the molecular ion is at 156, and another peak at 158, which is 2 units higher. That makes me think about possible fragments or maybe some kind of adduct. Since 158 is 156 plus 2, maybe it's a molecular ion with an addition of something, like a chlorine molecule? Or perhaps it's a doublet due to isotopes. Wait, chlorine has an atomic weight of about 35.5, so maybe the molecule has a chlorine atom. The molecular weight is 156, so let me calculate the possible formula.

Wait, another thought: the molecular ion could be losing something, like a fragment. So the molecular ion is m/z 156, and the peak at 158 is maybe the molecular ion plus something else, but that's not common. Alternatively, maybe the base peak is at 156, and 158 is an M+2 peak due to chlorine isotopes. Chlorine has a high abundance of isotopes, so maybe the molecular formula includes Cl. Let me check: if the molecular weight is 156, and it includes a Cl, what would the formula be?

Wait, let me think about the other data. The IR shows a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, another possibility is an amide or something else with N-H, but the options don't seem to suggest that. Also, a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's in the range of carbonyl groups. A strong peak there could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Wait, but the broad peak might be from a carboxylic acid (O-H stretch), but if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm^-1 or so. Alternatively, an ester or aldehyde would have a higher carbonyl peak.

Looking at the 1H NMR: there's a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which is a strong deshielded proton. That sounds like an aldehyde proton usually, but wait, could it be a carboxylic acid -OH? Because carboxylic acid protons are typically broad and around 10-12 ppm. But wait, in the NMR, it's a singlet integrating for 1H. If it's a carboxylic acid, the OH is usually a broad peak, but sometimes can be a singlet. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde proton, which is a sharp singlet around 9-10 ppm, but wait, this is at 11.0, which is higher. Hmm, maybe an aldehyde?

Wait, but let me check the other NMR signals. There are two doublets: at 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H). Two doublets with each integrating for 2H each. That suggests two sets of protons in an aromatic ring, each as a doublet. So perhaps a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, the two protons are equivalent and couple with each other, leading to a doublet. So for example, X-C6H4-Y, where X and Y are substituents. 

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure
