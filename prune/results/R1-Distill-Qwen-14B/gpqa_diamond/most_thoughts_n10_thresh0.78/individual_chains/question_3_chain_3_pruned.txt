Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The question says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. We need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx, and choose the correct option from A to D.

Hmm, I remember that expectation values are calculated by taking the conjugate transpose of the state, multiplying by the operator, and then by the state again. Or wait, more formally, for an operator A, the expectation value ⟨A⟩ is ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩.

So first, I should find the expectation values of σz and σx separately, then combine them with the coefficients 10 and 5.

Let me write down the state ψ. It's given as ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (√3/2) |↓⟩. Since it's a spin-½ particle, the possible states are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, which are eigenstates of σz.

I think σz has eigenvalues +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. So when I calculate ⟨σz⟩, I can compute it using the coefficients of ψ.

Wait, how do I compute the expectation value of σz? Oh right, because |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates, the expectation value would just be the weighted average of the eigenvalues.

So the amplitude for |↑⟩ is 0.5, so |a|^2 is (0.5)^2 =0.25. Similarly, the amplitude for |↓⟩ is sqrt(3)/2, so |b|^2 is (3/4) = 0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1). Let me compute that.

0.25*(1) + (3/4)*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Now, the other part is ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Its expectation value is a bit trickier because it's not diagonal in the σz basis.

Wait, I think the expectation value of σx can be calculated using the formula involving the amplitude and the components. Alternatively, I remember that for a spin-½ system in state ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value of σx is ( |a|^2 - |b|^2 ) multiplied by something or maybe (a b* + a* b )? Wait, let me think.

Wait, σx is represented by the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when you have ψ being a column vector [a, b]^T, then ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is a* b + b* a. Because when you multiply σx with |ψ⟩, you get [b, a]^T, then the inner product with ⟨ψ| is a* b + b* a. So that's 2 Re(a b*).

Yes, because a and b are complex numbers in general. But in this case, a is real (0.5) and b is real (sqrt(3)/2), so Re(a b*) is just a b.

So computing ⟨σx⟩ = a b + a b = 2 a b.

Wait wait, no. Wait, let me recast it correctly. Let me write a =0.5, b = sqrt(3)/2.

So ⟨σx⟩ = a b + a b = 2 a b.

Wait, no, actually, ⟨σx⟩ = a* b + b* a. Since a and b are real, a* =a and b* =b, so it's a b + b a = 2 a b.

So plugging in the numbers:

a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 2 * 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) =
