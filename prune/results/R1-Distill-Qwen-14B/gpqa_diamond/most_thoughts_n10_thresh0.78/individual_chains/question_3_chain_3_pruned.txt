Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition state: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz. The question asks for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. They want the answer up to one decimal place, and the options are given.

Hmm, I remember that expectation values are calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So I need to compute the expectation value of 10σz +5σx, which I can break down into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ and 5⟨σx⟩, since expectation values are linear.

First, let's figure out what the expectation value of σz is. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively, I can compute this easily.

The state is ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So the coefficients are a = 0.5 for |↑⟩ and b = sqrt(3)/2 for |↓⟩. 

The expectation value of σz is given by |a|²*(+1) + |b|²*(-1). Let me compute that.

|a|² = (0.5)^2 = 0.25. So 0.25 *1 =0.25.

|b|² = (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (3/4) = 0.75. So 0.75 * (-1) = -0.75.

Adding them: 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Then, the expectation value of 10σz is 10*(-0.5) = -5. But wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh, wait no, no. Because the operator is 10σz +5σx, so the expectation value is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. So I need both parts.

Now, what about ⟨σx⟩? That's the tricky part. Because σx is the Pauli X matrix, which is a Hermitian operator. The expectation value of σx in state ψ is given by 2*(|a|^2 - |b|^2) ? Wait, no. Alternatively, I remember that ⟨σx⟩ is 2*(Re(ab*)), but wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of the expectation value formula.

Wait, the Pauli matrices: σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], σy=[[0,-i],[i,0]], σz=[[1,0],[0,-1]]. So, for σx, the expectation value is ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

Let me write ψ as a column vector. Since |↑⟩ is [1; 0] and |↓⟩ is [0; 1], ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

So ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

So σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So to compute σx|ψ⟩, we apply the matrix to the vector.

σx|ψ⟩ would be [0*0.5 +1*(sqrt(3)/2), 1*0.5 + 0*(sqrt(3)/2)] = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Then, the inner product ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is ψ† multiplied by σx|ψ⟩.

So ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], and σx|ψ⟩ is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

So the inner product is 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5. Let me compute that.

0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) is (sqrt(3))/4, and the second term is (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 which is also (sqrt(3))/4. Adding them together gives (sqrt(3)/4)+(sqrt(3)/4) = (sqrt(3)/2).

So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that. Alternatively, another approach could be to note that for a spin-½ particle in a state ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value of σx is 2*(Re(a b*) ), but wait, actually, I might be mixing up the formulas. Alternatively, I can think in terms of the expectation value formula:

⟨σx⟩ = |a|^2 * ⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ + a b^* ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ + a^* b ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩ + |b|^
