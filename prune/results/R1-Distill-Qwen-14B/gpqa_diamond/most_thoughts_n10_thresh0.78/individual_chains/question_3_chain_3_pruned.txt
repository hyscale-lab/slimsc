Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The question says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. We need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx, and choose the correct option from A to D.

Hmm, I remember that expectation values are calculated by taking the conjugate transpose of the state, multiplying by the operator, and then by the state again. Or wait, more formally, for an operator A, the expectation value ⟨A⟩ is ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩.

So first, I should find the expectation values of σz and σx separately, then combine them with the coefficients 10 and 5.

Let me write down the state ψ. It's given as ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (√3/2) |↓⟩. Since it's a spin-½ particle, the possible states are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, which are eigenstates of σz.

I think σz has eigenvalues +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. So when I calculate ⟨σz⟩, I can compute it using the coefficients of ψ.

Wait, how do I compute the expectation value of σz? Oh right, because |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates, the expectation value would just be the weighted average of the eigenvalues.

So the amplitude for |↑⟩ is 0.5, so |a|^2 is (0.5)^2 =0.25. Similarly, the amplitude for |↓⟩ is sqrt(3)/2, so |b|^2 is (3/4) = 0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1). Let me compute that.

0.25*(1) + (3/4)*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Now, the other part is ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Its expectation value is a bit trickier because it's not diagonal in the σz basis.

Wait, I think the expectation value of σx can be calculated using the formula involving the amplitude and the components. Alternatively, I remember that for a spin-½ system in state ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value of σx is ( |a|^2 - |b|^2 ) multiplied by something or maybe (a b* + a* b )? Wait, let me think.

Wait, σx is represented by the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when you have ψ being a column vector [a, b]^T, then ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is a* b + b* a. Because when you multiply σx with |ψ⟩, you get [b, a]^T, then the inner product with ⟨ψ| is a* b + b* a. So that's 2 Re(a b*).

Yes, because a and b are complex numbers in general. But in this case, a is real (0.5) and b is real (sqrt(3)/2), so Re(a b*) is just a b.

So computing ⟨σx⟩ = a b + a b = 2 a b.

Wait wait, no. Wait, let me recast it correctly. Let me write a =0.5, b = sqrt(3)/2.

So ⟨σx⟩ = a b + a b = 2 a b.

Wait, no, actually, ⟨σx⟩ = a* b + b* a. Since a and b are real, a* =a and b* =b, so it's a b + b a = 2 a b.

So plugging in the numbers:

a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 2 * 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) =

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition state: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz. The question asks for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. They want the answer up to one decimal place, and the options are given.

Hmm, I remember that expectation values are calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So I need to compute the expectation value of 10σz +5σx, which I can break down into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ and 5⟨σx⟩, since expectation values are linear.

First, let's figure out what the expectation value of σz is. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively, I can compute this easily.

The state is ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So the coefficients are a = 0.5 for |↑⟩ and b = sqrt(3)/2 for |↓⟩. 

The expectation value of σz is given by |a|²*(+1) + |b|²*(-1). Let me compute that.

|a|² = (0.5)^2 = 0.25. So 0.25 *1 =0.25.

|b|² = (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (3/4) = 0.75. So 0.75 * (-1) = -0.75.

Adding them: 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Then, the expectation value of 10σz is 10*(-0.5) = -5. But wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh, wait no, no. Because the operator is 10σz +5σx, so the expectation value is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. So I need both parts.

Now, what about ⟨σx⟩? That's the tricky part. Because σx is the Pauli X matrix, which is a Hermitian operator. The expectation value of σx in state ψ is given by 2*(|a|^2 - |b|^2) ? Wait, no. Alternatively, I remember that ⟨σx⟩ is 2*(Re(ab*)), but wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of the expectation value formula.

Wait, the Pauli matrices: σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], σy=[[0,-i],[i,0]], σz=[[1,0],[0,-1]]. So, for σx, the expectation value is ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

Let me write ψ as a column vector. Since |↑⟩ is [1; 0] and |↓⟩ is [0; 1], ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

So ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

So σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So to compute σx|ψ⟩, we apply the matrix to the vector.

σx|ψ⟩ would be [0*0.5 +1*(sqrt(3)/2), 1*0.5 + 0*(sqrt(3)/2)] = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Then, the inner product ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is ψ† multiplied by σx|ψ⟩.

So ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], and σx|ψ⟩ is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

So the inner product is 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5. Let me compute that.

0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) is (sqrt(3))/4, and the second term is (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 which is also (sqrt(3))/4. Adding them together gives (sqrt(3)/4)+(sqrt(3)/4) = (sqrt(3)/2).

So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that. Alternatively, another approach could be to note that for a spin-½ particle in a state ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value of σx is 2*(Re(a b*) ), but wait, actually, I might be mixing up the formulas. Alternatively, I can think in terms of the expectation value formula:

⟨σx⟩ = |a|^2 * ⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ + a b^* ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ + a^* b ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩ + |b|^
