Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's a bit involved, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what each part does.

The question starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, so that's either propene or another alkene or maybe an alkyne. Wait, C3H6 has a degree of unsaturation of (3*2 +2 -6)/2 = (8-6)/2=1. So that's one pi bond, so it's an alkene. So the structure could be propene (CH2=CHCH3) or maybe cyclopropane, but I think it's more likely propene because bromination in CCl4 is more common with alkenes.

So Compound A is propene (CH2=CHCH3). Then, bromination in CCl4. Oh, wait, that's a bromination of an alkene. So bromination of propene would add Br2 across the double bond. So propene (CH2=CHCH3) plus Br2 would form 1,2-dibromopropane? Wait, no, wait. Propene has two substituents on each carbon of the double bond. So when Br2 adds, it would add across the double bond, giving CH2Br-CHBr-CH3? Or wait, maybe it's 1,2-dibromopropane, but wait, the structure would be CH2BrCH2CH2Br? No, wait, no. Wait, propene is CH2=CH2CH3 or CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond. No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So adding Br2 would give CH2Br-CHBr-CH3? No, wait, adding across the double bond would make each of the carbons in the double bond take a Br. So the product would be 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH2BrCH2BrCH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would add Br to each end. So it would become CH2BrCHBrCH3. So that's structure B.

Wait, but wait another thingâ€”could this be a different reaction? Oh, wait, if it's in CCl4, that's a non-polar solvent, so it's likely addition of Br2, not substitution. So yeah, B is 1,2-dibromopropane: CH2BrCH2BrCH3? Or wait, no, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3, so adding Br2
