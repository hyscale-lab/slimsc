Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what it's about. The question says that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Then there's this observable P, which is a matrix operator. The matrix P has specific elements in each row. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). The question asks for the probability that measuring the observable P yields 0.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables correspond to Hermitian operators, which have real eigenvalues. The probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is determined by the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.

Wait, so I think I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix P. Because the possible results of the measurement are the eigenvalues, and the probability is the square of the inner product of the state vector with the eigenvector.

But wait, what's the state vector here? The given state is (-1, 2, 1) as a column matrix. Let me represent that as a vector ψ. So ψ = [-1; 2; 1]. But I should probably normalize it because probabilities are based on the norm. Oh, wait, right, because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are normalized. So I think I need to check if ψ is normalized. Let me compute the norm: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So maybe the actual state is ψ divided by sqrt(6). Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors have a norm of 1.

Wait, but the problem might present the state already normalized, but I'm not sure. Let me think. If the state is given as (-1, 2, 1), and it's a state vector, then perhaps it's not normalized. So I might need to normalize it before proceeding.

Wait, the observable P is given as a matrix. So P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it out:

P = [ [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
