Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The problem describes a series of reactions. Let's go through each part carefully.

First, there's mixture X, which is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. These liquids decolorize bromine water. I remember that decolorizing bromine water usually means the compound has double bonds because alkenes can add bromine, causing the solution to decolorize. So mixture X must contain alkenes.

Next, when mixture X is treated with platinum (Pt) and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y, which is also an equimolar mixture of two liquids. But this time, mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So, the products after the reaction with Pt don't have double bonds anymore. Wait, what reactions involve adding H2 with Pt? Oh, hydrogenation! So maybe the alkenes are being hydrogenated to alkanes. But wait, the problem says it's a disproportionation reaction. Hmm, that's interesting. Disproportionation is when an element is both oxidized and reduced. But wait, the starting materials were two liquids—so maybe they are alkenes, and after reacting, some become something else. Alternatively, perhaps one of the components in X is undergoing a change that leads to two different products.

Wait, but the problem says that when X is treated with Pt when heated, it forms Y via a disproportionation. So maybe the starting materials are something that can undergo such a reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the alkenes are rearranging or undergoing some other reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains a diene or a compound that can undergo some rearrangement upon hydrogenation. But wait, after the reaction, Y doesn't decolorize bromine water, implying no double bonds. So maybe any double bonds in X are being hydrogenated to single bonds in Y.

But wait, the problem states that X is decolorizing bromine water, so X has double bonds, and Y does not—so Y is more saturated.

But then, when both X and Y are hydrogenated with Pt under severe conditions, they both give the same product Z, which is a hydrocarbon with 14.28% hydrogen by mass. Let me calculate the possible molecular formula for Z.

The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. So, let's say the molecular formula is CnHm. The molar mass would be (12n + m). The mass of hydrogen is (m * 1) / (12n + m) ) * 100 = 14.28.

Let me compute. Let's set up the equation:
