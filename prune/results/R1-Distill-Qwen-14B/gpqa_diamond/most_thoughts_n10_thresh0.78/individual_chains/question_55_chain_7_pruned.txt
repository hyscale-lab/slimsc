Okay, so I've got this NMR problem in front of me. I need to figure out which compound it is based on the given data. Let's see what I recall about NMR spectroscopy and how to analyze these signals.

The question gives four options: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate. All of them are esters, so the structure will have an acetate group (OAc) attached to a propenyl or butenyl group. The position of the double bond (cis or trans) will affect the NMR signals.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 7.0 ppm: 1H, doublet, J=16.0 Hz
- 5.5 ppm: 1H, doublet of quadruplets (dq)
- 2.1 ppm: 3H, singlet
- 1.6 ppm: 3H, doublet

Hmm. Let me break this down. 

First, the singlet at 2.1 ppm is probably the methyl group of the acetate. In an ester like R-O-CO-O-R', the acetyl group (COO) has a CH3 which is usually a singlet because it's not split by any neighboring protons. That makes sense here.

The doublet at 1.6 ppm (3H, d) suggests a methyl group adjacent to a double bond. Because in allylic positions, the protons are split based on their neighboring groups. If it's a doublet, maybe it's attached to a CH2 group that's next to a double bond. But wait, the integration is 3H, so perhaps it's a methyl group attached to a CH that's part of the double bond.

Wait, for example, in propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CH2CH2-OAc? Or maybe I should think about the substituents. Let me draw the possible structures.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the coupling. The doublet at 7.0 ppm with J=16.0 Hz is a large coupling, which is typical of a vinyl proton in a trans configuration. Wait, because in trans double bonds, the coupling between the two protons can be larger. Wait, but actually, in a trans configuration, the protons are on opposite sides, so the coupling (J) would be smaller. Wait no, wait: in a trans double bond, the two protons are on opposite sides, so their coupling is larger. Or is it the other way around? I think in a cis double bond, the coupling J is larger because the protons are on the same side and can couple more effectively. Wait, no, maybe I should think about this. For example, in a cis double bond, the two protons are on the same side, so their coupling would be larger, so the J value is higher. Whereas in a trans arrangement, the protons are on opposite sides, so the coupling is smaller, maybe around 6-8 Hz. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about some examples. In an E (trans) vs Z (cis) double bond, the coupling constants are larger for Z because the protons are closer. For example, in the case of 1,2-dichloroethylene, the cis isomer has a larger J value than the trans. So J=16 Hz is a pretty large coupling, which suggests a cis arrangement between two protons on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but the first signal is 7.0 ppm, 1H, d, J=16. So that's a single proton. Hmm, maybe it's a vinyl proton. If it's part of a double bond, then perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CH-OAc, but that doesn't fit the integration. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a substituted propenyl or butenyl group.

Wait, let me think about each option:

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. Structure would be (Z)-CH2CH(OAc)CH3? Or wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc? Wait no, propenyl is CH2CH2CH2, but that doesn't make
