Okay, so I've got this NMR problem in front of me. I need to figure out which compound it is based on the given data. Let's see what I recall about NMR spectroscopy and how to analyze these signals.

The question gives four options: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate. All of them are esters, so the structure will have an acetate group (OAc) attached to a propenyl or butenyl group. The position of the double bond (cis or trans) will affect the NMR signals.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 7.0 ppm: 1H, doublet, J=16.0 Hz
- 5.5 ppm: 1H, doublet of quadruplets (dq)
- 2.1 ppm: 3H, singlet
- 1.6 ppm: 3H, doublet

Hmm. Let me break this down. 

First, the singlet at 2.1 ppm is probably the methyl group of the acetate. In an ester like R-O-CO-O-R', the acetyl group (COO) has a CH3 which is usually a singlet because it's not split by any neighboring protons. That makes sense here.

The doublet at 1.6 ppm (3H, d) suggests a methyl group adjacent to a double bond. Because in allylic positions, the protons are split based on their neighboring groups. If it's a doublet, maybe it's attached to a CH2 group that's next to a double bond. But wait, the integration is 3H, so perhaps it's a methyl group attached to a CH that's part of the double bond.

Wait, for example, in propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CH2CH2-OAc? Or maybe I should think about the substituents. Let me draw the possible structures.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the coupling. The doublet at 7.0 ppm with J=16.0 Hz is a large coupling, which is typical of a vinyl proton in a trans configuration. Wait, because in trans double bonds, the coupling between the two protons can be larger. Wait, but actually, in a trans configuration, the protons are on opposite sides, so the coupling (J) would be smaller. Wait no, wait: in a trans double bond, the two protons are on opposite sides, so their coupling is larger. Or is it the other way around? I think in a cis double bond, the coupling J is larger because the protons are on the same side and can couple more effectively. Wait, no, maybe I should think about this. For example, in a cis double bond, the two protons are on the same side, so their coupling would be larger, so the J value is higher. Whereas in a trans arrangement, the protons are on opposite sides, so the coupling is smaller, maybe around 6-8 Hz. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about some examples. In an E (trans) vs Z (cis) double bond, the coupling constants are larger for Z because the protons are closer. For example, in the case of 1,2-dichloroethylene, the cis isomer has a larger J value than the trans. So J=16 Hz is a pretty large coupling, which suggests a cis arrangement between two protons on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but the first signal is 7.0 ppm, 1H, d, J=16. So that's a single proton. Hmm, maybe it's a vinyl proton. If it's part of a double bond, then perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CH-OAc, but that doesn't fit the integration. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a substituted propenyl or butenyl group.

Wait, let me think about each option:

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. Structure would be (Z)-CH2CH(OAc)CH3? Or wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc? Wait no, propenyl is CH2CH2CH2, but that doesn't make

Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are all different types of acetates—either propenyl or butenyl, and whether they're cis or trans.

First, let me remember what each of these compounds looks like. Propenyl acetate would have a three-carbon propenyl group attached to an acetate. Similarly, butenyl acetate would have a four-carbon butenyl group. The cis and trans refer to the configuration around the double bond in the propenyl or butenyl group.

The NMR data given is:

7.0 ppm: 1H, doublet, J=16.0 Hz.
5.5 ppm: 1H, doublet of quadruplets (dq).
2.1 ppm: 3H, singlet.
1.6 ppm: 3H, doublet.

I think about splitting in NMR. The singlet at 2.1 ppm is probably the methyl group attached to the oxygen in the acetate (like OAc). So that's the COOCH3 group, which would be a singlet because the CH3 is next to an electronegative atom and has no neighboring hydrogens.

Looking at the other signals. The doublet at 7.0 ppm with J=16 Hz is a long coupling constant. That suggests it's a trans coupling, maybe between two vinylic protons. Because 16 Hz is a typical value for trans coupling in alkenes.

Then there's the signal at 5.5 ppm, a doublet of quadruplets. Hmm. That's a bit more complex. Let me think about the splitting. A doublet of quadruplets suggests that the proton is coupling with two groups: perhaps one with two protons and another with three, or maybe two different coupling constants from adjacent protons.

Wait, maybe it's a vinylic proton that's coupling with two different sets of protons. For example, in a propenyl group, there's a CH2 and a CH. Or perhaps in a butenyl group, the structure is such that the protons are in a particular arrangement.

Wait, let me think about the structure of propenyl acetate and butenyl acetate.

Propenyl acetate would have the structure CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Or wait, no, propenyl is CH2CH2CH2? Wait, no—propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- as the substituent. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Or wait, could it be CH2CH2OAc with a double bond elsewhere? No, propenyl is an allyl group, I think. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Wait, but wait, acetates are usually esters where the R group is attached to the oxygen. So, for propenyl acetate, it's CH2CH2CH2OAc but with a double bond. Oh wait, perhaps it's CH2CHCH2-OAc with a double bond between the first and second carbons, so CH2=CHCH2OAc.

In that case, the structure would have the double bond between carbons 1 and 2 of the propenyl group. So the protons on C1 and C2 would be the vinylic protons.

But wait, in the NMR, the peak at 7.0 ppm is a doublet, which suggests it's coupled to one other proton. If it's a trans coupling, that might mean that the two vinylic protons are trans to each other. Wait, but in propenyl, the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2OAc, but that doesn't have a double bond. Oh wait, I think I confused the terms. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- as the substituent. So in propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, that would make it a 1-propenyl ester.

Alternatively, the structure could be CH2-CH2-OAc with a double bond elsewhere. Hmm, perhaps I should draw it out.

Wait, maybe the butenyl group is more likely. Butenyl has four carbons. Let's think about both possibilities.

In an ester like propenyl acetate, the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond. Wait, no, that's butenyl. Propenyl would have three carbons: OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait. The propenyl group is actually CH2=CHCH2- attached to the oxygen in the ester. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-Ac.

In such a case, the vinylic protons would
