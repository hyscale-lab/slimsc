Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember something about the speed of light in a medium. The general formula is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum, which is given as 1 here. So in the rest frame of the glass, the speed of the light would be 1/n. But wait, the glass is moving, so the observer in the lab might see a different speed.

Oh right, this is a problem involving relative motion. I think it's related to special relativity because we're dealing with velocities and the speed of light. But wait, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, but here the medium is moving, which complicates things because a medium is not an inertial frame if it's accelerating, but the glass is moving at a constant velocity, so its frame is inertial.

Wait, no. The medium's motion might affect the observed speed of light. Or does it? Because in special relativity, the speed of light remains c regardless of the source's motion. But wait, that's in a vacuum. The problem here is about light moving through a medium that's moving.
