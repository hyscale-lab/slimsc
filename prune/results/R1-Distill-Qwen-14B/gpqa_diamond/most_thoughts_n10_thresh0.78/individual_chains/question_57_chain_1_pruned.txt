Okay, so I have this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.

The question gives me phase shifts for different l values, I think. The phase shifts given are delta_0 = 90 degrees, delta_1=67, delta_2=55, delta_3=30, and delta_4=13 degrees. Wait, phase shifts are usually denoted as δ_l for each orbital angular momentum quantum number l. So l starts from 0, then 1, 2, etc. So here, l=0 to 4 are considered.

The problem asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Oh right, the scattering amplitude is related to the differential cross-section. The formula I remember is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l ) / (sinθ ± something). Wait, but when considering the direction along the beam, that's when θ is 180 degrees, but wait, no, the beam direction is θ=0 in the lab frame, right? Because the incident particle is coming along the positive z-axis, say.

Wait, no, when you're looking along the incident beam direction, that's when θ=0. So the scattering angle is zero. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh right, in scattering problems, θ is the angle between the initial and final momentum vectors. So if the particle is scattered in the same direction as it was moving, θ=0. So the forward direction is θ=0.

But the problem is specifically asking for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. Hmm. Does that mean we're looking at the scattering amplitude at θ=0?

Wait, another thought. The scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) can be written in terms of spherical harmonics. The imaginary part of f is related to the contribution from the phase shifts and the Legendre polynomials.

Wait, the general expression for the scattering amplitude is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [(2l +1) e
