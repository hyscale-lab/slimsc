Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about a molecule in its fundamental state, and we're supposed to find the momentum of a photon that needs to be absorbed for the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels involve both rotational and vibrational contributions. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next higher state. But wait, what's the next state? Because there are two aspects here—vibration and rotation.

Wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (probably J=0 or J=1, depending on the model). When it absorbs a photon, it can either increase its vibrational energy or its rotational energy. But which transition is the next lowest energy change?

I think the next state would involve the molecule moving to the first excited state, which would be the next possible state with the least energy increase. For diatomic molecules, the energy levels can be quantized in both rotation and vibration.

The energy levels for rotation are given by E_rot = B J (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant. For vibration, it's E_vib = (1/2) h ν + h ν (n), where n is the vibrational quantum number. The ground state is n=0, so the next vibrational state is n=1. But sometimes, the rotational state can change without changing the vibrational state.

Wait but the question says it's modeled using the non-rigid rotor model. Oh wait, no, the quantum rotation-vibration model is more about treating both vibrations and rotations as quantum phenomena, but the key here is that the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think refers to the lowest vibrational state and the lowest rotational state (which is J=0 for rigid rotor, but maybe J=1 for non-rigid? Wait, non-rigid rotor is different, but the question is about the rotation-vibration model. So perhaps the fundamental state is the lowest rotational (J=0) and lowest vibrational (v=0) state.

So the molecule's energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies. The next state would be either the first vibrational excited state (v=1) or the first rotational excited state (J=1), whichever has the lower energy. Because the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy, so the photon should provide the energy corresponding to the transition with the least energy required.

Wait, that makes sense. So I need to calculate the energy required to go from the fundamental state (which is J=0, v=0) to either J=1, v=0 or J=0, v=1. Which one requires less energy?

Let me calculate both and compare.

First, the vibrational energy. The energy levels for vibration are E_vib = (h ν / 2) (2n +1), where n is the vibrational quantum number. So, the ground state is n=0, E_vib = (h ν)/2. The first excited vibrational state is n=1, which would be E_vib = (3 h ν)/2. So the energy difference ΔE_vib = E_vib(n=1) - E_vib(n=0) = (3hν/2) - (hν/2) = hν.

Next, the rotational energy. For a rigid rotor, E_rot = B J (J +1), where B = (h²)/(8 π² I c), but wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, the energy levels are E_rot = (ħ² J (J +1)) / (2 I), where I is the moment of inertia. So the energy difference when J increases from 0 to 1 is E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = [ (ħ² (2)) / (2 I) ] - 0 = (ħ² * 2) / (2 I) = ħ² / I.

Wait, so the energy required for the rotational transition is ħ²/(I) and for the vibrational transition, it's hν.

So which one is smaller? Depends on the numbers. Let's compute both.

But wait, what's the formula for I, the moment of inertia? I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length. So μ = (m_X m_Y)/(m_X + m_Y) ).

Given Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu. So the reduced mass μ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Wait, but I need to convert that into kg because the units for momentum are in SI units.

Wait, amu is atomic mass units. 1 amu is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (22) ) * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Calculating that:

20 * 2 =40.

40/22 ≈1.81818 amu.

Multiply by 1.6605e-27 kg/amu: 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ let's compute that.

1.81818 * 1.6605 ≈ 3.013e-27 kg.

Wait, wait, let me compute more accurately.

1.81818 * 1.6605 = 

1.81818 * 1.6605 = let's break it down.

1.8 *1.6605 = 2.9889.

0.01818 *1.6605 ≈ 0.02998.

Total approx 3.01888. So 3.01888e-27 kg. So I = μ r².

r is the bond length, given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r=2e-10 m.

So r² = (2e-10 m)^2 = 4e-20 m².

Thus, I = μ r² = 3.01888e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.20755e-46 kg m².

Wait, is that right? Let me compute again. 3.01888e-27 *4e-20 = (3.01888 *4 )e-47 = 12.0755e-47 = 1.20755e-46 kg m². Okay.

Now, the energy difference for rotation when J goes from 0 to 1.

ΔE_rot = (ħ²) / I.

What's ħ? Planck's constant h is approximately 6.62607015e-34 J s, so ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

Wait, but wait: the formula for the rotational energy difference when J=0 to J=1 is (ħ² * [ J (J+1) - J_prev (J_prev +1) ]) / (2I). Wait no, earlier I thought for J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is (ħ² * 2 ) / (2I ) = ħ² / I. So yes, ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I).

So plugging in the numbers: ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ (1.05457^2) * 1e-68 = about 1.112e-68 J² s².

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the rotational energy formula. The correct formula for the rotational energy levels is E_rot = (ħ² J (J +1)) / (2I).

So when J=0, E_rot = 0. When J=1, E_rot = (ħ² * 2) / (2I ) = ħ²/(I).

So the energy difference is ħ²/(I).

So let me compute that:

ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J s)^2.

Wait no, actually, ħ has units of J s, so ħ² is (J s)^2. But when we divide by I (kg m²), the units become (J s)^2 / (kg m²).

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of energy. Let me compute the numerical value.

I have I = 1.20755e-46 kg m².

So ΔE_rot = (1.05457e-34 J s)^2 / (1.20755e-46 kg m² )

Wait, let's compute numerator and denominator
