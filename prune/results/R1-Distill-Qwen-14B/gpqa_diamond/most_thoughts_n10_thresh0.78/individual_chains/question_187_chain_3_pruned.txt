Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars would be detectable. Hmm, I remember that ESPRESSO is used for high-precision spectroscopy, right? But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

The question asks how many of the listed stars would be detectable if they achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. The options are a) to f), and the answer choices are A to D with numbers.

First, I need to figure out what determines detectability for ESPRESSO. I think it's mainly about the brightness of the star because if a star is too faint, the S/N ratio won't reach 10. So, the key factor here is the star's apparent magnitude.

ESPRESSO's sensitivity is something I should look into. From what I remember, ESPRESSO is designed for very bright stars, like those with lower magnitudes. Wait, I think it's optimized for stars brighter than about magnitude 8 or 9. Because fainter stars might not give enough photons for the required S/N.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about that. Another approach: perhaps I should calculate the apparent magnitude of each star and see if it's bright enough for ESPRESSO to achieve S/N 10 in an hour.

The formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d / 10), where M is absolute magnitude and d is distance in parsecs. Oh wait, no, the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d) - 5. Because M is the absolute magnitude (the apparent magnitude at 10 pc), so for a star at distance d, the apparent magnitude m is M + 5 log10(d) -5.

Let me compute each star's apparent magnitude:

a) Canopus: I think Canopus is a very bright star. Let me recall, Canopus is about magnitude -0.7 or something like that. So it's definitely bright enough. So this one is detectable.

b) Polaris: Polaris is the North Star. I think its apparent magnitude is around 2. Maybe a bit higher, but definitely much brighter than 8. So this should also be detectable.

c) Star with V=15, 10 pc. So M=15, d=10. m = 15 +5*(log10(10)) -5. log10(10)=1, so 15+5*1 -5 =15. So apparent magnitude m=15. Oh, that's way too faint. I think ESPRESSO can't handle that. So no detection.

d) Same absolute magnitude, but d=200 pc. Let's compute m. m =15 +5*log10(200) -5. Log10(200)=log10(2*100)=log10(2)+2 ≈ 0.301 +2=2.301. So 15 +5*(2.301) -5 =15 +11.505 -5=21.505. That's even fainter, so no.

e) M=15, d=5 pc. m =15 +5*log10(5) -5. Log10(5)=0.69897. 5 * 0.69897≈3.495. So 15 +3.495 -5 =13.495. So m≈13.5. Hmm. Is this bright enough for ESPRESSO?

Wait, what is the typical limiting magnitude for ESPRESSO? I think ESPRESSO is primarily used for bright stars, but I'm not sure exactly. Let me try to find some information. Oh, wait, I can't look up, but from what I remember, ESPRESSO can observe down to about magnitude 20? Or maybe not. Wait, no, that's for imaging. Wait, no, wait. For spectroscopy, the fainter the star, the harder it is to get a good S/N. I think ESPRESSO can handle stars as faint as about 19th magnitude, but I'm not sure. Wait, but earlier stars with m=15 would be way brighter than that. Wait, this is getting confusing.

Wait, let me think about the exposure time. The problem says 1-hour exposure. So if the star is bright enough, the exposure might be too long, but with ESPRESSO, you can read out the data quickly, so longer exposures are okay. But the main point is whether the photon count in one hour is enough for S/N 10.

Wait, the S/N ratio per binned pixel. So the question is about the S/N per pixel, not the overall. Hmm. But perhaps this is a bit beyond my knowledge. Alternatively, maybe I should think about what is the minimum magnitude ESPRESSO can handle for S/N 10 in an hour.

Wait, I found in some notes that ESPRESSO has a design goal to reach S/N 100 per pixel for a V=10 star in one hour. Wait, but that's for a very bright star. So if a star is V=15, which is 10^2.5 magnitudes fainter, the photons would be 100 times less. So S/N would be 100 / sqrt(100) = 10. So for a V=15 star, would S/N 10 be achieved in an hour? Because let's see: if a V=10 star gives S/N 100, then each magnitude increase (fainter) reduces the S/N by a factor of sqrt(10) per unit magnitude. So wait, 1 mag fainter is a factor of ~2.512 in photons. So for each magnitude, S/N scales by 1/sqrt(2.512) ≈ 0.62.

But wait, for a V=10 star, S/N is 100. So for a V=11 star (1 mag fainter), S/N would be 100 * 0.62 ≈ 62. For V=12, 62 *0.62≈38. V=13: ~24. V=14: ~15. V=15: ~9.
