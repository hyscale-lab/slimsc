Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Hmm, let's read it again carefully.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, but wait, the mass might not be directly relevant here since we're talking about luminosities. Oh right, because luminosity for stars is often related to their radius and temperature, not mass directly. Unless it's about something else like gravitational effects, but I think in this context, the mass might be a red herring or maybe it's used for another part.

The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is given by Wien's Law: lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if lambda_max is the same for both stars, that means their temperatures must be the same. Because if T were different, lambda_max would change. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but the radial velocities are given: Star_1 is 0 km/s and Star_2 is 700 km/s. Oh, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. So the observed wavelength is different from the actual emitted wavelength. But the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So maybe the observed wavelengths are the same, but their intrinsic (rest frame) wavelengths are different because of their velocities.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The peak wavelength observed would be affected by their radial velocities. So, for example, if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted; moving away, it's redshifted. So if Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, but Star_1 is at rest, then their observed peak wavelengths might be different. But the problem states that through spectroscopy, they found the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest to be the same. So the observed lambda_max for both stars is the same.

Wait, that's conflicting. Let me think. Let's say Star_2 is moving towards us or away from us. Because if it's moving, its observed temperature would change. Because the Doppler effect would shift the wavelengths. So the observed wavelength maximum would be different from the actual emitted wavelength maximum.

So suppose Star_1 is at rest. So its emitted lambda_max is lambda1 = b / T1. Then Star_2 is moving with some velocity, so its observed lambda_max is lambda2_observed = lambda2_actual * sqrt( (1 + v_r)/(1 - v_r) ) ), if I recall the relativistic Doppler shift formula correctly. Or maybe it's (1 + z), where z is the redshift. Wait, the Doppler formula can be a bit tricky.

Wait, the relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is lambda_observed = lambda_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), where v is the radial velocity. But when v is much smaller than c, which it is here (700 km/s is much smaller than the speed of light, which is about 3e5 km/s), we can approximate it using the non-relativistic formula: lambda_observed â‰ˆ lambda_emitted * (1 + v/c). But wait, radial velocity can be positive (recession) or negative (approaching). So if a star is moving towards us, v is negative (since it's moving towards us), so 1 + v/c is less than 1, so lambda_observed is less than lambda_emitted. So the observed wavelength is blueshifted.

Wait, but in the problem, the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both stars. So lambda1_observed = lambda2_observed.

But Star_1 has v_r = 0, so lambda1_observed = lambda1_emitted. Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s. Let's say Star_2
