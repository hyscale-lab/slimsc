Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. So, first, let me read the problem again carefully.

We dilute 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02000 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.

First, I think I should calculate the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Because we're mixing 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.040 liters). 

The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be Molarity × Volume. So that's 0.05 M × 0.02000 L. Oh wait, 0.05 * 0.02 is 0.001 moles. Right? Because 0.05 is 5e-2, times 2e-2 is 1e-3, so 0.001 mol.

When we add 20 cm³ of water, the volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration would be moles divided by volume. That's 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So after dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, we're titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. The next part is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

Wait, what's 25% titration? I think it means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So, I need to calculate how much NaOH is added at that point and then find the pH.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Find the initial moles of acetic acid after dilution.
2. Determine the moles of NaOH added at 25% titration.
3. Calculate the resulting concentrations of CH3COOH and CH3COO^- (acetate) in the solution.
4. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.

And for the equivalence point, since all the acetic acid has been neutralized, we'll have a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base. So, the solution will be basic. We'll need to find the concentration of acetate ions and then calculate the pH using the Kb.

Alternatively, since the acetate comes from a weak acid, we can use the Kb expression. But wait, maybe I should first handle each
