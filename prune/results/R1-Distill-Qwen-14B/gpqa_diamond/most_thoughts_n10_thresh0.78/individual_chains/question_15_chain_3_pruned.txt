Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should observe that one. Both planets have the same mass, but their orbital periods and host stars' properties are different.

Hmm, I remember that the transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orientation of the orbit. The formula for the probability is something like (R_planet / R_star) squared multiplied by something else. Wait, I think the formula is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 - eÂ²)^(1/2)), but since both have circular orbits, the eccentricity e is zero, so that part is 1. So the probability simplifies to (R_p / R_s)^2.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Because the RV method gives us the minimum mass, but the actual mass could be higher if the inclination is right. Oh, but for transit probability, the main factors are the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital inclination. Since the planets have the same mass, but their host stars are different, the R_p would depend on their actual radii. Wait, but in the question, the planets' radii aren't given. Wait, no, I think the problem says that the host stars have the same radius. Oh, right! Both host stars have the same radii. So R_s is the same for both.

So, the probability of transit would depend on (R_p1 / R_s)^2 and (R_p2 / R_s)^2. But wait, but since both have same star radius, it's just R_p squared. So if the planets have the same mass, but different sizes? Wait, no, the problem says both have Earth-like masses. Wait, Earth's radius and mass are known. If both have the same mass, their radii would be similar, but maybe not exactly the same. But the problem doesn't specify their radii, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Alternatively, maybe the transit probability also depends on the orbital distance and
