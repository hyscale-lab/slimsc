Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about cobalt complexes. Let me read it again carefully.

The question involves a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, the blue color usually corresponds to the Co(SCN)_n^(m+) complexes. I remember that Co with different numbers of SCN ligands can form different complexes, and their colors vary based on the number of ligands. But wait, dithiocyanato would be [Co(SCN)_2]^n+? Or maybe it's a specific complex like [Co(SCN)_4]^n+? Wait, wait, the question says "blue dithiocyanato," so I think dithiocyanato might mean two SCN ligands. Or maybe it's the [Co(SCN)_4]^3- complex? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think. Co(II) complexes with SCN are known, and the color varies with the number of ligands. For example, [Co(SCN)_4]^3- is blue, I think. Oh wait, I might be mixing up with other metals. Alternatively, maybe [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is blue. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the complex with four SCN ligands. Because I've heard that [Co(SCN)_4]^3- is blue. Or maybe the terminology is a bit different.

Wait, the problem mentions "dithiocyanato," which would imply two SCN groups. So, perhaps the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+. But the stability constants are given for the complexes, so let's see. The stability constant β is for the formation of the complex from the free ions.

The stability constants are given for β1, β2, β3, β4. So that suggests complexes with 1, 2, 3, 4 SCN ligands, respectively. The first complex is Co(SCN), the second is Co(SCN)_2, etc.

Wait, but stability constants are written as β = [complex]/([Co][SCN]^n), where n is the number of SCN ligands. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^3+, β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^4-? Or maybe something else. The exact charges might vary, but the main thing is the number of ligands.

But wait, the problem is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. So if dithiocyanato is two SCN ligands, then that's the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex. So I need to find the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ in the solution.

To find the percentage, I think I need to calculate the distribution of each species, considering all possible complexes, and then sum up the
