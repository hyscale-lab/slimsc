Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because titration problems can get a bit tricky for me. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so maybe I can work through each part.

First, let me read the problem again carefully. We have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³ (0.04 liters). 

Wait, but when you mix equal volumes, the concentration halves, right? So the initial concentration of acetic acid before any NaOH is added would be 0.05 M / 2 = 0.025 M? Hmm, because the moles stay the same but the volume doubles. Let me check: moles of acetic acid initially are 0.020 L * 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol. After adding 20 cm³, total volume is 40 cm³, so 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The first part is to find the pH at 25% titration. So, 25% of what's needed to reach the equivalence point. Let me think about the equivalence point first because maybe that will help.

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So, how many moles of acetic acid do we have? As calculated earlier, 0.001 mol. The NaOH needed for equivalence will be the same as the moles of acetic acid, because it's a 1:1 reaction. So, moles NaOH = 0.001 mol.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 liters, which is 10 cm³. So, the equivalence point is when we add 10 cm³ of NaOH. But wait, the question is asking about 25% titration. So, 25% of the equivalence volume. That would be 0.01 L * 0.25 = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: when you add 25% of the NaOH needed for equivalence, how many moles of NaOH have been added? 25% of 0.001 mol is 0.00025 mol. So, let's think about the reaction. Each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid. So, after adding 0.00025 mol NaOH, the moles of acetic acid will decrease, and the moles of acetate ions (CH3COO^-) will increase by the same amount.

So, the initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. After adding 0.00025 mol NaOH, moles of acetic acid left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate ions formed: 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the total volume is the initial solution (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added. The 2.5 cm³ is 0.0025 liters. So the total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

So, the concentrations are:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ let's compute that. 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Since this is a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is given by the formula pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. Let's see, 1.85e-5 is 1.85 x 10^-5. Let me approximate the log: log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is about 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

Now, [A^-]/[HA] is (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ approximately 0.333. Because 0.005882 is 1/16 of 0.017647? Wait, wait: 0.005882 * 3 = 0.017646, so yes, exactly 1/3. So the ratio is 1/3. The log of 1/3 is log(0.333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 + (-0.477) = about 4.256. That's approximately 4.26. Looking at the options, option A says 4.26 at 25% titration. Hmm, but wait, let me recheck the calculations to make sure.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the volume? Because when adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³, right. So the concentrations are correct.

So, the pH at 25% is about 4.26. Now, what about the equivalence point?

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So, the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so the solution will be basic.

The moles of sodium acetate are 0.001 mol. The total volume is the initial 40 cm³ plus the 10 cm³ of NaOH added. So, 50 cm³ (0.05 L). So, the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let's set up the expression for Kb.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]. Let x be the [OH^-].

So, Kb = x^2 / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, x^2 = Kb * 0.02 = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ approximately 3.288e-6 M. So [OH^-] ≈ 3.288e-6.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ around 5.485.

So pH = 14 - 5.485 ≈ 8.515. That's approximately 8.52.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A) 4.26; 8.52

Another option, D is 4.57;6.92. Oh, but wait, let me think again about the equivalence point. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, another approach: perhaps at equivalence point, I should consider the solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it's a basic solution.

Wait, but when I mixed 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, making 40 cm³ of 0.025 M. Then, you add 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Oh, wait, wait, no: the equivalence is when the moles of NaOH equal the moles of acetic acid.

Wait, the acetic acid is 0.001 mol, so you need 0.001 mol NaOH. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume is 10 cm³. So, after adding 10 cm³, the total volume is 40 +10 = 50 cm³.

So, the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 L = 0.02 M. So that part was correct.

Then, Kb is correct, and the calculation for OH- as ~3.29e-6, so pOH ~5.48, pH ~8.52. So the equivalence point pH is about 8.52.

So, option A says pH at 25% is 4.26 and equivalence 8.52. So that matches.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option D is pH 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the 25% calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the 25% titration part.

At 25% titration, moles of NaOH added = 0.25 * 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol.

So, moles of acetic acid left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume: 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

log(0.005882 / 0.017647) = log(1/3) ≈ -0.477.

pKa is 4.733. So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256. Rounded to 4.26.

So that's correct. So the first part is 4.26, the second is 8.52. So option A.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, option A is the first option. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait another thing. What if I made a mistake in the dilution step? Let me think again. The initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water. So the new volume is 40 cm³, and the concentration is 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 M. That seems correct.

But when we titrate, the volume of NaOH added will change the total solution volume. So in the 25% case, I added 2.5 cm³, so the total volume is 42.5 cm³.

Yes, that seems correct. So the calculations hold.

So, my conclusion is option A: 4.26;8.52.


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the dilution of acetic acid. Initially, 20.00 cm³ (0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, resulting in a total volume of 40.00 cm³ (0.040 L). The concentration of acetic acid after dilution is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{\text{moles of acetic acid}}{\text{total volume}} = \frac{0.020 \, \text{L} \times 0.05 \, \text{M}}{0.040 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the NaOH required to reach the equivalence point has been added. The moles of acetic acid initially are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.020 \, \text{L} \times 0.05 \, \text{M} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of NaOH added at 25% titration are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH added} = 0.25 \times 0.001 \, \text{mol} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]

After adding 0.00025 mol of NaOH, the remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ions (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ions are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}\right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733\), we calculate:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log\left(\frac{0.005882}{0.017647}\right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH, forming sodium acetate (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COONa}\)). The moles of sodium acetate formed are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution at equivalence is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.050 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.050} = 0.020 \, \text{M}.
\]

Acetate ions hydrolyze in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant, \(\text{K}_b\), which is related to the acid dissociation constant, \(\text{K}_a\), by:

\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{\text{K}_w}{\text{K}_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let \([\text{OH}^-] = x\). The equilibrium expression is:

\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} = \frac{x^2}{0.020}.
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x^2 = \text{K}_b \times 0.020 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \times 0.020 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11},
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.485.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.485 = 8.515 \approx 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
At 25% titration, the pH is approximately 4.26, and at the equivalence point, the pH is approximately 8.52. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
