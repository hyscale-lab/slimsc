Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some immune response processes. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So the setup is that someone tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then they used in vivo imaging and saw that some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid and some got stuck in the intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. They identified the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated the proliferating cells. Sequencing their variable heavy chain genes showed high variability. The question is asking which process is happening.

Wait, let me think about what each part means. Rotavirus is a virus that causes gastroenteritis, right? The inner capsid proteins are probably part of the viral structure, maybe the core. They tagged them with GFP, which is a fluorescent marker, so they can track where these proteins go in the mouse's body.

When they delivered them via oral gavage, that's like giving it through the stomach, so the proteins would go into the digestive system. Stomach acid is strong, so some fluorescence (the tagged proteins) got destroyed there. Others made it through but got stuck in the intestinal mucus. But then, these must have somehow gotten to the Peyer patches, which are a type of secondary lymphoid organ in the intestinal wall. Peyer patches are where a lot of immune responses happen, especially for things that get into the gut.

They isolated the proliferating cell population. Proliferating cells in an immune context are probably B cells or T cells. Since they're looking at the variable heavy chain gene, that's more likely B cells because the heavy chain is part of the B cell receptor (BCR). High variability in the variable region suggests that each B cell has a different receptor, which makes sense during an immune response.

Now, the processes: the options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

Somatic hypermutation is a process where B cells mutate their variable regions during the immune response, increasing diversity. This happens in the germinal centers after the initial activation. So when you have a lot of variability in the variable chains, that's probably due to somatic hypermutation.

Complement activation is about the complement system attacking pathogens. Not directly related to the variability in the genes.

Class switching is when the B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG), which doesn't change the variable regions but the constant regions. It's about function, not diversity.

VDJ recombination is the process during B cell development in the bone marrow where the V, D, and J segments are joined to form the variable region of the heavy chain. This happens early on, during maturation, not in response to a specific antigen. But in this case, the B cells are already mature and are responding to an antigen, so it's after VDJ.

So when the GFP-tagged proteins reach the Peyer patches, the B cells there are probably activated and undergoing division. The high variability in their variable regions suggests that they're undergoing somatic hypermutation to diversify their receptors to better bind the antigen. That's the process that increases diversity after the initial response.

So the answer should be A) somatic hypermutation.


The question involves tracking the fate of GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus in mice and analyzing the immune response. The proteins were delivered orally, and some were destroyed by stomach acid or entangled in intestinal mucus. Those that reached the Peyer patches led to the proliferation of cells, which showed high variability in their variable heavy chain genes upon sequencing. This variability suggests an immune response process that increases diversity in B cell receptors.

To determine the process, the options are analyzed:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This occurs during the immune response in germinal centers, where B cells mutate their variable regions to increase diversity. The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes aligns with this process.
- **B) Complement activation**: This involves the complement system attacking pathogens but does not explain the observed variability in the variable regions of the heavy chain genes.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This changes the class of antibody produced (e.g., IgM to IgG) but does not affect the variable regions, which are the focus here.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This occurs during early B cell development in the bone marrow, not in response to specific antigens, and is unrelated to the observed variability in mature B cells.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, a process that diversifies B cell receptors during the immune response. 

Answer: A
