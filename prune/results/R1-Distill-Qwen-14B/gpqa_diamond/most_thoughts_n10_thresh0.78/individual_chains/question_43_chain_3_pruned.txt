Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to IUPAC nomenclature. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about a benzene ring with several substituents: a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (which I think is an aldehyde group), and a cyano group. All three are meta to each other. Hmm, meta means each is separated by one carbon, right? So if one is in position 1, the others are in 3 and 5 perhaps?

Wait, the benzene ring has six positions. So let's imagine numbering them. Let's say the carboxylic acid is in position 1. Then the carbaldehyde and cyano would be in positions 3 and 5, but wait, meta to each other as well. Or maybe the three substituents are each meta to each other, forming a kind of triangle.

Wait, the problem says they are all meta to one another. So each substituent is meta relative to the others. So in a benzene ring, that should form a 1,3,5 arrangement. Because 1 and 3 are meta, 3 and 5 are meta, and 5 and 1 are meta. So that makes sense.

So the three groups—carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano—are at positions 1, 3, and 5. Now, the carboxylic acid is in position 1, perhaps. No, wait, the problem says the other groups are ortho and para to the carboxylic acid. Let me read that part again.

Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino. Para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Also, the methoxy and the hydroxyl are both ortho to the nitrile. So I need to figure out where each substituent is.

Let me try to sketch this out mentally. Let's number the benzene ring in a way that the carboxylic acid is position 1. Then, the groups ortho to it (positions 2 and 6) are hydroxyl and dimethyl amino. Which one is where? Hmm. The question doesn't specify the order, but the options might give a clue.

Wait, also, the methoxy group is para to the carboxylic acid, so that's position 4. So position 4 is methoxy.

Now, the nitrile (cyano group) is meta to the carboxylic acid. Since the carboxylic acid is in position 1, the cyano would be in position 3 or 5. But wait, the methoxy is in position 4, which is para to 1. So the nitrile is at position 3 or 5.

Wait, the problem says that the methoxy and the hydroxyl are both ortho to
