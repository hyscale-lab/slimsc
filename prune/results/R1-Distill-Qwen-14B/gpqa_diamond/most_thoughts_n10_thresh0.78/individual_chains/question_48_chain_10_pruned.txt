Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4. Let me break it down step by step.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, so it's a six-membered ring with a ketone group attached. The first step is treating it with bromine (Br2). I think that when ketones react with bromine, it's usually a addition reaction. Wait, no, wait. Bromine can undergo various reactions. Oh right, in the case of ketones, especially cyclic ones like cyclohexanone, bromine might add across the carbonyl group. But wait, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, so when it reacts with bromine, I think it undergoes a ring-opening addition. Oh wait, maybe it's more about conjugate addition or something else.

Wait, another possibility is that cyclohexanone could undergo a bromination via the enolate. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, bromine could add across the carbonyl group. So, in cyclohexanone, the carbonyl is at the end of the ring. Adding bromine would probably lead to the formation of a dibromide. Oh wait, wait, I think when you add bromine to a ketone like cyclohexanone, it would form a 1,2-dibromocyclohexane derivative. So product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane
