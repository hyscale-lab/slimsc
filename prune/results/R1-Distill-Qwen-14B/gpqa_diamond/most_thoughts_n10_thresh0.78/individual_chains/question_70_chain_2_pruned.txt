Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about a series of reactions, and I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, or C2v. Hmm, symmetry groups... I remember that these are related to molecular point groups, which describe the symmetry of a molecule.

Let me try to outline the reactions step by step.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So the reaction is A + 8B → C.

Second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E. So, C + 2D → E. And E is extremely hazardous.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak. So, C + H2O → A + F + G.

Fourth reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So, D + B → H.

I think I need to figure out what each of these compounds is. Let's start with the first reaction. Solid A reacting with gas B to form a red product C. Red products... I'm thinking maybe something like a metal oxide? Or perhaps a sulfide? Alternatively, maybe something like a transition metal complex?

Wait, when solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B, the 8:1 ratio suggests that B is a diatomic molecule. Because 8 equivalents would mean each A reacts with 8 B atoms. So if B is diatomic, for example, each molecule has two atoms, so the formula for C would be A B4. Maybe?

Wait, let me think about common reactions. For example, if A is a metal like copper, and B is something like sulfur. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if B is chlorine gas (Cl2), maybe A is something that reacts with Cl to form a chloro compound. But 8 equivalents would mean 4 Cl2 molecules? Hmm, maybe that's too much. Alternatively, perhaps B is something like O2, and A is a metal that forms an oxide.

Wait, another thought: maybe A is a metal, B is a halogen. Let's say A is Fe, and B is Cl2. Fe reacts with Cl2 to form FeCl3. But wait, FeCl3 is a red-brown solid, not bright red. Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait, the product C is described as a bright red solid. One bright red solid I can think of is mercury(II) oxide, HgO, but that's red. Or perhaps another possibility is a compound like lead dioxide (PbO2), which is dark brown, not bright red.

Alternatively, maybe C is a transition metal sulfide with a red color. For example, copper(II) sulfate is blue, but maybe some sulfide? Or perhaps a different compound.

Wait, let's think about what happens in the third reaction. C reacts with water to give back A and two acids F and G. So, C is probably an anhydride, perhaps. Because when
