Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. 

So the setup is: there's a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu equals gamma times Sz. The magnetic field was initially pointing in the +Z direction, and the particle's moment was aligned with it. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. So, I remember that when a magnetic moment is in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque. But in terms of quantum mechanics, the energy levels depend on the magnetic field direction, right? The spin state will align with the field to minimize energy.

Initially, the field is along +Z. So the particle's spin is in the Sz basis. The magnetic moment mu is gamma*S_z. So, the energy levels are proportional to S_z. But when the field is suddenly switched to +Y, the system will now have energy levels determined by the interaction with the Y-field.

Ah, but when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian of the system changes. The initial state of the system must be expressed in terms of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian to see how the expectation values evolve over time.

So, let's think about the system's initial state. Initially, the magnetic field is along +Z, so the particle is in an eigenstate of S_z. Let's say it's in the spin-up state along Z, which I'll denote as |+z>. The magnetic moment is then aligned with the field, so the energy is E = -mu·B.

But when the field is switched to +Y, the new Hamiltonian would be H = -mu·B', where B' is along Y. Wait, mu is gamma S_z, so H becomes -gamma S_z B' ? No, wait, no. Wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. Oh wait, the question says mu equals gamma times Sz. Hmm, that's a bit confusing because the magnetic moment is usually a vector, so it might be mu = gamma S (the vector). But the question says mu = gamma S_z, which is a scalar? Or maybe it's a vector where each component is gamma times the respective spin component. Wait, maybe the magnetic moment is a vector, so mu = gamma (S_x, S_y, S_z), but that's not what the question states. The question says mu = gamma * S_z. Hmm, that would make mu a scalar, which doesn't make much sense since magnetic moment is a vector. Maybe it's a typo, and they mean mu = gamma S, so the entire vector. Or perhaps they're considering the magnitude in a particular direction. Hmm, this might affect the setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma * S_z, which is a bit odd. Because S_z is a component, not the vector. Maybe it's a typo, or perhaps the magnetic moment is considered along the direction of the field. Alternatively,
