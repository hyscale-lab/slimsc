Okay, so I have this problem about stars and their spectral lines. Hmm, let me think. The question is about how the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels changes when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. 

Wait, I remember that when a star has spots, it affects the overall temperature. Oh right, spots are darker and cooler regions on the star's surface. So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the effective temperature of the photosphere drops. 

In the problem, without spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But with 40% coverage, the Teff drops to 5500 K. So the star is cooler when it has spots. 

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio is n1/n2, I think. Oh wait, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower than when it doesn't. 

Wait, the ratio of n1 to n2 depends on the Boltzmann distribution. The formula is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), right? Because higher energy states have fewer atoms, so the ratio depends exponentially on the energy difference over temperature. 

The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. That's in the near-ultraviolet, I think. So the energy difference between levels 1 and 2 can be found using the photon energy formula. 

Energy E = hc/λ. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters. 

Let me calculate E. So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10). Let me compute this step by step. 

First, numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. 
Denominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m. 

So E = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.373e-18 J. 

But wait, we usually work in terms of eV for such calculations because it's easier. Let me convert Joules to eV. 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So E = 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.57 eV. 

Wait, that seems high. Hmm, but 1448 Å is in the UV, so the energy should be higher than visible. Let me see, visible light is around 400-700 nm (400e-9 m is 4000 Å). So 1448 Å is higher (shorter wavelength) than visible, so higher energy. So 8.57 eV sounds plausible. 

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation. Let me compute hc/lambda again. 

h = 6.626e-34 J*s
c = 3e8 m/s
lambda = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m
Divide by lambda: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J → 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.57 eV. Yes, that's correct.

So the energy difference ΔE between the two levels is 8.57 eV. Or wait, that's the energy of the photon emitted when moving from level 2 to 1. So E2 - E1 = 8.57 eV.

Now, the ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(kT) ), because the ratio is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ). Wait no, wait: Boltzmann factor is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1. So in the ratio, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). 

But since the ratio is n1/n2, the higher energy level (n2) has a lower population, so when temperature decreases, the ratio increases? Wait, let me think. The exponent is negative (E2-E1 is positive, so it's negative in the exponent). So when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio increases. 

Wait, no. The Boltzmann factor is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1. So higher T makes the exponent less negative, so the factor is larger. So n1/n2 is proportional to exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ) → higher T → larger ratio. 

So when the star has spots, T decreases. So the ratio n1/n2 when the star has spots is lower than when it doesn't. Which aligns with the problem statement: the ratio decreases when the star has spots. 

So the question is, what's the factor by which the ratio changes. So when the star doesn't have spots, ratio is R1, when it does, R2. The factor is R1/R2.

So we need to compute R1/R2 = [n1/n2]_no_spots / [n1/n2]_has_spots.

But since the ratio depends on exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), the ratio R is proportional to exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). 

So R1 = exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T1) ), R2 = exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T2) ), where T1 is 6000 K (no spots), T2 is 5500 K (has spots).

So R1/R2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, let me compute that. 

So factor = exp( (E2-E1) / (k) * (1/(T1) - 1/(T2)) )

Wait, wait: Let me write this correctly. Let me think, R1 is for T1, R2 is for T2.

So R1 = exp( -(ΔE)/(k T1) )

R2 = exp( -(ΔE)/(k T2) )

So R1/R2 = exp( -(ΔE)/(k T1) + (ΔE)/(k T2) ) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2 ) - 1/(T1) ) ) )

Wait, yes. Because -(a) + b = b -a = (1/T2 - 1/T1) multiplied by ΔE/(k). 

So the exponent is [ΔE/(k)] * (1/T2 - 1/T1). Since T2 is less than T1, (1/T2 - 1/T1) is positive. So the exponent is positive, so R1/R2 is greater than 1.

So the factor is exponential of that value.

Now, let's compute the exponent.

ΔE is 8.57 eV. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So ΔE = 8.57 * 1.602e-19 J ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

k is Boltzmann's constant: 1.380649e-23 J/K.

Compute (ΔE)/(k) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ (1.373 / 1.38) * 1e5 ≈ approx 0.995 * 1e5 ≈ 9.95e4 K.

Wait, let me compute more accurately. 1.373e-18 / 1.38e-23 = (1.373 / 1.38) * 1e5. 

1.373 / 1.38 ≈ 0.995. So 0.995e5 = 99500 K.

So (ΔE)/(k) ≈ 99500 K.

Now, compute (1/T2 - 1/T1). T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.

1/5500 ≈ 0.0001818; 1/6000 ≈ 0.0001667. 

So 0.0001818 - 0.0001667 = 0.0000151.

Multiply (ΔE/k) by that difference: 99500 K * 0.0000151 ≈ 99500 * 1.51e-5 ≈ Let me compute 99500 * 1.51e-5.

99500 = ~1e5, so 1e5 * 1.51e-5 = 1.51. But 99500 is 99.5% of 1e5, so 0.995 * 1.51 ≈ 1.50245.

So the exponent is approximately 1.50245.

So the factor is exp(1.50245) ≈ e^1.5.

What's e^1.5? e is about 2.71828, so e^1 is ~2.718, e^0.5 is about 1.6487. So 2.718 * 1.6487 ≈ 4.48. So e^1.5 ≈ 4.48.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately. 1.50245 is just a bit more than 1.5, so e^1.50245 is about
