Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics question. Let me see what it's about. The question involves a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The problem is that this compound is making the barley unsuitable for food. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They mutagenized the plants using EMS, and now they're looking at the mutations in the target gene.

The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. I'm guessing that this means we need a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. Since the compound is anti-nutritional, probably the gene encodes a protein that produces it. So if the gene is non-functional, the compound won't be made, making the barley usable.

Looking at the sequences provided, the intact gene and four mutants are given. I need to compare each mutant to the intact gene and see which mutation is likely to disrupt the gene's function.

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. Let me look at each mutant:

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So, the first part is ATGTTCTACGCTG... Comparing to the intact gene, which starts ATGTTTCTCGCTG. So the first few bases are different. Let me see:

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTA...
Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTA...

Wait, let me line them up:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, so the change is in the third codon. Let's see:

The first codon is ATG (start, Met). Second codon in intact is TTT (Phe). In Mutant1, it's TTC (also Phe, same amino acid). Third codon in intact: CTC (Leu). Mutant1's third is TAC (which is Tyr). So the amino acid changes from Leu to Tyr. That's a substitution. So a missense mutation.

Mutant2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Compare to intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT...

Third codon in intact: CTC (Leu). Mutant2's third is TAA. Wait, but wait, the third codon starts at position 3, so in the mutant, is it TAA? Let me check:

Mutant2 is ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT... So the third codon is TAA, which is a stop codon (TAA is one of the three). Oh wait, wait, but in the mRNA reading frame, the start codon is at the beginning. So the third codon in the gene is position 3-5, which in the mutant is TAA.

Wait, the gene is in the 5' to 3' direction. So the first codon is positions 1-3 (ATG), second 4-6 (TTT), third 7-9 (CTC in intact, TAC in Mutant1, TAA in Mutant2).

So in Mutant2, the third codon is TAA. TAA is a stop codon. So this would cause a premature stop. That would truncate the protein. So if the gene is coding for a protein, this would produce a shorter, nonfunctional protein. So this could disrupt the gene's function.

Mutant3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Looking at the beginning. Intact starts ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...

Wait, the third codon in intact is CTC (Leu). Mutant3's third is TAC (Tyr), same as Mutant1. But then after that, the next part: intact has GGT ACT, while Mutant3 has GGT GTC ACT.

Wait, looking more carefully:

Mutant
