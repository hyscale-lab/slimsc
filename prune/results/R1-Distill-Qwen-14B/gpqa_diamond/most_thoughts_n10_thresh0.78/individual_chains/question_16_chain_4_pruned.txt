Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through each one step by step. Optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when a compound has a chiral center, which is a carbon with four different substituents. Let me go through each compound one by one.

First compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, the structure... It's an alkene with substituents. The Z configuration means the higher priority groups are on the same side. But wait, is there a chiral center here? The molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but wait, no, wait. The structure is but-1-ene, so double bond between C1 and C2. So C1 is Cl and CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So C1 is Cl attached to a double bond. So structure is Cl-C=C-CH2CH3? Wait, no. But but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with a Cl on C1 and a methyl on C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait no, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl-CH2-CH2CH2CH3, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me sketch it out.

But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would have Cl on C1, so Cl-CH2-CH2CH2CH3, but that's not an alkene. Oh wait, no, but it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group. So the molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 2-methyl would make it CH2=C(CH3)CH2CH3. But
