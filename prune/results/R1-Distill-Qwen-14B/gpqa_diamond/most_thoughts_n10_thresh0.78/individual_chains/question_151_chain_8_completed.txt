Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out the probability of measuring a certain observable and getting a specific value. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem states that the state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So that's a 3x1 vector. The observable is represented by matrix P, which is a 3x3 matrix. The rows of P are given: first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). We need to find the probability that measuring P yields 0.

Wait, how does this work again? I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables correspond to Hermitian operators. The eigenvalues of the operator are the possible measurement outcomes, and the eigenvectors give the states where the outcome is certain. So the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.

So the first step is to find the eigenvalues of P because those are the possible results we can get when measuring the observable P.

But wait, I don't remember the exact method for finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Let me think. For a matrix, the eigenvalues are the solutions to the equation det(P - λI) = 0. So we need to find the determinant of (P - λ I) and set it to zero.

The matrix P is:
[ 0       1/sqrt(2)  0       ]
[1/sqrt(2) 0          1/sqrt(2)]
[0       1/sqrt(2)  0       ]

So P - λ I would be:
[ -λ      1/sqrt(2)  0       ]
[1/sqrt(2) -λ        1/sqrt(2)]
[0       1/sqrt(2)  -λ       ]

Calculating the determinant of this matrix. The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be a bit tedious, but let's proceed.

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ] 
- (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 ] 
+ 0 * [ ... ] (since the third term is multiplied by zero, so we can ignore it)

So expanding the first term:

-λ [λ² - (1/2) ]

The second term is subtracted, so:

- (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (-λ/sqrt(2)) - 0 ] = - (1/sqrt(2)) * (-λ/sqrt(2)) ) 
= (1/sqrt(2)) * (λ/sqrt(2)) = λ/(2)

So putting it all together:

determinant = -λ (λ² - 1/2) + λ/2

Hmm, let me expand that:

= -λ³ + (λ/2) + λ/2
= -λ³ + λ

Wait, because (λ squared times λ is λ cubed, and I have a negative sign in front, so -λ³. Then, the term (λ/2) comes from the second part. Wait, wait, I think I messed up the signs.

Wait, the determinant expansion for a 3x3 matrix is:

a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)

Wait, perhaps I should use the rule of Sarrus or the cofactor expansion. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to find the eigenvalues for this specific matrix.

Looking at the matrix P, I notice it's symmetric, so it's Hermitian, which makes sense for an observable. Also, perhaps it's diagonalizable with real eigenvalues.

Hmm, another approach: perhaps P is a projection operator or has a particular structure. Let me see the matrix again:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Wait, is this matrix symmetric? Yes, because P[i,j] = P[j,i]. So it is symmetric, so it's Hermitian (since it's real and symmetric), which is correct for an observable.

Looking for eigenvalues, maybe we can think of this matrix as a combination of simpler matrices. Alternatively, perhaps the matrix has a particular pattern that allows for easy diagonalization.

Another idea: perhaps the matrix P has rank 2 or 1. Let's check the rank. The determinant being zero would imply rank less than 3. Let me try to compute the determinant again, but perhaps more carefully.

The matrix is:

Row 1: -λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ

To compute the determinant, let's expand along the first row:

det = (-λ) * det( [ [-λ, 1/sqrt(2)], [1/sqrt(2), -λ] ] )
       - (1/sqrt(2)) * det( [ [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)], [0, -λ] ] )
       + 0 * ... 

So the first minor is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix:
[ -λ, 1/sqrt(2) ]
[1/sqrt(2), -λ ]

Which is (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))^2 = λ² - (1/2)

The second minor is the determinant of:
[ 1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2) ]
[ 0,           -λ    ]

Which is (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 = -λ/sqrt(2)

So putting it all together:

det = (-λ) [ λ² - 1/2 ] - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (-λ/sqrt(2)) ] 

Simplify:

= -λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2) 

= -λ^3 + λ

So the characteristic equation is -λ³ + λ = 0 => λ ( -λ² + 1 ) = 0

So the eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ² = 1 => λ = 1 and λ = -1.

So the possible eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

The problem asks for the probability of measuring 0. So the eigenvalue 0 must have an eigenvector, and the probability is the square of the amplitude of that eigenvector in the given state.

So first, we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0.

So solving (P - 0 I) v = 0 => P v = 0.

So the system of equations is:

Row 1: 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/sqrt(2)) v2 = 0 → v2 = 0
Row 2: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0
Row 3: 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → same as row1, so v2=0

So from row 1 and 3, v2 must be zero.

From row 2: v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 must satisfy v2=0, and v1 = -v3.

Let's denote v3 as a parameter, say v3 = t. Then v1 = -t, v2=0, v3 = t.

So the eigenvector can be written as ( -t, 0, t ) = t ( -1, 0, 1 )

We can normalize this vector. The length squared is (-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 = 2. So the normalized eigenvector is ( -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) )

Wait, but any scalar multiple is allowed. So the eigenvectors are of the form (-1, 0, 1) multiplied by 1/sqrt(2) to make it a unit vector.

So the normalized eigenvector |ψ0> is ( -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) )

Now, the state of the system is given as the column vector ( -1, 2, 1 ). Let's denote this as |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

We need to find the projection of |ψ> onto |ψ0>, because the probability is the square of the absolute value of the inner product.

So the inner product <ψ0 | ψ> is:

( (-1/sqrt(2)) ) * (-1) + 0 * 2 + (1/sqrt(2)) * 1 

= (1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (1/sqrt(2)) 

= 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)

Wait, because (1/sqrt(2)) + (1/sqrt(2)) = 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).

So the inner product is sqrt(2). Therefore, the probability is |sqrt(2)|^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.

Wait, that can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1. Oh wait, no, because the state |ψ> must be normalized. Wait, is the given state |ψ> normalized?

Let me check. The state is [-1, 2, 1]^T.

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state isn't normalized.

Wait, that's a problem because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be normalized. So perhaps I should normalize the state before proceeding.

Ah, right. So before computing the inner product, I need to normalize |ψ> because otherwise, the probabilities won't add up to 1.

So the normalized state |ψ_norm> is (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

Now, the inner product between |ψ0> and |ψ_norm>:

<ψ0 | ψ_norm> = (-1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) + 0 * (2/sqrt(6)) + (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6))

= (1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) + 0 + (1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))

= 2/(sqrt(12)) )

Simplify sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3), so 2/(2*sqrt(3)) ) = 1/sqrt(3)

The probability is the square of this: (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through the steps again.

1. Found eigenvalues of P: 0, 1, -1.

2. For λ=0, found the eigenvectors are multiples of (-1,0,1), normalized to (-1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)).

3. The given state is [-1,2,1], which is not normalized. Normalize it by dividing by sqrt(6): (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

4. Compute inner product with eigenvector:

(-1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)).

Each term is 1/(sqrt(12)) = 1/(2*sqrt(3)).

Adding two terms: 2/(2 sqrt(3)) = 1/sqrt(3).

Square is 1/3.

So yes, the probability is 1/3. So the correct option is C.


To determine the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) and obtaining the value \( 0 \), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( P \)
The observable \( P \) is represented by the matrix:
\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
To find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). After computation, the eigenvalues are found to be \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \).

### Step 2: Eigenvector for \( \lambda = 0 \)
For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvector satisfies \( P \mathbf{v} = 0 \). Solving the system of equations, the eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \) is:
\[
\mathbf{v}_0 = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Normalizing this vector, we get:
\[
\mathbf{v}_0^{\text{norm}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Given State and Normalization
The state of the system is given as:
\[
\mathbf{ψ} = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The norm of \( \mathbf{ψ} \) is:
\[
\|\mathbf{ψ}\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
\mathbf{ψ}_{\text{norm}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Inner Product and Probability
The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between \( \mathbf{ψ}_{\text{norm}} \) and \( \mathbf{v}_0^{\text{norm}} \):
\[
\langle \mathbf{v}_0^{\text{norm}} | \mathbf{ψ}_{\text{norm}} \rangle = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}} \right) + \left( 0 \right) \left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \right).
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\langle \mathbf{v}_0^{\text{norm}} | \mathbf{ψ}_{\text{norm}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} + 0 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
\left| \langle \mathbf{v}_0^{\text{norm}} | \mathbf{ψ}_{\text{norm}} \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
