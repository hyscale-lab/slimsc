Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and bases are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says we mix 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. Then we have to find the enthalpy change. The options are given in kcal and kJ, which is a bit confusing but I'll figure it out.

Wait, enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The standard value is around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but here we have a mix of different acids and a base. Oh right, H2SO4 is a strong acid, HCl is also strong. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base.

First, I think I need to find out how much each acid and base contributes to the reaction. Because the neutralization will depend on the moles of H+ and OH- ions available.

Let me break it down step by step.

Step 1: Calculate moles of each reactant.

HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives 1 mole of H+.
Moles of HCl = Molarity * Volume(L) = 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 mol.

H2SO4 is a diprotic strong acid, so each mole gives 2 moles of H+. Since it's 0.3 M and 0.3 L (300 mL), moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole gives 2 moles of OH- because Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2OH⁻.
Molarity is 0.5 M, volume is 0.2 L. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol. So OH- from it is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol.

Wait, so total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol. And OH- is 0.2 mol.

But wait, when acid and base mix, the H+ and OH- will neutralize each other. The limiting reagent is whichever has fewer moles, because H+ + OH- → H2O.

So compare H+ (0.28) and OH- (0.2). OH- is the limiting reagent here. So all OH- will react, and some H+ will remain.

So the reaction will produce 0.2 mol of H2O from neutralization, and 0.08 mol of H+ left (0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08).

But wait, what about the excess H+? Since there's more acid than base in terms of H+ and OH-, the solution will be acidic. But for the enthalpy of neutralization, I think we only consider the amount that actually neutralizes.

The enthalpy change should be based on the moles of H+ and OH- that react. So here, 0.2 mol of H+ reacts with 0.2 mol of OH-.

Now, the enthalpy of neutralization per mole is usually about -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases. But wait, the question is about the total enthalpy change for the reaction, not per mole. So I need to calculate how much heat is released when 0.2 mol of H+ and OH- neutralize.

Alternatively, since each mole of H+ neutralizing gives off about 57 kJ, but wait, wait, wait. Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when one mole of H+ reacts with one mole of OH- to form water. So for each mole, it's -57 kJ (exothermic, so negative).

So for 0.2 moles, the enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57) kJ. Let me compute that: 0.2 *57 = 11.4, so -11
