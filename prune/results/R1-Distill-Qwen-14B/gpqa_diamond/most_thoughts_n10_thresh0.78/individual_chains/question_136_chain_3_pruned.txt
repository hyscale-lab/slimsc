Okay, so I'm trying to solve this vector calculus problem. Hmm, the question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it.

The vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². So that means the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r². And it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. Oh, right, so f(r) is a radial vector field, which makes sense because it's only along the radial direction.

The question is asking for the volume integral of the divergence of f over a sphere of radius R. So, I need to find ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV within that sphere.

Wait, wait. I remember from Gauss's Law that the divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux through the surface. The divergence theorem says that the integral of ∇·f over a volume is equal to the surface integral of f · n over the boundary surface, where n is the outward normal.

So, mathematically, that's ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dS.

In this case, the boundary surface is the sphere of radius R. Since the field is radial, the vector f and the normal vector n (which is also radial on the sphere) are in the same direction. So their dot product is just the product of their magnitudes.

But wait, the field f is given as 1/r² in magnitude. Wait, at radius r, the magnitude is 1/r². So on the surface of the sphere (r=R), the magnitude would be 1/R².

So the flux integral becomes ∫∫ (f · n) dS = ∫∫ f(R) * n · (dS). Since n is radial and dS is a vector in the direction of n, the dot product is just f(R) multiplied by the area element, because n · dS is dS (as the magnitude of dS is just the area element, and they're in the same direction).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The flux integral is ∫ f · dA, where dA is the vector element of the surface. So for a sphere, this becomes f(R) times the area of the sphere, because every point on the sphere has the same value of f (since it's radial and uniform in direction
