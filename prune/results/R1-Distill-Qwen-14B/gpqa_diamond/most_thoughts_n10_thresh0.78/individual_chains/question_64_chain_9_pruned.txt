Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's try to break it down. The problem involves heating a mixture of salts and analyzing the resulting gases. Hmm.

So, the setup is that we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams. They are heated to 200°C without air. The result is a mixture of gases. These gases are then passed through several tubes.

The first tube, number 1, is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. The weight of this tube increases by 3.60 grams. The second tube is Ca(OH)2 solution, and its weight doesn't change. The third tube has red-hot copper, and the weight increases by 0.80 grams, with CuO formed. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure.

We need to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are 13, 15, 17, 19.

Hmm, okay. Let's think about what each of these tubes does. Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent, it absorbs water. So if the first tube gains weight, that suggests the gas entering it had water vapor, which was absorbed. So Mg(ClO4)2 would react with water, increasing the tube's weight. So gas 1 is water vapor maybe?

Wait, but the first tube's weight increased by 3.60g. That suggests that the amount of H2O is 3.60g because Mg(ClO4)2 would absorb it. So the initial gas mixture must have included H2O vapor.

Then, the second tube is Ca(OH)2 solution. For this, if the gas is CO2, it would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water. But since the weight didn't change, maybe no CO2 was present. Because if there was CO2, the Ca(OH)2 would react, increasing the weight. But in this case, the weight didn't change, so perhaps there was no CO2 in the gas mixture.

Wait, but what else could be in the gases? Maybe hydrogen? Because H2 would not react with Ca(OH)2 solution. Wait, Ca(OH)2 is a base, maybe H2 would be neutral? Or perhaps the gas isn't acidic, so no reaction. Alternatively, NH3 would react, but I think the presence of NH3 would get absorbed, but in this case, the weight didn't change, so maybe NH3 wasn't present.

Then the third tube is red-hot copper. The gas passed through this tube caused the copper to gain weight by 0.80g, forming CuO. So copper oxide is formed, which suggests that the gas was H2 because H2 can react with hot copper to form Cu and water. Alternatively, maybe another reducing gas, but H2 is a common one.

Wait, the reaction of H2 with CuO: H2 + CuO → Cu + H2O. So if the gas is H2, it would react with the hot copper. But what about the amount? The mass increase in tube 3 is 0.80g. Let's calculate how much H2 would cause that.

So, the reaction is H2 + CuO → Cu + H2O. The molar mass of CuO is 80 g/mol, and Cu is 64 g/mol. So for every mole of H2 consumed, the mass of CuO would decrease by (64 - 80) g? Wait, no. Wait, the mass change is from the copper oxide converting to copper. Let me think: the reaction takes CuO and converts it to Cu, releasing water. So for each mole of CuO consumed, the mass of the tube decreases by 16 g (since CuO is 80 g, Cu is 64 g: 80 - 64 =
