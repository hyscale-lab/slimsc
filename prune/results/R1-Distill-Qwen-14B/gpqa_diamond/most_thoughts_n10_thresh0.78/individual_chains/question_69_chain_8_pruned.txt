Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking. Alright, the decay is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, so I think I need to figure out the velocity of the X⁰ particle first because that will determine how far it travels before decaying. Once I have the velocity, I can find the length it travels (the decay length) and see what resolution is needed to detect at least 30% of the decays.

Oh right, the proper lifetime τ₀ is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer due to time dilation. So the lab frame lifetime τ is γ multiplied by τ₀. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E/(m c²). Wait, but E is given as 27 GeV. Hmm, let me think about units here.

Wait, mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. So energy is 27 GeV. Gamma is E/(m c²), but since both are in GeV, and c² is (3e8 m/s)^2, but maybe because we're working in natural units, where c=1, perhaps in these units, E = gamma m c², so gamma would just be E/m. Because in units where c=1, E = γ m. So gamma would be 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.918.

Wait, let me calculate that: 27 / 3.41 is approximately 7.917. So gamma is about 7.92. So the lab lifetime τ is gamma times τ₀, which is 7.92 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that. 7.92 * 8 is 63.36, so 63.36e-16 s. Hmm.

But wait
