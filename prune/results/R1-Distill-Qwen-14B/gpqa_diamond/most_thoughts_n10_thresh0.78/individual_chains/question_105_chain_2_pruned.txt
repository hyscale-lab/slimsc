Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, the problem is about a star similar to the Sun, radius same as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because the star is rotating, these spots will cause brightness variations that look like a planet transiting the star. The question is asking, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as these spots?

Hmm. Right, so when a planet transits a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness, which we can observe. The amplitude of this dip depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. Similarly, the spots on the star will make it dimmer when they're in view, but only when they're on the side facing us as the star rotates.

Wait, the problem says that the star has a filling factor of 20% for the spots. So filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered by spots. So each hemisphere (assuming the other is spot-free) has 20% coverage. But since only one hemisphere is spotty, when the star rotates, we'll see this spot coverage moving in and out of view, causing the brightness variations.

But what's the effective change in brightness caused by these spots? Let's think about the flux. The star's total flux without any spots is based on its effective temperature. The spots are cooler, so when they're on the side facing us, they contribute less flux.

The star's flux without any spots is L = 4πR²σTeff^4. But wait, when we calculate the brightness variation, the spots reduce the flux. So the change in flux (ΔF) when a spot is visible would be the difference between the normal flux and the flux with the spot.

Alternatively, when a spot is on the visible hemisphere, the observed flux decreases because that area is emitting less. The total flux when the spot is visible is the original flux minus the flux that the spot contributes.

Wait, maybe it's easier to model this as the fraction of the star's surface that is covered by spots and their lower temperature. Let's break it down.

The star's surface area is 4πR². Each hemisphere is 2πR². The filling factor is 20%, so the area covered by spots on one hemisphere is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So total spotted area is 0.4πR².

But wait, the star is rotating so that one hemisphere (with spots) is facing us. No, no, the problem says only one hemisphere is covered in spots. So when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view and then moves away, causing the brightness variation.

Wait, no, perhaps the star is
