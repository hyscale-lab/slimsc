Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think this through step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator A_y. The setup is given, so let me parse that first.

The operator A_y is defined as c multiplied by the matrix S. The constant c is h/(4π), which I remember is related to the reduced Planck's constant, because ħ is h/(2π), so c is ħ/2. Oh wait, wait, no. Let me compute that: h/(4π) is actually ħ/2 because ħ = h/(2π). So c = (h/(2π)) * (1/2) )? Wait, no, wait: h/(4π) is (h/(2π)) * (1/2) )? Hmm, I think that's correct. So c is ħ/2.

The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So S is a 2x2 matrix:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

Wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices have a structure similar to this. Let me recall: The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], Z is diagonal. Oh, right,
