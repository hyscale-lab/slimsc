Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me see if I can figure it out. Hmm, it's about electric potential energy in an isolated system. Let me read it again.

Alright, the setup: there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. So that's 2 times the elementary charge, right? And their mass is negligible, so maybe I don't have to worry about things like kinetic energy or gravity here since it's an electric potential problem.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. Oh wait, and the 13th charge is fixed at point P. So point P is where the 13th charge is, and the other twelve are all 2 meters away from P. So they form a sort of spherical arrangement around P, I guess?

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system. I think that refers to the electric potential energy because weâ€™re dealing with charges and their arrangement. Oh, right, in a system of charges, the potential energy is the work required to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions, considering the potential from the others as we go.

Wait, but in this case, the 13th charge is fixed. So how does that change things? Let me think. The system's potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies of all possible pairs of charges. But since the 13th is fixed, maybe I can calculate the energy contributed by each of the twelve charges relative to the 13th, and then the energy between the twelve themselves.

Wait, no, wait a second. The 13th charge is fixed at P. The other twelve are each 2 meters from P. So each of the twelve is at a distance of 2 meters from the 13th charge. But what about the distance between the twelve charges themselves? Hmm, the problem says the twelve are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P. But it doesn't specify their mutual distances. Oh, wait, if they're fixed at 2 meters from P, but their positions relative to each other could vary as long as they are on the surface of a sphere of radius 2m. But for the minimum energy, maybe the charges are arranged in a way that minimizes the potential energy, which in the case of like charges would be when they are as far apart as possible. Wait, no, wait, that's for maximum potential energy. Because the potential energy for like charges being brought together is positive, so to minimize the energy, we might arrange them in a way that they are as far apart as possible. But since all twelve are at the same distance from P, their mutual distances would vary. Hmm, but perhaps for the purpose of calculation, we can approximate their mutual potential energy based on the average distance or something else. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the potential energy between each of the twelve and the 13th charge, and not between the twelve themselves. Wait, that can't be right. Because the total potential energy of the system includes all pairs.

Wait, let me re-read the problem. It says, "the
