Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these reactions yet. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about the Cope rearrangement and another reaction, maybe a Birch reduction or something similar? Wait, no, looking back, the first part is a two-step reaction with BuLi and then H+. The second part is a Cope rearrangement because it says "heat or light" and involves changing positions of double bonds.

Alright, let's look at the first reaction: ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene treated with BuLi and then H+. Hmm, I remember that BuLi is a strong base, a good nucleophile. It's often used to deprotonate compounds, especially in enolate formation. Wait, but the starting material is a benzene ring with an (oxy)methyl substituent, which is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. So the structure is something like phenyl-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but let me think. But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? Wait, no. Let me draw it out.

But-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait but that's the ene part. So but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-CH2-? No, wait. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- attached via the first carbon? Or the second? Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-CH2- but wait, wait, but-2-en-
