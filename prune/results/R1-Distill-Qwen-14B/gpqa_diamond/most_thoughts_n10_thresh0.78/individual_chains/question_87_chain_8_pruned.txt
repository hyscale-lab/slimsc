Okay, so I've got this question here about an aromatic compound, and I'm trying to figure out which NMR spectrum corresponds to it. Let me start by breaking down the problem.

The question says it's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms in total. Hmm, wait, 6-membered ring plus 8 carbons? Wait, the ring itself is 6 carbons, but wait, substitution. Oh, wait, di-substituted means two substituents. So, the ring has two substituents attached. So the total carbons would be 6 (ring) + substituents. So if the substituents add up to 2 carbons, then 6+2=8. Let me think.

Wait, no. The substituents could have more carbons. Wait, the total is 8 carbons. So the ring is 6 carbons, substituents contribute 2 carbons in total. Because 6 + substituents = 8. So substituents are two groups, each with 1 carbon? Or maybe one substituent has 2 carbons and the other has zero? Like maybe a chlorine and a methyl group, but wait, that would be 6+1+1 = 8. Or another possibility...

Wait, but the question mentions FTIR peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the compound has both a carbonyl (like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe ester or something) and a halogen attached to the ring.

So the substituents would probably be a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. Wait, but halogens are typically substituents like Cl, Br, etc. But the carbonyl group would be part of a substituent. So for example, maybe an acyl group attached to the ring. Wait, but that would add more carbons.

Wait, let me think: If the ring has two substituents, X and Y. Let's say substituent X is a carbonyl group, like a ketone (CO-) but that's part of a larger substituent. Alternatively, substituent Y is a halogen. So maybe the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen.

Wait, let's re-examine the structure. The molecule is a di-substituted benzene (since it's 6-membered aromatic). Each substituent is attached to the ring. One substituent is a carbonyl group, perhaps part of a ketone or another group, and the other is a halogen, like Cl.

Wait, but how many carbons does each substituent contribute? Let's see:

If the ring has 6 carbons, and the substituents add 2 carbons in total, so each substituent must contribute 1 carbon. Wait, but that's not possible for a carbonyl group. Because a carbonyl group like a ketone would be R-CO-R', but that would require more carbons.

Wait, maybe one substituent is a halogen (like Cl, which doesn't add any carbons beyond the ring) and the other is a carbonyl-containing group that adds 2 carbons. So 6 (ring) + 2 (from substituent) +
