Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. It says that compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures are called isomers. Constitutional isomers differ in their structural arrangement, while stereoisomers have the same structure but different spatial arrangements. 

The problem is in two parts, A and B. Part A asks which of the compounds benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism. Part B is about optical isomerism between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

I'll tackle each part separately.

Starting with part A: Which compound doesn't show tautomerism.

Tautomerism is when a compound can shift between different structures, usually through the movement of a hydrogen atom and a shift in double bonds. For example, in carbonyl compounds, if there are adjacent double bonds, hydrogen can move, causing a change in structure. This is also related to the possibility of keto-enol tautomerism.

Benzoquinone: I recall that benzoquinone is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone is actually a benzene ring with two ketone groups in the para positions. So its structure is O=C6H4=O. But wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups, but they are in adjacent positions? Or maybe para? Let me think. Oh wait, benzoquinone is usually the 1,4-diketone form. So it's a benzene ring with two keto groups opposite each other. So the structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O (but arranged in para positions). 

Now, can benzoquinone undergo tautomerism? Well, tautomerism typically requires adjacent carbonyl groups because the hydrogen can shift
