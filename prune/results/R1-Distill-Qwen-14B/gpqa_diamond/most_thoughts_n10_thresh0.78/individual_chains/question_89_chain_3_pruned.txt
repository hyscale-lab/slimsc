Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by breaking down what's happening in each reaction.

The first part says that 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR and IR data are given. So, I think this is an elimination reaction because KOH is a strong base and heating usually leads to E2 mechanisms. 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons, so when KOH removes a Î²-hydrogen, it should form an alkene via dehydrohalogenation. Since there are two Br atoms, perhaps two eliminations happen? Wait, but wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane... Hmm, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so the positions might be such that elimination leads to a more stable structure. Maybe each Br is on adjacent carbons, leading to the formation of a double bond.

Wait, 1,3-dibromo would imply the Brs are on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. But when KOH is used, each Br could eliminate a Br and form a double bond. So, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, and another between C3 and C4? Or perhaps each Br leads to a separate elimination, but wait, the product is a single compound. Hmm, perhaps it's a di-elimination, but wait, that's maybe not possible. Alternatively, perhaps a single elimination occurs, but that would form a mono-ene. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane might have two Brs on adjacent carbons, so each could eliminate, but maybe they form a conjugated diene? Or perhaps it's a bicyclic structure where elimination would form a bridgehead double bond, which is allowed.

Alternatively, maybe each Br is on the same carbon? No
