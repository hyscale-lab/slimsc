Okay, so I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Let me start by understanding what each instrument can observe.

From the question, I remember that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes up to 17 mag. HIRES, on the other hand, can handle stars up to 16 mag. So a star must have an apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 16 because both instruments can detect up to that. Wait, no. Wait, ESPRESSO can go up to 17, HIRES to 16. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be <=16. Because if it's brighter than 16, HIRES can't see it. If it's up to 17, ESPRESSO can, but HIRES can't. So the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤16.

But wait, some stars might have extinction (dust), which makes them appear dimmer. The question mentions E(B-V) for some stars, which affects the V magnitude. The formula is Av = 3.1 * E(B-V). So the apparent magnitude is the intrinsic magnitude plus Av. So I need to calculate the apparent V for each star, considering extinction, and see which ones are ≤16.

Let me go through each star one by one.

Star1: RA 15, DEC -75, absolute V 15.5 mag, distance 10 pc.

Absolute magnitude Mv is 15.5. So apparent V magnitude is Mv + 5 log10(d/10). d is 10 pc, so log(10/10)=0. So apparent V is 15.5 + 0 =15.5. No mention of E(B-V), so I assume E(B-V)=0. Therefore, apparent V is 15.5 mag.

Check if both can observe. ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so yes. HIRES can go up to 16. 15.5 is less than 16, so yes. So Star1 can be detected by both. Wait but wait, wait. Wait, no, ESPRESSO can observe up to 17, so Star1's apparent V is 15.5, which is within both. So Star1 can be seen by both. But wait, let me check each star.

Star2: RA 30, DEC 55, apparent V mag 16.5, distance 5 pc. Wait, no—apparent V is already given. But wait, do I need to apply extinction here? Because if E(B-V) isn't zero, the apparent mag would be higher because extinction makes stars look dimmer. But in this case, Star2 has an apparent V of 16.5. But what about extinction? The question says E(B-V)=0.6 for Star3 and Star4, but not Star2. So Star2's E(B
