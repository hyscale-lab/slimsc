Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating non-Gaussianity using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me a state |ψ> which is a superposition of two coherent states: cos(phi)|alpha> and sin(phi)|-alpha>, divided by a normalization constant N. The normalization N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2alpha²)). The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

The non-Gaussianity measure here is the relative entropy, del_b, defined as the difference between the von Neumann entropy of the state rho and a reference Gaussian state tau. That is, del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). So, I need to find this value.

Wait a minute, but wait—non-Gaussian states are those that can't be described by Gaussian statistics, which includes coherent states, squeezed states, etc. Coherent states are Gaussian. So the problem is about whether the state |ψ> is Gaussian or not.

Let me think. The state is a superposition of two coherent states. Coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator. Their superpositions are generally non-Gaussian, except in specific cases. But when phi is such that the state simplifies to another Gaussian state, then maybe the non-Gaussianity would be zero.

Wait, let's plug in the values. phi is -pi/4. Let me compute sin(2phi). 2phi would be -pi/2. So sin(-pi/2) is -1. So the term sin(2phi) is -1.

Now, the normalization N: sqrt(1 + sin(2phi)*exp(-2alpha²)). Let's plug in alpha=0.5. So exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-2*(0.25))= exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. Then sin(2phi) is -1, so the term is (-1)*(0.6065). So the inside becomes 1 + (-0.6065) = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state |ψ> is [ cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Wait, cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071. Sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071. So the state becomes [0.7071 |0.5> - 0.7071 |-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Hmm, so this is a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases. But wait, when phi is -pi/4, let me see if this state can be rewritten in a way that simplifies it.

Wait, another thought: what if the state is a coherent
