Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reactions and chromatography stuff. But let's take it step by step.

The question involves two reactions, each starting with a different compound. After both reactions are done, the products are combined and run on two different HPLC columns: one normal-phase and one chiral. The question is about how many peaks each will show. The options are A to D, each giving different numbers.

First, let me break down each reaction.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.

LAH is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one has a ketone group at position 3. When reduced, that should become a secondary alcohol. The structure would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but wait, the configuration? The starting material is an S configuration at C5? Let me think. Actually, when reducing a ketone to an alcohol, the configuration of the chiral center would be determined by the reaction. LAH is a strong reducing agent and usually leads to retention or inversion?

Wait, no, let me clarify. When you reduce a ketone to an alcohol, the resulting alcohol has two new substituents attached. The ketone is R2CO, and the reduction gives R2CH(OH). So the configuration depends on the mechanism. LAH is a strong hydride agent. It's a single-electron transfer mechanism, right? So the hydride attacks from the less hindered side. But for a ketone, the hydride would add from the less hindered face. Wait, no, maybe it's better to think in terms of the mechanism. In ketone reduction, the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen gets a negative charge which picks up a proton during workup. So the attack is from the less hindered side, leading to the configuration.

Wait, but in the starting compound, the 5-methoxyhexan-3-one has a specific configuration. Let me draw the structure. The molecule is hexan-3-one, so it's CH3-CO-CH2-CH2-OCH3. Wait, wait, no: the carbon chain is
