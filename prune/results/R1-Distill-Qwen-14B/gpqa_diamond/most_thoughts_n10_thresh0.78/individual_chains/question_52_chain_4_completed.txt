Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

So, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on the surface, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They say that when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm. So, the problem involves the Boltzmann equation, I think. Because the ratio of populations in energy levels in LTE is given by that equation. Right, the Boltzmann factor.

The Boltzmann equation is: (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Here, n is the number of atoms in each level, g is the statistical weight (or degeneracy), E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the transition between the two levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. So, the energy difference between the two levels can be found using the relation E = hc/λ. 

Wait, but since the problem gives the same transition in both cases (with and without spots), the energy difference (E2 - E1) is the same in both situations. So when calculating the ratio, the exponential part will involve the temperature, which is different when spots are present.

When the star has spots, the effective temperature decreases. So, without spots, T is 6000 K, and with spots, it's 5500 K. 

The problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio (n2/n1) decreases. So, without spots, the ratio is higher. That makes sense because higher temperature would lead to higher population in higher energy levels, so a higher ratio. Wait, wait, no. Because the ratio depends on exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). Let me think again.

The ratio (n2/n1) is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So, if T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, meaning the ratio increases. So, when T is higher (no spots), the ratio is higher. When T is lower (spots present), the ratio is smaller. That aligns with what the problem says.

So, we need to find the factor by which (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_with_spots. Because the question is asking for the factor when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots.

So, factor = [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T_no) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T_spots) ) ]

Since g2/g1 is the same in numerator and denominator, it cancels out. So factor = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T_no) + ΔE/(k T_spots) ] )

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T_spots) - 1/(T_no) ] )

Wait, let me re-arrange that exponent.

The exponent was: [ -ΔE/(k T_no) + ΔE/(k T_spots) ] = ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T_spots) - 1/(T_no) ]

Wait, no: Let me compute the exponent again. 

The numerator's exponent is -ΔE/(k T_no) and the denominator's is -ΔE/(k T_spots). So when you take the ratio, it's:

exp( [ (-ΔE/(k T_no)) - (-ΔE/(k T_spots)) ] )

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T_spots) - 1/(T_no) ] )

Wait, let me compute this correctly. Let me denote the exponent as:

Exponent = [ (-x / T1 ) - (-x / T2) ) ] where x = ΔE/(k)

So, Exponent = x ( -1/T1 + 1/T2 )

Which is x ( (1/T2) - (1/T1) )

So, correct.

So, factor = exp( (ΔE/(k)) ( 1/T_spots - 1/T_no ) )

Now, let's compute ΔE.

The energy difference between the two levels is given by E = hc/λ. But since λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448 * 10^-10 meters.

Wait, but for calculation purposes, perhaps it's easier to compute in terms of Angstroms and use the Rydberg constant or other constants, but perhaps I'll just use the basic constants.

h is Planck's constant, which is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light, about 3e8 m/s.

k is Boltzmann's constant, about 1.38e-23 J/K.

So, let's compute ΔE = hc / λ.

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.

So,

ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m )

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by 1448e-10 m:

ΔE = 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = (1.9878 / 1448) * 1e-15 J

1.9878 / 1448 ≈ 0.001372.

So ΔE ≈ 0.001372e-15 J = 1.372e-18 J.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation:

Wait, 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25.

Divide by 1448e-10 m:

1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 m = (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-18 J.

1.9878 / 1.448 ≈ 1.373.

So, ΔE ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

So, now, compute (ΔE)/(k) : (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ (1.373 / 1.38) * 1e5 K.

1.373 / 1.38 ≈ 0.995 ≈ ~1.

So, (ΔE/k) ≈ 1e5 K (approximately 100,000 K).

Wait, that's a very large value. Let me double-check the calculation because this seems a bit high, but perhaps that's correct.

Wait, 1.373e-18 / 1.38e-23 = (1.373 / 1.38) * 1e5 = about 1e5.

So, yes, about 1e5 K.

So, now, compute (1/T_spots - 1/T_no).

T_spots =5500 K, T_no=6000 K.

1/5500 ≈ 0.0001818 (exactly 0.000181818...).

1/6000≈0.000166666...

Difference: 0.000181818 - 0.000166666 ≈ 0.000015152.

So, (ΔE/k) * (1/T_spots -1/T_no) = (1e5 K) * (0.000015152) ≈ 1.5152.

So, the exponent is 1.5152.

Wait, but wait, since the exponent is (ΔE/k)(1/T_spots -1/T_no) ) = (1e5 K) * (1.5152e-5 1/K) ) = 1.5152.

So, the factor is exp(1.5152) ≈ e^1.5152.

We know that e^1.6 is about 4.95, e^1.5 is about 4.48. Let me calculate more accurately.

Using calculator: e^1.5152.

I can compute it step by step.

We know that ln(4.5) is about 1.504, and ln(4.6) is about 1.526.

Since 1.5152 is between these, e^1.5152 is between 4.5 and 4.6.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Let me think: ln(4.5) ≈ 1.504077.

ln(4.54) ?

We can compute e^1.5152 as follows.

Using a Taylor expansion or linear approximation between 1.504 and 1.526.

The difference between 1.504 (ln(4.5)) and 1.526 (ln(4.6)) is 0.022 over an interval of 0.022 (from 4.5 to 4.6).

Wait, wait: no, the x interval is from 1.504 to 1.526, which is 0.022. The corresponding e^x goes from 4.5 to 4.6, which is also 0.1.

Wait, no, the actual e^1.504 is 4.5, e^1.526 is 4.6.

We have x=1.5152.

The difference between x and 1.504 is 0.01112.

The slope of e^x around x=1.5 is approx e^1.5 ≈4.4817. The derivative is same as the function, so the slope is e^x.

So near x=1.504, the slope is 4.5.

We can approximate:

At x=1.504, y=4.5.

x increases by 0.0112 to 1.5152.

y increases by approximately 4.5 * 0.0112 ≈0.0504.

So, e^1.5152 ≈4.5 +0.0504=4.5504.

Alternatively, using a calculator, 1.5152:

e^1.5152 = ?

Using a calculator (since I can't do it exactly), but I know that e^1.5 is about 4.4817, e^1.51 is about 4.53, e^1.52 is around 4.58.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the exact value.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it numerically.

But perhaps for the purposes of this problem, the approximate factor is about 4.5.

Wait, the options are:

A) ~1.1

B) ~7.8

C) ~4.5

D) ~2.9

So, 4.5 is option C.

Wait, but I have a factor of e^1.5152 ≈4.55, which would be closest to option C (~4.5). So the factor is approximately 4.5.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps because that seems a bit high, but perhaps that's correct.

Wait, another way: perhaps the calculation of (ΔE/k) is wrong.

Wait, let's recompute ΔE.

ΔE = hc/λ.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So:

ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) 

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 1.448e-7 m.

So ΔE = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ) = (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-18 J.

1.9878 /1.448 ≈1.373.

So ΔE ≈1.373e-18 J.

Then, ΔE/k= (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) = (1.373 /1.38 ) * 1e5 K.

1.373/1.38 ≈0.995 ≈1.

So, ΔE/k ≈1e5 K.

So, that was correct.

Then, (1/T_spots -1/T_no) = 1/5500 -1/6000.

Compute that:

1/5500 ≈0.000181818

1/6000≈0.000166667

Difference: 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151.

Multiply by (ΔE/k)=1e5 K:

1e5 * 0.000015151 = 1515.151515... no, wait, no.

Wait, (ΔE/k) is 1e5 K.

Multiply by 0.000015151 (which is 1.5151e-5):

1e5 * 1.5151e-5 = 1.5151.

So exponent is 1.5151.

So e^1.5151 ≈4.54.

So factor is ~4.5, which is option C.

Wait, but wait. The factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

Wait, no, the question is about the ratio of n1 to n2, but according to the problem, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Let me make sure.

Wait, the problem says: the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots.

So, the ratio (n2/n1) decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star doesn't have spots, it's higher. So, the factor is (n2/n1)_no_spots divided by (n2/n1)_spots.

Which is exactly what I computed as e^1.5151 ≈4.5.

So, the factor is about 4.5, which is option C.

Hmm, but wait, looking at the options, option B is ~7.8, which is larger. Did I make a miscalculation?

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the temperature is the effective temperature, but the spots are cooler. So, the photosphere with spots has a lower effective temperature, but perhaps the emission from spots and unspotted regions affects the overall observed spectrum.

Wait, the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K when 40% is covered by spots. So, the effective temperature is 5500 K overall.

But, the problem is about the photosphere. Wait, but the spots are cooler, but when the star has spots, the photosphere might be a mix of hot and cool regions.

Wait, but the problem states that the stellar photosphere is in LTE, so perhaps we can model each region as being in LTE, but when calculating the overall effect, it's an average of the flux from different regions.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K.

So, in the no-spots case, the star's Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered by spots, Teff is 5500 K.

But for the purpose of the Boltzmann factor, which T do we use? Do we model the photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present, or do we consider a mixture?

Wait, the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So, perhaps the entire photosphere, on average, is at 5500 K when spots are present. But that would complicate things because the photosphere is a mix of hotter and cooler regions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the photosphere as if it were at a uniform temperature. When all the surface is unspotted, T_eff is 6000 K. When 40% is spotted, the overall emission reduces, leading to a lower T_eff of 5500 K. But for the purpose of the ratio, perhaps each region (spot and non-spot) is at its own temperature.

Wait, but the problem says that the photosphere is in LTE. So, perhaps when the star has spots, the photosphere is a mix of regions at different temperatures.

Wait, but the problem is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. If the photosphere is a mix of regions at different temperatures, then the Boltzmann factor would be an average.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the photosphere as if it's at the effective temperature. But that would be an approximation, perhaps. Because the effective temperature is a measure of the total emitted flux, not the temperature of the photosphere.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that when the star has spots, the photosphere is at a lower effective temperature, so the line formation occurs in a photosphere that's now at 5500 K. But that would not be correct, as the spots are cooler regions, but the rest of the photosphere is still at 6000 K.

Ah, this is a crucial point. Because if the spots are cooler, and the rest of the surface is at 6000 K, then the line formation in the photosphere would involve a mixture of regions at different temperatures.

But the problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So, perhaps the photosphere is considered to be at 5500 K when spots are present. But that can't be entirely accurate because the spots are cooler, and the rest is hotter. But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps we're supposed to model it as the effective temperature.

Wait, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again.

The question says that when the star has spots covering 40% of its surface, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So, the entire star's effective temperature is 5500 K. But in reality, the spots are cooler, and the rest is at 6000 K.

But the problem states that the stellar photosphere is in LTE. So perhaps the photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present. But that would mean that the star's entire photosphere is at 5500 K, which isn't the case. The spots are cooler, and the unspotted regions are hotter.

But perhaps the problem is treating the effective temperature as the average, so the photosphere is effectively at 5500 K when spots are present. Or perhaps the observed Teff is 5500 K, but the actual photospheric regions have varying temperatures.

But the question is specifically about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. So, if the photosphere is a mix of regions at 6000 K and 5500 K, then how do we compute the average ratio?

Wait, that complicates things a lot. Alternatively, perhaps the star's photosphere is considered to be at the effective temperature. So when there are no spots, the photosphere is at 6000 K. When spots are present, the photosphere is at 5500 K.

But that's probably not correct because the spots are cooler regions on the surface. The rest remains at 6000 K. So, the photosphere is a mix of 60% at 6000 K and 40% at a lower temperature. But what lower temperature? The problem doesn't give the temperature of the spots. Hmm.

Wait, the problem doesn't provide the temperature of the spots. It only says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So, perhaps the effective temperature is the average of the contributions from the spotted and unspotted regions.

Wait, but the effective temperature is the temperature a blackbody of the same size would emit with the same total flux. So, the observed flux is the sum of the fluxes from the spotted and unspotted regions.

Assuming that the spots are black (emitting nothing), but that's probably an approximation. Typically, spots are cooler regions, so they emit less flux.

So, the total flux F_total is F_unspotted * 0.6 + F_spotted * 0.4.

F_unspotted is the flux per unit area from the unspotted regions, which is sigma * T_unspotted^4.

Similarly, F_spotted is sigma * T_spotted^4.

But the problem doesn't give the temperature of the spots. So, perhaps this approach isn't feasible.

Wait, but the problem is about the ratio of the populations in the photospheric layers. So, perhaps the photosphere is considered to be at the effective temperature. That is, without spots, photosphere is 6000 K, with spots, it's 5500 K.

But that would mean that when spots are present, the entire photosphere is at a lower temperature. Which isn't correct, but perhaps the problem is making that approximation.

If that's the case, then the calculation I did earlier holds, and the factor is about 4.5.

But wait, if the effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present, perhaps the photosphere is at 5500 K. So, the Boltzmann factor uses T=5500 K when spots are present, and T=6000 K otherwise.

Which is how I approached it earlier.

So, the factor would be e^{(ΔE/k)(1/5500 - 1/6000)}.

Which we computed as approximately 4.5, which is option C.

But wait, another thought: the transition is at 1448 Å, which is in the near UV or perhaps extreme UV. Wait, 1448 Å is 144.8 nm, which is in the UV range. But Ti lines are typically in the optical or UV. So, maybe this is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign of the exponent. Let me recheck.

The ratio when no spots is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T_no) )

Ratio when spots is (n2/n1)_spots = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T_spots) )

So, the factor is (n2/n1)_no / (n2/n1)_spots = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T_no) + ΔE/(k T_spots) ] )

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T_spots) - 1/(T_no) ] )

Which again gives the same as before.

As T_no is higher than T_spots, the difference inside the exponent is positive. So, the exponent is positive, and the factor is greater than 1, which makes sense as the ratio (n2/n1) is higher when no spots are present.

So, the calculation seems correct, leading to a factor of ~4.5, which is option C.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ~7.8. Could I have made a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let me recompute (1/T_spot - 1/T_no):

1/5500 = 0.000181818

1/6000 = 0.000166667

Difference: 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151.

Multiply by (ΔE/k) = 1e5 K.

So, 1e5 * 0.000015151 = 1.5151.

Then, e^1.5151 is approximately 4.54.

So, the factor is about 4.5, which is option C.

Hence, the correct answer should be C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right)
\]

Here, \( n_2 \) and \( n_1 \) are the populations of the two energy levels, \( g_2 \) and \( g_1 \) are their statistical weights, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

### Key Information:
1. **Energy Difference (\( \Delta E \))**:  
   The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \). Using \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), we calculate:
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]

2. **Temperature Ratio**:  
   When the star has no spots, \( T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \). When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the effective temperature decreases to \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \). The difference in inverse temperatures is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.000015151 \, \text{K}^{-1}.
   \]

3. **Exponent in Boltzmann Factor**:  
   The ratio of populations changes by a factor of:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \exp\left(\Delta E \cdot \frac{1}{k} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right)\right).
   \]
   Substituting \( \Delta E / k = 1.373 \times 10^{-18} / 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \approx 1 \times 10^5 \, \text{K} \), we get:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \exp\left(1 \times 10^5 \cdot 0.000015151\right) = \exp(1.5152).
   \]

4. **Final Calculation**:  
   Using \( \exp(1.5152) \approx 4.54 \), the factor by which the ratio changes is approximately \( 4.5 \).

### Conclusion:
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels is higher when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, with a factor of approximately \( 4.5 \).

ANSWER: C
