Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that there's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. I remember that di-substituted means two substituents are attached to the benzene ring. The FTIR shows an ester group. Oh right, esters have a carbonyl group, so IR would show the C=O peak around 1700 cm^-1, but I don't think the exact position matters here, just the presence.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: six signals. Two for aromatic H, two for vinyl H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two for –CH3 groups. No –CH2 signals. So, I need to figure out the structure based on this.

First, aromatic H in a di-substituted benzene. Di-substituted rings can have different substitution patterns. If the substituents are para, ortho, or meta. But wait, the aromatic H signals are two. Wait, if it's para substitution, the aromatic protons would be two sets: two equivalent H in ortho, two in meta, and none in para (because substituents are in para positions). Wait, no, wait. The substituents are in para positions. So the benzene ring would have two substituents opposite each other. Then the remaining four H would be in two sets of two each, perhaps as a para coupling. Or maybe if the substituents are in the meta positions, but that would give more signals. Hmm, but the NMR shows two aromatic signals, so perhaps it's a 1,4-substitution (para), which would lead to two sets of aromatic H: the two H adjacent to each substituent (ortho) and the two H opposite (para) to them. So each set would have two H each, but if the substituents are identical, those ortho H's would be equivalent, and the para H's would be equivalent as well. So that would give two aromatic signals, each integrating for two H. That makes sense.

So the aromatic part is a para-disubstituted benzene ring with two substituents.

Now, the ester group. Esters are R-O-CO-O-R? Wait, no, ester is R-O-CO-R. So the structure would be something like R-O-CO-R'. Since it's an ester, the substituents on the benzene are probably an ester group and another substituent.

Wait, but wait. A di-substituted benzene with an ester group. So perhaps one substituent is a COO-R group, and the other substituent is something else.

Looking at the NMR, the vinyl H's are two signals: one is a doublet, the other is a doublet of quartets. Vinyl H's are in a CH2=CH- group. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton, and the quartet suggests coupling with two or three. Hmm.

Wait, the doublet of quartets: that's more
