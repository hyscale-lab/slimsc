Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spectroscopy. But let's take it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The clues come from the FTIR and 1H NMR spectra.

Alright, the FTIR shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group. Esters typically have strong absorption around 1740 cm⁻¹ for the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So the compound has an ester functional group. That's a key point.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. There are six signals. Let me break down each part:

1. Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H. So the ring has two different types of aromatic protons. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents are in positions that cause the aromatic protons to split into two sets. For example, if the substituents are para, but wait, para would give two equivalent protons each, right? So maybe the substituents are in positions that lead to two distinct sets. Wait, di-substituted aromatic rings can have substituents in ortho, meta, or para positions. For ortho substituents, the ring would have two sets of aromatic protons, maybe each as a doublet. Wait, but in para, the substituents are opposite each other, leading to two equivalent protons on each side; but perhaps the substituents are such that the ring has two distinct types of aromatic Hs.

Wait, but maybe the substituents are in such a way that the ring has two different environments. For example, if the substituents are in meta positions, but that's a 1,3 substitution. Wait, no, di-substituted would be either 1,2 (ortho), 1,3 (meta), or 1,4 (para). Hmm. Let me think. For 1,2 substitution, the aromatic protons could be in two different environments. For example, in o-xylene, the two methyl groups are adjacent. The aromatic protons adjacent to the substituents would be deshielded and show up as a doublet each. But in this case, the substituents are probably not the same. Wait, in our problem, it's a di-substit
