Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't overexpressing in the transgenic mice. The setup is a bit complex, but I'll break it down.

So, the researcher is using a plasmid to overexpress GADD45G in mice. They added a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells with Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance. But the protein isn't showing up as expected.

Looking at the construct's plus strand sequence provided, I need to figure out why it's not working. The options suggest possible issues with the sequence leading to no protein expression.

First, let's look at the beginning of the coding sequence. The start codon is important. The sequence starts with ATG, which is methionineâ€”so that's correct. The next codon is TAC, which is tyrosine. Wait, but the tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus. Oh wait, the HA tag is added before the GADD45G coding sequence. So the first part of the construct should be the HA tag, then GADD45G.

Wait, but the provided sequence starts with ATG TAC... that's the start codon followed by TAC. So the first amino acid is methionine, then tyrosine. But the HA tag (which is a specific peptide from influenza) is probably part of the added sequence. Let me think about the HA tag's sequence. The HA tag is usually 11 amino acids: YPYDHHQQLV. But the DNA sequence would be the coding sequence for that. So the first few codons after ATG should be the HA tag.

Wait, the construct's sequence starts with ATG TAC C C AT A CGA T G... Hmm. Wait, the original GADD45G starts with ATG, so maybe the HA tag is added before that. Oh wait, maybe the problem is that the HA tag isn't correctly included. Because the first codon is TAC, which is tyrosine, but if the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus, maybe the sequence isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is missing. But looking at the provided sequence, the first part after ATG is TAC, which would be Tyrosine. That seems suspicious because the HA tag starts with Y (tyrosine) as its first amino acid. Wait, but the HA tag is YPYDHHQQLV. So the first codon is TAC (Y), second would be P (CC), third Y (TAC again). Wait, let me check the DNA codons. The HA tag would be:

YPYDHHQQLV corresponds to the amino acids Y P Y D H H Q Q L V.

Translating that into DNA:

Y: TAC

P: CCA

Y: TAC

D: GAT

H: CAT

H: CAT

Q: CGA, or maybe CAG? (Wait, Q is Gln, which is CAG or CGA.)

Wait, maybe the initial sequence in the construct has the HA tag. Let me see the start of the provided sequence.

The first part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... Let me break it down into codons:

ATG (M), TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GAT (D
