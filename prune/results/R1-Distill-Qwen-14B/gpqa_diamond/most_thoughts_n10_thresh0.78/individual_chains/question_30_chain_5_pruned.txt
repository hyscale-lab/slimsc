Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the color of light absorbed by a textile dye. Hmm, I remember that when materials absorb certain wavelengths of light, they reflect or transmit others, which is what we perceive as color. But wait, the question is about what color is absorbed, not what is emitted. Oh wait, the dye emits light with a specific energy. So I think I need to figure out the complementary color or something.

The question says the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV. I recall that energy and wavelength are inversely related by the equation E = hc/Î», where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. So higher energy photons have shorter wavelengths, which correspond to colors on the blue end of the spectrum, and lower energy photons are red.

Wait, but wait. The dye emits light, which is its fluorescence or phosphorescence, but the question is about the light it absorbs. Oh right! Because when a substance emits light, it's often because it absorbed a higher energy photon and then re-emits a lower energy one. So the energy of the emitted light (2.3393 eV here) is probably less than the energy it absorbed. So the absorbed light must be higher in energy than 2.3393 eV.

Hmm, but wait another thing: Wait, no. Wait, when a molecule absorbs light, it's usually because the energy of that photon is just right to excite an electron from a lower energy level to a higher one. The emitted light comes from when that electron drops back down. The energy of the emitted photon would be the difference between the two levels. Wait, but sometimes in fluorescence, the emitted photon is lower in energy than the absorbed one. So the absorbed energy is higher than the emitted.

So, if the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed energy must be higher than that. Then, the absorbed wavelength is shorter than the emitted. Because energy and wavelength are inversely related, higher energy means shorter wavelength.

So, what's the energy scale? Let me think
