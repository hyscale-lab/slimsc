Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism, or enantiomerism, occurs when a molecule has a chiral center, meaning it lacks a plane of symmetry and has non-superimposable mirror images. So the question is asking which of these four compounds can exhibit this property.

Let me look at each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl structures can sometimes have chirality if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center. Wait, but biphenyls with substituents in certain positions can lead to atropisomerism. Oh wait, atropisomers are a type of stereoisomer due to hindered rotation around the central bond. But does that make them enantiomers or just diastereomers? Oh, right, atropisomers can be enantiomers if the axis of rotation is a C-C single bond and the substituents are arranged in a way that creates mirror images. So if this compound has two nitro groups on each phenyl ring in the 6 position, and the other substituents are in 2 positions, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry? Hmm, wait, no. If the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the entire structure chiral. So if each ring has two substituents (the nitro groups and the ester groups?), perhaps they're arranged asymmetrically. Alternatively, if the substituents on each phenyl are in such a way that the biphenyl as a whole has a chiral axis, leading to enantiomers. Alternatively, maybe each ring has ester groups in a certain position and nitro in another, making the molecule chiral. But I'm a bit fuzzy on this. So I think this compound might have optical isomerism due to the biphenyl's substituents causing atropisomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH3COOCH2COOCH3? Wait, no. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Let me draw it. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2COOH. Wait, no, wait. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but wait, the correct structure is CH2CH2COOH? No, I'm getting confused. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When esterified, it becomes CH2(OH)CH2COO- with the methyl group. So the ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Does this have a chiral center? Let's see. The central carbon (second carbon) has four different groups: OH, CH2COOCH3, and two CH2 groups? Wait, no. The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate: the acid is propanoic acid with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the ester would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When esterified, it becomes CH2(OH)CH2COO- with an OMe group. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Now, the central carbon (the one with the OH) has what attached? Let's count: attached groups are CH2COOCH3, OH, two CH2 groups? Wait, no, because if it's CH2(OH)CH2
