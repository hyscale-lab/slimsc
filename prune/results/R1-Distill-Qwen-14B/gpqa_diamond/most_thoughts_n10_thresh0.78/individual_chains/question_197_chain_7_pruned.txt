Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying a product formed when compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of nitriles or maybe for other substitutions. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, when you have an alkyne and treat it with red phosphorus and HI, it's called the hydroiodic acid reaction. That's for converting alkynes into alkanes, right? So the reaction is something like an alkyne plus HI and red phosphorus to give an alkane. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

The question gives IR and NMR data for compound X. So I need to figure out what X is first, then determine what it becomes after the reaction. Let's look at the spectral data.

Starting with the IR data: the peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, probably O-H or N-H stretches. Since the problem is about reacting with HI and red phosphorus, which are typically for alkyne reactions, maybe X has a triple bond. Another peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is around the carbonyl region. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or nitrile. 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ are in the aromatic
