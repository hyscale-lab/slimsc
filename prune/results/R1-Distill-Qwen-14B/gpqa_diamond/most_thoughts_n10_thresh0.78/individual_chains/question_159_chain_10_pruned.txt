Okay, so I've got this question about cosmology, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says we're observing a quasar, and in the near-infrared and optical spectrum, there's a peak around 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly at shorter wavelengths. So, the peak is at 790 nm. Hmm, I remember that when we observe objects with redshift, their emitted light gets stretched. So if the peak is at 790 nm now, but maybe it was emitted at a shorter wavelength, that would imply redshift.

Wait, quasars usually have emission lines, like in their spectra. The peak at 790 nm is probably due to some emission line that's been redshifted. Let me think about what emission lines are common. Oh, the Lyman-alpha line is a prominent one for hydrogen, which is about 121 nm in the ultraviolet. If that's what's being observed at 790 nm, that would mean a significant redshift.

So, the rest wavelength is 121 nm, observed at 790 nm. The redshift z would be (observed - rest)/rest. So (790 - 121)/121 = 669/121 ≈ 5.528. So z is about 5.5. Oh wait, but sometimes other emission lines are used. For example, the Balmer series in optical could have rest wavelengths around 400 nm, but if the observed is 790, that's a z of (790-400)/400 = 390/400=0.975. Hmm, but which is more likely for a quasar? Quasars are very luminous and often have high redshifts, so a higher z makes more sense. So I'll go with the Lyman-alpha line, z≈5.5.

Now, the question is about the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth. The options are A)6, B)8, C)9, D)7 Gpc. So I need to calculate the comoving distance for a redshift z=5.5 in the given cosmological model.

The cosmological parameters given are: Hubble constant H0=70 km/s/Mpc, matter density parameter Ω_m=0.3, dark energy density Ω_λ=0.7, and the universe is flat (so Ω_k=0).

Comoving distance is given by the integral from 0 to z of c/(H0 * E(z')) dz', where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_r*(1+z')^4 + Ω_m*(1+z')^3 + Ω_λ*(1+z')^0 + Ω_k*(1+z')^2). Wait, but since Ω_r (radiation) is negligible at high redshifts (z=5.5, which is not that high for modern cosmology, but maybe okay), we can ignore it. So E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z)^3 + Ω_λ + (1 - Ω_m - Ω_λ - Ω_r)*(1+z)^2). But since the universe is flat, Ω_m + Ω_λ =1, so E(z)= sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z)^3 + Ω_λ).

So the integral becomes D_c = (c / H0) * integral from 0 to z of 1 / sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z')^3 + Ω_λ) dz'.

But calculating that integral exactly is tricky without a calculator or a table. Maybe I can approximate it using known values for comoving distances at certain redshifts.

Wait, I remember that for z around 1, the comoving distance is about 2 Gpc with H0=70. For higher z, the distance increases. Let me think about some approximate comoving distances for different redshifts.

For example, I think that for z=0.5, the comoving distance is about 1.5 Gpc. For z=1, about 2 Gpc. At z=2, it's about 3.3 Gpc. z=3: around 4.7 Gpc? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up with something else. Alternatively, I remember that the comoving distance for a given z depends on the expansion history, which in turn depends on Ω_m and Ω_λ.

Wait, another approach: use the approximation formula for comoving distance for flat ΛCDM universe. Some sources give approximate expressions or even lookup tables for certain redshifts.

Alternatively, I can use the approximation that for a flat ΛCDM universe, the comoving distance can be approximated by integrating numerically, but without exact computation, I need to make an educated guess.

Alternatively, I recall that for z=5, the comoving distance is approximately around 10 Gpc, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, maybe that's too high. Let me think: H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc, which is about 2.2e-18 s^-1. The age of the universe is around 13.8 billion years, but I don't know if that's directly helpful here.

Wait, maybe I can use an approximate formula. The comoving distance for a flat universe with matter and dark energy can be calculated using:

D_c = (c / H0) * ∫_0^z [1 / sqrt(Ω_m(1+z')^3 + Ω_λ)] dz'

But without calculating that integral, perhaps I can recall some approximate comoving distances.

Wait, I think that for z=1, the comoving distance is about 2 Gpc, for H0=70. For z=2, it's about 3.3 Gpc. For z=3, about 4.7 Gpc. Wait, but these numbers don't match with what I thought earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, another way: I can compute the integral approximately by dividing it into intervals and using Simpson's rule or trapezoidal rule. But that's time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps using an online calculator or a table.

Wait, perhaps I can find a table of comoving distances for different redshifts. Let me try to recall some values.

At z=0.5: Dc ~ 1.5 Gpc

z=1: ~2 Gpc

z=2: ~3 Gpc

z=3
