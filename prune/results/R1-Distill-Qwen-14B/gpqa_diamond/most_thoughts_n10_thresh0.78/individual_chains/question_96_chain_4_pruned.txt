Okay, so I’ve got this physics problem here about black holes and entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through this.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and the distance is d = 10^10 parsecs. They’re asking for the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole. The options are all around 10^50-something J/K, so the answer is going to be in that ballpark.

Wait, okay, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. Right, the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. Or wait, more precisely, S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G), maybe? Or is it S = (k_B A c^3)/(4 ħ G)? I think that's right. Oh wait, other way around. Because the formula I remember is S = (k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G) multiplied by the area of the event horizon. So the first step is to find the area A.

But wait, the problem gives the angular size θ. So I need to find the radius of the event horizon, then compute the area from that. Oh wait, but how?

Right, the angular size θ is related to the actual size of the object via the formula θ (in radians) ≈ d (distance) / r (radius), when the distance is
