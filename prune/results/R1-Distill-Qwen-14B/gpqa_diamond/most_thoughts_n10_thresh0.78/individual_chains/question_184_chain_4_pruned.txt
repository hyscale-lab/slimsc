Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. That's a mouthful. Let's break it down.

First, I need to understand the structure of the target molecule. The benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, benzene rings are numbered in such a way that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3, but wait, that can't be right because three substituents in a row on a benzene ring might be a tri-substituted benzene.

Wait, no, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the substituents are on positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me visualize it: the benzene ring has ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. So in a way, they're adjacent but not all on the same side.

Now, thinking about the synthesis steps. Benzene is the starting material. We need to introduce ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups in the correct positions. The order of adding substituents is important because of directing effects of the groups.

Nitro groups are meta directors, ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para director, and tert-butyl is a bulky group, which is also a para director because it's an alkyl group (activating, but bulky, so maybe para is favored when possible).

Wait, but when you have multiple substituents, the directing effect depends on which group is more activating. More activating groups are better directors. So, the order in which we add the substituents will influence where the next group goes.

So, the target has three substituents. Let's think about the possible steps:

1. Introduce one substituent first. Let's say we add the tert-butyl group first. But wait, benzene is not very reactive, so probably using a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts doesn't work with bulky groups like tert-butyl because it's hard to form the carbocation. Oh, right, because tert-butyl chloride would form a stable carbocation, so maybe Friedel-Crafts can work. So, reaction with AlCl3 as a catalyst.

Alternatively, maybe nitration first? Nitro is a meta director, which would influence where the next groups go.

Wait, let's think about the target molecule again. Position 1 is ethoxy. Ethoxy is an activating group, which directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para. Position 2 is tert-butyl, which is a strong activating group but bulky. Position 3 is nitro, which is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

Wait, but nitro groups deactivate the ring, making subsequent reactions harder. So nitration should probably happen after the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups are in place. Or wait, no. Wait, the order is tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced first. Because ethoxy is a strong activating group, it would direct the next substitution to ortho or para. Once that's in place, another substitution (like nitration) would be directed by the ethoxy.

Wait, but the target has three substituents. Let me think about the order in which they are added to minimize steric hindrance and maximize reaction efficiency.

Another approach: Let's think about the substituents' directing effects. The ethoxy group is a strong activating, ortho/para director. The nitro group is deactivating, meta director. The tert-butyl is activating, but bulky, so it's a para director (because it's bulky, ortho is difficult due to steric issues).

So, the target has ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. Wait, but benzene is symmetric, so how are these positions arranged? Let me draw a benzene ring:

Positions 1, 2, 3 would form a sort of meta arrangement but with three substituents. Maybe positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent, but that's not possible on a benzene ring. Wait, the numbering would be such that the substituents are at 1, 2, and 3 in a way that each is next to the previous, like 1, 2, 3 being consecutive. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so substituents at 1, 2, and 3 are
