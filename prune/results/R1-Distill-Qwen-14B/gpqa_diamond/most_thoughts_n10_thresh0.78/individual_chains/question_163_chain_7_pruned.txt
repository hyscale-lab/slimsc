Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Then, we're supposed to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed to dissolve it and determine the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D.

Hmm. I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide. Since it's a hydroxide, it's probably a base, so when it dissolves in an acid, they'll react. The reaction between a hydroxide and a strong acid should produce water and the corresponding salt. Iron(III) hydroxide reacting with a strong acid like HCl would form FeCl3 and water.

First, I think I need to write the balanced chemical equation for this reaction. Fe(OH)3 is reacting with HCl, which is a monobasic strong acid. So the reaction should be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3HCl → FeCl3 + 3H2O.

Wait, is that right? Because Fe(OH)3 has three OH groups, so it would need three H+ ions from the acid. So yeah, 3 HCl per Fe(OH)3.

Now, I need to calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3 we have. The mass is 0.1 grams. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 would be Fe (55.85 g/mol) + 3*(O (16) + H (1)).

Calculating that, Fe is about 55.85, each OH is 17 (16+1), so 3*17=51. So total molar mass is 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol, or roughly 9.36e-4 moles.

Wait, let me double-check: 0.1 divided by 106.85. Let me compute that. 106.85 is approximately 107. So 0.1/107 ≈ 0.0009346, so yeah, about 0.000935 moles.

Now, according to the stoichiometry, each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of HCl. So moles of HCl needed = 3 * 0.000935 ≈ 0.002805 moles.

But wait, the acid is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 mol per
