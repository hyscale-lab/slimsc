Okay, so I've got this problem about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I need to find the order of magnitude of its entropy. Let me think about what I remember from my physics classes.

The question gives me the angular size θ of the event horizon, which is 10^-17 degrees, and the distance d is 10^10 parsecs. I remember that the angular size relates to the actual size of the event horizon. Oh, right, the formula for angular size is θ ≈ size / distance, where θ is in radians. So I'll probably need to convert θ from degrees to radians first.

Wait, so first step: convert θ from degrees to radians. I know that 180 degrees is π radians, so 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ in radians is 10^-17 * π/180. Let me calculate that. 10^-17 * π/180 is approximately 1.745e-19 radians. Wait, yeah, because π is about 3.1416, so 3.1416/180 is about 0.01745. Multiply that by 1e-17 gives 1.745e-19 radians.

Now, using θ ≈ size / distance. Here, size is the event horizon radius, which for a black hole is 2GM/c², or more commonly known as the Schwarzschild radius, R_s = 2GM/c². So the size is R_s = 2GM/c². But wait, in the angular formula, the size is the diameter, or is it the radius? Wait, the formula θ = size / distance uses the actual size. So if the size is the Schwarzschild radius, that would be R_s. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

No, wait. The angular size θ is given by θ = R_s / d, where R_s is the Schwarzschild radius. Because the event horizon's radius is R_s, so the size of the event horizon is R_s. So θ = R_s / d. So R_s = θ * d.

So R_s = θ * d. Wait, but I have to make sure the units are consistent. θ is in radians, and d is in parsecs, but I think I need to convert
