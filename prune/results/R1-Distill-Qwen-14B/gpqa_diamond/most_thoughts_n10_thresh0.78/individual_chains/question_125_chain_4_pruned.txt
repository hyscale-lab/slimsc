Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that this is the potential for a 3D harmonic oscillator. The problem is asking for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the same energy eigenvalue.

Hmm, I think I should start by recalling the energy levels for a 3D harmonic oscillator. I remember that in three dimensions, the energy levels depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each dimension. Oh wait, right! The energy levels are quantized and given by E = ħω(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). Alternatively, since in 3D, the state is often denoted by the total quantum number N = n_x + n_y + n_z. So E can be written as E = ħω (N + 3/2).

Wait, let me think again. Oh, yes, another way to write the energy is E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the three quantum numbers. So n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So each n corresponds to a different energy level, and the degeneracy (number of eigenfunctions) depends on the number of ways to write n as the sum of three non-negative integers.

Now, the problem is about the third excited state. Wait, what's the ground state and how do excited states work here? The ground state is the state with the lowest energy, which would be the state where all quantum numbers are zero: n_x = n_y = n_z = 0. So n = 0, and E = (0 + 3/2) ħω = (3/2) ħω.

The first excited state would be the next higher energy level. That would correspond to n=1. Because n=1, so E = (1 + 3/2) ħω = (5/2) ħω. The second excited state is n=2, E=(7/2) ħω. Third excited state is n=3, E=(9/2) ħω. So that gives me the energy part.

Wait, but how do the quantum numbers translate? So for the third excited state, n=3. Because ground state is n=0, first is n=1, second n=2, third n=3. So E=(3 + 3/2) ħω? Wait, no, because E is (n + 3/2) ħω. Oh right, so n=3 gives E=(3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. So the energy is 9/2 ħω. Looking at the options, options A and C have this energy.

Now, the second part is about the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for the same energy. That's the degeneracy. So for each n, how many ways can n be expressed as the
