Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question involves a series of reactions starting from trans-cinnamaldehyde. There are three steps, and I need to find out how many carbon atoms are in the final product, product 3.

First, I'll break down each reaction step by step.

**Step 1: trans-cinnamaldehyde treated with methylmagnesium bromide, forming product 1.**

Hmm, I remember that Grignard reagents like methylmagnesium bromide add to carbonyl groups. Cinnamaldehyde has a carbonyl group (aldehyde). The structure of trans-cinnamaldehyde is an aldehyde with a benzene ring attached via a double bond. Specifically, it's (E)-3-phenylpropenal. So the structure is Ph-CH2-CHO, but wait, no, wait. Trans-cinnamaldehyde is actually Ph-CH2-CHO? Or is it Ph-CH2-CHO? Wait, no, I think it's Ph-CH=CH-CHO? No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde. Its structure is benzaldehyde with a propenal chain. So, it's Ph-CH2-CHO. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, cinnamaldehyde is actually Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, no, I think it's Ph-CH₂-CHO, but wait, wait, the correct structure is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me draw it.

Wait, cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde with a CH₂-CH₂ group? No, that's not right. Wait, no, cinnamaldehyde is actually (E)-3-phenylpropenal. So, the structure is Ph-CH₂-CHO with a double bond? Wait, no, wait. No, cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CHO, but that's not correct. Let me think again. Oh wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-
