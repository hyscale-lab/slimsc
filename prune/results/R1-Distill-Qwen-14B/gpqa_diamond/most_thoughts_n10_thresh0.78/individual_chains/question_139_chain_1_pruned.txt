Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that two compounds, A and B, when treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water, produce different diketones. I need to determine which starting materials A and B are from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that sodium nitrite and hydrochloric acid are often used in certain reactions, like maybe the formation of diazonium salts. Wait, but wait, that's more for aromatic amines, right? Oh wait, no, waitâ€”another thought comes to mind. Oh right! The Stephen reduction? Or wait, maybe it's the HNO2 reaction with alcohols. Oh wait, I think when you treat an alcohol with nitrous acid (which can be formed from NaNO2 and HCl), it can lead to the formation of a carbocation or maybe some kind of elimination or rearrangement. Alternatively, I might be mixing this up with something else. Another thing I remember: the reaction of hydroxylamine with ketones, but that's not it here.

Wait, maybe it's about the oxidation of alcohols. Oh, wait! I think that when a secondary alcohol is treated with nitrous acid under acidic conditions, it can form a nitroso intermediate, which then might undergo some kind of elimination or rearrangement. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact process. Alternatively, maybe it's about the formation of a carbonyl group from an alcohol. Oh! I think I've heard about the oxidation of alcohols using HNO2. Let me recall: secondary alcohols can be oxidized to ketones using certain oxidizing agents. But under what conditions? Wait, I think that when secondary alcohols react with nitrous acid (HNO2), especially under acidic conditions, they can form nitro compounds or perhaps undergo some kind of elimination.

Wait, another approach: the products are diketones. So, each starting material A and B, when treated with those reagents, gives a diketone. So the reaction must convert some functional group in A or B into a ketone. How?

Oh! Oh, wait a second. I think I remember that when a geminal diol (like a 1,2-diol) is treated with nit
