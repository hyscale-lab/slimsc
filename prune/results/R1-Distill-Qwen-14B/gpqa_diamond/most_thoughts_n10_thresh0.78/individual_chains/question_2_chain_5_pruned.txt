Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. But let's take it step by step. The question is about a series of reactions starting with trans-cinnamaldehyde and going through several steps to form product 3. We need to find out how many carbon atoms are in product 3.

Alright, let's break it down step by step. The first step is treating trans-cinnamaldehyde with methylmagnesium bromide. I remember that Grignard reagents like methyl magnesium bromide react with aldehydes. So trans-cinnamaldehyde has a structure with an aldehyde group and a benzene ring connected by a double bond. The structure is something like Ph-CH2-CHO, but wait, no. Wait, trans-cinnamaldehyde is actually Ph-CH2-CHO? No, wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH2-CHO, but wait, no. Wait, I think cinnamaldehyde is benzaldehyde with a propene group. Oh right, it's Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, wait. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde with a propene chain. So the structure is Ph-CH2-CHO? No, wait. Wait, the structure of cinnamaldehyde is actually benzaldehyde with a vinyl group. So, it's Ph-CH2-CHO? No, wait again. Wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH=CH-CHO? No, wait, I think I'm mixing up things.

Wait, cinnamaldehyde has the structure where the aldehyde is attached to a benzene ring via a double bond. So, the structure is Ph-CH2-CHO? No, that would be benzaldehyde with an ethyl group. Oh wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is benzaldehyde with a vinyl group. So, the structure is actually Ph-CH2-CH₂-CHO? No, that's wrong. Wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde where the aldehyde group is attached to a vinyl group, which is connected to a benzene ring. So, the structure is Ph-CH₂-CHO? No, wait. Let me think.
