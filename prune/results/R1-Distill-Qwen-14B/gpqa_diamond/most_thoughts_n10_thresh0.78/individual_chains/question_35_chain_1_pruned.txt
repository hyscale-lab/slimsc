Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slowly.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator Ay is given as a 2x2 matrix, which is equal to c multiplied by S. Here, c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So, I think I need to write out the matrix Ay first.

Wait, wait. So, Ay = c * S. Given that, each element of S is multiplied by c. So S looks like:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

So when multiplied by c = h/(4π), Ay becomes:

Ay = [ [0, -i*(h/(4π))],
        [i*(h/(4π)), 0 ] ]

Hmm, that's the operator matrix. Now, the question is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. But before that, the options are about statements that would be correct during this calculation.

The problem gives four options, A to D. I need to figure out which statement is correct.

Let's think about the eigenvalue equation: Ay * φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenvector.

Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

Let me write down the matrix Ay - a I:

[ (-a)      (-i c)     ]
[ (i c)     (-a)      ]

Wait, no. The diagonal elements would be (0 - a) and (0 -a). So, the matrix is:

[ -a       (-i c)       ]
[ i c      -a          ]

Then the determinant is ( (-a)(-a) ) - ( (-i c)(i c) )

Calculating that, determinant = a² - [ ( -i c )( i c ) ]

Wait, (-i c) multiplied by (i c) is (-i)(i) c². Since i*(-i) is 1 because i^2 is -1. Wait, let me compute that:

(-i c) * (i c) = (-i)(i) c² = ( -i^2 ) c² = (-(-1)) c² = (1) c² = c².

So the determinant is a² - c². Setting this equal to zero for eigenvalues: a² - c² = 0 → a² = c² → a = ±c.

So the eigenvalues are a = c and a = -c. Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, which ones match this.

Option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±2πh, and real parts ±h/(4π). Wait, but the eigenvalues a are real numbers, right? Because the matrix Ay is Hermitian? Let me check if
