Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR and calibration curves. I'm a bit rusty on my PCR, but let me try to think this through.

The scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He did three technical replicates for each serially diluted sample. The efficiency is 100%, which means each cycle doubles the target DNA perfectly. The R² is 1, so the data fits perfectly to the curve. The slope is -3.3.

Looking at the data, each dilution step is a tenfold decrease. Let me list out the concentrations and their Ct values.

100000 copies: 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The average is around 34.2.
10000: 30.6 to 31.2, average about 30.9.
1000: 27.3 to 27.9, average ~27.6.
100: 24 to 24.6, average around 24.3.
10: 20.7 to 21.3, average about 21.0.

Wait, so each tenfold dilution should decrease the Ct by a certain amount. Since efficiency is 100%, the formula is something like Ct = Ct0 - (log10(conc) * slope). Or wait, because each tenfold dilution reduces the amount by 10x, and with 100% efficiency, each dilution should lower the Ct by 1 cycle, because each cycle doubles the DNA. So, a 10x dilution would require an additional 3.3 cycles? Or wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the formula for qPCR quantification is usually Ct = Ct0 - (log10(N) * slope), where N is the starting copies. Wait, but the slope is in the equation. Let's think: in a perfect scenario, a 10-fold dilution should cause a decrease in Ct of 1 cycle because each cycle doubles the DNA. Since the efficiency is 100%, each cycle doubles the DNA.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the PCR cycle threshold (Ct). The Ct is the cycle number where the fluorescence crosses a threshold. With more starting copies, you reach that threshold earlier, so lower Ct.

If the efficiency is 100%, then each cycle doubles the DNA. So, if you have 10x fewer copies, you need log2(10) ≈ 3.32 cycles more to reach the same amount. So, each 10-fold dilution should increase Ct by about 3.3 cycles.

Looking at the data, from 10^5 to 10^4, Ct went from ~34.2 to ~30.9. The difference is about 3.3. That matches. Similarly, from 10^4 to 10^3: 30.9 to 27.6, difference 3.3. Then 27.6 to 24.3 is 3.3. 24.3 to 21.0 is 3.3. So each tenfold dilution increases Ct by 3.3 cycles, which is exactly what the slope is. Because the slope is negative, it's -3.3, so it's in line with the data.

Wait, but the question is about the discrepancies in his results. The options are about what explains the discrepancies.

Looking at the options:

Option A: qPCR can't quantify nucleic acids. No, that's not right because he's using it for quantification and it's working with R²=1.

Option B: Ct values not in agreement with target. No, because in this case, they are perfectly in line with the expected values.

Option C: Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, from 10^5 to 10^4, the Ct increases by 3.3, which is exactly expected. So this option is saying that tenfold dilution corresponds to more than 3.3 cycles, but in reality, it's exactly 3.3. So I'm not sure if this is about the data or the option is trying to say something else. Or maybe the option is suggesting that a tenfold dilution would cause a change larger than 3.3 cycles, which is correct because the slope is -3.3. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Option D: Deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates. Looking at the data, the triplicates have deviations of about 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, and 0.3. So the deviations are within 0.3. So option D would say that the deviation is more than 0.3? Wait, but in this data, it's exactly 0.3 each time. So no, the deviation isn't more than that.

Wait, the question is about the discrepancies in his results. So what's the issue here? The data seems to fit perfectly, but the question is about why the discrepancies (differences) exist.

Wait, perhaps the question is pointing out that the Ct differences are as expected, which is 3.3 per 10 fold. So the data is consistent, but perhaps one of the options is pointing that out.

Looking back at the options. Option C says, "Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles." Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because a ten-fold dilution would cause a change of 3.32 cycles. So if the slope is -3.3, that's consistent. So the ten-fold dilution is about 3.3 cycles, which matches the slope. So the statement in option C is incorrect because it's not more than 3.3; it's exactly that.

Hmm, perhaps the option is about the number of cycles needed. Wait, maybe the question is suggesting that the Ct values don't match expectations, but in reality, they do. So the answer is that the ten-fold dilution is exactly 3.3 cycles, so all the data fits, so there's no discrepancy. But the options are looking for an explanation for the discrepancies, so perhaps the question is about the observed Ct values having a certain discrepancy, but I don't see any.

Wait, maybe the question is pointing out that the researcher's data shows a perfect fit, but the options are about possible issues. Wait, but the question says that the R² is 1, so the data is perfect, so why are there discrepancies? Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is pointing out that the Ct values are not consistent with the actual copy numbers. But no, the data shows that each tenfold dilution causes a Ct increase of 3.3, which is exactly what's expected. So the Ct values are in agreement.

Looking again at the options, perhaps the correct answer is C, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Another angle: The slope is -3.3. Each tenfold dilution (log10(10) =
