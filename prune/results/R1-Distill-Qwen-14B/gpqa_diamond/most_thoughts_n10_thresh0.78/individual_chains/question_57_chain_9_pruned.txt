Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons, and I'm supposed to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The problem gives me phase shifts δ0=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, and δ4=13°. They also mention that I should ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond these. The electrons are 50 MeV, and it's an elastic scattering experiment.

I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using partial waves. The general formula involves the sum over l of (2l+1) * [something involving the phase shifts and spherical harmonics]. But wait, the question is specifically about the imaginary part along the incident direction. Oh right, along the incident direction corresponds to θ=0 degrees, so the forward direction.

Wait, the scattering amplitude in the forward direction (θ=0) should have a specific form. I think the expression is something like f(0) = 1/(k) * sum over l of (2l+1) * e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l. Or wait, maybe it's more precise to say that the imaginary part is related to the sum of the phase shifts multiplied by some factors.

Wait, I recall that the total scattering cross-section is given by the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude. And the formula for the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/(k)) * sum over l (2l+1) * sin δ_l. But wait, no, that's the expression for the cross-section, but the question is about the imaginary part of f itself, not the cross-section.

Wait, the scattering amplitude f is a complex quantity. For elastic scattering, f can be written as f = sum_{l} (2l+1) [ e^{i δ_l} ( sin δ_l ) ] * (something else?), but I'm not entirely sure. Oh wait, no, the partial wave expansion is f(θ, φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+
