Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my spin states, but I'll try to think through it.

The question says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, I think that notation represents a two-component spinor. So the spin state vector is a column vector with the first component 3i and the second component 4. Oh right, because in quantum mechanics, spin states are often represented as two-component vectors since the electron is a spin-1/2 particle.

The expectation value of S_y is what we're after. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is given by the bra-ket notation: <ψ|Ô|ψ>, where Ô is the operator. But wait, I'm not too confident about the exact form of the operator for spin in the y-direction.

Oh right, the Pauli matrices! The spin operators are given by S_x = (ħ/2) σ_x, S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y, and S_z = (ħ/2) σ_z. So for this problem, we need S_y, which would be (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli y-matrix.

What's the Pauli y-matrix look like? I think it's [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me write that down:

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

So the operator S_y would be (ħ/2) times this matrix. So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y.

The expectation value <S_y> would then be ψ† S_y ψ, where ψ is the spinor. Let's write out the components. Oh wait, ψ is given as (3i, 4). So ψ is a column vector:

ψ = [3i; 4]

Wait, no, in Dirac notation, ψ is a column vector, and ψ† is the row vector with the complex conjugate of each component. So ψ† would be [ -3 (because (3i)* is -3i? Wait, wait. Let me think: the complex conjugate of 3i is -3i, but if it's a row vector, I think each component is just the conjugate. So
