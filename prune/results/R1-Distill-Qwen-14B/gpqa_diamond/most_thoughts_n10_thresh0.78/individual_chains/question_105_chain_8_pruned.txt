Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through carefully. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about a star similar to the Sun, with some dark spots on one hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K. The spots are covering 20% of that hemisphere, and they're cooler by 1000K. The setup is that these spots cause the star to vary in brightness as it rotates, and this looks similar to the light curve changes caused by an exoplanet. The question is, if we didn't have these spots, what size exoplanet would cause the same brightness variation?

Hmm, okay. So when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light. The amount of blocked light depends on the area of the planet relative to the star. The change in brightness is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. But wait, in this case, the star itself has spots, which might be causing a dip in brightness when they're facing us. So the effect of the spots is similar to a planet blocking the star's light, but the calculation is a bit different.

Wait, no. The problem is saying that the star's brightness variation due to the spots can be mistaken for an exoplanet. So they want to find out the exoplanet's radius that would produce the same brightness change as the spots do. So in other words, the amplitude of the light curve (the change in brightness) is the same whether it's due to the planet or the spots. So we need to model both scenarios and set them equal.

First, let me think about the star with spots. When the star rotates, the hemisphere with spots comes into view. The effective temperature of the star is 6000 K, but the spots are 1000 K cooler, so their temperature is 5000 K.

The brightness variation caused by the spots would depend on the difference in their flux compared to the rest of the star.

Wait, when the star rotates, the spots move in and out of view. So when spots are on the near side, the observed flux is lower because the spots
