Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm. I remember from my electromagnetism classes that oscillating charges can radiate energy, and the radiation has certain patterns depending on the setup.

The problem says the charge distribution is spheroid-shaped with the symmetry along the z-axis. So it's symmetric around the z-axis. That probably affects the radiation pattern. When charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic waves. The radiation zone is where the fields behave like plane waves, and the power radiated per unit solid angle depends on the angle theta from the z-axis.

The question is asking about two things: the fraction of the maximum power A that's radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and the possible form of the function f, which is the power per unit solid angle as a function of lambda and theta.

I think the key here is understanding the radiation pattern for a dipole antenna. Wait, or is this a dipole? Well, a spheroid distribution might be approximated as an oscillating dipole when considering radiation. Dipole radiation patterns are well-known. The power radiated in a particular direction depends on the angle theta from the dipole's axis.

The radiation pattern for a dipole is given by the formula for the power per unit solid angle, which I believe is proportional to (sin^2 theta)/(something with the wavelength). Or wait, the power pattern for a dipole is typically (sin^2 theta) in the far field, but I'm not exactly sure about the dependencies on lambda.

Wait, but the problem says the function f depends on lambda and theta. So f = f(lambda, theta). So I need to find how f behaves with lambda and what fraction is at 30 degrees.

Wait, another thought: The total power radiated is the integral of the power per unit solid angle over all solid angles. The maximum power A is the maximum value of this function f.

Alternatively, for a dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field is given by the formula for the electric field, which is proportional to (sin theta) / r (lambda is involved somehow). The power per unit solid angle (intensity) would depend on the square of the electric field. So for a dipole, the intensity pattern is proportional to sin^2 theta.

Wait, but I'm mixing up the exact dependencies. Let me think. The power radiated
