Okay, let's see. I've got this chemistry problem here. So, the question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid. Hmm, I remember that when you add an acid to a hydroxide, they react to produce a salt and water. Right, Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, and the acid is monobasic and strong, so probably something like HCl or HNO3.

The problem states: We need to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Then, find the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed and the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D.

First, I think I should calculate how much Fe(OH)3 we have. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3... Let me think. Iron is about 55.85 g/mol, oxygen is 16, hydrogen is 1. So, Fe(OH)3 is Fe + 3(OH). Wait, actually, Fe(OH)3 is Fe(OH)3, which is Fe^3+ and OH^-3. The formula is Fe(OH)3, so the molar mass would be 55.85 (Fe) + 3*(16 + 1) for each OH group. Wait, each OH is 17 g/mol, so 3*17 is 51. So total molar mass is 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So the moles of Fe(OH)3 in 0.1 grams is mass divided by molar mass. 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me double-check that calculation. 0.1 divided by 106.85... Let's see, 106.85 is approximately 107, so 0.1/107 ≈ 0.0009346. So about 9.35e-4 moles.

Now, when Fe(OH)3 reacts with a strong acid, it'll produce Fe^3+ ions and water. The reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O. So for each mole of Fe(OH)3, we need 3 moles of H+ ions. Since the acid is monobasic, each mole of acid provides one mole of H+. So the moles of H+ needed are 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3.

Moles of H+ needed = 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 mol.

The acid solution is 0.1 M, so M = moles/volume (in liters). Rearranged, volume = moles / M. So volume in liters is 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. But wait, the question is asking for the minimum volume of acid needed. So that's 28.08 cm³. Looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04. Option B is 30.09, which is a bit higher. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I missed something. Oh wait, the total volume is 100 cm³, so could there be a dilution effect? Or does that affect the H+ concentration after adding the acid?

Wait, no. The reaction is stoichiometric. The
