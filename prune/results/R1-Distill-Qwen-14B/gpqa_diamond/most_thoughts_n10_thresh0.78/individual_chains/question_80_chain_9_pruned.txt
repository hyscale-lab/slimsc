Okay, I've got this question about an algorithm that converts DNA sequences into numbers. Let me think about how to approach this. So, the examples given are AGG -> 115 and TGCTGA -> 176. I need to find out what ACAGTGACC gives.

Hmm, I remember that DNA is made up of four nucleotides: A, T, C, G. So each letter in the input string corresponds to one of these. But how does it convert to a number? Let's see the examples.

First example: AGG is 115. Let me break down AGG into A, G, G. Each position might have a value. Maybe each nucleotide is assigned a number. Let's list them:

A, T, C, G. Maybe A is 1, T is 2, C is 3, G is 4? Or perhaps another order. Wait, let me think about the first example.

AGG is 115. Let's see, if each nucleotide contributes a digit, but that's not right because 115 is a three-digit number. AGG has three letters, so maybe each letter is converted into a number, and those numbers are concatenated. Let's test this.

If A is 1, G is 2, then AGG would be 1,2,2 → 122? But the output is 115. So that doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe each letter is converted into a single digit, but perhaps in a different way.

Wait, maybe each letter has a value that's a digit, but perhaps it's based on their positions in the alphabet. A is 1, T is 20, C is 3, G is 7. Wait, that would make AGG → A (1), G (7), G (7) → 177, but the output is 115. So that's not matching.

Another approach: Perhaps each nucleotide is converted to a numerical value, and then the sum is taken. Let's try that.

In the first example, AGG. If A is 1, G is 7 (since A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4? No, wait that would make G=4. Wait, maybe the values are A=1, T=0, C=2, G=3. Let
