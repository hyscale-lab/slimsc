Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. The question gives me six different benzene derivatives and asks me to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield.

Wait, I remember that in electrophilic substitution, the directing effect of the substituents on the benzene ring determines where the incoming electrophile attacks. The substituents can be activating or deactivating, and they can direct the incoming group to ortho, meta, or para positions.

So each of these substituents will influence where the bromine adds. The para-isomer's yield depends on how favorable the para position is for substitution.

Let me list the substituents and think about their directing effects.

1) C6H5-CH3: This is toluene. The methyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So the incoming Br will go to ortho or para positions. Since the substituent is bulky, maybe para is favored? Or does it depend on steric factors?

Wait, for toluene (methyl benzene), the substituent is activating. So the ring is more reactive. The substituent is an electron donor, so the ortho and para positions are activated. Since the methyl is a bulky group, steric hindrance might make para more favorable than ortho. So para is a major product, perhaps the major isomer.

2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: That's ethyl benzoate. The substituent is a carbonyl group attached to an ester. Wait, the carbonyl is part of a carbonyl group, which is a strong deactivating (electron-withdrawing) group. So it's meta-directing. So the Br would add in meta positions. But wait, the carbonyl group is in the substituent, so the substituent is at the para position of the ring. Or does the substituent itself direct?

Wait, the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to the benzene. So for benzoate esters, the COOEt group is deactivating (because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing), so it's a meta director. So when bromine adds, the Br would go meta to the substituent. So in the product, the Br would be in the meta position relative to the ester group.

But wait, the substituent is in the para position of the benzene ring? Or is it a substituent on the benzene that's a COOEt group? Oh, right, the structure is benzene ring with a COOEt group. So the substituent is in the position where the benzene is attached to COOEt. So the substituent is at the ortho, meta, para positions relative to the incoming Br.

Wait, but the substituent is a strong deactivating meta-directing group. So the incoming Br will go to the meta position relative to the substituent. Wait, but the substituent is already a substituent on the benzene, so the Br will add in the meta position relative to CO
