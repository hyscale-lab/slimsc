Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about the Cope rearrangement, which I remember is a pericyclic reaction. From what I've learned, the Cope rearrangement involves 1,5-dienes. These molecules rearrange when heated or exposed to light. The reaction forms a new diene structure, which can be really useful for creating complex molecules.

Looking at the problem, there are two parts: reaction A and reaction B. I need to figure out the major products for each.

Starting with reaction A:

The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let's try to draw that structure. So it's a benzene ring with a substituent. The substituent is an oxygen attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group.

Wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl would be a four-carbon chain. The double bond is between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2CH2-CH(CH3)-, but wait, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2? No, wait, 1-yl means the substituent is at position 1. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but that can't be right. Maybe it's CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-? Wait, no. Let's think again.

But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but with a substituent. Oh wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-. Because but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but if it's 3-methyl, the methyl is on the third carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-. So the substituent is OCH2CH2CH(CH3)CH2? No, wait, the starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene.

So the benzene has an OCH2 group attached, and that OCH2 is connected to the 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. So the structure is benzene-O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, wait. The but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2=CHCH2-CH2 but wait, the but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but since it's 3-methyl, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-. So the full substituent is OCH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Hmm, I might be getting this a bit wrong. Let me try drawing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is OCH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait the 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. So the substituent is OCH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, maybe OCH2-(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2? I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe the structure is OCH2-C(CH2CH2CH(CH3))? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is OCH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, but the but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2, but since it's 3-methyl, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-. So the substituent is OCH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Or perhaps it's OCH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-.

Wait, the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy methyl benzene. So the substituent is OCH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, but but-2-en-1-yl is four carbons, with the double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but with a methyl on C3. So it's CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-. So the substituent is OCH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-. Wait, but that's three carbons, not four. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OCH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3). No, that doesn't fit. Wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl would be four carbons in total. So the substituent is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2. So the substituent is OCH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait. The but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2=CH
