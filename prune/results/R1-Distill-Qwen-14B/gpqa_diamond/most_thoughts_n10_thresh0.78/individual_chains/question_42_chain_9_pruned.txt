Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, I need to figure out by what factor Planet3's orbital period is larger than Planet1's. Let me try to break this down.

The question gives a few ratios. The equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 are about 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 2.3. Also, the mass ratios are 1.15 between Planet1 and Planet2, and 1.35 between Planet2 and Planet3. All have the same albedo as Earth, which is 0.3. But wait, albedo affects the equilibrium temperature, right? Oh wait, but since all have the same albedo, maybe it cancels out in the ratios.

So, I remember the equilibrium temperature formula. The equilibrium temperature (Te) of a planet is given by:

Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) / (1 + e) )^(1/2)

But wait, since all planets are in circular orbits, e is zero. So the formula simplifies. Also, if they're around the same star, T_star and R_star are the same for all. So the formula becomes:

Te ∝ sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - A)^(1/2)

But since albedo A is the same for all, (1 - A) is a constant. So the ratio of temperatures only depends on the semi-major axis a.

So, the temperature ratio between two planets is Te1/Te2 = sqrt(a2/a1). Because when a planet is farther away, it's colder, so if Te1 is higher, a1 must be smaller.

Wait, let me get that right. If a planet is further out (larger a), it should be colder, so Te would be lower. So if Planet1 is hotter than Planet2, then a1 is smaller than a2.

But wait, according to the given ratios, Te1/Te2 ≈ 1.4. So Te1 is larger than Te2. So a1 must be smaller than a2, meaning Planet1 is closer in.

Similarly, Te2/Te3 = 2.3. So Te2 is hotter than Te3, meaning a2 is smaller than a3. So Planet3 is the farthest
