Okay, so I've got this question about vector fields and volume integrals. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism class that divergence and Gauss's law are involved here. Let me try to break it down.

The problem says the vector field f(r) falls off as 1/r² and has only a radial component. So in spherical coordinates, the field would be something like f(r) = (some constant) * r̂ / r². Right, because r̂ is the radial unit vector, and r is the magnitude.

Wait, the field's magnitude is 1/r², but it's a vector, so the entire vector would be f(r) = (1/r²) r̂. Because it's only radial, no other components like theta or phi. That makes sense.

The question is asking about the volume integral of the divergence of f inside a sphere of radius R. So I need to compute ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV over the volume of the sphere.

I remember that Gauss's law relates the divergence of a vector field to the flux through a surface. Oh right, Gauss's law states that the integral of the divergence of E over a volume is equal to the flux of E through the surface enclosing that volume. Mathematically, ∫∫∫ (∇ · E) dV = ∫∫ E · dA.

But wait, in this case, our vector field is f(r), not E. So applying the same principle, the volume integral of the divergence of f is equal to the flux of f through the surface of the sphere.

So I can compute either the volume integral or the surface integral. Maybe computing the surface integral is easier here.

Let's think about the surface integral. The flux is the integral of f · dA over the sphere. Since f is radial, and dA on the sphere is also radial outward, the dot product will just be f multiplied by the area element.

So f(r) on the surface of the sphere (radius R) is (1/R²) r̂. And dA on the sphere is R² sinθ dθ dφ in spherical coordinates. So f · dA = (1/R²) * R² sinθ dθ dφ = sinθ dθ dφ.

Wait, that's because r̂ · r̂ is 1, so f · dA becomes (1/R²) * (R²) sinθ dθ dφ. Oh, right, because dA is R² sinθ d
