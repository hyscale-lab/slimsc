Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, right? Divergences are those infinities that pop up in calculations, which are unphysical, so you need to handle them somehow.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics.

Let me think about each option. 

Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a quantum field theory. I know that in QED, you calculate things like the electron self-energy or photon vacuum polarization, and these calculations often lead to divergent integrals. So regularization is necessary there. But wait, isn't QED renormalizable? Oh right, because it's renormalizable, you can absorb the infinities into counterterms, but you still need to regularize those divergences before doing the renormalization.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to QED but with SU(3) symmetry. QCD does have asymptotic freedom, meaning that at high energies (or equivalently, short distances), the coupling becomes weak. But because it's a non-abelian theory, it might have different kinds of divergences. Wait, does QCD require regularization? I think it does, especially when dealing with loop diagrams and things like the beta function. So regularization is needed here too.

Now, Superstring Theory. Strings are different because they're not point particles. I remember that string theories (like Type I, IIA, IIB, etc.) are quantum theories of gravity candidates. One of the nice things about string theory is that it doesn't have the same kind of divergences as in QFT. Wait, but I thought that string theory still requires regularization in some contexts, like when dealing with certain perturbative expansions or when handling tachyonic instabilities. Oh wait, but maybe in the full theory, the divergences are absent because of the underlying structure of strings. Or perhaps because it's a background-dependent theory, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe in the perturbative expansion (like in the form of Feynman diagrams
