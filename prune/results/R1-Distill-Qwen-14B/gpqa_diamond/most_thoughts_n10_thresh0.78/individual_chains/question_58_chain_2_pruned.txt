Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I need to figure out which theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. Hmm, let me start by recalling what regularization means. From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like infinities that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math work by introducing a cutoff or some other method to handle these infinities so that the results are finite.

The question gives four options: Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and Classical Electrodynamics. I need to think about each of these theories and whether they require regularization when dealing with high energies.

Starting with option A, Superstring Theory. Wait, string theory is a theory of everything that tries to reconcile quantum mechanics with general relativity. I think string theories are supposed to be finite, meaning they don't have the same kinds of divergences that other quantum field theories have. Because strings are extended objects, maybe the divergences cancel out when you calculate loop diagrams. So I think string theories don't require the same level of regularization since they're inherently finite. But I'm not 100% sure, so I'll keep that in mind.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics. QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, dealing with quarks and gluons. I remember that QCD has something called asymptotic freedom, where the force between quarks becomes weaker at high energies (or short distances). But wait, does QCD require regularization? I think like most quantum field theories, QCD calculations can lead to divergences, especially when you have loops. So you might need regularization and renormalization techniques to handle those infinities. So B probably does require regularization.

Option C, Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism, electrons, and photons. I'm pretty sure QED does require regularization. The famous case is the calculation of the electron's charge, which leads to infinite self-energy. Without regularization, the charge would be infinite, so you need methods like introducing a cutoff or using dimensional regularization to make sense of the calculations. So C requires regularization.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, classical theories don't involve quantum mechanics. So in classical ED, you don't have
