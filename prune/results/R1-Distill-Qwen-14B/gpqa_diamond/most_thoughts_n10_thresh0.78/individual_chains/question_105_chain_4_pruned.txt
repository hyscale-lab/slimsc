Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the setup is about a star similar to the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because the star is rotating, these spots will come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. The question is comparing this to the effect of an exoplanet passing in front of the star (transit method), and we need to find what exoplanet radius would produce the same brightness change.

Wait, the question says that the star isn't covered by spots, but they're asking what exoplanet radius would produce the same amplitude in the light curve. Wait, maybe it's the other way around. Hmm, no, the problem states that in the scenario without spots, the exoplanet's signal would match the observed variations.

I think the approach is to calculate the change in brightness due to the spots and compare that to the change caused by a planet transit.

First, let me think about the star spots. The star's brightness is affected because the spots are cooler. So when the spots are facing us, the star appears dimmer. Similarly, when a planet transits the star, it blocks some light, causing the star to appear dimmer.

The key is to find the relative brightness change (the amplitude of the light curve) in both cases and set them equal, then solve for the planet radius.

Let me break it down.

1. **Flux from the Star Without Spots:**
The star's total flux is based on its effective temperature and radius. The formula for flux (F) is σTeff^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So F_star = σ*(6000)^4.

2. **Flux from the Spots:**
The spots are T_spot = 6000K - 1000K = 5000K. So F_spot = σ*(5000)^4.

3. **Fraction of Star Covered by Spots:**
The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. Wait, what's a hemisphere? So the star is a sphere, and one hemisphere (half of it) is covered with spots. But the spots themselves only cover 20% of that hemisphere. So the total area of the spots relative to the star's surface is (0.5) * 0.2 = 0.1, or 10% of the star's surface.

So the fraction of the star covered by spots is 0.1.

Wait, no, wait. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered. So if the hemisphere is half the star's surface, and 20% of that is covered by spots, then the total area covered is 0.2 * 0
