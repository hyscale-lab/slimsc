Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let's read it carefully and break it down step by step.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog. I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, let me try to identify each component.

First, the reaction between X and Y. Violent reaction suggests something like a strong acid or base reacting with a metal. Wait, metal reacting with acid usually produces hydrogen gas. But gas W has same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. For example, H2 (but that's 1 proton and 0 neutrons, not same). Another is CO2, but that's 12 (C) and 16 (O). Wait, the molecule's neutrons and protons are the same. Let's think of something like CH4? No, that's 6 protons and 6 neutrons (CH4: C has 6 p, 8 n; H each has 1 p and 0 n. So total for CH4 is 12 p and 8 n. Not same. Hmm. Wait, what about H2O? No, H2O has 2 H (each 1p, 0n) and O (8p, 8n). So total p:10, n:8. Not same. Maybe O2? No, O has 8p and 8n each, so O2 has 16 p and 16 n. Ah! So O2's molecule has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That fits. So W is O2.

Wait, but does a reaction of X with Y produce O2? That's a bit unusual. Alternatively, maybe CO? No, because CO has 12 p and 14 n. Hmm. Wait, wait, maybe it's another gas. Let me think. What about something like NH3? No, 14 p and 17 n. Not same. What about N2? N has 7 p and 7 n. So N2 would have 14 p and 14 n. So W could be N2. But then the reaction producing N2 would require specific conditions.

Wait, but when metals react with strong acids, they typically produce hydrogen gas. So maybe W is H2? But H2 has 2 p and 0 n. Not same.

Wait, perhaps the gas is something else. Let me think again. Another possibility is that W is CO2. Let's see: CO2 has 12 p (6 from C, 16 from O, but wait, CO2 is one C and two O's. So each O has 8p, 8n. C has 6p, 6n. So total protons:6 + 16 =22. Neutrons:6 + 16=22. Oh! So CO2's molecule has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. That would fit. So W could be CO2. But wait, how would the reaction produce CO2? Let's think about reactions that produce CO2. Maybe if X is a carbonate reacting with an acid, but the reaction was violent. Alternatively, if X is a metal and Y is a strong acid, but that produces H2. Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track here.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is something like CH4? No, as I thought earlier. Alternatively, maybe it's a noble gas, but noble gases are monoatomic. So, for example, Argon has 18 p and 22 n, which doesn't fit. So that's not it.

Wait, another approach: the reaction of a metal with an acid produces H2. But if the metal is in a higher oxidation state, maybe it reacts with water or acid to produce something else. Alternatively, perhaps X is a peroxide, reacting to release O2.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. What substances have a melting point near that? Water is 273 K (0 C), so 277 is a bit higher. Maybe something like B is a solid with a melting point around there. Alternatively, maybe B is a different compound. Wait, but 277 K is around 4 C, so maybe it's a solid that's just above freezing.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a gas? No, because it's the product of heating a precipitate.

Wait, perhaps G is a carbonate, which upon heating decomposes into a metal oxide and CO2. But then B would be CO2, but that's a gas. Hmm, but the problem says B is a product when G is heated; perhaps G is something else.

Alternatively, let's think about the precipitate. When a metal reacts with a liquid (maybe a solution), the precipitate could be a metal hydroxide. For example, if X is an alkali metal and Y is water, but that's not likely because alkali metals react violently with water, producing H2. But if Y is another solution, perhaps a salt solution.

Wait, but let's get back to the gas W. Suppose W is CO2. Then the reaction between X and Y must produce CO2. So perhaps X is a carbonate reacting with an acid. But that would produce CO2 and the corresponding salt. But the reaction is between X (a solid?) and Y (liquid). So maybe Y is an acid.

Wait, but the reaction is with Y (liquid), which could be an acid. So if X is a carbonate, then reacting with acid would produce CO2, water, and the acid's salt. But in that case, the precipitate G would be the salt. Then when G is heated, perhaps it decomposes, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe W is something else. Let me think of another approach. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. Keto acids have a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group. For example, acetoacetic acid is a keto acid. When it reacts with X, the product has two O atoms. Hmm, perhaps X is a base that deprotonates the acid, but that would add O from the acid. Alternatively, maybe X is a reagent that adds to the keto group.

Wait, the problem says the product has two O atoms. Wait, but the keto acid itself has multiple O's. So perhaps the reaction adds or removes O's. Hmm, maybe X is a reducing agent. For example, LiAlH4 is a strong reducing agent used in organic chemistry. Wait, LiAlH4 is a reagent. It's used to reduce carbonyl groups. So if X is LiAlH4, what would happen?

Wait, LiAlH4 reacts with carbonyl groups in keto acids, like converting ketones to secondary alcohols. So the product would have an additional O. Hmm, but the problem says the product contains 2 O atoms. Maybe the reaction is something else.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal. Let's say X is sodium. Sodium reacts with water (maybe Y is water) to produce H2 (gas), NaOH, and heat. So precipitate G could be NaOH, but NaOH is a strong base and would be a solution, not a precipitate. Unless Y is a salt solution that precipitates the hydroxide. For example, if Y is a copper sulfate solution, then Na would react violently, producing H2, and the precipitate would be Na2SO4. But Na2SO4 is soluble, so that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe Y is a solution of a metal nitrate. For example, if Y is copper nitrate, and X is sodium, the reaction would produce NaNO3, which is soluble, but maybe some precipitate forms. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is magnesium (Mg). Mg reacts with water (if it's H2O) in a violent way, producing Mg(OH)2 and H2 gas. Mg(OH)2 is a precipitate. Then when heated, Mg(OH)2 would decompose into MgO and H2O. The melting point of MgO is around 2800°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that's not matching.

Wait, but the melting point of B is near 277 K. 277 K is about 4°C. So what solid has a melting point around that temperature? Maybe something like water ice, but water's melting point is 0°C (273 K). So 277 K is 4°C, which is just above 0. Alternatively, perhaps B is a solid with a slightly higher melting point, like something that's a soft solid or a low-melting point metal.

Alternatively, maybe B is a form of carbon, like graphite or diamond. Graphite's melting point is around 3600°C, so that's way higher. Diamond is even higher. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps B is a different compound. Let's think about what has a melting point near 277 K (4°C). Maybe something like a soft metal like mercury, but mercury's melting point is about -38°C. No, that's not it. Alternatively, maybe it's a salt like ammonium nitrate, which has a melting point around 170°C. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a solid oxide. Wait, if X is sodium, and Y is water, the reaction produces NaOH and H2. NaOH is a strong base. But if the precipitate G is NaOH, that's not a precipitate because NaOH is soluble. So that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe Y is not water. Let's think again. The reaction between X and Y releases O2. So for O2 to be produced, maybe X is an oxide. Alternatively, perhaps X is a peroxide, like Na2O2. When Na2O2 reacts with water, it produces O2. Let's see:

Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + O2↑

So gas W
