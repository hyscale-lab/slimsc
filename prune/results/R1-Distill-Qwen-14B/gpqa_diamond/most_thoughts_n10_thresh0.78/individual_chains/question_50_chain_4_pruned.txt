Okay, so I need to figure out how many loops this Feynman diagram has based on the given expression. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum field theory, but let's think it through.

From what I remember, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is related to the superficial degree of divergence and also to the structure of the terms in the calculation, like the integrals and the factors that come with them. Each loop usually contributes a factor that comes from integrating over a momentum, which often introduces factors of integrals like ∫d^4k/(2π)^4 or something similar.

Wait, the term given is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4π)^6 * (Q/M)^2. Let's break this down.

Alpha (α) is the fine-structure constant, which is a dimensionless quantity. Similarly, g is usually a coupling constant, also dimensionless. The sqrt(2) and 8 are just numerical factors. The (1/(4π)^6) part stands out because 4π often comes from integrating in spherical coordinates in loop integrals. Each loop integral might bring a 1/(4π)^something factor.

Wait, in loop integrals, each loop typically contributes a factor of 1/(4π)^n where n depends on the number of loops. For example, a one-loop diagram would have an integral like ∫d^4k/(4π)^4, so the denominator would be (4π)^4. But wait, sometimes it's (2π)^4 as well, depending on the convention. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think about the general structure.

Each loop integral usually comes with a (2π)^4 denominator because when you switch to momentum space, each integral over d^4k is divided by (2π)^4. But in some regularization schemes, like dimensional regularization, the factors might be a bit different. But in this problem, it's about four-dimensional spacetime, so it's probably using a cutoff or another method.

Wait, but wait, the term in the expression is (1/(4π)^6). So 4π to the 6th power. Let me count the factors from each term. So 1/(4π)^6. Let me see, each loop would
