Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to how much light a planet absorbs and how much it emits. But wait, the planets are in orbital resonance and have periods in a certain ratio. Oh right, the TTV method is used to detect them, but I think that's not directly relevant to the temperature calculation.

The question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both have the same albedo, which means the same fraction of light is reflected. Since they have the same albedo, the difference in temperature must come from their distances from the star.

I recall the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)), where T_star is the star's temperature, R is its radius, and 'a' is the planet's orbital distance. Wait, or was it T = T_star * (R/(2a))^(1/2)? Yeah, that sounds right. Because the planet absorbs light from the star's surface, which spreads out over its cross-sectional area (like a disk), and then the planet emits as a blackbody from its entire surface area.

So the key is to find the ratio of the distances of Planet_4 and Planet_2 from the star. Once I have that ratio, I can compute the temperature ratio.

The orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has period P1, Planet_2 P2=2*P1, Planet_3 P3=2.5*P1, Planet_4 P4=3.5*P1, and Planet_5 P5=5*P1.

But wait, Kepler's third law says that (a^3)/(P^2) is constant for planets around the same star. So a is proportional to P^(2/3). So the ratio of a for Planet_4 to Planet_2 would be (P4/P2)^(2/3).

Let me compute P4/P2. P4 is 3.5 P1, P2 is 2 P1. So P4/P2 = (3.5)/(2) = 1.75.

So the ratio a4/a2 = (1.75)^(2/3). Let me calculate that. Hmm, 1.75 is the same as 7/4.

Wait, 1.75 is 7/4, which is approximately 1.75. So raising that to the power of 2/3. Let me think about it.

I know that 2^(2/3) is about 1.5874, because 2^(1/3) is about 1.26, squared is ~1.587. What about 1.75^(2/3)? Let's think about logarithms or maybe find an approximate value.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute (3.5/2)^(2/3) as (7/4)^(2/3) = (7^(2/3)) / (4^(2/3)).

Wait, 7^(2/3) is approximately... Let's see. Cube root of 7 is about 1.913. Squared is roughly 3.66. And 4^(2/3) is cube root of 4 squared. Cube root of 4 is about 1.587, squared is approximately 2.5198.

So 3.66 divided by 2.5198 is approximately 1.453. So a4/a2 is roughly 1.453.

Wait, but wait, I thought the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)). So T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So the temperature ratio T4/T2 would be sqrt(a2/a4).

Because T scales as 1/sqrt
