Okay, so I've got this question about black holes and entropy. Hmm, I remember that entropy of a black hole is related to its area. Oh right, the formula is something like S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. But wait, I think it simplifies to a multiple of the area in Planck units. So maybe S ≈ (A / (4 l_p^2)) * k_B, where l_p is the Planck length.

Wait, the question gives me the angular size of the event horizon. Oh right, angular size θ is related to the actual size (diameter, maybe) and the distance to the object. The formula I think is θ (in radians) ≈ diameter / distance. But since the angle here is in degrees and very small, maybe I can approximate it. Let's see.

The distance d is 1e10 parsecs. Oh wait, I should convert that into meters because the standard units for physics formulas are in SI units. I remember that 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 pc = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

The angular size θ is 1e-17 degrees. Let me convert that to radians because the small angle approximation (θ ≈ opposite/adjacent) works better in radians. So 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ_rad = 1e-17 * (π/180) ≈ (1e-17) * 1.745e-3 ≈ 1.745e-20 radians.

Assuming that the angular size is roughly the diameter of the event horizon divided by the distance. So θ ≈ (2R) / d, where R is the radius of the event horizon. So solving for R: R ≈ θ * d / 2.

Wait, let me plug in the numbers. θ_rad is about 1.745e-20, d is 3.086e26 m. So R ≈ (1.745e-20) * (3.086e26) / 2. Let me compute that. Multiply 1.745e-20 by 3.086e26: 1.745 *3.086 ≈ 5.367, and exponents are 1e6 (since 1e-20 *1e26=1e6). So 5.367e6. Then divide by 2: about 2.6835e6 meters. So R is roughly 2.68e6 meters.

Wait, but the Schwarzschild radius R_s is given by 2 G M / c^2. So the radius of the event horizon is R_s = 2 G M / c^2. So once I have R, I can find the mass of the black hole.

Alternatively, since I have the radius R, the area A is 4 π R². Then the entropy S is approximately (A / (4 l_p^2)) * (k_B), but maybe I can just compute A first.

Let me compute A = 4 π R². R is 2.68e6 m, so R squared is (2.68e6)^2 = approx 7.18e12 m². Multiply by 4 π: 4 *3.1416 *7.18e12 ≈ 12.566 *7.18e12 ≈ 9.0e13 m². So A is about 9e13 m².

Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because if R is 2.68e6 meters, then R squared is (2.68e6)^2 = (2.68)^2 *1e12 = 7.18 *1e12 m², yeah. So 4 pi R² is 4 *3.14 *7.18e12 ≈ 89.9e12 = 8.99e13 m². So A is about 9e13 m².

Now, the Planck area is l_p squared. l_p is sqrt( (G ħ)/(c^3) ). The Planck length is approximately 1.6e-35 meters. So l_p squared is (1.6e-35)^2 = 2.56e-70 m².

So the entropy S is (A/(4 l_p^2)) * k_B. Let me compute A/(4 l_p^2). Wait, no, the formula I remember is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) ). Wait, but maybe it's more accurate to write it as S = (A)/(4 l_p^2) ) * (k_B), but I'm not so sure. Let me think again.

The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) * (1/(4π)) )? No, wait, the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G) ) (1/(4π k_B)) )? Hmm, maybe I should just look it up again. Oh wait, I can't, but I think the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) * (1/(4 π)) )? Or perhaps it's S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) ) * (1/(something)).

Wait, maybe I should just calculate it correctly. Another approach: The formula for entropy S is (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) ) times (some constant factor). Alternatively, since the Schwarzschild radius R_s = 2 G M / c^2, and the area A = 4 π R_s² = 16 π G² M² / c^4.

So S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) ) = (16 π G² M² / c^4) * c^3 / (4 ħ G k_B) ) = (16 π G² M² c^3) / (4 ħ G c^4 k_B) ) = (4 π G M²) / ( ħ c k_B ) ).

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I'll just compute using A.

So A is 9e13 m². Then, l_p² is 2.56e-70 m². So A/(4 l_p²) = (9e13) / (4 * 2.56e-70) ) = (9e13) / (1.024e-69) ) ≈ (9 /1.024 )e(13 +69 ) → approximately 8.79e81.

Wait, 13 - (-69) = 82? Wait, 1e13 / 1e-69 is 1e82. So 9e13 / 2.56e-70 is about (9/2.56)e83? Wait, wait, 9e13 / 2.56e-70 = 9/(2.56) * 1e(13 +70) )= approx 3.516 * 1e83. Then divide by 4? No, wait the initial formula is A/(4 l_p^2), so 9e13/(4 * 2.56e-70) )= (9e13)/(1.024e-69) )= approx 8.79e82.

But then, the entropy is (A/(4 l_p^2)) * k_B. Wait, no, let me get the right formula. The correct formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B). So maybe I should compute that.

Alternatively, using A = 4 pi R^2. R is 2.68e6 m. So A is 4 * pi * (2.68e6)^2. Let me compute that again.

(2.68e6)^2 = 7.18e12 m². 4 pi * 7.18e12 ≈ 4 *3.1416 *7.18e12 ≈ 89.9e12 = 8.99e13 m². So A = 8.99e13 m².

Now, the formula S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B). Let me compute each part.

I need the constants:

c = 3e8 m/s.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

G = 6.67430e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

k_B = 1.380649e-23 J/K.

So putting it all together:

S = (8.99e13 m²) * (3e8 m/s)^3 / (4 * 1.0545718e-34 J·s * 6.6743e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² * 1.380649e-23 J/K )

Wait, let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: A c^3 = 8.99e13 * (3e8)^3 = 8.99e13 * 27e24 = 8.99 *27e(13+24) )= 242.73e37 = 2.4273e39.

Denominator: 4 * ħ * G * k_B = 4 *1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 *1.380649e-23.

Compute that:

First, 1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 = (1.05457 *6.6743)e-45 ≈ 7.027e-45.

Then multiply by 1.380649e-23: 7.027e-45 *1.3806e-23 ≈ 9.68e-68.

Multiply by 4: 4 *9.68e-68 ≈ 3.87e-67.

So denominator is 3.87e-67.

So S = 2.4273e39 / 3.87e-67 = (2.4273 /3.87 )e(39 +67) ) = approx 0.627e106 = 6.27e105 J/K.

Wait, that's a gigantic number, but the options are all around 1e59 to 1e66. Wait, did I make a mistake in the exponent somewhere?

Let me check the exponents again.

In the numerator:

A = 8.99e13 m².

c^3 = (3e8)^3 = 27e24 = 2.7e25.

Wait, wait, 3e8 cubed: (3^3) =27, 1e8^3=1e24. So 27e
