Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think this through step by step.

The question is about finding the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a certain point r due to a charge q that's moving along some trajectory s(t). The time is such that t is greater than tr, where tr is the time when the field was generated. So, the charge is moving, and we're looking at the potentials at a later time.

I remember that when dealing with moving charges, the fields aren't just static anymore. Oh right, there's this concept of retarded potentials. Retarded because the fields at a point depend on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time. So, the fields (and potentials) aren't instantaneous; they're based on where the charge was and how it was moving a little while ago.

Wait, the scalar potential V for a charge at rest would be straightforward, like Coulomb's law: V = q/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, things get more complicated. Oh, but wait, the scalar potential might still be similar, but I'm not sure. Or does it change because of the motion?

Wait, I think the scalar potential for a moving charge is still given by the same formula as the static case but evaluated at the retarded position. Because the scalar potential is kind of like the electrostatic potential, but retarded. So, V(r, t) would be q/(4πε₀ r'), where r' is the distance from r to the charge's position at tr. But wait, in the problem, they've given 'd' as the vector from the field generating point (tr) to r. So, d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. So, r = d + position of charge at tr. Wait, no, I think d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r. So, the distance is d's magnitude. So, the scalar potential would be V = q/(4πε₀ |d|) multiplied by some factor involving the time delay.

Wait, but when considering the motion, I think the scalar potential actually isn
