Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So the question is about Maxwell's equations in a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both poles; you can't isolate them. That's why, like, if you break a magnet, you just get two smaller magnets, each with their own poles.

Maxwell's equations are four fundamental laws of electromagnetism. Let me recall them. The four equations are:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: The divergence of E equals rho over epsilon zero.
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: The divergence of B is zero.
3. Faraday's Law of Induction: The curl of E is equal to the negative rate of change of B.
4. Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition: The curl of H equals the current plus the displacement current.

So in our universe, the second equation, Gauss's Law for magnetism, says that divergence of B is zero. That makes sense because there's no isolated magnetic monopoles—so the 'magnetic charge' density rho_m would be zero. But in this parallel universe, they do have isolated poles, so rho_m wouldn't be zero. So the second equation must change.

Wait, but the question is about which of Maxwell's equations are different. So if in their universe, magnetic monopoles exist, that affects the equations. Let's think about each equation.

The first equation (Gauss's Law for E) is about electric fields and electric charge. Since we're dealing with magnetic poles, I don't think that equation changes. So equation 1 stays the same.

Equation 2 is Gauss's Law for magnetism. In our world, it's div B = 0. If there are isolated magnetic monopoles, then this equation should change to div B = rho_m, where rho_m is the magnetic charge density. So equation 2 is definitely different.

What about Faraday's Law (equation 3) and Ampère's Law (equation 4)? In our world, Faraday's Law says that the curl of E is -dB/dt. If magnetic monopoles exist, would that change? Wait, Faraday's Law deals with how changing magnetic fields produce electric fields. Hmm, I'm not sure if the existence of monopoles directly affects that. Maybe not. Or wait, perhaps the form would change if there's a magnetic current as well. Oh, Maxwell's equations also include the concept of magnetic current, but in our case, those terms are zero.

Wait, in the standard equations, the time derivative of B is involved in Faraday's Law. If in this universe, they have magnetic monopoles, maybe the equation for Faraday's Law would include a term related to the magnetic current density. Or wait, no, Faraday's Law in our universe doesn't have a source term because B's divergence is zero. But with monopoles, the divergence would not be zero, so Faraday's Law might change.

Wait, maybe I should think about the forms. Let me think about the structure. The four equations are:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0
2. div B = 0 (in our universe)
3. curl E = - dB/dt (Faraday)
4. curl H = J + epsilon_0 dE/dt (Ampère with Maxwell's term)

If the universe allows magnetic monopoles, then equation 2 becomes div B = rho_m (some magnetic charge density).

What about equation 3? In our case, equation 3 is the curl of E equals the negative time derivative of B. If there's a magnetic current, maybe there's another term. Wait, I remember that in some modified Maxwell's equations with magnetic monopoles, Faraday's Law gains a term involving the magnetic current. Let me think—since in the presence of magnetic current, the equation might be curl E = -dB/dt - J_m (or something like that).

Alternatively, perhaps not. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think differently. Maxwell's equations in the presence of magnetic monopoles would have two additional terms. The modified equations would be:

Gauss's Law for magnetism: div B = rho_m.
Faraday's Law (curl E) would have an additional term involving the magnetic current J_m. So equation 3 would be curl E = - dB/dt - J_m.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe the Ampère's Law would change. Because Ampère's Law relates to the curl of H and the current, including displacement current. But if there's a magnetic current, perhaps Ampère's Law is modified as well.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the symmetrization of Maxwell's equations. In the presence of magnetic monopoles, the equations become symmetric. So, not only does div B = rho_m, but also curl E would have a term involving J_m (the magnetic current). So, equation 3 would change.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see. The question is about which specific equations are different.

Option A: Only the divergence of B equation. So, if equation 2 is different, that's option A.

Option B: The ones related to the circulation of E (which is curl E, Faraday's equation) and divergence of B. So if both equation 2 and 3 are different, then option B is correct.

Wait, but in
