Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about naming a benzene ring with multiple substituents. Hmm, I remember that IUPAC nomenclature can get tricky, especially with benzene rings because of their symmetry and the need to assign the lowest possible numbers.

Let me read the question again. The benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to one another. So, that means each of these groups is separated by one carbon. Like, if one is in position 1, the others are in 3 and 5. Wait, no, meta is three positions apart in a six-membered ring, so maybe each is one position apart? Wait, no, meta is when substituents are on positions 1, 3, and 5 for a benzene ring. So all three are each meta to each other. So their positions are 1, 3, 5 on the ring.

Wait, no. If all three are meta to one another, then each is in a position that's two carbons away from the others. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: in a benzene ring, substituents can be ortho, meta, or para. So, if two substituents are meta, they are separated by two carbon atoms. But when three substituents are all meta to each other, I'm a bit confused. Wait, maybe they're arranged such that each is meta to the others. So for three substituents, perhaps each is in a position that's two away from the others. Let's imagine the ring as positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

If substituent A is at position 1, substituent B is meta to A, so at position 3, and substituent C is meta to both A and B. So from A at 1, C would be at position 5 (because 1 and 5 are meta). And from B at 3, C is at position 5 (since 3 and 5 are meta). So yeah, substituents at 1,3,5.

So the carboxylic acid (COOH), carbaldehyde (CHO), and cyano (CN) groups are all at positions 1,3,5. But which is which? The question says that the carboxylic acid is at a particular position, and the others are relative to it.

Wait, the question also says: Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. Hmm, so the COOH is at position, say, 2. Then, ortho to 2 are positions 1 and 3. Wait, no. Wait, the numbering starts with the functional group of highest priority as position 1. Wait, in benzoic acid derivatives, the carboxylic acid is the principal functional group, so the ring is numbered
