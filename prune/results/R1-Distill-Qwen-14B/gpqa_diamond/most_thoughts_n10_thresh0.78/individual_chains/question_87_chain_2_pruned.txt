Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms in total. Oh wait, the ring is 6-membered, like benzene, but it's di-substituted, so two substituents attached. And there are 8 carbon atoms in total. Hmm, so the benzene ring has 6 carbons, and each substituent must add to the count. Let me think: 6 (ring) + substituents = 8. So substituents account for 2 carbons. But if there are two substituents, each could be a single carbon, like two methyl groups, but then that's 2 carbons. Or maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other has none, but since it's di-substituted, both have substituents.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, di-substituted means two substituents on the ring. So the ring has 6 carbons. Each substituent is attached to the ring, so each substituent is a group that's attached. So the total carbons in substituents would be their own carbons. So if the substituents are, say, two -CH3 groups, that's 2 carbons. So 6 + 2 =8. That makes sense. So substituents are two CH3 groups. But wait, the question says "8 carbon atoms in total". So the molecule has 8 carbons. So the ring has 6, substituents add 2, so each substituent is a single carbon, like methyl groups.

But wait, the FTIR shows a carbonyl group. Oh, right, a carbonyl (C=O) is present. So maybe one of the substituents is a carbonyl group. But wait, a carbony
