Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics question about EMS mutagenesis and how it affects a gene responsible for an anti-nutritional compound in barley. The goal is to eliminate the compound, which probably means we need the gene to not be functional anymore. So, I need to find the mutation that disrupts the gene's function.

First, let me understand the setup. The intact gene's DNA sequence is given. The gene has five exons and four introns. The mutants are created using EMS, which is ethyl methanesulfonate. EMS typically causes point mutations, usually transitions (like A to T or G to C) because it adds an ethyl group that mispairs during replication, leading to base changes.

Looking at the sequences, the changes are at the beginning of the first exon. Exons are the coding regions, so any mutation here could affect the protein product. The question is which mutation would disrupt the gene's function.

Let me look at each mutant:

Mutant 1: The sequence changes from TTCT to TCTA... Wait, the first part of the gene is 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1 is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So comparing, the first part where it changes: the wild type is TTTCTCGC, and mutant 1 is TTCTACGC. Wait, maybe I should break it down more precisely. Let me look at the exact positions.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a frameshift or a nonsense mutation. Because a frameshift would change all downstream amino acids, which could lead to a nonfunctional protein. But wait, EMS usually causes point mutations, so probably no frameshifts here. But maybe a nonsense mutation (a stop codon) which would terminate translation early.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: Compares the wild type.

Wild: ATG TTT CGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA... 

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT A GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAACAT... 

Wait, perhaps I should compare the sequences more carefully. Let's write the wild type and each mutant's first parts to spot changes.

Wild type: 5'-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3'

Mutant 1: 5'-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3'

So, the wild type starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ... 

Wait, looking at the beginning:

Wild type: positions 1-20: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT
