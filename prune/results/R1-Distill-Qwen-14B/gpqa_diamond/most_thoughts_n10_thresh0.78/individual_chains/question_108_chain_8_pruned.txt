Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about paramagnetic coupling and the hydrogen atom's transition energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think it through.

The question says the magnetic field B is parallel to Oz and is 1 Tesla. It also mentions small values of m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. Wait, m is the magnetic quantum number, right? So for each orbital, m can be -l, ..., 0, ..., +l. But if m is small, maybe we're considering states where m is close to zero, like the s states (l=0) or maybe p states (l=1). But s states have l=0, so m can only be zero. For p, m can be -1, 0, +1.

The problem is asking to compare the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom, which has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. Wait, 0.4861 micrometers is in the visible range, I think. That's about the wavelength for the Balmer series, maybe the H-alpha line? Oh right, the Balmer series is transitions to n=2, and H-alpha is n=3 to n=2, which has a wavelength around 656 nm. Wait, no, 0.486 micrometers is about 486 nm, which would be the H-beta line, n=4 to n=2. So the energy difference ΔE is the energy of that photon.

So I need to compute both the paramagnetic term and the transition energy ΔE and see which is bigger.

First, let's recall the paramagnetic term. The energy for a magnetic dipole in a magnetic field is given by the Zeeman effect. The Hamiltonian for the Zeeman effect is H = -μ·B. The magnetic dipole moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B m, where g is the Landé g-factor, and μ_B is the Bohr magneton.

Wait, but paramagnetic coupling... Oh, wait, maybe here the paramagnetic term is the perturbation due to the magnetic field. So the paramagnetic term would be the Zeeman term, which is H_para = μ_B B m, but I need to get the exact expression right.

Wait, the Zeeman term is H = -μ·B. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -g μ_B m, right? Or is it the other way around? Let me think. The orbital magnetic dipole moment is μ = (eħ)/(2m_e) * (L/(ħ)) ), so μ is proportional to L. But the quantum number m is associated with L_z, the z-component of angular momentum. So in terms of quantum numbers, μ_z = μ_B m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton.

Wait, the Bohr magneton is μ_B = (e ħ)/(2 m_e) ≈ 9.274×10^-24 J
