Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that both these instruments are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations, including star studies.

The question gives me some information about each star, like their RA, DEC, magnitudes, distances, and in some cases, extinction (E(B-V)). I think the key here is to figure out the apparent V magnitude for each star because that's what determines whether they can be observed by the spectrographs.

Wait, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17, and HIRES can observe up to 16. So a star needs to have an apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES. Oh wait, no, wait. The question says "brighter than 17" for ESPRESSO, which means magnitude less than 17. Similarly, for HIRES, brighter than 16, so magnitude less than 16. Because lower magnitude numbers mean brighter objects.

So each star must have apparent V magnitude <=17 (for ESPRESSO) and <=16 (for HIRES) to be detectable by both. So any star that's brighter than (apparent V mag <=17) for ESPRESSO and <=16 for HIRES would be detectable by both.

But wait, let me recheck: The problem states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So, that's apparent V <=17. Because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So if a star's apparent magnitude is 17, it's at the limit. Similarly, HIRES can see stars brighter than 16, so apparent V <=16. So the star must satisfy both: V <=16 for HIRES and V <=17 for ESPRESSO. So any star with V <=16 will be acceptable by both, but some with V between 16 and 17 might only be seen by ESPRESSO. But wait, the question is which stars can be detected with
