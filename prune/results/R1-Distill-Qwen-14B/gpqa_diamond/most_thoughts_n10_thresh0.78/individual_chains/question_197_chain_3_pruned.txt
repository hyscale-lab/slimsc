Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A to D, all seem to be substituted benzoic acids or isomers with substituents attached.

First, let me look at the IR data. The peaks are in the ranges 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region usually indicating O-H or N-H stretches. But more relevant here might be the 1720 cm-1, which is a strong peak, probably a carbonyl group. Maybe a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid. Wait, the 3400–2500 region could be an O-H stretch, which would suggest a carboxylic acid. But if it's a carbonyl, then maybe it's an ester or a ketone. The other IR peaks: 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those are around the aromatic C=C stretching regions. So, the compound probably has an aromatic ring.

Now the NMR data. Let's break it down.

The 1H NMR shows several signals:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm is likely an -OH proton, which would fit with a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde proton, but that's usually around 9-10 and maybe a triplet or something else. Since it's broad, I'm more leaning towards a carboxylic acid.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Two protons as a doublet. That suggests aromatic protons, maybe para-substituted. Like para-substituted benzene, where each proton is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group. For example, in benzoic acid, the protons ortho and para to the COOH group are deshielded.

7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, likely the other two aromatic protons. So, if the first doublet at 8.0 is two protons, their neighboring protons at 7.2 would be in a doublet as well. So that fits a para-substituted benzene ring, where the substituent is at the para position. So, in benzoic acid, we have two protons adjacent to the COOH group (ortho), and two across (para). Wait no, wait: for a para-substituted benzene, the substituent is in one position, and the protons on either side would be ortho and para to that group. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. If the substituent is at position 1, then the protons at 2 and 6 are ortho, and 3 and 5 are meta, and 4 is para. Wait, no, if it's a substituent in position 1, then the substituent is at position 1, and the protons at 2, 4, 6 are adjacent. Wait, maybe my numbering is off. Alternatively, in a para-substituted benzene, the substituents are at opposite positions. So for example, in 4-methylbenzoic acid, the ring has a COOH group at position 1 and a methyl at position 4. Then the protons ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded and appear upfield? Wait, no. Wait, the COOH group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, so the ortho protons would be deshielded, meaning they appear downfield. So in benzoic acid, the two protons ortho to the COOH group are at higher ppm than the para ones.

Wait, looking at the NMR data: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). So that suggests that the two protons are split into two doublets. Which would happen if the substituent is para to each other. For example, if the substituent is at position 4, and the ring substituent is in position 1, but maybe not. Wait, perhaps it's a substituent in position 4. Let me think of a para-substituted benzene with another substituent in the para position. Wait, no, maybe the substituent is at position 4, and the COOH is at position 1. Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-(something)benzoic acid. So the substituent is in the para position relative to the COOH group.

Then the other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

Looking at these, the 0.9 triplet (3H) is likely a methyl group attached to a CH2, like a CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, a triplet with 3H would be a methyl group attached to a CH2 that's next to another CH2. Or perhaps a CH2-CH(CH3)-something. Alternatively, thinking about a butyl group. Let me think about the substituent.

The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is probably a methyl group attached to something else. For example, maybe a CH(CH3) group, where the CH is split into a doublet because of coupling with another CH2 group.

The 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) could be two protons adjacent to a CH group. So perhaps a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group.

Putting that together, perhaps the substituent is a isobutyl group. Wait, wait: the substituent would be a group attached to the benzene ring. Let me think about the possible structure.

If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, that would be a four-carbon chain with branching. A sec-butyl is (CH2)2CHCH2- but no, wait. Wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-? No, wait. Let me get the structure right. A butyl group has four carbons. The sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-? Wait no, maybe it's -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-? No, wait, maybe I'm confusing substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group. An isobutyl group is -(CH2)2CH(CH3), but attached via the CH2CH2 group. Wait, perhaps it's CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the benzene. Alternatively, considering the splitting in the NMR.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) could be a CH group attached to two other groups. So perhaps that's a CH connected to a CH2 and a methyl.

Wait, let me think about the integration. The signals are for 1H, 2H, etc.

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, which in turn is perhaps part of a branching.

Putting it all together, maybe the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but let's go back to the starting materials. The starting compound is X, which reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus with HI is a reagent used for the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. Wait, no, wait: Clemmensen uses HCl and red phosphorus, but maybe it's similar. Alternatively, sometimes HI with red phosphorus is used for other reductions, like for esters or amides. Wait, wait: I think Clemmensen is for ketones to alkanes, and the reduction uses HCl and red phosphorus. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, wait, another possibility is that the starting material is a benzoic acid derivative, and when treated with H-I and red phosphorus, it undergoes some kind of elimination or substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is an ester, and the reaction is a hydrolysis. But wait, the reagents given are red phosphorus and HI, which isn't a typical condition for hydrolysis. Maybe it's a substitution reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a deprotection. Let me think about the possible structure.

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad around 2500-3400, which is present. But a carboxylic acid would also have a peak around 1700 cm-1, which is what's here. So perhaps X is a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, the NMR shows a singlet at 10.5 ppm, which would fit a carboxylic acid proton. So X is a benzoic acid with substituents.

Looking at the options, options A and C are benzoic acids. Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Wait, so when the problem states that compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what's the possible product?

Wait, Clemmensen reduction uses HCl and red phosphorus to reduce ketones to alkanes. So if X is a ketone, then after reduction, it would form an alkane. But in this case, the starting compound X has a carbonyl, which could be from an ester, an acid, a ketone, or
