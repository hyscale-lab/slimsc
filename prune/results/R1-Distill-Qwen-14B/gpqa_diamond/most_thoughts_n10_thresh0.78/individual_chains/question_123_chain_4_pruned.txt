Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and some ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, I remember that in physics, when you're dealing with different reference frames, you might need to consider things like velocity and time dilation, especially if it's a high-speed scenario. But let me think through this step by step.

The question says that the ejecta and the galaxy are both inertial frames. So they're not accelerating, which is good because that might complicate things. The important detail is that from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, but in reality, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at that speed, right? Because if the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at the same speed. Or am I mixing things up here?

Wait, no, in relativity, velocities don't just add up like that in different frames. Because of the way reference frames work, especially when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. Oh wait, but 60,000 km/s is way beyond the speed of light. Wait, the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 km/s is 0.2 times the speed of light, which is still a high speed, but under c. So maybe I don't need to worry about relativistic effects like time dilation here? Or do I?

Wait, the problem gives time as 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. So I need to find out how much distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame during this time. But wait, the time is measured in the ejecta's frame, so perhaps we need to find the corresponding time in the galaxy's frame, which might not be the same due to time dilation.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the basics. Let's define the frames. Let's say the galaxy's frame is S, and the ejecta's frame is S'. In S', the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s. So in S (the galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at 60,000 km/s.

But
