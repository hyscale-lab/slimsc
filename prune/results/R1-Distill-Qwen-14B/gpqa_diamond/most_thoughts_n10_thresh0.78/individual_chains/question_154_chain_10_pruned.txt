Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying an unknown white solid from spectral data. The chemist has some mass spectrometry, IR, and 1H NMR data. The options are four different compounds, and I need to figure out which one fits the data.

First, let's look at the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 (100%) and there's another peak at m/z 158 (32%). Hmm, the molecular ion is the highest peak, so the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol. The 158 peak suggests something with a higher massâ€”maybe a fragment or an isotope? Wait, chlorine has a significant natural abundance isotope at 35Cl (about 75%) and 37Cl (about 25%). So if the molecular formula includes chlorine, the molecular ion might split into M and M+2 peaks.

Wait, molecular weight is 156. Let's think about the options.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let's calculate its molecular formula. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Adding a Cl (35.5) and an OH (17), but wait, wait, 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde would have the formula C7H5ClO2. Let me calculate the molecular weight: C=12*7=84, H=5=5, Cl=35.5, O=16*2=32. So total is 84 +5 +35.5 +32=156.5. Oh, wait, but the molecular weight given is 156. Hmm, maybe rounding? Or perhaps I made a miscalculation. Alternatively, maybe it's C7H6ClO2? Let me see: 7*12=84, 6=6, 35.5, 32. 84+6=90, +35.5=125.5, +32=157.5. Hmm, that's not matching. Wait, maybe I should check the options' molecular weights.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl attached to the benzene ring at the para position, and a carboxylic acid group. Molecular formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let's calculate: 7*12=84, 5*1=5, 35.5, 2*16=32. Total: 84 +5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. So, molecular weight about 156.5. That fits with the molecular ion at 156. But wait, the molecular ion is at 156? So maybe the molecular formula is C7H5ClO2, which would have a molecular weight of 156.5. So 156 is the M+ peak, and 158 would be the presence of the (37Cl) isotope. So the M peak is 156, and the M+2 is 158, which is 32% abundance. That makes sense because 37Cl is about 25%, so perhaps the base peak is 100% for M and 32% for M+2, which is 4 times 25%? Wait, no, 32% is roughly 35Cl being 75% and 37Cl 25%, but for the M and M+2 peaks, it's the natural abundance. So for a compound with one Cl, the M is mostly from 35Cl, and M+2 from 37Cl. So the ratio would be roughly 75% : 25%. But the given data is 100% at 156 and 32% at 158. Hmm, 32% is about 75% of 43%, no, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular ion is at 156 and the fragment is at 158. Wait, maybe the molecular ion isn't the only peak. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is something else.

Let me check the other options. Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. Molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. Same as benzoic acid? Wait
