Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The problem says that there's an equimolar mixture X of two liquids. When treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes some reaction and forms another equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids through a disproportionation reaction. Then, hydrogenating both X and Y gives a single hydrocarbon Z, which is part of Y. Also, Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen at 14.28%, which I can calculate to find what it is. Plus, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, meaning it's probably a fully saturated molecule, maybe an alkane.

Let me outline the key points:

1. Mixture X (two liquids) decolorizes bromine water. That suggests both components are unsaturated, maybe alkenes or alkynes. Since they decolorize bromine, they must have double or triple bonds.

2. When X is heated with platinum, a catalyst, it undergoes disproportionation to form Y. Disproportionation is when one substance is both oxidized and reduced. So, probably each component in X is breaking down into two different products in Y.

3. Both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give the same product Z. So Z is the product of hydrogenating both components of X and Y. But wait, Y is a result of X's disproportionation. So, if X's components are A and B, then Y would have some products from A and B breaking down. But when you hydrogenate Y, you get Z. So, maybe the components of Y are more reduced than X's? Or perhaps the hydrogenation of Y's components gives Z.

4. Z is a hydrocarbon, mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let me calculate that. Hydrogen's molar mass is 1, carbon is 12. So, if the mass fraction is 14.28%, that's 14.28% hydrogen by mass. So, for a molecule CHn, the mass of H is 14.28% of the total.

Let me compute that. Let's say the formula is CnHm. The mass fraction of H is (m * 1) / (12n + m) ) = 0.1428.

Looking for an integer solution. Let's think of common hydrocarbons. For example, ethane is C2H6. Let's check: (6)/(24 +6)=6/30=0.2, which is 20%, too high.

What about ethylene? No, because ethylene is C2H4, which would be 4/(24 +4)=4/28≈14.28% exactly. Oh! That's exactly the value given. So Z is ethylene, but wait, ethylene is a double bond. Wait, but Z is a hydrocarbon from hydrogenation. Wait, no—wait, hydrogenation would add hydrogen. Oh, but Z is a product of hydrogenation, which usually adds H. Wait, but wait, no, hydrogenation of alkenes would produce alkanes. Wait, I'm confused.

Wait, no. Let's think again. If Z is the product of hydrogenating both X and Y, and Z is a certain hydrocarbon. If Z is ethylene, but that's an alkene, which wouldn't react further. But wait, the question says that Z doesn't react further, meaning it's fully saturated. So perhaps Z is an alkane.

Wait, wait, the mass fraction is 14.28%, which is 1/7. Let me think. For CHn, (n)/(12 + n) = 1/7.

So, 7n = 12 + n → 6n=12 → n=2. So the formula is C2H2? But that's acetylene, which is a triple bond, and perhaps wouldn't react under certain conditions. Or maybe it's ethane (C2H6), but that didn't fit. Wait, wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, wait, let's recalculate. Let me let Z be CnHm.

(m) / (12n + m) = 0.1428 = 1/7.

So 7m = 12n + m → 6m = 12n → m = 2n.

So for each n, m is twice that. Let's see possible n and m.

n=1 → m=2 → CH2. Not possible, as CH2 would need to be CH2 something, but that's not a stable molecule.

n=2 → m=4 → C2H4. That's ethylene.

n=3 → m=6 → C3H6. That could be an alkene or an alkyne, but perhaps not.

Wait, but if Z is the result of hydrogenation, which typically adds hydrogen, so perhaps Z is a more saturated form.

Wait, but another thought: if Z is ethylene (C2H4), but when you hydrogenate ethylene, you get ethane (C2H6). But in this case, Z is the product. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the problem says that hydrogenation
