Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again.

So, the setup is that there's an electron moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. Then there's a positron moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. The energies of both photons are the same, and their directions are measuredâ€”one goes upper-right, the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between their directions.

Hmm. I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, and because of conservation laws, certain things have to hold. Like conservation of energy and momentum.

Wait, but wait a second. The positron is the antimatter counterpart of the electron, so when they meet, they annihilate. But what about their momenta before collision?

I think I should start by figuring out the total momentum before the collision because momentum has to be conserved. Since photons carry momentum, the total momentum after the collision should equal the total before.

So, the electron is moving left to right (from the left), and the positron is moving right to left (from the right). So their velocities are in opposite directions.

Wait, but Lorentz factors are just gamma, right? So gamma for the electron is 4, and for the positron, it's 2.

The momentum of a relativistic particle is given by p = gamma * m * v. But wait, another formula comes to mind: p = gamma * m_0 * c * beta, where beta is v/c.

Wait, since the rest mass of an electron (and positron) is the same, m_e, and the speed of light is c. So for each particle, their momentum can be calculated.

Let me think about the directions. The electron is moving to the right (let's say positive x-direction), and the positron is moving to the left (negative x-direction). So their momenta are in opposite directions
