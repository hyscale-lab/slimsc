Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think through it step by step. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a particular spin state. 

The state given is (3i, 4). I remember that spin states are usually represented as two-component vectors, like a column vector with two elements. So, I think in this case, the spin state vector χ is [3i, 4]^T. 

Wait, expectation value... Oh right, the expectation value of an operator is calculated as the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator matrix, then multiplied by the state vector. Or wait, maybe the other way around. Let me think. Oh, right, it's χ† S_y χ.

The operator for S_y is given as sigma_y, but I should remember that S_y is ħ/2 multiplied by sigma_y. Because spin operators are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So, S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y.

So, the matrix σ_y is:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

Therefore, S_y is (ħ/2) times this matrix.

The expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is χ† S_y χ.

Let me write down the components. The state χ is [3i, 4]. So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ] because the conjugate transpose would swap and take complex conjugates. Wait, actually, the conjugate transpose of [3i,4] is [ -3i, 4 ]? Let me double-check: for a column vector [a; b], the conjugate transpose is [a*, b*]. So 3i becomes -3i, and 4 stays 4. So χ† is [-3i, 4].

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the state is given as (3i, 4), which is a row vector. So the conjugate transpose would be a column vector with elements [-3i, 4]. So χ† is a 1x2 matrix, and χ is a 2x1 matrix. So when I multiply, I have χ† (1x2) multiplied by S_y (2x2) giving a 1x2 matrix, then multiplied by χ (2x1) gives a scalar.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute each part step by step. Let's write each step.

First, compute χ† S_y.

χ† is the row vector: [ -3i, 4 ]

S_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So, χ† S_y would be [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by (ħ/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Let me compute that matrix multiplication.

Wait, no, actually, when you have a row vector multiplied by a matrix, each element is the sum of products of the row elements and the column elements.

So the first element of χ† S_y is (-3i)*0 + 4*i = 0 +4i =4i.

Wait wait, no. The matrix multiplication is [a b] * [[c d],[e f]] = [a c + b e , a d +b f]. So for the first element: (-3i)*0 +4*i = 0 +4i =4i.

Second element: (-3i)*(-i) +4*0 = (3i^2) +0. Wait, (-3i)*(-i) is 3i^2. But i^2 is -1. So that becomes 3*(-1) = -3.

Wait, let me recheck that. (-3i)*(-i) = 3i^2. i squared is -1, so 3*(-1) is -3.

So χ† S_y is [4i, -3], each multiplied by (ħ/2) because S_y is (ħ/2)*σ_y.

Wait, no, wait: the S_y matrix is (ħ/2) multiplied by the σ_y matrix. So the calculation of χ† S_y is (ħ/2) times the result of χ† σ_y.

So the first element for χ† σ_y is 4i, the second is -3. So χ† S_y is (ħ/2) [4i, -3].

Wait no, actually, S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y. So when you compute χ† S_y, it's χ† multiplied by (ħ/2) σ_y. So the result is (ħ/2) times the result of χ† σ_y.

So χ† σ_y is [4i, -3], so χ† S_y is (ħ/2) [4i, -3].

Now, we need to multiply this by χ, which is [3i;4]. So the next step is to compute (ħ/2) [4i, -3] * [3i; 4].

Wait, [4i, -3] is a row vector, and [3i;4] is a column vector. So the multiplication is (4i *3i) + (-3 *4).

Let me compute each part:

4i *3i = 12 i^2 = 12*(-1)= -12.

-3 *4 = -12.

So total is -12 + (-12) = -24.

Then, multiply by (ħ/2): (ħ/2)*(-
