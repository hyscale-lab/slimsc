Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear decay, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me think through it.

The question describes a decay process where two nucleons of flavor A convert into two B's and emit particles E and V. The reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. It's given that the E particles have a continuous energy spectrum with an endpoint Q.

Now, there's a variant where instead of the two V particles, one exotic, massless particle M is emitted. So the reaction becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M. The question is about how the E particles' energy spectrum changes in this new scenario.

Hmm, I remember that in beta decay, for example, when a neutron turns into a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino, the emitted electron has a continuous spectrum. The maximum energy (endpoint) is determined by the Q value of the decay. The same concept applies here, I think.

In the original case, two V particles are emitted along with two E particles. So the decay involves multiple particles. The E particles' energies are spread out from zero up to Q, but what determines Q? Q is the total energy available from the decay, minus the masses of the products, I suppose.

Wait, no, Q is the total energy released. So in the original decay, the energy is shared among the E's and V's. Now, in the variant, instead of two V's, there's one M which is massless. So maybe the distribution of energy changes.

Let me think about how the emission of other particles affects the E particles' spectrum. In the original case, since there are two V particles, each V must carry away some energy, and the E particles share the remaining. So the E's can't all have maximum energy because some is taken by the V's.

If in the variant, the V's are replaced by a massless M, maybe the energy is distributed differently. But wait, M is massless—so perhaps it doesn't contribute much to the energy in terms of rest mass. So more energy is available for the E particles and other products.

Wait, but the M is a single particle instead of two Vs. So the energy that was previously split between two Vs now is in one M. Since M is massless, all its energy is kinetic. So the total energy available for the E particles would be higher?

Wait, no, because the initial decay's Q value is fixed by the masses of the initial and final states. If the product particles change, Q might change. But the problem says in the original decay, the endpoint is Q. Now, in the variant, the reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + M.

So the change is that instead of 2V, it's 1M. So the available energy Q' would be different. Let me calculate Q for both cases.

In the original decay: 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V.

The Q value is the total energy released, which is (mass of 2A) - (mass of
