Okay, so I've got this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Wait, parallax is related to distance, right? Oh right, the parallax in arcseconds (let's call it plx) is inversely proportional to the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/distance. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So if stars are uniformly distributed, I guess that means their actual distances are uniformly distributed. Wait, no, wait: uniform distribution in what sense? Oh, the problem says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, so does that mean in space, their distances are uniform? Or that their positions on the sky's surface (like angles) are uniform? Hmm. Wait, I think when they say uniformly distributed in the sky, it refers to their spatial distribution, like their 3D positions. So the number density of stars is the same in all directions.

Wait, no, maybe it's about their positions on the celestial sphere. But to model this, I think it's better to imagine that the number of stars in a given volume is uniform. So the density is constant.

So the idea is that the number of stars is spread out uniformly in three-dimensional space.
