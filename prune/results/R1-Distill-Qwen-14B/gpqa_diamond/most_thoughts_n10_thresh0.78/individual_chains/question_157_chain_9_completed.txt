Okay, so I've got this question about designing a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus outbreak. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my virology, but let's think through this.

First, the question is about choosing the correct method to design the kit. The options are A, B, C, D. I remember that molecular diagnostics often involve detecting the genetic material of the virus. Retroviruses, like HIV, have RNA as their genetic material. So when designing a test, I need to consider whether the virus is RNA or DNA based.

Option A says using symptoms to identify the virus and then designing nested PCR. Wait, symptoms alone aren't enough because different viruses can cause similar symptoms. You need a more specific method. Plus, nested PCR is a technique, but how do you know what to target without knowing the virus's genetic info?

Option B involves cDNA sequencing first. Oh, right, retroviruses have RNA, so to make cDNA they use reverse transcriptase. So if you extract their RNA, make cDNA, and sequence that, that would help identify the virus. Then, using real-time PCR for diagnosis. Real-time PCR is good because it's quick and gives quantifiable results. That sounds plausible.

Option C suggests DNA sequencing. Wait, if the virus is a retrovirus, its genetic material is RNA, not DNA. Unless it's integrated into the host genome as DNA, but for initial detection, you might target the RNA. So DNA sequencing might not be the first step unless you're looking for proviral DNA, but that's after infection. So maybe C isn't the right approach here.

Option D talks about IgG antibodies and ELISA. ELISA is used to detect antibodies in the blood, which is good for serological testing. But if the goal is to detect the virus quickly, like in early infection, molecular methods (detecting the virus itself) are better than antibody tests. Antibodies might take time to develop, so ELISA might not be the first choice for quick diagnosis during an outbreak. Plus, the question specifies a molecular diagnostic kit, which usually refers to detecting the pathogen's genetic material, not antibodies.

So putting this together: the first step should involve identifying the virus using its genetic material. Since it's a retrovirus, you'd probably extract RNA, make cDNA, and sequence that to identify it. Then, develop a real-time PCR kit to detect the presence of the virus quickly and accurately. That points me towards option B.

Wait, but what's the difference between options B and C? Option B uses cDNA sequencing, which is appropriate for RNA viruses. Option C uses DNA sequencing, which wouldn't be the first choice unless the virus is a DNA virus or if you're looking for integrated DNA. Since it's a retrovirus, the first step is likely their RNA, so cDNA sequencing makes sense. So option B is correct.


To design a molecular diagnostic kit for detecting a retrovirus, it is essential to consider the nature of the virus. Retroviruses have RNA as their genetic material, and their detection typically involves targeting this RNA. Option A suggests using symptoms to identify the virus and designing nested PCR, but symptoms are not specific enough for accurate identification. Option C proposes DNA sequencing, which is less suitable for retroviruses since their genetic material is RNA. Option D focuses on detecting IgG antibodies using ELISA, but this method is not ideal for quick molecular diagnosis, especially during early infection when antibodies may not yet be present.

Option B, on the other hand, involves cDNA sequencing as the first step. This is appropriate because retroviruses use reverse transcriptase to produce cDNA from their RNA. By sequencing this cDNA, the virus can be identified. Subsequently, developing a real-time PCR kit allows for quick and accurate detection of the virus. Real-time PCR is a reliable and efficient method for molecular diagnostics, making this approach the most suitable for the given scenario.

Answer: B
