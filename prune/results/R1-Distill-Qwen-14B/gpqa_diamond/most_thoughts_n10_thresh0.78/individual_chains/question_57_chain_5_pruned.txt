Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to understand what it's asking. Hmm, it's about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, phase shifts... Right, in scattering theory, especially in partial wave analysis, the scattering amplitude can be broken down into contributions from different angular momentum states. Each state has a phase shift, denoted by δ_l, where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number. Oh right, the scattering amplitude depends on these phase shifts.

The measured phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. And the question says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts. So I guess we only consider l=0 to l=4 here.

The problem is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Wait, what's the incident beam direction in terms of angles? I think the scattering angle θ is measured with respect to the incident direction. So when the question says "along the incident beam direction," that's probably θ=0 degrees.

The scattering amplitude f(θ,φ) is a function of both θ and φ. But wait, for elastic scattering of identical particles like electrons, there's a symmetry. I remember that for spin-½ particles, the amplitude can have certain symmetries. But I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, maybe the problem simplifies things because it's along the beam direction, so perhaps φ is zero or doesn't matter much here. But maybe the angular dependence can be considered using the spherical harmonics or Legendre polynomials.

Wait, the scattering amplitude for each partial wave is given by f_l(θ) = (1/(k l)) * ( (sin δ_l )/(1 - cos δ_l) ) ) * something else... Or wait, I think the expression for the partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude is f(θ,φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ [ (2l+1) / (2ik) ] * (
