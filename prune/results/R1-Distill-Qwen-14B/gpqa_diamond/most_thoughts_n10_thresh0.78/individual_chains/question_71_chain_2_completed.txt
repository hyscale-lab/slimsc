Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about exoplanets discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for Transit Timing Variation. But I'm not sure if that method affects the problem here. I think the key details are about their orbital periods and how that relates to their equilibrium temperatures.

So, the planets are in orbital resonance and have periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Each planet's period is given relative to the first one. So Planet_1 has period P, Planet_2 is 2P, Planet_3 is 2.5P, Planet_4 is 3.5P, and Planet_5 is 5P. 

The question is asking about the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. The planets have the same albedo, which means they reflect the same proportion of light. So albedo won't come into play here because it's the same for both.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined using the formula:

Te = T_star * ( (L / (16 * π * σ * D²) ) )^(1/4) 

Wait, no, maybe another way. Alternatively, the formula is often expressed as:

Te = T_eff * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) )

Wait, not entirely sure. Let me think. The equilibrium temperature equation relates the star's temperature, the planet's distance, and other factors. Oh right, the formula I think is:

Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) / (1 + e) )^(1/4)

But since albedo is the same for both planets, and assuming circular orbits (e=0), then the albedo term cancels out. So the formula simplifies.

Wait, wait, no. Another approach: The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period. Or wait, is it inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis? Because the period is related to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law.

Right, Kepler's third law states that (P^2)/(a^3) = 4π²/(G M_star). So a^3 is proportional to P^2. So a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So the semi-major axis a is proportional to P^(2/3). Since all planets are around the same star, the mass M_star is the same for all. So a = k * P^(2/3), where k is some constant.

Now, the equilibrium temperature equation is given by:

Te = T_star * ( (R_star/(2a)) )^(1/2) )

Wait, or another version. Let me get this right. The standard formula for equilibrium temperature when the planet is in orbit around a star is:

Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4)

But since albedo is the same for both planets, we can ignore that term, as it's a constant factor. So the ratio of Te4 to Te2 will depend on a4 and a2.

So, Te4 / Te2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 )

Because Te is proportional to sqrt(1/a), so the ratio becomes sqrt(a2/a4). Wait, let me recheck that.

The formula is Te proportional to sqrt(1/a) because:

Te ∝ sqrt(R_star/(a))^(1/2) → which is sqrt(1/a). Because R_star is constant, so the ratio is based on 1/a.

Wait, wait, let me think again. Let me write the formula.

Te = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( ... )

So Te is proportional to sqrt(1/a). Because R_star and other terms are constant, so Te ∝ 1/sqrt(a).

Wait, no, sqrt(1/a) is 1/sqrt(a). So higher a means lower Te.

So for two planets, Te1 / Te2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because Te ∝ 1/sqrt(a), so the ratio Te2/Te1 = sqrt(a1/a2).

Wait, let me make it clear: Te is proportional to (1/sqrt(a)).

So Te4 / Te2 = (1/sqrt(a4)) / (1/sqrt(a2)) ) = sqrt(a2/a4)

Yes, that makes sense.

But since a is proportional to P^(2/3), because a^3 is proportional to P^2 → a = k P^(2/3).

So a4 = k * (P4)^(2/3), a2 = k * (P2)^(2/3).

So the ratio a2/a4 = (P2^(2/3) / P4^(2/3)) ) = (P2/P4)^(2/3)

So putting this into the temperature ratio:

Te4/Te2 = sqrt( a2/a4 ) = sqrt( (P2/P4)^(2/3) )

Which is equal to (P2/P4)^(1/3) )

So Te4/Te2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)

Now, what are P2 and P4?

From the given ratios, the orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.

So for Planet_2, P2 = 2 * P1.

For Planet_4, P4 = 3.5 * P1.

So P2/P4 = (2 P1) / (3.5 P1) ) = 2/3.5.

Simplify that: 2 divided by 3.5 is the same as 4/7.

So 2/3.5 = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

So (P2/P4) = 4/7.

So the ratio Te4/Te2 is (4/7)^(1/3).

What's the cube root of 4/7?

Well, 4 is approximately 4, 7 is about 7. So 4/7 is about 0.5714.

Cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83, because 0.83^3 is about 0.83 * 0.83 = ~0.6889, multiplied by 0.83 again: ~ 0.6889 * 0.83 ≈ 0.571.

Oh, so cube root of 0.571 is approximately 0.83. So Te4/Te2 ≈ 0.83.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute 0.83^3: 0.8^3 is 0.512, 0.83^3: 0.83 * 0.83 = 0.6889, then times 0.83: 0.6889 * 0.83 ≈ 0.571. So yes, cube root of 0.571 is about 0.83.

So the ratio Te4/Te2 is approximately 0.83.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the steps. Because sometimes it's easy to mix up the ratios.

We have Te4/Te2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3).

P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5. So 2/3.5 = 4/7 ≈ 0.571.

Cube root of 0.571 is approximately 0.83 as I thought.

So the ratio is about 0.83, so Te4 is 0.83 times Te2.

So the question is about the ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2. So the answer is 0.83, which is option C.


To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting that the planets' orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \(a\) is proportional to \(P^{2/3}\), where \(P\) is the orbital period. Thus, the equilibrium temperature \(T_e\), which is inversely proportional to \(\sqrt{a}\), can be expressed as:

\[
T_e \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

For two planets, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is given by:

\[
\frac{T_{e4}}{T_{e2}} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_4}\right)^{1/3}
\]

From the given period ratios, \(P_2 = 2P_1\) and \(P_4 = 3.5P_1\). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \frac{2P_1}{3.5P_1} = \frac{2}{3.5} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.571
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\frac{T_{e4}}{T_{e2}} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.83
\]

Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83. Comparing this to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
