Okay, so I've got this physics problem about spin 1/2 particles and magnetic moments. Hmm, I need to figure out the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment when the magnetic field changes. Let me think through this.

So the setup is: the particle has a spin 1/2, and its magnetic moment mu is given by gamma times Sz. Initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. Then the field is turned off and turned on along +Y direction, same magnitude B. The question is about the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment oscillating—what's its frequency.

Wait, spin 1/2 particles have spin angular momentum S, which can be ± ħ/2 along any direction. The magnetic moment mu is proportional to S, so mu = gamma * S. So in the initial state, when the field is along Z, the spin will align either along +Z or -Z because that's the direction of the field, so the energy is minimized there.

When the field is suddenly switched to Y, the Hamiltonian changes. I think this is a problem involving time evolution under a different Hamiltonian. The initial state is an eigenstate of the old Hamiltonian (H_initial = -mu·B_initial), but now the Hamiltonian becomes H_final = -mu·B_final.

Wait, mu is gamma S, right? So mu in terms of spin components. So when the field is along Y, H_final would be proportional to S_y. So the new Hamiltonian is H = gamma B S_y. Hmm, but wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the energy is H = -mu · B. Oh wait no, wait, I think the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So the energy is E = -mu · B. So when B is along Y, E = -gamma S_y B.

Alternatively, some sources define mu as gamma times the spin, but perhaps with a minus sign because of the energy expression. Wait, maybe I should be careful.

Wait, the magnetic dipole moment mu is related to the spin S by mu = gamma S. So the energy of a dipole in a magnetic field B is E = -mu · B. So yes, the Hamiltonian is H = -mu · B = -gamma S · B.

So in this case, the initial B was along +Z, which made the Hamiltonian H_initial = -gamma B S_z. The eigenstates of this are |+z> and |-z>, with eigenvalues E+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E- = gamma B (ħ/2), but wait, let me make sure. Wait, S_z has eigenvalues ± ħ/2 for spin 1/2. So then E_+ would be -gamma B (ħ/2), and E_- would be gamma B (ħ/2). Or wait, no: mu is gamma S, so mu_z is gamma S_z. So E = -mu_z B = -gamma S_z B. So for S_z = ħ/2, E = -gamma (ħ/2) B. For S_z = -ħ/2, E = gamma (ħ/2)
