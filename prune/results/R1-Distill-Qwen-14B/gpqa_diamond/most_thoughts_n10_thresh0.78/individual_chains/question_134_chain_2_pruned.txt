Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions typically involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. Enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid donates a proton to a base, usually per mole of reaction.

The problem gives me three different solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Let me jot down their details.

HCl is 500 mL of 0.2 M. H2SO4 is 300 mL of 0.3 M. Ba(OH)2 is 200 mL of 0.5 M. I think I need to figure out how much acid and base I have, whether they're in excess, and how much actually reacts.

Wait, but wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right? And HCl and H2SO4 are strong acid and a strong acid as well. So the neutralization reaction should go to completion.

But H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. So each mole of H2SO4 can donate two H+ ions. HCl is monoprotic, only one H+ per mole.

Ba(OH)2, on the other hand, is a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions because it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

So the reaction is probably between H+ ions from the acids and OH- from the base. But since the base has two OH- per formula unit, that might affect the stoichiometry.

Let me calculate the moles of each substance.

First, moles of HCl. Molarity is moles per liter. So 0.2 M * 0.5 L (since 500 mL is 0.5 L) equals 0.1 moles of HCl. Since HCl is a strong acid, it will donate 0.1 moles of H+.

Next, H2SO4. It's 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 H+, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+.

Then, Ba(OH)2. 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles of OH-.

So total H+ is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles H+.

Total OH- is 0.2 moles.

Now, when H+ and OH- react, they form water. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. Each mole of H+ and OH- reacts 1:1.

So, H+ is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles. The OH- is the limiting reagent here because 0.2 < 0.28. So all the OH- will react, and some H+ will be left over.

So moles of H+ that react: 0.2 moles. Moles of H+ remaining: 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles.

But wait, the neutralization reaction here will only involve the OH- and the available H+ from the acids. So the total H+ that gets neutralized is 0.2 moles.

The enthalpy of neutralization is usually given per mole of H+ (or OH-) reacting. I remember that strong acid and strong base neutralization releases about 57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-) at 25°C. So, for each mole of H+ neutralized, the enthalpy change is approximately -57 kJ.

So, the total enthalpy change would be moles of H+ reacted multiplied by the enthalpy per mole.

Moles reacted: 0.2. So 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but looking at the options, one is -11.42 kcal, another is -16.0 kJ, etc. Wait, units are a problem here. Because the options have some in kcal and some in kJ. Oh, right, the problem asks for the enthalpy in which units?

Wait, the options: A) -2.72 kcal, B) -11.42 kcal, C) -3.80 kcal, D) -16.0 kJ.

Hmm, so the problem is in kcal or kJ. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is often given in kJ. For example, I think the standard value is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-). Wait, but sometimes it's expressed per mole of acid, which for H2SO4 would be different since it's diprotic.

Wait, but in the calculation, we're considering each H+ from any source. So for each mole of H+ neutralized, the enthalpy is about -57 kJ.

So, 0.2 moles * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, but the question probably expects the answer in kJ, but one of the options is in kcal. Let me check the options again.

Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is about -16 kJ. But our calculation is -11.4 kJ, which is close to option D if I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the stoichiometry. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization of each mole of acid and base
