Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution with EDTA. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, right? So Ca-EDTA would be something like CaY²- where Y is the EDTA. The pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about the protonation states of EDTA, which is good because that can complicate things.

The given K for the complex is 5x10^10. Wait, K here is the formation constant, I think. Formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The formula would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. So Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

But wait, in this case, the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, which is the product. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But when it dissociates, it produces Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

So, the complex dissociates as: CaEDTA²- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

The K for this dissociation would be the inverse of the formation constant. Because formation is Kf = [complex]/([M][L]), so the dissociation K would be 1/Kf. Wait, let me get that right. Formation constant is Kf, so if I reverse the reaction, the K becomes 1/Kf. So for the dissociation, Kdissociation = 1/(Kf).

So, Kdissociation = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Wait, but wait, the problem gives KCa-EDTA as 5e10. I'm assuming that's the formation constant. So yes, Kd is 2e-11.

Now, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me set up an ICE table.

Initial:
[CaEDTA²-] = 0.02 M
[Ca²+] = 0
[EDTA^4-] = 0

Change:
[CaEDTA²-] decreases by x, so 0.02 - x
[Ca²+] increases by x, so x
[EDTA^4-] increases by x, so x

At equilibrium:
[CaEDTA²-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is probably very small compared to 0.02)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x

So the Kdissociation is [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [CaEDTA²-] = (x)(x)/(0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02 = Kd = 2e-11.

So, x² = (2e-11)*0.02 = 4e-13.

Taking square root: x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4*10^-13, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-12)=1e-6, but 1e-13 is 1e-13, so sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, no, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, so 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. Hmm, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, 4e-13 is 4 x 10^-13. The square root is sqrt(4)=2, and sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5. Wait, because (1e-6.5)^2 is 1e-13. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2 * 1e-6.5.

What's 1e-6.5? That's 3.1623e-7, approximately. So 2 * 3.1623e-7 is about 6.3245e-7.

So x is approximately
