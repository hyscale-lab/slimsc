Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about the potentials in an electromagnetic field generated by a moving charge. Hmm, let's see what it's asking.

The setup is that there's a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). We're considering the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a point r at time t, where t is greater than tr (the time when the field was generated). The vector d is from the point where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r.

I remember that the potentials are solutions to Maxwell's equations. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact forms when the charge is moving. Oh right, when charges are moving, you have to consider the retarded time because the fields propagate at the speed of light, not instantaneously.

So, for the scalar potential V, the general form for a moving charge is something like V(r, t) = q/(4πε₀ |r - v t'| ), where t' is the retarded time. Oh wait, the retarded time tr is the time when the charge was at the position that affects the field at r and t. So tr = t - |d|/c, because the light travel time from the charge's position at tr to r is |d|/c. Wait, no, actually, d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. So the distance is |d|, right? So the charge is at position r - d at time tr.

Wait, no, more accurately, the charge is at position s(tr) at time tr, and the vector from that position to the field point r is d. So d = r - s(tr). So |d| is the distance between the charge and the field point at the retarded time.

So, the scalar potential V would be V = q/(4πε₀ |d|) but wait, considering the time delay. Actually, since the potential travels at speed c, the expression involves the distance and the velocity.

Wait, perhaps the scalar potential is V(r,t) = (q)/(4πε₀ (|d| * sqrt(1 - (v^2/c²)) )) ) ? No, wait, that's the Lorentz factor.
