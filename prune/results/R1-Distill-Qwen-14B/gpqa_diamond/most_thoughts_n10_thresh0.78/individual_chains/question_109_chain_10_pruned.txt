Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. It's about nucleons emitting a particle and some quantum numbers. Hmm, I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says we have a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. Oh right, Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, isospin is involved here. I remember that isospin is a part of the larger concept of angular momentum coupling, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

So the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. We need to find which of the given options is not allowed because it violates conservation laws, specifically angular momentum and parity.

Let me first think about the initial state. The initial state is given as 1S0. The term symbol notation is (2S+1)L(J), so 1S0 would mean S=0 (since 2*0+1=1), L=0 (since S is the next letter, and S is 0). So J would be L + S = 0 + 0 = 0. So the initial state has L=0, S=0, J=0.

Then, the system emits particle X. So the reaction is NN → NN' + X. Wait, no, the question says a bound system emits a particle, so it's like NN + X → NN', but I'm not sure if that matters. Wait, it's more like the NN system is in 1S0 and emits X, so the final state is NN in some state plus X. So the initial state is the 1S0 state, and the final state is the NN in some other state plus X.

But wait, the question is about the final NN state. So the initial NN is 1S0, then they emit X, so the NN system must change. The problem is about the possible partial waves, which are related to the orbital angular momentum L of X, I think.

Wait, the options are the possible final states after emission—like 7D1 + p, etc. So each option shows the transition from the initial 1S0 to a new state plus the emitted particle. So the initial state is 1S0, the final state for NN is something, and X is emitted.

We need to find which of these is not allowed. The options are A to D, each with a different final state and the emitted particle.

The key is to use conservation of angular momentum and parity, along with the Pauli statistics condition.

First, the Pauli condition: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So since the final state has T=0, we can plug that in.

Wait, T(NN) is the isospin of the NN state. So T=0. So 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2. So S + L must be 1 mod 2. So S + L is an odd integer. So either S is even and L is odd, or S is odd and L is even. Wait, actually, mod 2, 0 is even and 1 is odd. So S + L must be odd. So if S is even, L must be odd, and vice versa.

So for the final NN state, we have to figure out their S and L, then check if their sum is odd.

Also, parity is conserved. The parity of the initial state is the product of the parity of the final states.

The initial state is 1S0. The parity of a state is given by (-1)^{L}, where L is the orbital angular momentum. So for 1S0, L=0 → parity is (+1).

When the NN system emits X, which has intrinsic parity (-1). So the parity of the emission process must be considered.

The parity of the initial state must equal the parity of the final state (since parity is conserved). The initial parity is (+1). So the parity of the final state, which is the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of X, must also be (+1).

So parity conservation: P_initial = P_final.

P_initial = (+1) = P_NN_final * P_X.

P_X is given as (-1). So P_NN_final must be (-1), because (+1) = (-1) * P_NN_final → P_NN_final = (-1) * (+1)/(-1) → Wait, wait: let's compute it.

P_initial = P_NN_final * P_X. Because
