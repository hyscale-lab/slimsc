Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction between 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione when heated. The question is asking for the exo product, and there are four options to choose from. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I remember that [4+2] cycloadditions are Diels-Alder reactions. The Diels-Alder is a [4π + 2π] pericyclic reaction between a diene and a dienophile. So I need to figure out which compound is the diene and which is the dienophile here.

Looking at the reactants: 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione. Thiophene is an aromatic heterocycle. Furan-2,5-dione is another aromatic compound, right? It's a dione, so the furan has two ketone groups at positions 2 and 5.

Wait, which one is the diene and which is the dienophile in this case? Diels-Alder reactions typically require a conjugated diene (the diene) and a dienophile, which is usually something with a good electron-deficient double bond, like a carbonyl group.

Furan-2,5-dione has the two ketone groups in the 2 and 5 positions. Its structure is a furan ring with two ketones opposite each other. So the double bonds in furan are between 2-3 and 5-6 (if I'm numbering correctly). Wait, no, furan is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. Oh wait, no, furan has one double bond. Let me correct that. Furan structure: it's O with four carbons in a ring, positions 2 and 5 have the ketones. So the dienophile would be the part with the electron-deficient double bond. Typically, the dienophile is something like a carbonyl, maybe a dione, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, 2,5-dimethylthiophene is a thiophene with methyl groups at 2 and 5. Thiophene is an aromatic five-membered ring with a sulfur. It's a good diene because it's conjugated. Thiophene has a conjugated diene system, so it's a good diene for the Diels-Alder reaction. So I think 2,5-dimethylthiophene is the diene, and furan-2,5-dione is the dienophile.

Wait, but wait. Furan-2,5-dione: the dienophile would be a compound with a good electron-deficient double bond. Furan itself is a good dienophile, but when it has electron-withdrawing groups like ketones, it's even better. So yes, furan-2,5-dione is the dienophile here.

So the diene is 2,5-dimethylthiophene, which is a five-membered ring, and the dienophile is the dione furan.
