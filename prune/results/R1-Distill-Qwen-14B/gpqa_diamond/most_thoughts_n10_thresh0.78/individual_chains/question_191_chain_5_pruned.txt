Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. So, I'm a bit new to organic chemistry, but I'll do my best to think it through. The question is about a series of reactions starting from a specific compound, and we need to determine the final product after four steps. Let me break down each step and see what's happening.

The starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw that structure mentally. So, the cyclohexanone ring has a ketone group at position 1. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (that's a CH2OH attached). At position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C(CH2)-, right? Wait, no. Propene is CH2=CH-CH3. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2, but wait, no. Let me think: the substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, which is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2-, but wait, position 2 is the substituent. Hmm, maybe it's CH2-C(CH2) something. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=C(CH3)-. Because prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C1 and C2, and the substituent on C2. So, the structure would be CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, maybe I'm confusing the numbering. Let me get this straight. The substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, so the main chain is three carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is attached to C2. So, the group would be CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, that would make it CH2=CH-CH2-, but with the substituent on C2. So, the substituent is CH2=CH-CH2- attached via the middle carbon. Wait, that's confusing, maybe it's CH2-C(CH2)-? Hmm, perhaps it's better to think of it as a vinyl group attached to a methyl. Wait, maybe it's isopropenyl? Because prop-1-en-2-yl is the same as isopropenyl. So, that would be CH2=C(CH3)-. So, substituent is at position 5 as CH2-C(CH3)=.

So, the starting material has a
