Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major products for two reactions. Let me take it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let's look at the first reaction: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, which usually means it's involved in elimination reactions, like E2 mechanisms. But wait, the starting material here is a ketone. Oh, right! This sounds like a Claisen condensation or maybe a crossed aldol addition. Wait, Claisen is between esters, and aldol is between ketones and aldehydes or esters.

Wait, another thought: Oh, wait, the starting material is a ketone (cyclohexanone derivative), and the other reagent is ethyl acrylate, which is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. So maybe it's a Michael addition? Or perhaps a conjugate addition. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldol reaction. Hmm.

Wait, Claisen is for esters, but in this case, perhaps it's a crossed aldol. Let me think: The ketone (cyclohexanone) might undergo aldol condensation with ethyl acrylate. But wait, ethyl acrylate is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. So maybe the base (t-BuOK) deprotonates the alpha position of the ketone, and then the enolate attacks the alpha,beta-unsaturated ester in a conjugate addition.

Wait, the starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me imagine its structure. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1. Positions 2 and 6 have methyl groups, and position 2 also has an ethyl group. So the structure
