Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because enthalpy of neutralization isn't my strongest topic. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is asking me to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when three solutions are mixed: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. The options are given in kcal and kJ, so I'll need to pay attention to units.

Hmm, wait, enthalpy of neutralization usually involves the reaction between an acid and a base. The general formula for that is acid + base → salt + water. And the enthalpy change is typically around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but I guess the exact value might vary depending on the specific reaction.

But wait, in this problem, there are three solutions. So I need to figure out how they all interact. Let me list out each solution and their components.

First solution: HCl. That's a strong acid. Each mole of HCl will donate one H+ ion.

Second solution: H2SO4. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid too, but it's diprotic. So each mole should donate two H+ ions.

Third solution: Ba(OH)2. Barium hydroxide is a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides two OH- ions because the formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2OH⁻.

Wait, but when you mix these together, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base. So the overall reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, and the enthalpy change is per mole of H+ and OH- reacting.

So I need to calculate the total moles of H+ from the acids and the total moles of OH- from the base. Then, the neutralization will involve the smaller of the two, because the other will be in excess.

Let me calculate each part.

First, the moles of H+ from HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so each mole gives one H+.

Molarity is 0.2 M, volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L.

Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl → 0.1 moles H+.

Next, H2SO4. It's a strong acid, and each mole gives 2 H+.

Molarity is 0.3 M, volume is 300 mL → 0.3 L.

Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

So total H+ from both acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now, the base: Ba(OH)2. Each mole gives 2 OH-.

Molarity is 0.5 M, volume 200 mL → 0.2 L.

Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each gives 2 OH-, so moles OH- = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

So comparing H+ and OH-:

H+ is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles.

The OH- is the limiting reactant. So only 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- will react to form water. The remaining H+ will be 0.08 moles.

Wait, but wait a minute. Because in the case of H2SO4, is it possible that the second H+ isn't fully dissociated? No, because H2SO4 is a strong acid, both H+ ions are released in solution. So our initial calculation is correct.

So the reaction that occurs is between 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH-.

The enthalpy change for neutralization is usually given as about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-) reacting. But wait, sometimes it's given per mole of H2O formed, which would be the same as per mole of H+ or OH- used.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is
