Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let me think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work it out.

The question says that we have a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Then, there are three signals at around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options provided are four different combinations of compounds. I need to figure out which pair is correct.

First, let's break down the molecular formula C10H14. The degree of unsaturation can be calculated. Each benzene ring contributes 4 degrees (since it's a 6-carbon ring with 3 double bonds). So, 10 carbons and 14 hydrogens. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation:

Degrees of unsaturation formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X and N are 0. So, (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22 -14)/2 = 8/2=4. So four degrees. Since each ring or double bond is one degree, a benzene ring gives 4 (3 double bonds plus a ring?), wait no, benzene has three double bonds but as a ring, so the degree is 4 (one ring and three double bonds count as 4, because each double bond is one, and each ring is one, but in benzene, it's a conjugated system, so it's considered to have three double bonds but only one ring). Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Each ring or each double bond is one degree. Benzene is three double bonds and one ring? No, wait, the degree of unsaturation for benzene is 4 because each double bond counts as one, but in a ring structure, perhaps each ring counts as one too. Wait, no, benzene is a six-membered ring with three double bonds. However, in terms of degrees of unsaturation, it's four because it's a ring (one) and three double bonds (three), totaling four. So yeah, the molecule has one benzene ring and maybe some substituents.

But the molecular formula is C10H14. Benzene is C6H6. So the substituents must contribute 4 more carbons and 8 hydrogens, which is C4H8. Hmm, that's an alkyl group. Let me see, but wait, if there are two benzene rings, that would complicate things. No, wait, each compound is C10H14. Oh wait, the molecular formula is for each compound, so each is a mono-substituted benzene? No, maybe with multiple substituents.

Wait, the options are all tetramethylbenzenes except one. Let me look at the options:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. So that's a benzene ring with four methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,4. Similarly, the other options have four methyl groups attached.

Wait, but 1,4-diethylbenzene is in option C. Let's see its structure. It has two ethyl groups attached at positions 1 and 4. So that's C8H14 (benzene is C6H5, two ethyl groups are 2*(C2H5)=C4H10, so total C10H15. Wait, but the molecular formula of each compound is C10H14. So 1,4-diethylbenzene would have C6H
