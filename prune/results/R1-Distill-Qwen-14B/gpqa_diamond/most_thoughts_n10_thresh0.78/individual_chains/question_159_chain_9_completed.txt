Okay, so I have this question about quasars and cosmology, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about observations of a quasar in the near infrared and optical spectrum. There's a peak at around 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly below that wavelength. So, this peak must be related to some emission line, probably something like Lyman-alpha or some other prominent line in quasars.

Wait, quasars emit a lot of light because they're powered by supermassive black holes. But the specific peak at 790 nm... Hmm, wait, 790 nm is in the near-infrared. Let me think: visible light is about 400-700 nm, so 790 is just into the infrared. What emission lines are around there? Oh, wait! Maybe it's the Lyman-alpha line but redshifted. The Lyman-alpha emission line is usually at about 121 nm in the ultraviolet. But if the quasar is very far away, the expansion of the universe would cause that line to shift into longer wavelengths.

So, if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, the rest wavelength is 121 nm. The ratio of the observed to rest would give me the redshift factor. Let me calculate that: 790 / 121 ≈ 6.5289. So the redshift z would be approximately 6.5289 minus 1? Wait, no. Wait, wait, the formula for redshift is (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1. So (790 / 121) is about 6.5289, so z ≈ 5.5289. Hmm, that's a high redshift. But wait, wait, is that correct? Because sometimes when I think about the Lyman-alpha, it's actually the 121.6 nm line. Let me be precise. 790 / 121.6 ≈ 6.5, so z ≈ 5.5. So z is about 5.5.

Now, the question is asking about the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth. The comoving distance depends on the redshift and the cosmological parameters given. The model used here is the Lambda-CDM model, which includes dark matter, dark energy, and a Hubble constant. The parameters given are:

- Hubble constant H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc
- Matter density parameter Ω_m = 0.3
- Dark energy density parameter Ω_Λ = 0.7
- The universe is flat (so Ω_k = 0)

I remember that the comoving distance D_C is calculated by integrating the inverse of the Hubble parameter from a=0 (the time of emission) to a=1 (now). The formula is:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫(from 0 to z) dz' / E(z'),

where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ).

Wait, but wait: when the universe is flat, that's correct. So E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m(1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ*(1 + z)^0 ), because dark energy doesn't change much with expansion, or is it?

Wait, no. Dark energy density is actually (Ω_Λ)(a_0/a(z))^3, but since a_0 is 1, it's (Ω_Λ)(1/(1+z))^3? Wait, no, wait: no, wait, the energy density of dark energy in a flat universe scales as a^{-3(1+w)}, where w is the equation of state parameter. For dark energy, w is usually around -1, which gives scaling as a^0, so the density remains constant. So, the dark energy density is Ω_Λ (a_0/a(z))^3(1 + w). Since w is -1, that's (a_0/a(z))^0, so it's Ω_Λ.

So, E(z) = sqrt( Ω_m (1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ ) * (1+z)^(something?) Wait, no. Because the expansion is governed by the Friedmann equation, which is H^2 = (8πG/3)ρ_m + (Λ c^2)/(3). When we express this in terms of E(z), which is H(z)/H0, it's E(z) = sqrt( Ω_m (1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ ), right? Because Ω_Λ is the dark energy density parameter, which is (Λ c^2/(3 H0^2)).

So yes, E(z) = sqrt( Ω_m (1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ ). So for each z, we compute E(z) as that, and then integrate 1/E(z) from 0 to z.

But wait, the integral is over z' from 0 to z, but in terms of a differential in redshift z, so the integral is ∫ dz' / E(z').

The comoving distance is D_C = (c / H0) * ∫(0 to z) dz' / E(z').

Now, the value of D_C depends on z. So with a redshift z of about 5.5, what is the comoving distance in a flat Lambda-CDM universe with Ω_m=0.3 and Ω_Λ=0.7?

But I don't remember exact numbers. I think for high redshifts, the comoving distance approaches a certain value. Let me think about some approximate values.

I remember that for a flat universe with Ω_m=0.3 and Ω_Λ=0.7, the comoving distance at z=1 is about 1.7 billion parsecs (which is 1.7 Gpc) when H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc. Wait, but wait, no: when H0 is 70, the conversion factors change.

Wait, the formula for comoving distance is D_C = (c * (1+z)) / H0 * ∫(a=1/(1+z) to a=1) da/(a^2 E(a)).

Wait, maybe it's easier to use an online calculator or known values, but since I can't do that now, I'll have to think.

Alternatively, I can recall that for z around 5, the comoving distance is about 10-12 billion parsecs. But wait, let me think. I've heard that the comoving distance for z=1 is about 1.7 Gpc with H0=70, but wait that can't be right. Wait, no, because when H0 is 70, 1/H0 in parsecs is about 14 billion parsecs (since 1/H0 in km/s/Mpc is 70, so in Mpc s/km is 1/70. Then, to get parsecs, since 1 Mpc is 3.086e22 pc, so 1/70 / (3.086e22) would be about 4.7e-24 pc s, wait, this might not be the right approach.

Alternatively, I can compute the age of the universe at z=5.5 and multiply by c to get the distance. But that's another approach.

Alternatively, I can use the approximation for the comoving distance for a flat universe with Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7. I think that for z=2, the comoving distance is about 3 Gpc, z=5 is around 10 Gpc, and z=10 is around 16 Gpc or so.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about integrating dz / sqrt(0.3(1+z)^3 + 0.7).

Wait, when z is very high, the dark energy term dominates. So for z >> 1, E(z) ≈ sqrt(0.7) ≈ 0.83666. So the integral from z=0 to z=5.5 would be roughly the integral from 0 to infinity, but that's not exactly helpful. Alternatively, for high z, the integrand is roughly 1/0.83666, so the integral becomes approximately (z_max) / 0.83666.

But wait, in reality, the integrand is 1/sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7). So when z is large, 0.3*(1+z)^3 is much larger than 0.7, so E(z) ≈ sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3) = sqrt(0.3) * (1+z)^(3/2). So the integrand becomes 1/(sqrt(0.3)*(1+z)^(3/2) ).

So the integral ∫ dz' / E(z') ≈ ∫ dz' / [sqrt(0.3) (1+z')^(3/2)] ] from z'=0 to z=5.5.

So the integral becomes 1/sqrt(0.3) * ∫ (1+z')^(-3/2) dz' from 0 to 5.5.

The integral of (1+z')^(-3/2) dz' is:

∫ (1+z')^(-3/2) dz' = (-2) / sqrt(1+z') ) + C.

So evaluated from 0 to 5.5: [ -2/sqrt(1+5.5) ) + 2/sqrt(1+0) ] = [ -2/sqrt(6.5) + 2/1 ].

Compute sqrt(6.5): approx 2.55, so 2/sqrt(6.5) ≈ 0.7846.

So the integral is ( 2 - 0.7846 ) = 1.2154.

Then, the integral is 1/sqrt(0.3) * 1.2154.

sqrt(0.3) ≈ 0.5477.

So 1/0.5477 ≈ 1.826.

Multiply by 1.2154: 1.826 * 1.2154 ≈ approx 2.22.

So the integral is approximately 2.22.

Then, D_C = (c / H0 ) * 2.22.

Wait, but H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc. Let's compute c/H0 in Mpc.

c is approximately 3e5 km/s.

c / H0 = (3e5 km/s) / (70 km/s/Mpc ) = approx 4285.7 Mpc.

So D_C ≈ 4285.7 Mpc * 2.22 ≈ 4285.7 * 2.22 ≈ 9518 Mpc, which is about 9.5 Gpc.

Wait, but this is the approximation for E(z) ≈ sqrt(0.3 (1+z)^3 ) when z is large. But z=5.5 is a pretty high redshift, so maybe this approximation is okay.

But wait, that would suggest a comoving distance around 9.5 Gpc. Looking at the options, option C is 9 Gpc, D is7, B is8, A is6. So 9.5 is near 9 Gpc, but perhaps the exact calculation would be a bit less.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral isn't exactly 2.22 because at lower z, the dark energy term (0.7) contributes more. So maybe the integral is a bit larger than the 2.22 I calculated.

Wait, because when z isn't extremely high, the 0.7 term is non-negligible. So perhaps the integral is a bit more than 2.22.

Wait, let me think. For z=5.5, the 0.3(1+z)^3 term is 0.3*(6.5)^3 = 0.3 * 274.625 = approx 82.39. The 0.7 term is 0.7. So E(z) at z=5.5 is sqrt(82.39 + 0.7) = sqrt(83.09) ≈ 9.115. So E(z)=9.115, so 1/E(z)=0.1097.

But wait, the integral is from 0 to 5.5, so I have to integrate the function 1/sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7) dz'. At lower z', like z' < 1, the 0.7 term is more significant, and the integrand is larger than the approximation I did earlier. So the integral would be a bit larger than 2.22.

Wait, but my initial approximation gave 2.22, leading to D_C ≈ 9.5 Gpc. But perhaps the integral is a bit higher, so maybe up to about 2.4 or something, which would bring D_C to around 10 Gpc. But that's not an option here. The options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc.

Hmm, maybe I should look for a more accurate way. Alternatively, perhaps the peak is not Lyman-alpha but something else. Let me think again about the peak wavelength.

The observed wavelength is 790 nm. If it's Lyman-alpha at 121 nm, then z= (790/121) -1 ≈5.528. But if it's a different line, maybe the rest wavelength is longer.

Wait, another prominent emission line in quasars is the Balmer series. Hydrogen-alpha is about 656 nm in the rest frame. If the observed wavelength is 790, then the redshift would be (790/656) -1 ≈1.204. That's a much lower redshift, z≈0.204. But the flux drops below 790 nm, meaning the peak is at 790, which would be in the near infrared.

Wait, but if the rest wavelength is 656 nm (H-alpha), then the redshift would be (790/656) ~ 1.204, so z≈0.204. But then the comoving distance would be much smaller. Let me compute that.

At z=0.204, the comoving distance in a flat universe with Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, H0=70.

The formula for comoving distance for low z can be approximated as D_C ≈ (c/H0) * (z) / (sqrt(Ω_m (1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ)).

Wait, no, that's not the exact formula. The exact comoving distance is:

D_C = (c/H0) * ∫(0 to z) dz' / sqrt(Ω_m (1+z')^3 + Ω_Λ).

Alternatively, for small z, we can expand the denominator.

At z=0.2, (1+z)=1.2.

E(z)=sqrt(0.3*(1.2)^3 + 0.7) = sqrt(0.3*1.728 + 0.7) = sqrt(0.5184 + 0.7) = sqrt(1.2184) ≈1.1038.

So the integral from 0 to 0.2 is approximately ∫0^0.2 dz' / 1.1038 ≈ (0.2)/(1.1038) ≈0.1812.

Multiply by c/H0: 4285.7 Mpc * 0.1812 ≈ 775 Mpc, which is 0.775 Gpc. That's way smaller than the options given. So perhaps the line isn't H-alpha but something else.

Another possibility: Helium lines? Or maybe a forbidden line like [OIII] at 500 nm? If the rest wavelength is 500 nm, observed is 790, then z=(790/500)-1=1.58, so z=0.58.

Wait, but the Balmer decrement is about 300-400 nm, but perhaps the Lyman series is more likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the observed peak is the Lyman limit? Wait, the Lyman limit is at 91 nm, which is even shorter, so observed 790 nm would be z= (790/91) -1 ≈8.79.

Wait, that's a much higher redshift. So z≈7.79. Let me check: 91 nm rest, observed 790 is 790/91 ≈8.68 → z=7.68.

Wait, that would mean the redshift is much higher, around z=7.7. Now, what's the comoving distance for z=7.7?

Hmm, that's way higher than the previous 5.5. So I need to compute D_C at z=7.7.

But given the parameters, let's think about what the comoving distance would be.

Wait, but I'm getting confused about which emission line it is. The question says the peak is at 790 nm, and flux drops below that. Quasars typically have strong emission lines in UV, like Lyman-alpha. If the peak is in near infrared, perhaps it's the Lyman-alpha line redshifted.

Alternatively, maybe it's the Lyman break. The Lyman series ends at 91 nm, so anything beyond that is redshifted into the visible or infrared. So, if the observed peak is around 790, that would correspond to a Lyman-alpha line at z= (790/121.6)-1= around 5.5.

But let's clarify: the Lyman-alpha emission line is at 121.6 nm rest. If the observed wavelength is 790, then (790/121.6)=6.5, so z=5.5.

So, comoving distance for z=5.5.

But earlier, my approximation suggested about 9.5 Gpc. But the options don't have that; the highest is C)9 Gpc. So perhaps the correct answer is around 9 Gpc, which is option C.

But wait, perhaps I should use the proper formula for comoving distance.

Wait, another approach is to use the approximation for the comoving distance in a flat Lambda-CDM universe. There are look-up tables or approximate formulas, but I don't remember them exactly.

Alternatively, using the approximation that for a flat universe with Ω_m=0.3 and Ω_Λ=0.7, the comoving distance at redshift z is given by:

D_C = (c / H0) * f(z),

where f(z) is an integral function.

I think for z=5, f(z) is about 2.0, for z=10, it's about 2.8.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, I can think about the relation between lookback time and comoving distance.

Wait, the lookback time at z=5.5 is about 10 billion years, perhaps. Then, comoving distance would be c multiplied by the lookback time, but that's only if the universe were not expanding. But in reality, it's more complex.

Alternatively, I can think about the co-moving distance for a flat universe. There's an online calculator, but since I can't access that, I can only approximate.

Wait, I found a source (from memory) that for a flat universe with Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, the comoving distance D_C (in Gpc) can be approximated as follows:

At z=1 → ~1.7 Gpc
z=2 → ~3.3 Gpc
z=3 → ~4.9 Gpc
z=4 → ~6.3 Gpc
z=5 → ~7.6 Gpc
z=6 → ~8.8 Gpc
z=7 → ~9.8 Gpc
z=8 → ~10.7 Gpc
z=9 → ~11.5 Gpc
z=10 → ~12.2 Gpc

Wait, if that's the case, then at z=5.5, D_C is about 8 Gpc (since z=5 is 7.6, z=6 is 8.8). Hmm, 5.5 is halfway between 5 and 6, so maybe around 8.2 Gpc. The options are A)6, B)8, C)9, D)7.

So 8.2 would be closest to B)8 Gpc.

Wait, but earlier with my integral approximation, I got around 9.5 Gpc. So perhaps my initial approach was wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the source I'm recalling is correct.

Wait, another approach: the comoving distance scales with the integral of 1/E(z') dz'. For a fixed H0, the comoving distance in gigaparsecs is roughly proportional to the integral.

So for z=5, D_C ≈7.6 Gpc; z=6, 8.8 Gpc. So z=5.5 would be between 7.6 and 8.8. Let's say about 8.2 Gpc. So the closest option is B)8 Gpc.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral approach is more accurate. Let me compute the integral numerically.

But without a calculator, it's hard. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is around 8 Gpc, so option B.

Wait, but the options given are A)6, B)8, C)9, D)7.

Wait, another approach: in a flat universe with Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, the luminosity distance for z=5.5 is about 13 Gpc, but the comoving distance is smaller than the luminosity distance.

Wait, no, wait: luminosity distance D_L = (1+z) * D_C. So if D_L is 13 Gpc, D_C would be 13/(1+5.5) ≈ 2 Gpc. No, that can't be right because that would suggest a lower D_C than earlier estimates.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The comoving distance D_C is the distance at which the object would appear if the universe were not expanding. The luminosity distance is D_L = (1+z) * D_C. So for a given D_L, D_C is D_L/(1+z).

But I'm not sure about the exact values. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation formula for D_C in terms of redshift.

Wait, perhaps using the formula from the book or online: For a flat universe (Ω_k=0), the comoving distance is:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫_0^z [1 / sqrt(Ω_m(1+z')^3 + Ω_Λ)] dz'.

But without solving it numerically, I can't get the exact value. However, I can use some approximation methods.

Another approach: Use the approximation for E(z) when z is large. For z >>1, the matter term dominates, but actually no—when z is large, if Ω_Λ is dominant, dark energy would dominate. Wait, because Ω_Λ is 0.7, which is more than Ω_m=0.3. So at high z, like z=5.5, the dark energy term is negligible compared to the matter term? Wait, no, because (1+z)^3 at z=5.5 is (6.5)^3=274.6. So Ω_m*(1+z)^3 =0.3 * 274.6=82.38. Ω_Λ is 0.7. So 82.38 >> 0.7, so the matter term dominates.

Wait, but wait: E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m(1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ) = sqrt(82.38 + 0.7) = sqrt(83.08)≈9.114.

So, E(z)=9.114. So for large z, E(z)≈sqrt(0.3 (1+z)^3 ).

So the integrand 1/E(z) ≈ 1/(sqrt(0.3) (1+z)^(3/2)) )= 1/(0.5477 (1+z)^1.5 )

The integral from 0 to z is dominated by the matter term. So the integral becomes:

∫ dz' / E(z') ≈ 1/sqrt(0.3) ∫ (1+z')^{-3/2} dz'

Which is 1/sqrt(0.3) * [ (-2)/(1+z')^{1/2} ) ] from 0 to z.

So, it's (1/sqrt(0.3)) * [ 2 - 2/(1+z) ) ].

At z=5.5, 1+z=6.5. So 2 - 2/6.5 = 2 - 0.3077= 1.6923.

Multiply by 1/sqrt(0.3)≈1.826:

1.6923 * 1.826 ≈3.092.

So the integral is approximately 3.092.

Then, D_C = (c/H0) * 3.092.

c=3e5 km/s, H0=70 km/s/Mpc.

c/H0= 3e5 /70 ≈4285.7 Mpc.

So D_C=4285.7 *3.092 ≈4285.7 *3 ≈12857 Mpc → 12.857 Gpc. But this is way higher than the options given.

Hmm, that can't be right because earlier I thought for z=5.5, D_C would be about 8 Gpc. So where is the mistake?

Wait, no, because if the dark energy term is being neglected, and the universe is matter-dominated at z=5.5, then the comoving distance should be larger. Wait, but earlier, when I considered the source's table, I thought D_C at z=5 is 7.6 Gpc, which is way less than 13 Gpc.

So my approximation must be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a more precise integral, considering both terms.

But without numerical integration, it's tough. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D)7 Gpc, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: using the approximation formula for comoving distance in a flat universe.

The formula is:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫_{0}^{z} [1 / ( (Ω_m (1+z')^3 + Ω_Λ )^{1/2} ) ] dz'

But given the parameters, this integral can be approximated using look-up tables or online calculators.

Wait, perhaps I can use an online calculator. But since I can't do that, I'll have to think.

Alternatively, I can use the approximation from the "cosmology calculator" by Ned Wright or similar. From what I remember, for a flat universe with Ω_m=0.3 and Ω_Λ=0.7, the comoving distance at z=5 is about 7.6 Gpc, and at z=6, about 8.8 Gpc. So for z=5.5, it would be about 8.2 Gpc, which is close to option B)8 Gpc.

Wait, but another source says that for z=5, 7.6 Gpc. So if z=5.5 is approximately 8 Gpc, then B is the right option.

Wait, but the options are A)6, B)8, C)9, D)7. So B is 8 Gpc. So the answer would be B.

But earlier, when I considered that the peak is at 790 nm due to Lyman-alpha, the redshift is about 5.5, and the comoving distance is around 8 Gpc, so B is the answer.

Alternatively, if the peak is due to a different emission line, the redshift would be lower, but I think Lyman-alpha is the most likely.

Wait, another thought: quasars often have a Lyman-alpha forest, but the main emission lines are in the rest UV. So the peak in near-infrared suggests a high redshift.

So, putting it all together, the quasar is at a redshift of about 5.5, and the comoving distance is around 8 Gpc, so the answer is B)8 Gpc.


The question involves determining the comoving distance of a quasar from Earth in a flat Lambda-CDM universe with the following parameters: Hubble constant \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \), matter density parameter \( \Omega_m = 0.3 \), dark energy density parameter \( \Omega_\Lambda = 0.7 \). Observations of the quasar show a peak at a wavelength of 790 nm, with flux dropping significantly below this wavelength. This suggests the peak corresponds to a redshifted emission line, most likely the Lyman-alpha line of hydrogen, which has a rest wavelength of 121.6 nm.

### Step 1: Calculate the redshift
The redshift \( z \) is determined using the formula:
\[
z = \frac{\text{observed wavelength}}{\text{rest wavelength}} - 1
\]
Substituting the observed wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 790 \, \text{nm} \) and the rest wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 121.6 \, \text{nm} \):
\[
z = \frac{790}{121.6} - 1 \approx 5.528
\]

### Step 2: Comoving distance formula
The comoving distance \( D_C \) in a flat universe is given by:
\[
D_C = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^z \frac{dz'}{\sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \Omega_\Lambda}}
\]
Here, \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \) is the speed of light, and \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \). The integral depends on the cosmological parameters \( \Omega_m \) and \( \Omega_\Lambda \).

### Step 3: Approximate the integral
For \( z \approx 5.5 \), the matter density term \( \Omega_m (1+z)^3 \) dominates over the dark energy term \( \Omega_\Lambda \). Approximating the integral using known values for a flat universe with \( \Omega_m = 0.3 \) and \( \Omega_\Lambda = 0.7 \), the comoving distance at \( z = 5.5 \) is closest to 8 Gpc, based on standard cosmological look-up tables or approximations.

### Step 4: Evaluate the options
The options provided are:
- **A) 6 Gpc**
- **B) 8 Gpc**
- **C) 9 Gpc**
- **D) 7 Gpc**

From the analysis, the comoving distance for \( z \approx 5.5 \) aligns most closely with **8 Gpc**.

ANSWER: B
