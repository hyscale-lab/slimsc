Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I remember that the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That's a mouthful. Let me try to draw its structure mentally. It looks like it's a molecule with two double bonds. Each of those double bonds is probably between carbons. So, maybe it's a diene or something more complex. Wait, looking closer, each end has a CH2 group attached to a C=CH structure. So, perhaps it's a conjugated diene or has multiple double bonds.

The data given includes the enthalpy of atomization for carbon, which is 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, right, atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in an element to make atoms. So for carbon, which is in a solid state, breaking all bonds to get C atoms. Then there are bond energies for H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds.

Wait, the problem asks for the enthalpy of formation, but the approach usually involves using bond energies. Oh right, I think the method is to calculate the energy required to break all bonds in the elements (reactants) and then form all bonds in the product. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around—formation is when elements form the compound, so perhaps we calculate the energy change.

Alternatively, I remember that the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the formula:

ΔHf° = (sum of bond energies of reactant bonds) - (sum of bond energies of product bonds) ?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The enthalpy of formation is the energy change when elements form one mole of the compound. So, if I'm forming the compound from its elements, I have to account for the bonds broken in the elements and the bonds formed in the compound.

Wait, but the bond energies given include H-H
