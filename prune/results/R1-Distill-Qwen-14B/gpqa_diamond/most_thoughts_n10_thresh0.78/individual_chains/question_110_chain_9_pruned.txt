Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs. From the question, I see that each has a different brightness limit for the stars they can observe. ESPRESSO can detect stars with V magnitudes up to 17, while HIRES can go down to 16. So any star that's brighter than 17 mag in V will be observable by ESPRESSO, and anything brighter than 16 mag can be seen by HIRES.

Wait, but wait. The question is asking which stars can be detected by both. So a star has to be observable by both instruments. That means the V magnitude of the star must be less than or equal to 16 because HIRES can't see beyond 16. Because if a star is brighter than 17, ESPRESSO can see it, but HIRES can't unless it's brighter than 16. So a star must have V magnitude â‰¤16 to be seen by both.

Wait, no. Wait. Let me clarify. Let's think: ESPRESSO observes stars brighter than 17, meaning any star with V <17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so V <16. So for a star to be detected by both, its V mag must be less than 16. Because if it's 16.5, HIRES can't see it, but ESPRESSO can. So stars with V mag <=16 can be seen by both.

Wait, no, wait again. Wait, the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. Oh, wait, wait. That wording is a bit tricky. Brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So if a star's apparent magnitude is brighter than 17, that's apparent V mag <17. Because lower magnitude numbers are brighter. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V <17.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with V <16. So for a star to be detected by both, it must have V <16. Because that's the brighter limit for both. Because if it's V=16.5, ESPRESSO can see it (since 16.5 <17), but HIRES can't (since 16.5>16). So for a star to be seen by both, it has to be V <16.

Wait, but let me think again. If a star's apparent magnitude is 16.5, then for ESPRESSO (limit 17), 16.5 is okay. For HIRES, limit is 16, so 16.5 is too faint. So only stars with V <=16 can be seen by both.

So now, let's look at the stars given:

Star1: Absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. So apparent magnitude is calculated using the distance modulus: V = V_abs + 5 log10(d/10). So d=10, log(1) =0. So V=15.5 +0=15.5. So apparent V is 15.5, which is <16. So it's observable by both.

Star2: Apparent V mag 16.5. That's higher than 16, right? So for HIRES, which can only go up to 16, this star is too faint for HIRES. But ESPRESSO can see it since 16.5 <17? Wait, no: 16.5 is less than 17? No, 16.5 is less than 17? Wait, 16
