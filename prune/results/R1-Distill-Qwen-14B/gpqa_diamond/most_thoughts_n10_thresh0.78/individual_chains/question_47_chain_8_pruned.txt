Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to identify a compound based on its spectroscopic data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, looking at the IR data. The strong bands in the 3420 and 3325 cm^-1 regions are probably from N-H stretches. Those are usually around there for amines or amides. Also, the strong band at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group. That could be an ester, amide, or maybe a ketone. But given the presence of N-H, it's more likely an amide or an ester with an amine somewhere.

Now, moving on to the 1H NMR. Let's list the peaks:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is a triplet, which usually corresponds to a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl ester's methyl. So maybe there's an ethyl group somewhere, like an ethyl ester or ethyl amide.

- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet with 2H. A broad peak often indicates exchange, like NH2 or maybe an -OCH2- group where the protons are split but maybe not visible here or something else. But since there's an N-H in the IR, maybe this is -NHCH2- or something else. Wait, or maybe it's an ethyl group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O or N. But the broadness makes me think it's not an ethyl ester. Maybe it's an N-linked group? Or perhaps it's part of an amide.

- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quartet, 2H. That's a quartet, which is usually a CH2 next to another CH2. Like in an ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 group. Wait, the ethyl group in an ester would have a triplet at around 1.2 (the methyl) and a quartet at around 4.1 (the CH2 connected to O). But here, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Maybe it's a different environment, like near an electronegative atom. Alternatively, could it be part of a carbamate or amide?

Wait, let me think about the coupling. The quartet at 4.5 with 2H—maybe it's an OCH2 group. If this is part of an ester, like OCH2CO, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if it's a CH2 connected to an amide group, but I don't know. Let me hold that thought.

- 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): These are two doublets each integrating to 2H. That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. So the compound has a benzene ring with two substituents in para positions. The lower field (higher ppm) is 8.0, which is typical for an electron-withdrawing group. The 7.0 could be from an electron-donating group, but wait, wait. Let me think: the two doublets might be from a benzamide or similar structure where the ring is substituted with amide and another group.

Wait, another possibility: para-substituted benzene with two different groups. Like, for example, one substituent is an amino group and the other is an ester or something else. Or maybe it's an ortho, meta, para arrangement, but the doublets suggest they are opposite each other, so para.

Putting it all together: The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C9H11NO2. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens (X=0). So (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2 = 10/2=5. Five degrees: probably one ring (benzene, which is 3) and maybe a carbonyl (another 1), and amide (which is another 1) but wait, the amide would contribute to the ring? Maybe. Alternatively, benzene (3), carbonyl (1), and an amide (but that's part of the ring maybe). Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the options given. The options are:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide
B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide
C) 4-aminophenyl propionate
D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate

Let me analyze each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. Benzamide is C6H5CONH2. So adding an ethoxy would make it C6H4(OCH2CH3)CONH2. Let's count the carbons: 6 (benzene) + 3 (ethoxy) + 2 (amide) = 11? Wait, molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see: Benzamide is C7H7NO2. Adding ethoxy (which is OCH2CH3, adding 2 carbons) would make it C9H9NO2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, that's two hydrogens more. So maybe this isn't the correct option.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure: formamide is HCONH2, but here it's N-substituted. So the structure would be O=C(NHPhOEt)–, where Ph is the phenyl group. Let me count the carbons: phenyl (6) + ethoxy (2) + formamide (1 C from the CO). So 6 +2 +1 =9. The formula would be C9H11NO2? Let's calculate. Phenyl is C6H5. Ethoxy is OCH2CH3 (C2H5O). Formamide is HCONH-. So putting it together: C6H5-O-CH2CH2-NH-CO-... Wait, no, the structure is Ar-O-CH2CH3 connected to the N of formamide. So the structure is HCONH-Ar-OEt. The molecular formula would be C6H5 (6 C, 5 H) + OCH2CH3 (2 C, 6 H) + HCONH2 (1 C, 2 H, 1 O, 1 N). Wait, no, the formamide is HCONR2, but in this case, it's HCON(4-ethoxyphenyl)2? No, wait, no: formamide is HCONH2. If it's N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, then it's HCONH-(4-ethoxyphenyl). So the molecular formula: C6H5-OCH2CH3 is 6+2=8 C, plus the formamide's HCO (1 C) gives 9 C. H count: benzene has 5 H (since one H is replaced by OEt), OEt has 5 H (since OCH2CH3 has 2 CH2 groups → 5 H?), formamide has NH and H. Let me sum:

Ph-OEt: C6H5-OCH2CH3 → 6 C, 5 H (from benzene) + 2*(CH2) → 2*2=4 H, but the O connects to CH2, which is attached to CH3. So the OCH2CH3 has 2 H on CH2 and 3 H on CH3, total 5 H. So benzene OEt has 5 (from benzene) + 5 (from OEt) = 10 H? Wait, not exactly. Benzene is C6H5 (5 H), OCH2CH3 is 2 H (on OCH2) and 3 H (on CH3). So total H in Ph-OEt is 5 + 2 +3 =10.

Then the formamide part is HCONH-(Ph-OEt). So HCONH would contribute 2 H (the one in HCO and the NH). So HCO has 1 H, NH has 1 H. So total H would be 10 (from Ph-OEt) + 2 (from HCONH) =12. Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2.

Wait, let's recount:

Ph-OEt: C6H5-OCH2CH3 → 6 C, 5 H (Ph) + 2 (CH2) +3 (CH3) → 5+5=10 H.

Formamide part: HCONH-Ph-OEt → H is 1 (from HCO) and 1 (from NH). So total H: 10 + 2 =12. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2, which has 11 H. So that's a discrepancy. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure of option B is O=C(NH-Ph-OEt)H. So formamide is HCONR2. So the structure is HCON(Ph-OEt)H. So in that case, the HCON has one H (from HCO) and one H from the NH. So total H would be: Ph-OEt (5+5=10 H) + 2 H from formamide → 12. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2, which has 11 H. So that doesn't add up. So maybe option B is not correct.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure would be CH2CH2COO-NH-C6H4-4-aminophenyl. Wait, wait. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure is CH2CH2COO-NH-C6H4-4-NH2? No, wait, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be CH2CH2COO-NH-C6H4-NH2. Hmm. Wait, the molecular formula would be:

Propionate: CH2CH2COO- → 3 C, 5 H (since COO- is O2, and the propionyl is CH2CH2COO).

4-aminophenyl: C6H5NH2 → but in this case, it's substituted at the para position with another group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me write it as:

The propionate would be O=C(O-)CH2CH2COO- attached to NH-C6H4-NH2? No, wait. The full structure would be: the amide is formed between the amino group of the phenyl and the propionic acid. So it's NH-C6H4-NHCOOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure would be CH2CH2COO-NH-C6H4-NH
