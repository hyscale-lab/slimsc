Okay, so I've got this physics question to think through. Let me read it again. The question is asking which of the given theories never requires regularization at high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, like infinities that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math work out so you can get finite, meaningful results. So the question is about which theory doesn't need this regularization when energies are high.

Let me think about each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a quantum theory that deals with strings as fundamental particles instead of point particles. Since it's a theory of quantum gravity, maybe it doesn't have the same issues as other quantum field theories. Wait, but I'm not sure. Does string theory require regularization? Or does it naturally avoid the divergences that other theories have?

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that at high energies (or equivalently, at short distances), QCD becomes weakly interacting because of asymptotic freedom. But wait, does that mean it doesn't have issues with divergences? Or does it still require regularization? I think QCD calculations often involve things like renormalization, which is related to regularization. So maybe it does require regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I remember that QED has processes leading to divergent integrals, like in calculating the electron self-energy or the Lamb shift. So regularization is definitely used here. Techniques like cutoff regularization, dimensional regularization, etc., are applied to handle these infinities. So QED requires regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh, wait, this is the classical version, not the quantum one. Classical theories don't have the same issues with divergences because they don't involve the same kind of infinities as quantum theories. For example, in Maxwell's equations, you can have point charges which have issues with self-energy, but in classical electromagnetism, we model things in a way that avoids these problems through other means, like using distributions or considering the fields' behavior. So, maybe classical electrodynamics doesn't need regularization because it's a classical theory and regularization is a quantum phenomenon.

Wait, but the question is about high energies. So in quantum theories, high energies can lead to high momentum transfers, which may cause divergences. But in classical theories, maybe they don't have the same issues. So which theory doesn't need regularization? The question is about which one never requires it, implying that the others do.

So, looking again: Superstring Theory is a quantum theory, so it would require regularization if it has the usual QFT divergences. But wait, string theory is background-dependent and perhaps doesn't have the same issues as point particle QFT because the stringy nature might smooth things out. Or maybe it's a matter of whether the theory is finite. I think
