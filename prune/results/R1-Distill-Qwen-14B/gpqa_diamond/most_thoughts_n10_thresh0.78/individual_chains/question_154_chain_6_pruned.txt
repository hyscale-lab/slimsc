Alright, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what information I'm given. Okay, the chemist found a white solid, and some spectral data is provided. I need to figure out which structure among the options it is.

First, the mass spectrum: the molecular ion is at m/z 156 with 100% abundance. There's another peak at m/z 158, 32%. Hmm, molecular ion suggests the molecular weight is 156. The other peak is 158, which is +2. That might indicate something like a chlorine isotope because Cl has a common isotope at about 35Cl (around 75% abundance) and 37Cl (about 25%). Wait, but the molecular ion is 156, and the peak at 158 is 32%, which is roughly 32/100 *100% = 32%. Wait, that might be the M+2 peak. So the molecular formula probably includes chlorine because M+2 for Cl is about 35Cl and 37Cl. Let me think, if the molecular weight is 156 and considering Cl as part of it, the formula might be C8H5ClO2 or something similar. Let's check the options.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So the formula would be C7H6ClO2. Molecular weight: C is 12*7=84, H is 6, Cl is about 35, O is 16*2=32. Total is 84+6+35+32=157. Wait, but the molecular ion is 156. Hmm, that's a problem. Unless the formula is without the hydroxyl or something else. Or maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde structure: benzaldehyde with Cl at position 3 and OH at position 2. So benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Adding Cl and another O? Wait, no, the formula would be C7H5ClO2? Let me recalculate. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Adding a Cl (35) and another O (16), so 7*12=84, 6*1=6, 35, 16*2=32. 84+6=90, +35=125, +32=157. So molecular weight is 157, but the given is 156. So option A would be 157, so that's not matching. Maybe I'm wrong here.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Adding Cl: so molecular formula C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight: 12*7=84, 5*1=5, 35, 16*2=32. 84+5=89, +35=124, +32=156. Oh, that matches the molecular ion at 156. So B could be a possibility.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. That's Cl-CO-O-Ph. Ph is C6H5. So the formula would be C7H5ClO2. Same as option B. Molecular weight is same as B, 156. So both B and C have same molecular weight.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Same as B, but the Cl is in position 2. So molecular formula is same: C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight 156. So D is also possible.

So the molecular ion is 156, so any of B, C, D could fit because their molecular weights are 156. The peak at 158 suggests presence of Cl (since +2 is likely from Cl isotope).

Now, looking at the IR data. Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. That usually indicates O-H stretching. Benzoic acid would have a broad O-H stretch because it's a carboxylic acid. Phenyl chloroformate has an ester group, but the O-H would be from where? Wait, phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. That's an acyl chloride? No, wait, chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-... Maybe I'm getting that wrong. Wait, chloroformate is O=C(O-Ph)Cl. So in that structure, there's an ester group (O-CO-O?), no, wait, chloroformate is an acyl chloride? Or maybe not. Wait, I might be confusing terms. Alternatively, maybe chloroformate has a structure like Cl-CO-O-R. So the functional groups present are an ester and an acyl chloride? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, maybe it's an acyl chloride but connected to a phenyl group. But in any case, if it's an acyl chloride, the IR would show a strong peak around 1770-1800 cm^-1, but the given IR has a peak at 1720 cm^-1. Benzoic acid would have a carbonyl around 1700 cm^-1, maybe a bit higher. So 1720 is in the range for a carbonyl, perhaps an ester or an acid.

Wait, the IR also has a broad peak in 3500-2700. Benzoic acid has a broad O-H stretch from the carboxylic acid. Phenyl chloroformate may have an O-H if it's an ester, but I'm not sure. Wait, in chloroformate, the structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the carbonyl is connected to O and Cl. Wait, that would be an acyl chloride perhaps. Because the structure Cl-CO-O-Ph would actually be an acyl chloride if the O is connected to Cl. Wait, no, acyl chloride is R-COCl. So in this case, chloroformate would be Ph-O-COCl. So the functional groups would be an ester (O) and a chloride. Wait, but if it's an ester, the carbonyl would be around 1700-1750. The IR here shows 1720, which is in that range. But the broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 would suggest O-H. So if the compound has a hydroxyl group, that would explain the broad peak. But phenyl chloroformate (Cl-CO-O-Ph) doesn't have an -OH group, right? So the broad peak might not fit unless it's something else, like a carboxylic acid.

Wait, let me
