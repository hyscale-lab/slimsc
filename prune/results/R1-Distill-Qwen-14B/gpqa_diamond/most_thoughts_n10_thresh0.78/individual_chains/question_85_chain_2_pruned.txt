Okay, so I've got this question about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors like the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. Oh, right, albedo is the same for both, so that cancels out.

Wait, the question gives the star's parameters. The star's mass is 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. I think the luminosity of the star is important here because equilibrium temperature is proportional to the square root of (star's luminosity divided by (distance squared)).

But wait, how do I find the luminosity of the star? Oh, right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff⁴. So L is proportional to R² T_eff⁴.

Let me calculate the star's luminosity relative to the Sun. The Sun's luminosity is L_sun = 4πR_sun²σT_sun⁴. So for the star, L_star = (R_star/R_sun)^2 * (T_star/T_sun)^4.

Given R_star is 1.2 R_sun, T_star is 6300 K, and T_sun is, let me think, about 5778 K. So:

L_star/L_sun = (1.2)^2 * (6300/5778)^4.

Wait, let me compute that. 1.2 squared is 1.44. 6300 divided by 5778 is roughly 1.09, maybe 1.0905? Let's compute (1.09)^4: 1.09^2 is about 1.1881, then squared again gives about 1.41. So (1.09)^4 ≈ 1.41.

So L_star ≈ 1.44 * 1.41 = about 2.033. So the star is roughly twice as luminous as the Sun.

Now, the equilibrium temperature formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) / sqrt( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). Wait, no, maybe I should write it correctly.

The equilibrium temperature (assuming no greenhouse effect and a circular orbit) is given by:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The formula I think is:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

But wait, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Alternatively, the formula can be written as:

T_eq = ( L / (16 π σ a² (1 - A) ) )^(1/4 )

Since L = 4π R_star^2 σ T_star^4.

So substituting L into T_eq:

T_eq = [ (4π R_star^2 σ T_star^4 ) / (16 π σ a^2 (1 - A)) ) ]^(1/4 )
= [ (R_star^2 T_star^4 ) / (4 a^2 (1 - A)) ) ]^(1/4 )
= T_star * ( R_star / (2 a ) )^(1/2 ) * (1/(1 - A)) )^(1/4 )

So yeah, the formula I had before is correct.

So the ratio of T_eq1 to T_eq2 would be the product of the ratios involving R_star/(2a) and (1/(1-A)) raised to the respective 1/2 and 1/4.

But wait, since both planets
