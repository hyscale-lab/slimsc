Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a spin 1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, I remember that spin 1/2 particles, like electrons, have their own magnetic moments. The question is about what happens when the magnetic field direction is changed suddenly.

Let me read the problem again. The particle's magnetic moment mu is given as gamma times Sz. Oh wait, right, the magnetic moment mu is usually proportional to the spin angular momentum, with gamma being the gyromagnetic ratio. So mu = gamma * S, but here it's written as mu = gamma * Sz. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Oh wait, maybe in this context, they're considering the component along a specific axis, like the direction of the magnetic field.

Initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. So the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with this field. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, same magnitude B. Oh wait, so the magnetic field changes direction from Z to Y. And we're to find the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, when the magnetic field is applied along a different axis, the Hamiltonian changes. The energy levels will depend on the new field direction. So before the field change, the particle was in an eigenstate of Sz with some energy. But when the field switches to Y, the Hamiltonian now depends on S_y or maybe S_z? Wait, the magnetic moment interacts
