Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about the Michael addition reaction. I remember that the Michael reaction is a conjugate addition where a nucleophile attacks the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The product is an enolate ion, which is resonance-stabilized. So, I need to apply this concept to the given reactions.

Let's look at each part of the question separately.

First reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). The product is labeled as A.

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diester with two malonate groups. It can act as a Michael donor. The other component is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, wait. No, wait. Let me think. The formula is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C6H4-tolyl ester? Or maybe I'm mixing up the positions.

Wait, wait, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is probably CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. Because acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-, but if the substituent is at the 3 position, that would be the alpha and beta carbons. Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me clarify: the acrylate group has the structure CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. So if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, that would mean the p-tolyl group is attached to the central carbon of the acrylate. So the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. Oh wait, no that canâ€™t be because that would make it a substituted acrylate. Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 but with a p-tolyl group on the third carbon? Hmm, maybe I should draw it out.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with the p-tolyl group on the acrylate. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that this is an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (an acrylate), which is a good Michael acceptor.

So the Michael donor here is dimethyl malonate, which is a conjugate base. Wait, no, dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOCH3)2. It's a good nucleophile because
