Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities, and I'm trying to figure out which one is the highest. Hmm, let's break it down.

The question gives four options, a to d, each describing a planet with different characteristics. I remember that density is mass divided by volume, right? So I'll need to calculate the density for each case to compare.

Let me start by recalling the formula: density = mass / volume. Oh wait, and volume for a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So the radius plays a big role in the volume, which affects the density.

Looking at each option:

Option a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So Earth's mass is about 5.97e24 kg, and radius is around 6.37e6 meters. But wait, the question is about density. Earth's density is known; it's about 5.5 g/cm³. So this planet has the same mass and radius as Earth, so its density should be 5.5 g/cm³. That's the same as Earth.

Option b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but the density is given directly. So its density is 5.5, same as Earth. So this planet's density is already known, so it's same as a. But wait, the mass is higher. Oh, but the question is about which has the highest density. So same as a, so same density.

Option c) A planet with the same composition as Earth
