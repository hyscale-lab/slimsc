Alright, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy levels. Let me try to work through it step by step.

Okay, the question is about the |3,0,0> state decaying to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. Hmm, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, transitions happen between different energy levels, and these are governed by the selection rules.

Wait, dipole transitions... right, the selection rules for electric dipole transitions are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Oh, and for electrons in hydrogen, the principal quantum number n can change by any integer, but in practice, for dipole, it's usually Δn = ±1, but sometimes higher changes are possible if other transitions are allowed.

Wait no, wait. For electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are:

Δl = ±1,
Δm = 0, ±1,
and Δn can be any integer as long as l changes by ±1. But wait, no, wait. No, I think the Δn can be any, but for a dipole transition, the l must change by exactly ±1. Oh right, so n can go from 3 to, say, 2 or 4, but in this case, the transition is from 3 to 1. Oh wait, but the question says it's a two-step transition, right? So 3 → 2 → 1. Because going from 3 to 1 in one step would require a change of l by 2, which is not allowed for dipole transitions.

So the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. To transition via dipole, the next state must have l=1 because l must change by ±1. So from l=0, next l can only be 1. So the first transition would be to n=2, l=1, m=0 or ±1.

Wait, but the starting m is 0. So after first transition, m can be -1, 0, +1. But then in the next transition, we have to go to |1,0,0>. So the second transition must go from l=1 back to l=0. Because the final state is l=0.

So the first step is 3,0,
