Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs. But their detection limits vary. The question says ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, and HIRES can observe up to V mag 16. So, the star's apparent magnitude must be below (brighter than) 17 for ESPRESSO and below 16 for HIRES. Wait, no, wait—if the magnitude is brighter (smaller number), it's easier to detect. So for a star to be observed by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤16.5 (since HIRES can go up to 16 V mag, but ESPRESSO can go to 17). So any star with apparent V mag ≤16 can be detected by both. If a star's apparent V is between 16 and 17, it can only be seen by ESPRESSO, not HIRES. And if it's above 17, neither can see it.

Now, I have to go through each star and calculate their apparent V magnitudes, considering any extinction (dust) if given. Because extinction makes stars appear dimmer (higher V mag). Oh wait, the question mentions that for Star3 and Star4, there's E(B-V) which affects the V band. The formula is given: the total absorption in V is A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). So I need to calculate the apparent magnitude, then add the absorption to get the observed magnitude.

Let me process each star:

Star1: Absolute V =15.5 mag, distance 10 pc. So apparent V is m = M + 5 +5 log d (wait, the formula is m = M +5 log (d/10)), where d is in parsecs. So d=10, log(10/10)=log(1)=0. So m =15.5 +0 =15.5. So apparent V is 15.5. Since both instruments can detect up to 17, but HIRES can only go up to 16. So Star1's apparent mag is 15.5, which is below 16 and 17. So both can detect Star1.

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO", which is like m <17. But HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so m <16. So Star1 has m=15.5, which is less than 16, so both can observe it.

Star2: Apparent V is 16.5 mag, located at 5 pc. So no extinction given here. Hmm, so apparent V is 16.5. Now, can HIRES observe it? HIRES can go up to 16. So 16.5 is higher than 16, so HIRES can't see it. But ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so it can. So Star2 can't be detected by both, only ESPRESSO.

Star3: Apparent V is given as 15.5 mag, but E(B-V) is 0.6. So A_V =3.1 *0.6=1.86. So the observed apparent V would be 15.5 +1.86=17.36. Wait, no, wait. Wait, extinction increases the apparent magnitude. So the star's light is dimmed, making it appear fainter, so higher magnitude. So Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, but after extinction, it becomes 15.5 +1.86 =17.36. So the observed V is 17.36. So ESPRESSO can't see it, because it's brighter than 17? Wait, no. Wait, ESPRESSO can observe stars with m <17. So 17.36 is higher than 17, so it can't be observed by ESPRESSO either. Wait, but wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." That's a bit confusing. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star's apparent magnitude is brighter (smaller number) than 17, then it can be observed. So if a star is m=17, it's at the limit. So Star3's apparent mag after extinction is 17.36, which is fainter than 17, so ESPRESSO can't observe it. HIRES can only go up to 16, so Star3's observed mag is 17.36, which is way beyond HIRES's limit. So Star3 can't be detected by either.

Wait, but wait, Star3's initial apparent magnitude is 15.5, but with extinction, it's 17.36. So that's the observed m. So neither can detect it. So Star3 is out.

Star4: Absolute V=15.5, distance 10 pc. So m (without extinction) is 15.5. E(B-V)=0.4, so A_V=3.1 *0.4=1.24. So observed m =15.5 +1.24=16.74. So m=16.74. Now, can both see it? HIRES requires m<16, so 16.74 is above, so HIRES can't. ESPRESSO allows m up to 17, so 16.74 is under 17, so ESPRESSO can. But HIRES can't. So Star4 can only be seen by ESPRESSO, not both.

Star5: Absolute V=16.5, distance=5 pc. So m (without extinction) is M +5 log (5/10) = 16.5 +5(log(0.5))=16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505≈14.995. So about 15.0 mag. No extinction given, so m=15.0. Which is below both 16 and 17. So both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect Star5.

Wait, let me check Star5 again. Absolute magnitude M is 16.5, distance is 5 pc. So m = M +5 log (d/10) =16.5 +5 log(0.5). Log(0.5) is about -0.301. Multiply by 5: -1.505. So m=16.5 -1.505=14.995, roughly 15. So apparent V is 15. Both instruments can detect it because 15 <16 and <17.

Wait, but Star5's M is 16.5, which is higher than Star1 and Star4, but since it's at 5 pc, the distance modulus brings it down to m=15. So both can detect it.

So let's go back to each star:

Star1: m=15.5 → both can see.

Star2: m=16.5 → only ESPRESSO can see.

Star3: m=17.36 → neither can see.

Star4: m=16.74 → only ESPRESSO can see.

Star5: m=15 → both can see.

Wait, wait. No. Wait, Star5's apparent magnitude is 15.0, which is less than 16 (HIRES) and 17 (ESPRESSO), so both can detect it.

So which stars can be detected by both? Star1 and Star5. Let me check the options.

The options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4's m=16.74, which is above HIRES's limit. So A is incorrect.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Star3 can't be detected by either, so B is incorrect.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Neither are, so C is incorrect.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1 can be detected by both, but Star4 can't be detected by HIRES. So D would be incorrect.

Wait, but wait. Wait, I thought Star1 and Star5 can be detected by both. So which option includes both Star1 and Star5? Looking at the options again:

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't be detected by HIRES, so no.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Star3 can't, so no.

C) Star2 and Star3 → no.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1 is good, but Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

Wait, but the only stars that both can detect are Star1 and Star5. But none of the options have both. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check Star5 again.

Star5's M is 16.5, distance 5 pc.

m = M +5 log (d/10) → 16.5 +5 log(0.5) → 16.5 -1.505 =14.995→15.0.

Yes, that's correct. So Star5 can be seen by both.

So the stars that can be seen by both are Star1 (m=15.5) and Star5 (m=15.0). Are there any others? Let me see.

Wait, Star1: m=15.5. HIRES can observe up to 16, so 15.5 is okay. So Star1 can be seen by both.

Star5: m=15.0, which is even better. So both can be detected.

So the question is, which option includes Star1 and Star5? Looking at the options, the options don't have an option that includes both. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star5 is in A.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Star5 is in B.

C) Star2 and Star3 → no.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1 is in D.

Wait, but the correct stars are Star1 and Star5. So none of the options have both. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with Star1. Let me recheck Star1.

Star1: M=15.5, distance 10 pc.

m = M +5 log(10/10) → 15.5 +0 → m=15.5.

So Star1's apparent mag is 15.5. HIRES can see up to 16, so 15.5 is fine. So Star1 is visible by both.

Star5: m=15.0, both can see.

So which option includes both? The options don't have an option that includes both. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, let me recheck the options.

The options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't be detected by both.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Star3 can't, so no.

C) Star2 and Star3 → no.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1 can, but Star4 can't.

Wait, but the question is which can be detected by both. So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1 and Star5.

But looking at the options, none of the options list both. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Star1 or Star5.

Wait, perhaps the question is which stars can be detected by both, not which options include both. So perhaps only one star in the options meets the condition.

Wait, looking again, the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4's m=16.74, which is above HIRES's limit. So only Star5 is visible by both.

But wait, Star5's m=15.0, which is within both. So in option A, only Star5 is visible by both. So A is incorrect because Star4 isn't.

In option B, Star3 and Star5. Star3's m=17.36, so neither can detect Star3. So only Star5 is in B, but B says both Star3 and Star5. So B is incorrect.

In option D, Star1 and Star4. Star1 can be detected by both. Star4 can be detected by ESPRESSO but not HIRES. So only Star1 in D is correct.

Wait, but the correct stars are Star1 and Star5. But none of the options have both. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Star5? Let me double-check.

Star5: M=16.5, d=5 pc.

m = M +5 log (d/10) =16.5 +5 log(0.5) → log(0.5)= -0.3010.

5 * (-0.3010) = -1.505.

16.5 -1.505 =14.995 → about 15.0.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm. So the correct stars are Star1 and Star5. But the options don't have an option that includes both. So perhaps the question is which option includes either Star1 and Star5.

Wait, the options are:

Option D: Star1 and Star4.

But Star4 isn't visible by both. So perhaps the only star visible by both is Star1 and Star5. But that's not an option.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formulas. Let me recheck.

Wait, distance modulus is m - M =5 log (d/10), right. So m = M +5 log (d/10).

Alternatively, some sources say it's 5 log (d) -5. Because d/10 is the same as d * (1/10), so log(d/10) = log d -1. So 5 log(d/10) =5 (log d -1) =5 log d -5.

So for Star1, d=10, log d=1. So 5(1) -5 =0. So m=15.5.

Star5: d=5, log(5)=approx 0.69897. So 5*0.69897=3.49485. So 5 log d -5=3.49485 -5= -1.505. So m=16.5 + (-1.505)=15.0. Correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I missed something else. Let me look at the other stars again.

Star4: M=15.5, d=10 pc, so m=15.5. E(B-V)=0.4 → A_V=1.24. So m_observed =15.5 +1.24=16.74. So that's above HIRES's 16 limit. So Star4 can't be observed by HIRES, so only ESPRESSO can.

Star5: m=15.0, no extinction. So both can see.

So which options have stars that are visible by both? Star1 and Star5.

The options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't, so only Star5 is common.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Star3 can't, so only Star5 is common.

C) Star2 and Star3 → neither can be seen by both.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1 can be seen by both, Star4 can't.

So the only correct stars are Star1 and Star5. But the options don't have a choice with both. So perhaps I made a mistake in determining which stars can be seen by both.

Wait, perhaps I should reconsider the maximum magnitudes allowed.

ESPRESSO: apparent V <17 mag can be observed.

HIRES: apparent V <16 mag can be observed.

So a star must have apparent V <16 to be seen by both.

Wait, wait, no. Because if a star's apparent V is, say, 16.5, then HIRES can't see it (since 16.5>16), but ESPRESSO can (since 16.5<17).

Wait, so for both to see it, the star's apparent V must be <16. So any star with m <16 can be seen by both.

So let's re-evaluate each star's apparent V (after extinction) and see if it's less than 16.

Star1: m=15.5 → both can see.

Star2: m=16.5 → only ESPRESSO can.

Star3: m=17.36 → neither can.

Star4: m=16.74 → only ESPRESSO can.

Star5: m=15 → both can.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1 and Star5.

Looking at the options again:

Which options include any of these? Star1 is in option D, and Star5 is in options A and B.

So looking for which options have both? None. So perhaps the correct answer is that only Star5 is in both options.

Wait, but the options are about which pair of stars can be detected by both. So perhaps the correct answer is that only Star5 can be detected by both, but I'm not seeing that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with Star3 and Star4. Let me see.

Star3: E(B-V)=0.6 → A_V=1.86. So m_observed =15.5 +1.86=17.36>17 → not observed by ESPRESSO.

Star4: m=15.5 → with A_V=1.24 → m=16.74>16, so HIRES can't see it.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the apparent V for Star5 is 15.0, which is <16, so both can see it.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1 and Star5.

Looking at the options, none have both, but perhaps I misread the options.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → only Star5 is in.

B) Star3 and Star5 → only Star5 is in.

C) Star2 and Star3 → neither.

D) Star1 and Star4 → only Star1 is in.

Wait, but the correct answer should include Star1 and Star5. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is which star can be detected by both, and the options only have a subset.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Star1's m.

Wait, let me do Star1 again.

Star1: M=15.5, d=10 pc.

m = M +5 log(d/10) → 15.5 +5 log(1) → log(1)=0 → m=15.5. So yes, correct.

So Star1's m is 15.5, which is <16, so both can see.

Star5's m is 15.0, so both can see.

So the correct stars are Star1 and Star5.

Looking at the options, which options have any of these?

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star1 is correct, but Star4 isn't.

Option A: Star4 and Star5 → only Star5 is correct.

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → only Star5 is correct.

So the only star that can be detected by both is Star5 and Star1. But the options don't have an option where both are included. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering that Star3 has E(B-V). Let me recheck.

Star3's data: apparent V=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So A_V=1.86. So m_observed=15.5+1.86=17.36. So can't be seen by either.

Star4: m=15.5 +1.24=16.74 → can't be seen by HIRES.

So the only stars that can be detected by both are Star1 and Star5.

But none of the options include both. So perhaps the correct answer is that only Star5 can be detected by both, but in the options, only option B includes Star5, but it also includes Star3, which can't.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement.

Wait, the question says that the stars can be detected with both spectrographs. So which stars meet that condition.

Let me list the stars that can be seen by both:

Star1: m=15.5 → both can see.

Star5: m=15.0 → both can see.

So the correct stars are Star1 and Star5. Now, looking at the options, none of the options include both. So perhaps the intended answer is that only Star5 is correct, but the options don't present that.

Wait, perhaps the only star that meets both is Star5, because Star1's m=15.5 is within both, but perhaps I have to see which options include any of the correct stars.

Wait, the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → only Star5.

B) Star3 and Star5 → only Star5.

C) Star2 and Star3 → none.

D) Star1 and Star4 → only Star1.

So if the question is which stars can be detected by both, and the options are pairs, the correct answer would be the options that include any of the correct stars.

Wait, but the correct stars are Star1 and Star5. So any option that includes either would be acceptable, but the question says 'which of the following stars can be detected with both ...' So it's about which stars are in both spectrographs' capabilities. So the correct stars are Star1 and Star5. So the options that include either would be D (Star1) and B (Star5). But the options are about which pair is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis of Star5. Let me check again.

Star5: M=16.5, d=5 pc.

m = M +5 log (5/10) → 16.5 +5 log(0.5) → 16.5 +5*(-0.3010) → 16.5 -1.505=14.995 →15.0.

So Star5's m=15.0, which is <16, so both can detect it.

So the correct answer would be any option that includes either Star1 or Star5, but the question asks which pair can be detected. Since the options don't have a pair that includes both, perhaps the intended answer is that only Star5 can be detected by both. But looking at the options, option B includes Star5 and Star3. Star3 can't be detected by either.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the extinction for Star3 and Star4.

Wait, for Star3, the apparent V is 15.5, but after extinction, it's 17.36, which is beyond both instruments.

Star4: m=15.5, extinction makes it 16.74. So Star4 can't be seen by HIRES, but can be by ESPRESSO.

So back to the original conclusion: the correct stars are Star1 (m=15.5) and Star5 (m=15.0). But the options don't have a pair with both.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the absolute magnitude and distance for Star1. Let me think again.

Star1: M=15.5, d=10 pc. So m =15.5 +5 log(10/10)=15.5.

So yes, correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the star's absolute magnitude is not the same as apparent magnitude. Wait, no. The formula is correct.

In that case, the correct answer would be that Star1 and Star5 can be detected by both, but the options don't include this pair. So perhaps the intended answer is that only Star5 is in the correct pair, but in the options, only option B includes Star5, but it's paired with Star3 which is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the extinction calculation for Star3 and Star4. Let me recheck.

For Star3:

E(B-V)=0.6 → A_V=3.1 *0.6=1.86.

So the observed m is 15.5 +1.86=17.36.

Which is above both instruments' limits.

Star4: E(B-V)=0.4 → A_V=1.24. m=15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So Star4's m=16.74. Which is above HIRES's 16 limit, but under ESPRESSO's 17 limit. So Star4 can be detected only by ESPRESSO.

So the only correct pair is Star1 and Star5. Since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is that only Star5 can be detected by both, but that's not in the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the distance modulus calculation for Star5.

Star5: M=16.5, d=5 pc.

m = M +5 log(d/10) → 16.5 +5 log(5/10) →5 log(0.5)=5*(-0.3010)= -1.505.

So m=16.5 -1.505=14.995≈15.0.

Yes, correct.

Hmm. Well, perhaps the intended answer is option D (Star1 and Star4), but that's incorrect because Star4 can't be seen by both. Or perhaps option B (Star3 and Star5), but that's incorrect because Star3 can't be seen.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the options again.

Let me list which stars can be detected by both:

Star1: yes.

Star2: no.

Star3: no.

Star4: no.

Star5: yes.

So the only stars that can be detected by both are Star1 and Star5.

Looking at the options, none of the options have both. So perhaps the intended answer is that only Star5 and Star1 can be detected by both, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is that no options are correct, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation for Star5.

Another approach: perhaps the question is asking which stars can be observed by both spectrographs, regardless of whether their magnitudes are within the limits. But that doesn't make sense because the question explicitly says they can be detected based on the magnitudes.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that both ESPRESSO and HIRES can observe stars with V mag less than their limits. So for a star to be detected by both, it must have m <16 (since HIRES's limit is lower). So which stars have m <16.

Let me recheck:

Star1: m=15.5 → yes.

Star5: m=15.0 → yes.

So the correct stars are Star1 and Star5.

But the options don't include both. So perhaps the question intended to have a different correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering whether the apparent magnitude includes extinction.

Wait, for Star5, there's no E(B-V), so no extinction. So m=15.0.

For Star1, no extinction, so m=15.5.

So both can be detected by both spectrographs.

Thus, the correct stars are Star1 and Star5.

Looking at the options, the only option that includes any of these is option D (Star1) and option B (Star5). But the options are about pairs, and the correct answer should include both.

Since none of the options include both, perhaps the correct answer is that neither of the options is correct. But that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering Star4's m.

Wait, Star4: M=15.5, d=10 pc → m=15.5. E(B-V)=0.4 → A_V=1.24 → m_observed=16.74.

HIRES can't see it, but ESPRESSO can. So Star4 can't be in the correct pair.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps the intended answer is option D, but that's incorrect because Star4 can't be detected by both.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A (Star4 and Star5). But Star4 can't be detected by both.

Wait, perhaps the question is which stars can be detected by either spectrograph, but the question says 'can be detected with both'. So they must be detectable by both.

Another approach: perhaps the question is about the stars that can be observed by both, meaning that both observatories can detect them, but perhaps the observatories have different skies accessible.

Wait, the question says to disregard the pointing limits and altitudes. So it's just about apparent magnitude.

So the correct answer is that Star1 and Star5 can be detected by both. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is that only Star5 is correct.

But looking at the options, option B includes Star5 and Star3. Star3 can't be detected by either, so option B is incorrect.

Hmm. Perhaps the correct answer is that only Star5 can be detected by both, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation for Star5.

Wait, Star5's M is16.5, d=5 pc.

m = M +5 log (d/10) =16.5 +5 log(5/10)=16.5 +5 log(0.5)=16.5 -1.505=15.0.

Yes, correct.

So perhaps the intended answer is option B (Star3 and Star5), but that's incorrect because Star3 can't be detected.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D (Star1 and Star4), but that's incorrect because Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem.

The question is: Which of the following stars can be detected with both spectrographs?

So the stars must have apparent V mag <16.

Which stars have apparent V mag <16 after considering extinction.

Star1: m=15.5 → <16 → yes.

Star2: m=16.5 → no.

Star3: m=17.36 → no.

Star4: m=16.74 → no.

Star5: m=15.0 → yes.

So the correct stars are Star1 and Star5.

But in the options, no option includes both.

So perhaps the intended answer is option B, but I think that's incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended Star1 and Star5, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the options. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4: m=16.74. HIRES can't see it. So only Star5 is correct.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Star3 can't, Star5 can.

C) Star2 and Star3 → neither.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1 can, Star4 can't.

So the only option that includes a star that can be detected by both is option B (only Star5) and D (only Star1).

But the question is about which pair can be detected by both.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Maybe the correct answer is that only Star5 can be detected by both, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that Star5 is the only one, so the option that includes Star5 is B, but that's not correct because it includes Star3.

Wait, perhaps I should think that only Star5 can be detected by both, so the correct option is B, but that's wrong because Star3 can't. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that only Star1 can, so option D is correct, but that's also wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that only Star5 can be detected by both, but the options don't have a single-star option. So perhaps the intended answer is option B, but I think that's incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in Star1's distance modulus.

Wait, Star1's distance is 10 pc. So m = M +5 log (d/10) → 15.5 +5 log(1) → 15.5.

Yes, correct.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. The correct stars are Star1 and Star5. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option D, but that's incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that only Star5 can be detected by both, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is Star1 and Star5, but since the options don't include that, perhaps the intended answer is that only Star5 is correct, which would be in options A and B.

But looking at the options, the only option that includes Star5 is A and B. But in those options, the other star isn't correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I'll have to make a decision.

The correct stars are Star1 and Star5. But the options don't have that pair. So perhaps the intended answer is that only Star5 can be detected by both, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is not requiring both stars to be correct, but any of them. But the question is 'which of the following stars can be detected with both...', implying any that can be.

But the options are pairs. So the correct answer is the option that includes any star that can be detected by both.

So among the options, both Star1 and Star5 are correct, but the options don't have a pair with both.

Thus, perhaps the intended answer is option D, but I think that's incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but that's incorrect.

But I'm stuck, and I think I should proceed to the conclusion based on the initial analysis.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars, considering extinction where applicable. The detection limits are as follows:

- **ESPRESSO**: Stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag (i.e., $m < 17$).
- **HIRES**: Stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 16 mag (i.e., $m < 16$).

For a star to be detected by both spectrographs, its apparent V magnitude must satisfy $m < 16$. Additionally, extinction (if given) is calculated using $A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V)$ and added to the apparent magnitude to account for dust.

### Analysis of Each Star:

1. **Star1**:  
   - $M = 15.5$, $d = 10$ pc, no extinction.  
   - Apparent magnitude: $m = M + 5 \log(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log(1) = 15.5$.  
   - After extinction: $m = 15.5$ (no extinction).  
   - **Conclusion**: $m = 15.5 < 16$, so Star1 can be detected by both spectrographs.

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent magnitude: $m = 16.5$, no extinction.  
   - **Conclusion**: $m = 16.5 > 16$, so Star2 cannot be detected by HIRES, only ESPRESSO.

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent magnitude: $m = 15.5$, $E(B-V) = 0.6$.  
   - Extinction: $A_V = 3.1 \cdot 0.6 = 1.86$.  
   - Observed magnitude: $m = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36$.  
   - **Conclusion**: $m = 17.36 > 17$, so Star3 cannot be detected by either spectrograph.

4. **Star4**:  
   - $M = 15.5$, $d = 10$ pc, $E(B-V) = 0.4$.  
   - Apparent magnitude: $m = M + 5 \log(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log(1) = 15.5$.  
   - Extinction: $A_V = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24$.  
   - Observed magnitude: $m = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74$.  
   - **Conclusion**: $m = 16.74 > 16$, so Star4 cannot be detected by HIRES, only ESPRESSO.

5. **Star5**:  
   - $M = 16.5$, $d = 5$ pc, no extinction.  
   - Apparent magnitude: $m = M + 5 \log(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log(0.5) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0$.  
   - **Conclusion**: $m = 15.0 < 16$, so Star5 can be detected by both spectrographs.

### Final Conclusion:
The stars that can be detected by both spectrographs are **Star1** ($m = 15.5$) and **Star5** ($m = 15.0$). However, none of the options provided include both stars. Among the given options, **Star5** is the only star that appears in multiple options, but none of the pairs are fully correct.
