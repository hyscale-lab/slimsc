Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully and think through each part step by step.

Alright, the question is about the luminosities of two stars. So, let me jot down what I know. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, and the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The astronomers assume the stars are black bodies when calculating luminosity. The question is asking by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

Hmm. Let's break this down. I remember that the luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. The formula I recall is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both are black bodies, this should apply to both stars.

But wait, the problem says they have the same wavelength where they appear brightest. For a black body, the wavelength at maximum emission (λ_max) is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.8977719 ×10^-3 m·K). If both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Oh, wait no! Because if λ_max is the same, then T would be the same. So, T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait a second. The radial velocities... Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, which probably means it's not moving towards or away from us, so its observed temperature wouldn't be affected by Doppler shift. But Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Oh, but wait, the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So, I think that the Doppler shift from Star_2's velocity would affect the observed wavelength. Oh, so we have to account for that.

Wait, no, the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So, their observed λ_max is same. But their actual temperatures might be different because of Doppler shift. Let me think again.

Wien's law is for the emitted wavelength
