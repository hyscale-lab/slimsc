Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about binary compounds of fluorine with another element Y. There are five such compounds, labeled A1 to A5. Hmm, I remember that fluorine often forms compounds with other elements, maybe something like YFₙ structures.

The problem starts with A1, which is a bright-red substance. It decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, around 20°C) into A2 and fluorine. So the decomposition reaction might look like A1 → A2 + F2 or something similar. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so maybe A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent itself, so perhaps A1 is a compound where Y is in a high oxidation state.

Then, A3 can interact with xenon and is obtained by fluorinating Y. So A3 is probably YF_x where Y is in a lower oxidation state. Maybe YF2, but I'm not sure yet.

Next, when Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated, colorless solution of A4, it forms A5. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. Wait, when a compound decomposes in water, maybe it's hydrolysis. For example, if A5 is a fluoride salt, it could hydrolyze into something else. Alternatively, if it's a metal fluoride, maybe it forms the corresponding hydroxide and HF.

Let me think about possible Y elements. Fluorine forms various compounds. Wait, maybe Y is something like oxygen? No, because oxygen would form compounds like OF2, but the problem says binary compounds with fluorine, so Y plus F. Alternatively, Y could be a halogen, like chlorine? No, because then YF would be ClF, but I'm not sure. Wait, another thought: maybe Y is an alkali metal, like K or Na. Because alkali metals form various fluoride compounds, and when you add the metal to a solution, maybe it's a displacement reaction.

Wait, A4 is a solution, so perhaps it's a fluoride of a metal. When Y is added in a 1:1 ratio, maybe Y displaces another metal in A4. For example, if A4 is Y'F, adding Y in 1:1 molar ratio could form YF and Y' metal. But I'm not entirely sure.

Another angle: the decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2. Let's think about known fluoride compounds. One possibility is that A1 is ClF3. Because ClF3 is a red-brown liquid at room temperature, but wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up with something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a compound like O2F2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A1 is OF2.
