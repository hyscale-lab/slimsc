Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about paramagnetic coupling and the hydrogen atom's transition energy. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step. 

First, the question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small, so I'm guessing that means m is like 0 or 1 or something small like that. 

The problem is asking me to compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which I recognize as the wavelength for the Balmer series transition, probably the H-alpha line. That's the transition from n=2 to n=1, but wait, no, Balmer is n=2 to n=1? Or wait, Balmer series is transitions to n=2, so H-alpha is n=3→n=2. Oh, but the specific wavelength might not matter as much as knowing the energy scale involved.

So, I need to find the ratio or compare the magnitudes of two terms: the paramagnetic term and the transition energy ΔE. Let's think about each term.

First, what's the paramagnetic coupling term? I remember that in the presence of a magnetic field, electrons experience a magnetic interaction. The Hamiltonian for the Zeeman effect is something like H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. The magnetic moment μ for an electron is given by μ = -(eħ)/(2m_e) * (L + 2S), but wait, for orbital magnetic moment, it's μ_L = (μ_B) * L, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Similarly, the spin part is μ_S = γ_s μ_B S, but since m is small, maybe we're focusing on the orbital part? Or perhaps it's the spin-orbit coupling? Wait, no, the question says paramagnetic coupling, which I think relates to the orbital magnetic moment. 

Wait, paramagnetic materials have electrons with unpaired spins, so maybe the coupling here is spin-orbit? Or maybe it's the orbital contribution. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me focus on the paramagnetic term.

The paramagnetic term in the Hamiltonian is typically H_para = -μ·B. For the orbital part, μ_L = (μ_B) * m_l * something? Wait, no. The orbital magnetic moment is μ_L = μ_B * L, where L is the orbital angular momentum. But L has magnitude sqrt(l(l+1))ħ, but when we're considering the energy shift due to the magnetic field, it's the dot product of μ and B. Since B is along Oz, let's say the z-axis, so the energy is H_para = -μ_L · B = -μ_B B m_l, where m_l is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Wait, no, because μ_L is proportional to L, which is m_l in the z-direction. So actually, H_para would be proportional to m_l * B. But in this problem, m is small, so m_l is small. But wait, the question says m is small, which I think refers to the orbital magnetic quantum number, m_l. So, m is the magnetic quantum number, so m can be -l, ..., 0, ..., +l. If l is 0, then m=0. For l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, but the paramagnetic coupling term would be proportional to m times B. But the transition energy ΔE is on the order of the energy levels of the hydrogen atom.

So, we need to calculate the paramagnetic term and compare it to ΔE.

First, let's figure out the order of magnitude of ΔE. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nm. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. Let's compute that.

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. c is speed of light, about 3e8 m/s. λ is 486.1e-9 meters.

E_photon = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (486.1e-9 m) ≈ (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (486.1e-9 m) ≈ 4.09e-17 J.

Wait, but what's the energy of the hydrogen transition? The Rydberg constant is about 13.6 eV for the ground state. The Balmer series transition is from n=2 to n=1, but wait, no, Balmer is n=→2 from higher states. Oh, wait, H-alpha is n=3→n=2. Let me compute the energy difference.

The energy levels of hydrogen are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So, E_2 is -13.6 /4 = -3.4 eV. E_3 is -13.6/9 ≈ -1.511 eV. The transition from n=3 to n=2 emits a photon with energy ΔE = E_2 - E_3 = (-3.4) - (-1.511) = -1.889 eV. The magnitude is about 1.889 eV. Converting that to joules: 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So ΔE ≈ 1.889 * 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.02e-19 J. 

Wait, earlier, the photon energy I calculated from the wavelength was about 4.09e-17 J, which is about 25 times larger than 3.02e-19 J. That can't be right. Oh wait, wait, the wavelength given is the wavelength of the emitted photon for the transition. So the energy ΔE should be E_photon. Wait, yes, because ΔE is the energy of the transition, which is the energy of the emitted photon. So I think I messed up earlier. Let me correct that.

So, given λ = 0.4861 μm = 486.1e-6 m? Wait, no, 0.4861 micrometers is 486.1 nanometers. Because 1 micrometer is 1e-6 meters, so 0.4861 μm is 486.1e-9 m.

E_photon = hc / λ.

Plugging in the numbers:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s,
c = 3e8 m/s,
λ = 486.1e-9 m.

E_photon = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486.1e-9)

Calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by λ: 1.9878e-25 / 486.1e-9 = 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7.

1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 ≈ 4.09e-19 J.

Convert to eV: 4.09e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV.

Wait, that's a big energy, but in terms of hydrogen transitions, the energy between levels is about 10s of eV. No, wait, earlier calculation of ΔE from n=3 to n=2 was about 1.889 eV, which aligns with a wavelength of about 121 nm (Lyman series), but H-alpha is 656 nm. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the Balmer series is transitions to n=2. So the transition from n=3 to n=2 is the H-alpha line, which has a wavelength of about 656 nm. Oh wait, so the given wavelength in the problem is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486 nm, which is the H-alpha line? No, wait, H-alpha is 656 nm. Wait, but 486 nm is the H-beta line, which is n=4→n=2. Oh wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the lines. Let me think: the Balmer series lines
