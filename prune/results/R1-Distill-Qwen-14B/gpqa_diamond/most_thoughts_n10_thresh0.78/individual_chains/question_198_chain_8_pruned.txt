Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the problem is about.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The concentration of cobalt is 1e-2 M, and thiocyanate is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Hmm. So first, I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex forms. The complex with the higher β will dominate. But since the question is about the percentage of a specific complex (I think the blue one is dithiocyanato, so maybe [Co(SCN)_2]^2+?), I need to calculate the fraction of that complex compared to all possible complexes.

Wait, so the complexes formed would be [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n), right? Because each SCN- is -1 charge. So for n=1, the complex is [CoSCN]^+; n=2, [Co(SCN)_2]^0; n=3, [Co(SCN)_3]^-; n=4, [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

But wait, the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So I think βn is the formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands. So βn = [complex]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^n).

But the problem is that each subsequent β may not be for adding another SCN- to the previous complex. I think the way it works is that each β is for the step-wise addition. So β1 is the constant for the first SCN- attaching: Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ [CoSCN]^+ ; β1=9.

Then β2 is the next step: [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_2]^0 ; β2=40.

Similarly, β3 would be for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_3]^- ; β3=63.

And β4 is [Co(SCN)_3]^- + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_4]^2- ; β4=16.

Wait, but I've heard that sometimes stability constants are given for the overall formation from the metal ion. So for example, β_total for [Co(SCN)_n] is the product of the step-wise βs up to n.

Wait, no, wait. Another approach: each βn is the formation constant for the nth complex. So [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) = βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

So the overall formation constants for each complex are β1, β2, etc. So each subsequent complex is formed with a certain β.

The problem is about the distribution of the cobalt species, so I need to find the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is the dithiocyanato complex. But wait, the question says "blue dithiocyanato", but I'm not sure if that's the Co(SCN)_2^0 or another species. Maybe it's [Co(SCN)_2]^(0), which is neutral.

So the approach would be to calculate the fraction of each possible complex (n=1 to n=4) based on their stability constants and the concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN^-.

The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, which is the sum of all the species: [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^2- = 1e-2 M.

Wait, but the solution also has SCN- at 0.1 M. So the concentrations are fixed, but the distribution among the complexes depends on the β values and the concentrations.

The general formula for the fraction of each complex is given by the product of the stability constant and the concentration terms. The fraction for each complex [Co(SCN)_n] is:

f_n = (β_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n) / Σ (β_m [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^m) for m=1 to 4, but wait, including m=0 (which is [Co^2+])?

Wait, I think the formula includes all possible complexes, including the free ion. So the denominator is the sum of all possible terms for each complex, including the free Co^2+.

Wait no, the free Co^2+ is just [Co^2+] which is part of the denominator when you consider each complex.

Wait, more accurately, the fraction f_n for [Co(SCN)_n] is:

f_n = (β_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n) / ( [Co^2+] + β_1 [Co^2+] [SCN^-] + β_2 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^2 + β_3 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^3 + β_4 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^4 )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all the species. So:

c_total = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN
