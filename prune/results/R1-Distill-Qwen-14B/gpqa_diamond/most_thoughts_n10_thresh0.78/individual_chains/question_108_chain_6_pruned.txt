Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small. Wait, but I'm not exactly sure how m being small plays into this. Oh right, m is the orbital quantum number, so it can be -1, 0, or +1 for p orbitals, and so on. But the problem says small m, so maybe m is like 0 or maybe 1? Not sure if that's important yet.

The main thing is comparing the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE. The transition energy is given with a wavelength λ of 0.4861 micrometers. Oh wait, 0.4861 micrometers is about the wavelength of the Balmer series in hydrogen, like the H-alpha line. So that transition is between n=2 and n=3 maybe? Or wait, for Balmer it's n=2 to n=1? No, wait, H-alpha is n=3 to n=2, right? Because Balmer is transitions to n=2. Oh yes, 3→2 is the H-alpha line, which has a wavelength around 656 nm. Wait but wait, 0.4861 micrometers is 486 nm, which is the Balmer's beta line, which is n=4→2. So that corresponds to a certain energy.

So the energy ΔE is the energy difference between two states. Let's think about how to calculate ΔE. The energy levels of hydrogen are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n², but wait, that's for the ground state. Wait, no, the Rydberg constant is about 13.6 eV, so E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So for n=2, E_2 is -13.6 /4 = -3.4 eV. For n=
