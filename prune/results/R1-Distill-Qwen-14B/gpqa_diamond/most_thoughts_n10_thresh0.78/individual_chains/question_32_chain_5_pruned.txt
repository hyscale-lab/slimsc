Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC for short. Hmm, the question is asking about the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is X, which is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li normally has 3 protons, and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6, I think. So X is Li-6.

I remember that relativistic particles require using special relativity formulas for their energy. The energy of a particle depends on its rest mass and its velocity. Since the speed is given as 0.96c, which is pretty high, relativistic effects are definitely important here.

So the formula for the total energy of a particle is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy, E = gamma * m0c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over the square root of (1 - v²/c²). 

First, I need to find gamma. Let me plug in v = 0.96c into the gamma formula. So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). Let me calculate that.

Calculating (0.96)^2: 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. What's 1 divided by 0.28? Let me think, 0.28 is 7/25, so 1/(7/25) is 25/7 ≈ 3.5714. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

But wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me use a calculator-like approach. 0.96 squared is:

0.96 * 0.96:
= (1 - 0.04)^2
= 1 - 0.08 + 0.0016
= 0.9216.

So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, right? Because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So yes, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now I need the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Wait, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton is about 938 MeV/c², and neutrons are about 939 MeV/c². So the mass of Li-6 would be (3 * proton mass) + (3 * neutron mass).

But wait, maybe I should just look up the exact mass of Li-6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass number as the approximate mass. The mass number A is 6 for Li-6. The approximate mass in atomic mass units (u) is about 6 u, but each u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So 6 * 931.5 MeV is 5589 MeV, or about 5.589 GeV/c². Hmm, but that might be an approximation.

Wait, but wait, protons and neutrons have slightly different masses. Let me calculate it more accurately. Proton mass is about 938.272 MeV/c², and neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So for Li
