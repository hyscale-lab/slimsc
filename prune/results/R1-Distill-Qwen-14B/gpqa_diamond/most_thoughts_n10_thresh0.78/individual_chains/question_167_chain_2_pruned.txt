Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating non-Gaussianity using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The state given is a Schrödinger cat state, which I remember is a superposition of two coherent states. The state is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. Oh right, N is the normalization constant. They provided N as sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). 

The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. I think I'll need to plug these values into the formula for N first. Let me jot that down.

So, sin(2 phi) when phi is -pi/4. Let's compute 2 phi: 2*(-pi/4) = -pi/2. The sine of -pi/2 is -1. So sin(2 phi) is -1.

Then, exp(-2 alpha²) with alpha=0.5. So alpha squared is 0.25, multiplied by 2: 0.5. e^-0.5 is approximately 0.6065. So sin(2 phi) * exp(-2 alpha²) is (-1)*0.6065 ≈ -0.6065.

Now, N is sqrt(1 + (-0.6065)). Wait 1 - 0.6065 is 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935). What's that approximately? Let me compute. 0.3935's square root is around 0.6275. Let me check: 0.6275^2 is 0.6275 * 0.6275. 0.6^2 is 0.36, 0.02^2 is 0.0004, and cross terms... Hmm maybe not precise, but I'll proceed with N ≈ 0.6275.

Wait, the state |psi> is normalized because we've got N in the denominator. So the density matrix rho is |psi><psi|, right? So rho would be a pure state, as it's a single state.

The reference Gaussian state tau is presumably a Gaussian state, which for coherent states are Gaussian. But wait, the problem says tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. So I think tau is probably the closest Gaussian state to rho, maybe the one with the same mean and variance? Or perhaps it's a thermal state or something else. But I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, the problem is to compute the non-Gaussianity using relative entropy. The formula given is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So this is the relative entropy between rho and tau. But wait, relative entropy is usually S(rho||tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau). Oh wait, but the given formula is different. Wait, the problem says the relative entropy is defined as trace(rho ln rho) minus trace(tau ln tau), which is not the standard relative entropy. Oh, that's a bit confusing. Because usually relative entropy is between two states, like rho relative to tau.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different measure. Let me read again. The relative entropy measure is given as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So perhaps it's the difference between the von Neumann entropy of rho and that of tau. Because trace(rho ln rho) is the entropy S(rho), and trace(tau ln tau) is S(tau). So del_b would be S(rho) - S(tau). So non-Gaussianity is being measured as the difference in entropy between the state and a reference Gaussian state.

But wait, why is tau a Gaussian state? Because if the state is non-Gaussian, maybe the reference is the Gaussian state
