Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. I'm a bit rusty on my QFT, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Hmm, I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Right, the gamma matrices' commutators. So σ is antisymmetric, and F is the field strength tensor, probably for electromagnetism or something similar.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should figure out the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. Remember, the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 in 4 spacetime dimensions because the action is dimensionless (in natural units, where ħ = c =1, the action S has no dimensions, and the integral is over four dimensions, each with dimension 1. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

So L_int is dimension 4. Let me write down the components of the term: ψ̄, σ_{μν}, ψ, and F^{μν}. Also, κ is a coupling constant with some dimension we'll figure out.

Let me recall the mass dimensions of the fields and coupling constants. In 4D,

- Fermion fields ψ have mass dimension 3/2.
- Antifermion fields ψ̄ also have 3/2.
- The field strength tensor F (like in electromagnetism) has dimension 2. Because the vector potential A has dimension 1, and F_{μν} = ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ, so each derivative is dimension 1, so F is dimension 2.
- The σ_{μν} tensor is made from gamma matrices, which have dimension 0 because they're just matrices, not fields. So σ_{μν} is a product of two gamma matrices (since it's their commutator), so each term in σ is dimension 0, but considering the structure, the actual dimension of σ_{μν} as an operator... Hmm wait, I'm a bit confused here. Wait, no, ψ is a spinor field, so when you have ψ̄ γ_mu ψ, that's a vector current, which has dimension 3 because ψ is 3/2 each, and γ is dimensionless. So the product ψ̄ γ_mu ψ would be (3/2 + 3/2) = 3.

But in our case, we have ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ. Since σ is antisymmetric, maybe it's like a tensor product of two spinor indices. But for the mass dimension, the gamma matrices don't contribute any dimensions, so σ_{μν} would have the same dimension as the product of two gamma matrices, but since they're just matrices, σ_{μν} has dimension 0. Wait, no— that's not right. Because σ_{μν} is built from the gamma matrices, which are dimensionless, but the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ would have the same dimension as ψ̄ γ_mu gamma_nu ψ. So each gamma is dimensionless, so the product is dimensionless. So ψ̄ (3/2) times γ terms (0) times ψ (3/2) gives 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. So ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ has dimension 3.

Wait, but F^{mu nu} has dimension 2, as I said before. So putting it all together, the term is κ multiplied by (ψ̄ σ ψ) (F). So the dimensions: [κ] times [ψ̄ σ ψ] times [F].

So [ψ̄ σ ψ] is 3, [F] is 2. So the product (ψ̄ σ ψ) (F) has dimension 3+2=5.

But the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So the entire term is:

κ * [dimension 5 term] must be dimension 4. So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ]= -1.

Wait, wait. Because the Lagrangian is L = κ (ψ̄ σ ψ F), so each part's dimensions add. So [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ] + [F] = 4.

Wait, no. Because each term in the Lagrangian is multiplied by the coupling, the term is κ multiplied by the product of (ψ̄σψ) and F. So the dimension of L is [κ] + [ψ̄σψ] + [F] = [κ] +3 +2 = [κ] +5. And this must equal 4. So [κ] must be -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. So that's the first part.

Now, the second question: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the dimension of the coupling constant. If the coupling has dimension less than 4 in 4D, then the theory is renormalizable. Wait, no. Wait, in 4D, a coupling with dimension [g] = d is renormalizable if d ≥ 0. Because higher dimension couplings (like dimension 1 or higher) would lead to higher-order terms that can be renormalized, while negative dimensions imply higher-dimension operators which are nonrenormalizable.

Wait, more accurately, in 4D, the mass dimension of a coupling constant determines whether the interaction is renormalizable. If the coupling has dimension [g] ≥ 0, the interaction is renormalizable. If [g] < 0, it's nonrenormalizable.

Wait, let's think about the superficial degree of divergence. For a Feynman diagram, the superficial degree D is given by D = 4 - (L × [coupling dimension]) - (I × 1), where L is the number of loops and I the number of internal lines. Alternatively, another formula: For each vertex, you have something contributing to the dimension. Alternatively, using the formula for a renormalizable interaction, the interaction term must have a coupling with dimension ≤4 − (number of fields × their dimensions). Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think in terms of the power counting.

The interaction term is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. Each fermion field ψ has dimension 3/2, so ψ̄ σ ψ is two fermion fields (so 3/2 * 2 =3) and F has dimension 2. So the term is dimension 5, as before. So the coupling κ must have dimension -1 to make the whole term dimension 4.

Now, to check renormalizability, the coupling's dimension must be ≥0 for the theory to be renormalizable in 4D. Because if the coupling has negative mass dimension, that implies that the interaction term is of higher order (like a higher-dimensional operator), which would make the theory nonrenormalizable because the perturbative expansion would require an infinite number of counterterms.

So κ has dimension -1, which is less than zero. Therefore, the theory is not renormalizable.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. In the Standard Model, for example, the Yukawa coupling has dimension -1 as well. Wait, no, the Yukawa term is L = g ψ̄ ψ φ, where φ is a scalar. The dimension of ψ is 3/2 each, so ψ̄ ψ is 3. φ has dimension 1. So the term is g times 3 + 1 =4. So [g] must be 0, making the Yukawa coupling dimensionless, which is renormalizable.

In our case, the coupling κ has dimension -1, which is negative. So it's not renormalizable. So the theory would require counterterms at all orders, meaning it's nonrenormalizable.

So the options are:

Looking back, the options are:

A) [κ]=-1, renormalizable.

B) [κ]=1, renormalizable.

C) [-1, not renormalizable.

D) [1], not renormalizable.

Wait, our conclusion is [κ]=-1 and the theory is not renormalizable. So that's option C.

Wait, but wait another thought. Some sources say that for an interaction term to be renormalizable, the coupling must have a dimension no less than (4 - (n_fermions × 3/2) - (n_bosons × (4 - mass_dim_of_boson))?), but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, the general rule is that a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have mass dimension ≥ 0. Because in 4D, each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So for a term like L = g φ^n, the dimension of g is 4 - n*(dimension of φ). If dimension of φ is d_phi, then [g] = 4 - n * d_phi. For the term to be renormalizable, [g] ≥ 0.

In our case, the term is κ ψ̄ σ μν ψ F^{mu nu}. Let's think about the number of fields. Let's see: ψ̄ is one field, ψ is another, and F is two fields (since F is the field strength, which is the derivative of A). So for the interaction, it's a term with four fields? Or wait, wait, no. The F^{mu nu} is (A_mu, A_nu) but it's a field strength, which is like (∂ A), so each F is made from two A fields. But in terms of the term ψ̄ σ F ψ, it's two fermions and two bosons? Or wait, the term is a product of ψ̄ σ ψ and F. So ψ̄ and ψ are two fermion fields each, but wait, no: ψ̄ is the adjoint, which is one field, and ψ is another. So altogether, two fermion fields and two boson fields (since F is made from two A fields, but in the term F^{mu nu} is treated as a single object, though it's a derivative of A). Hmm, perhaps this is complicating.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the term as involving two fermion fields (because ψ̄ and ψ) and two boson fields from F. So the interaction term has four fields multiplied by κ. So the term is like κ (ψ̄ ψ) (F), but F is of two A fields. Wait, but F^{μ ν} is a compound field, so perhaps it's treated as a single bosonic field for the purpose of counting dimensions. Hmm, no, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps F has dimension 2, as I thought before.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the mass dimension of the coupling. So our earlier calculation said that [κ]=-1. So the coupling has negative mass dimension, which implies that the term is nonrenormalizable.

So the correct option is C: [κ]=-1 and theory is not renormalizable.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$ and $F^{\mu\nu}$ is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass Dimension of $\kappa$
The Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 in 4 spacetime dimensions because the action is dimensionless. Each term in the Lagrangian must therefore have mass dimension 4. Breaking down the components:
- The fermion fields $\bar{\psi}$ and $\psi$ each have mass dimension $\frac{3}{2}$.
- The $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ tensor is constructed from the commutator of $\gamma$-matrices, which are dimensionless. Thus, $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ contributes no additional dimension.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension 2.
- The product $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi$ has mass dimension $\frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = 3$.
- The product $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ therefore has mass dimension $3 + 2 = 5$.

Since the Lagrangian term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ must have mass dimension 4, the coupling constant $\kappa$ must satisfy:

\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

Thus, the mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$.

### Step 2: Renormalizability of the Theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have mass dimension $\geq 0$. In this case, the coupling constant $\kappa$ has mass dimension $-1$, which is negative. This implies that the interaction term is of higher dimension (specifically, a dimension-5 operator) and the theory is **not renormalizable**. Nonrenormalizable theories require an infinite number of counterterms to handle divergences, making them less predictive at higher energy scales.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option **C**.
