Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve. Let me try to understand what it's asking. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a nucleus X is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Hmm.

Wait, Li usually has 3 protons because Lithium has atomic number 3. But if it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number would be 3 (protons) +3 (neutrons) =6. So X is Li-6. Right, because Li-6 is a common isotope.

So I need to find the total energy of the nucleus when its speed is 0.96c. I remember that in relativity, the total energy of a moving object is given by the gamma factor multiplied by its rest mass energy. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). 

The formula is E = gamma * m0 * c², where m0 is the rest mass. But since the options are given in GeV, I think I'll need to compute the rest mass in appropriate units and then calculate gamma times that.

Wait, but wait, the rest mass energy of a nucleus is the sum of the masses of its constituent nucleons, right? Because in nuclear physics, the mass of the nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of protons and neutrons, minus the binding energy (but for approximate calculations, sometimes people just take the sum). Or do I just use the actual mass of the Li-6 isotope?

I think the problem expects me to use the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. So maybe I need to find the mass of Li-6 in atomic mass units (amu), then convert that to energy using the conversion factor 1 amu ≈ 931.5 MeV/c².

Wait, but I'm not sure if the problem gives the mass. Oh wait, the options are all in GeV, so I probably need to calculate it using known values. Let me think about how to get the mass of Li-6.

Lithium-6 has 3 protons, 3 neutrons. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015122 amu. I think I've seen that value before. So the rest mass energy would be 6.015122 amu multiplied by 931.5 MeV/amu. Let me compute that.

First, compute 6.015122 * 931.5 MeV. Let me calculate that. 6 *931.5 is 5589. Then, 0.015122 *931.5. Let me compute that: 0.01 *931.5 is 9.315, 0.005122 *931.5 ≈ 4.76 approximately. So total is 9.315 +4.76=14.075. So 5589 +14.075 =5603.075 MeV. Wait, but that's 5.603 GeV approximately. Because 1 GeV is 1000 MeV.

Wait, but wait, the rest mass energy is E = m c². So the rest energy is 6.015122 amu * 931.5 MeV/amu, which is 6.015122 * 931.5 = let me compute this more accurately.

Let me do 6 *931.5 =5589. Then, 0.015122 *931.5. Let's compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315. 0.005122 *931.5= let's calculate 0.005 *931.5=4.6575, and 0.000122 *931.5≈0.1134. So adding, 4.6575 +0.1134=4.7709. So 9.315 +4.7709=14.0859. So total is 5589 +14.0859=5603.0859 MeV, which is 5.6030859 GeV.

So the rest mass energy is approximately 5.603 GeV.

Now, the speed is given as 0.96c. So I need to calculate gamma, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that. v is 0.96c, so v²/c² is (0.96)^2 =0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216=0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is sqrt(0.0784)=sqrt(784e-4)=28e-2=0.28. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.571428... Hmm, so gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute that more accurately. 0.96 squared is 0.9216 exactly. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

So then, the total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. So E = 3.57142857 *5.603 GeV. Let me compute that.

3 *5.603 is 16.809. 0.57142857 *5.603 ≈ let's compute 0.5 *5.603 is 2.8015, and 0.07142857 *5.603 is approximately 0.402. So 2.8015 +0.402=3.2035. So total E ≈16.809 +3.2035=20.0125 GeV.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it more accurately. 3.57142857 multiplied by 5.603.

I think it's better to compute 3.57142857 *5.603.

Let me compute it as (3 + 0.57142857) *5.603.

3 *5.603 =16.809.

0.57142857 *5.603.

Hmm, 0.5 *5.603=2.8015.

0.07142857 *5.603: 

Well, 5.603 *0.07 =0.39221.

5.603 *0.00142857 ~ approximately 0.008 (since 0.00142857 is 1/700, 5.603 *1/700≈0.008).

So 0.39221 +0.008=0.40021.

So 2.8015 + 0.40021=3.20171.

So total E=16.809 +3.20171=20.01071 GeV.

So approximately 20.011 GeV.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, and option B is 23.069. Hmm. Oh wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the gamma factor.

Because v=0.96c, so beta=0.96.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²) =1/sqrt(1 - 0.96^2).

As I said, 0.96^2 is 0.9216.

So 1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857.

Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the rest energy was miscalculated. Let me recheck.

The mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015122 amu. Each amu is about 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.015122 *931.5 MeV.

Let me compute that accurately.

Let me calculate 6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.015122 *931.5 = let's compute it step by step.

0.01 *931.5 =9.315 MeV.

0.005 *931.5=4.6575 MeV.

0.000122 *931.5 = approximately 0.1134 MeV.

So 9.315 +4.6575=13.9725; plus 0.1134=14.0859 MeV.

So total is 5589 +14.0859=5603.0859 MeV, which is 5.6030859 GeV.

So that's correct. Then, E=gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.6030859 GeV.

Compute that accurately.

3.57142857 *5.6030859.

Let me calculate 3.57142857 times 5.6030859.

I'll do it step by step.

3 *5.6030859=16.8092577.

0.57142857 *5.6030859.

0.5 *5.6030859=2.80154295.

0.07142857 *5.6030859.

0.07 *5.6030859=0.392216.

0.00142857 *5.6030859≈0.0079999.

So adding 0.392216 +0.0079999≈0.4002159.

So 2.80154295 +0.4002159≈3.20175885.

Now, adding to the 3* part: 16.8092577 +3.20175885 =20.01101655 GeV.

So approximately 20.011 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV and option D is 21.419 GeV. Hmm, but my calculation is about 20.011 GeV, which is closest to option C, but option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate more accurately.

Let me compute gamma more precisely. So beta=0.96.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) =1/0.28 =3.57142857142857....

Now, perhaps the rest energy is a bit more precise. Let me check the exact value of Li-6's atomic mass.

Looking up, Li-6 has an atomic mass of approximately 6.015122 amu. So that's correct.

So rest energy: 6.015122 *931.5 MeV.

Let me compute that more accurately.

Compute 6 * 931.5 = 5589.

0.015122 *931.5:

Compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.005 *931.5=4.6575.

0.000122 *931.5= let's compute 0.0001 *931.5=0.09315, 0.000022 *931.5=0.020493. So total is 0.09315 +0.020493=0.113643.

So summing up: 9.315 +4.6575=13.9725 +0.113643=14.086143.

So 5589 +14.086143=5603.086143 MeV=5.603086143 GeV.

So more precisely, m0 c²=5.603086143 GeV.

Now, multiply by gamma=3.5714285714285714.

So 5.603086143 *3.5714285714.

Let me compute this precisely.

5.603086143 *3.5714285714.

Let me compute 5 *3.5714285714=17.857142857.

0.603086143 *3.5714285714.

Compute 0.6 *3.5714285714=2.14285714284.

0.003086143 *3.5714285714≈0.011004 (because 0.003 *3.57142857=0.0107142857, and 0.000086143 *3.57142857≈0.0003085, so total≈0.0110228).

So 2.14285714284 +0.0110228≈2.15388.

So total E=17.857142857 +2.15388≈20.01102 GeV.

Hmm, so about 20.011 GeV.

Wait, but the options don't have exactly 20.011. The closest option is C) 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Let me think again. Another possibility is that I should have considered the relativistic mass, but I think I already accounted for that by using gamma multiplied by the rest energy. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. Wait, the question says "the energy of the RHIC" which probably refers to the kinetic energy, but wait, no, RHIC is a collider, so I think the energy given is the total energy, not just the kinetic.

Wait, the question says, "What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?"

Hmm, in colliders, the particles are accelerated to a certain energy, which is usually the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy. Wait, no, in particle physics, the energy is often expressed as the total energy, which includes the rest mass and the kinetic.

But in some contexts, the energy mentioned is the kinetic energy. Wait, need to clarify.

Wait, the relativistic energy of a particle is gamma times m c². So that would include the rest mass. So the energy of the RHIC would be the total energy, so E = gamma * m c².

So I think my approach is correct.

But why isn't the calculated value matching any option? Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

Hmm. I have 20.011 GeV, which is closest to option C (20.132). But perhaps I did the calculation with more precise values.

Wait, perhaps my approximation for the square root was too rough. Let me compute gamma with more precision.

Wait, beta is 0.96. So beta squared is 0.9216. So 1 - beta squared is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly, because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.5714285714285714...

Hmm. So that part is exact.

Wait, but perhaps the mass of Li-6 is more precisely 6.015122 amu. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the exact value is a bit different. For example, let me look up the exact atomic mass of Li-6. From my knowledge, Li-6 has an atomic mass of approximately 6.015122 amu.

So perhaps I should calculate more precisely. Let me compute 6.015122 *931.5 MeV.

Let me compute it accurately.

Compute 6.015122 *931.5:

Let me compute 6 *931.5 =5589.

0.015122 *931.5:

0.01 *931.5 =9.315.

0.005 *931.5 =4.6575.

0.000122 *931.5 = let's calculate:

0.0001 *931.5=0.09315.

0.000022 *931.5= 0.020493.

Adding: 0.09315 +0.020493= 0.113643.

So 9.315 +4.6575=13.9725 +0.113643=14.086143.

So 5589 +14.086143=5603.086143 MeV=5.603086143 GeV.

So that's correct.

Multiply by gamma 3.5714285714285714.

So 5.603086143 *3.5714285714285714.

Let me compute this with more precision.

5.603086143 *3.5714285714.

To compute this precisely, perhaps I can use fractional representation.

Gamma is 25/7. Because 0.28 is 2/7, so 1/0.28 is 7/2=3.5, which is 25/7? Wait, wait.

Wait, 0.28 is 28/100 =7/25. So 1/0.28 =25/7 ≈3.57142857.

Ah, so gamma is 25/7.

So 5.603086143 GeV multiplied by 25/7.

Which is 5.603086143 *25 /7.

5.603086143 *25 =140.077153575.

Divide by 7: 140.077153575 /7 ≈20.01102194 GeV.

So approximately 20.011 GeV.

Looking at the options, C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.12 GeV higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made an error elsewhere. Another possibility is that the mass of the nucleus is not 6.015122 amu. Maybe I should have used the mass of a single nucleon and multiplied by the number of nucleons. For example, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons: 6 nucleons. Each proton has a mass of about 1.007276 amu, and each neutron about 1.008665 amu.

Wait, but that's if I'm summing individual nucleon masses, which would give a different result than using the exact mass of Li-6.

Ah, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the total rest mass as the sum of individual nucleon masses, not the exact mass of Li-6. Because the exact mass of Li-6 is known, but perhaps in the problem, they're approximating it as 6 times the mass of a proton (or neutron? Or average?), which could change the result.

Wait, let's think.

If I use the sum of individual protons and neutrons, each proton is about 1.007276 amu, each neutron about 1.008665 amu.

So for Li-6, 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Sum: 3*(1.007276 +1.008665) =3*(2.015941)=6.047823 amu.

Then, rest mass energy is 6.047823 amu *931.5 MeV/amu.

Compute that: 6.047823 *931.5.

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.047823 *931.5.

0.04 *931.5=37.26.

0.007823 *931.5≈7.305.

So 37.26 +7.305=44.565 MeV.

So total is 5589 +44.565=5633.565 MeV=5.633565 GeV.

So rest mass is 5.633565 GeV.

Then, gamma is 25/7 =3.57142857.

So E=5.633565 *3.57142857.

Let me compute this.

5 *3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.633565 *3.57142857.

Compute 0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.033565 *3.57142857 ≈ approximately 0.12 (since 0.03 *3.5714 is about 0.10714, and 0.003565 *3.5714≈0.01275, so total ≈0.11989).

So 2.142857142 +0.11989≈2.26274.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.26274≈20.11988 GeV.

So approximately 20.12 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. That's very close. So perhaps the correct approach is to sum the individual nucleon masses.

Wait, but why would the problem expect that? The mass of the nucleus is usually less than the sum of the individual nucleons due to binding energy, but in this case, the mass of Li-6 is about 6.015122 amu, which is less than 6.047823 from the sum of individual protons and neutrons. So why would the problem expect me to use the sum of the individual masses?

Hmm, perhaps the question is assuming that the nucleus is a collection of noninteracting nucleons, which is not the case, but perhaps it's an approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption, and the correct approach is to use the rest mass of the nucleus as 6.015122 amu, leading to about 20.011 GeV, but since that's not an option, perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps the speed is 0.96c, so perhaps when calculating gamma, I should use more precise value.

Wait, let's recompute gamma:

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation of gamma is better done with more precise beta.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute more precise gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise calculation.

Wait, let me compute beta squared more accurately.

0.96 squared is 0.9216 exactly.

1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 exactly, so gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider whether the energy is per nucleon or per nucleus. The problem states the energy of the nucleus, so it's per nucleus.

Hmm. So in the first approach, using the exact mass of Li-6, I get about 20.011 GeV, which is not an option.

In the second approach, summing individual nucleon masses (which gives higher rest mass), I get approximately 20.12 GeV, which is very close to option C (20.132 GeV).

So perhaps the problem expects me to use the sum of individual nucleon masses as the rest mass.

But why would that be the case? Because for heavy ions, sometimes people approximate the rest mass as the sum of the nucleons' rest masses, but that's an approximation and not accurate. But maybe that's what the problem expects.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps I should use the correct atomic mass of Li-6, which is 6.015122 amu, and proceed.

So 6.015122 amu *931.5 MeV/amu =5.603086 GeV.

Multiply by gamma 3.57142857.

5.603086 *3.57142857.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.57142857 is 25/7.

So 5.603086 *25/7.

25 *5.603086=140.07715.

Divide by 7: 140.07715 /7=20.0110214 GeV.

So that's about 20.011 GeV.

Hmm, but none of the options exactly match this.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the relativistic energy formula but considering kinetic energy instead of total energy. Let me think about that.

Wait, the total energy is gamma mc². The kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc².

If the question is asking for the kinetic energy, then the energy would be (gamma -1)*5.603086 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857, so gamma-1=2.57142857.

So 2.57142857 *5.603086 = ?

Let me compute that.

2 *5.603086=11.206172.

0.57142857 *5.603086.

0.5 *5.603086=2.801543.

0.07142857 *5.603086≈0.400405.

So 2.801543 +0.400405=3.201948.

So total KE=11.206172 +3.201948=14.40812 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A which is 18.475, but no, that's way higher.

Hmm, that's not matching any option.

So perhaps the question is indeed asking for the total energy, not the kinetic.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the molar mass. Wait, Li-6 has a molar mass of 6.015122 g/mol, but that's the same as the amu value.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is correct, but the options are expecting a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the proton mass, but that doesn't make sense because the nucleus has neutrons as well.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the momentum and then the energy via E² = (pc)² + (m c²)².

Wait, but that's the same as the gamma approach, so I don't think that's necessary.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the speed is given as 0.96c, but the problem is asking for the energy per nucleon. Because the options are in GeV, which is a unit per nucleon as well. But Li-6 has 6 nucleons, so if the energy is per nucleon, that would be a different calculation.

Wait, but the question says the energy of the nucleus, so I think it's for the entire nucleus.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy, but that gives a lower value, which doesn't match any option.

Wait, unless there's a miscalculation in my part. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass is calculated as the sum of protons and neutrons, which would be higher. Let me try that approach again.

Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Proton mass: 1.007276 amu.

Neutron mass:1.008665 amu.

So 3*(1.007276+1.008665) =3*(2.015941)=6.047823 amu.

So rest energy is 6.047823 *931.5 MeV.

Which is 6.047823 *931.5 =5633.557 MeV=5.633557 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E=5.633557 *3.57142857 ≈20.119 GeV.

Which is close to option C (20.132 GeV), but not exactly. So perhaps the problem expects that approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute more precisely.

Compute 5.633557 GeV *3.57142857.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.57142857 is 25/7.

So 5.633557 *25 =140.838925.

Divide by 7: 140.838925 /7 ≈20.119846 GeV.

So approximately 20.1198 GeV, which is about 20.12 GeV.

Looking at option C, it's 20.132 GeV. So perhaps the problem expects me to use the sum of the individual nucleon masses, leading to approximately 20.12 GeV, which is very close to option C (20.132 GeV).

But why would the problem expect that approach? Because the actual mass of Li-6 is about 6.015122 amu, which is less than the sum of individual nucleons, implying a binding energy.

Hmm, maybe the problem is using the approximation where it's considering the nucleus as a collection of free nucleons, hence uses the sum of their rest masses.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem text has a typo, but I have to proceed with the given information.

Assuming the problem uses the sum of individual nucleon masses, then the energy is approximately 20.12 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132 GeV).

Another possibility: perhaps the calculation of gamma was incorrect. Let me recheck.

Wait, beta=0.96.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta²) =1/sqrt(1- 0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

That's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is using a more precise value for the square root. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) more precisely.

Wait, 0.0784 is 784e-4. So sqrt(784)=28. So sqrt(784e-4)=28e-2=0.28.

So no, gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Hmm. I think I need to proceed, given the options, the closest match is option C (20.132 GeV) when using the sum of individual nucleon masses.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the exact Li-6 mass, but perhaps in the calculation, the rest mass energy was taken as 6 * 931.5 MeV, which would be 6 * 931.5 =5589 MeV=5.589 GeV.

So E=5.589 *3.57142857 = let's compute that.

5 *3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.589 *3.57142857.

0.5 *3.57142857=1.785714285.

0.089 *3.57142857≈0.316.

So 1.7857 +0.316=2.1017.

Total E=17.8571 +2.1017=19.9588 GeV.

Which is about 19.959 GeV.

Hmm, none of the options match exactly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute with more precise numbers.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of the exact value of the speed of light and other constants, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that the correct answer is approximately 20.011 GeV, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem uses the relativistic energy formula for kinetic energy.

Wait, so the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc².

In the first approach, with m=5.603 GeV, gamma=3.5714.

So KE= (3.5714-1) *5.603 = 2.5714 *5.603 ≈14.408 GeV.

Which is way lower than any option.

But the options are higher than 20 GeV, so that's not the case.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the RHIC gives energy per nucleon, and the nucleus has 6 nucleons. So the total energy would be 6 times the energy per nucleon.

Wait, that could change things.

Wait, let me think. If each nucleon has energy E_n, then the nucleus has 6 E_n.

But that would imply a much higher energy, but the options are in the 20 GeV range, which would mean each nucleon has about 3 GeV, which doesn't make sense because for such high speeds, the energy per nucleon is higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating things. I think the correct approach is to take the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus as 6.015122 amu, compute gamma, and multiply.

Which gives E=20.011 GeV.

But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended approach is to compute the rest mass as 6 * (proton mass), which would give a higher value.

Wait, but 6 *1.007276=6.043656 amu.

Rest mass energy:6.043656 *931.5= let me compute that.

6 *931.5=5589.

0.043656 *931.5= approx 40.75 MeV.

So 5589 +40.75=5629.75 MeV=5.62975 GeV.

Then, E=5.62975 *3.57142857.

Which is 5.62975 *25/7.

25 *5.62975=140.74375.

Divide by 7:140.74375/7≈20.10625 GeV.

Which is about 20.106 GeV, still close to option C (20.132 GeV).

Hmm. So I think the correct answer is option C.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the nucleus X (Li-6) moves at a speed of \( 0.96c \), we use the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), \( m_0 \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The rest mass of Li-6 is given as \( 6.015122 \, \text{amu} \), and the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{amu} \approx 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) is used to calculate the rest mass energy.

### Step 1: Calculate the rest mass energy of Li-6
\[
m_0 c^2 = 6.015122 \, \text{amu} \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/\text{amu} = 5603.0859 \, \text{MeV} = 5.6030859 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The speed \( v = 0.96c \), so:
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} = 3.57142857.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2 = 3.57142857 \times 5.6030859 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Breaking this multiplication into parts:
\[
3 \times 5.6030859 = 16.8092577, \quad 0.57142857 \times 5.6030859 \approx 3.20175885.
\]
Adding these:
\[
E = 16.8092577 + 3.20175885 = 20.01101655 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.011 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:
- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Higher than the calculated value.

### Step 5: Consider alternative approaches
If the problem assumes the rest mass energy is calculated as the sum of individual nucleon masses (3 protons and 3 neutrons), the total rest mass energy would be slightly higher. Using this approach, the energy would be approximately \( 20.12 \, \text{GeV} \), which is even closer to option **C**.

### Conclusion
Given the options and the calculations, the most reasonable answer is **C) 20.132 GeV**, as it aligns closely with the calculated value when considering the sum of nucleon masses or the exact Li-6 mass.
