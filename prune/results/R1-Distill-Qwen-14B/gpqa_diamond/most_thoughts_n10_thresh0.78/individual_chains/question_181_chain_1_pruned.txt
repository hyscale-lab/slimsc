Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, and the pp chain is a big part of it, especially in the core. The question mentions the pp-III branch stopping, and I need to find the ratio of neutrino flux in two energy bands.

Wait, what is the pp-III branch? Oh right, the proton-proton chain has different branches. The main one (pp-I) produces deuterium, and then there are other branches like pp-II and pp-III. Oh wait, I think pp-III is the branch where two protons fuse into a deuterium, then another proton adds, and then maybe a neutron is involved? Or wait, maybe it's the part where a helium-3 nucleus captures two protons. Oh right, the pp-III branch is the part where two helium-3 nuclei (He-3) combine to form helium-4, which is a significant step in the overall fusion process.

So if the pp-III branch stops, that would affect the production of certain particles. Neutrinos are produced in various steps of the fusion. The main neutrinos we detect are the electron neutrinos from the decay of boron-8, which comes from the pp chain. But wait, the pp-III branch is responsible for producing a lot of the He-4 in the core, right?

If pp-III stops, the main source of He-4 would stop. But how does that affect neutrinos? Well, neutrinos are produced in other ways too. There are also neutrinos from the decay of other isotopes, like carbon-13 in the CNO cycle. Oh, wait, but the CNO cycle isn't the dominant process in the Sun. The Sun's energy is mostly from the proton-proton chain.

So if pp-III stops, the main source of He-4 would be disrupted. But how does that affect the overall neutrino production? Well, the pp chain produces a lot of high-energy neutrinos. The neutrinos are emitted when a boron-8 nucleus decays into carbon-8 (which then decays into two helium-4 nuclei), emitting an electron neutrino.

Wait, but if the pp-III branch stops, what happens to the overall fusion rate? The pp-III branch is a key part of the proton-proton chain, so
