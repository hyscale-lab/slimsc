Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Hmm, I need to find the energy of RHIC when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So, the isotope would be... Let me think. Lithium typically has 3 protons. If there are 3 neutrons, that makes the mass number A=3+3=6, so it's Li-6.

Alright, so the problem is about relativistic energy. I remember that for particles moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we use the relativistic energy formulas. The total energy of a particle is given by gamma times m c squared, right? Gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma equals 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Oh wait, the speed here is 0.96c, so v=0.96c. Let me compute gamma first. Let's plug in the numbers. v is 0.96c, so v² is (0.96)^2 c². 0.96 squared is... 0.9216, right? So v²/c² is 0.9216, so 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, wait, 0.28 is 28/100, which is 7/25. So 1/(7/25) is 25/7≈3.5714. Yeah.

But wait, wait a second. Is the nucleus moving at 0.96c, so gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). Let me calculate that again. 0.96 squared is 0.9216, so 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈3.5714.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714. Now, the total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy, right? So E = gamma * m * c². But I need to find the energy in GeV. So I need the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Li-6 has an atomic mass number of 6. Each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a rest mass of approximately 1.007294 GeV/c² for protons and 1.008665 GeV/c² for neutrons. Wait, wait, actually, the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV, which is 0
