Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand.

The system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, no, waitâ€”no, wait, wait. Wait, actually, in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as column vectors, but their components have to be complex numbers and normalized. Oh wait, the given vector has elements -1, 2, and 1. That's three components. So it's a 3-dimensional state vector. But wait, the sum of the squares of the absolute values should be 1 for normalization. Let me check: (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, 1^2 is 1. So 1 +4 +1 =6. The norm is sqrt(6), so the state isn't normalized. Oh wait, but in the problem statement, it's just given as the state. Maybe I need to normalize it first? Or maybe the problem doesn't require it because the probabilities will adjust accordingly. Hmm, I'm not sure, but perhaps I can proceed without worrying about it right now.

The operators for the observables P and Q are given. Let me write them down.

Operator P has the matrix:
Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Operator Q's matrix is diagonal:
Row 1: 1, 0, 0
Row 2: 0, 0, 0
Row 3: 0, 0, -1

So the question is: If we measure Q just after measuring P, what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q? The options are A to D.

Wait, but the way measurements work in quantum mechanics is that once you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So the process is: first measure P, then measure Q on the resulting state.

But wait
