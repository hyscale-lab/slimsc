Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through carefully.

First, what's optical activity again? Oh right, it's when a compound can rotate plane-polarized light. For that to happen, the molecule needs to have chirality, meaning it's not superimposable on its mirror image. Chirality typically arises from having a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

So, I need to go through each of these compounds and check if they have any chiral centers. If they do, then the compound is chiral and might be optically active. But wait, sometimes compounds with chiral centers can be meso compounds, which aren't optically active because they have an internal plane of symmetry. So I have to be careful about that.

Let's list out the compounds one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene.
Hmm. The structure here is probably CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but wait, in but-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, which has a double bond to C2 (which has a methyl group). So the structure is Cl-C(CH2CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait. Butene has four carbons. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would replace one H on C1 with Cl. So structure would be ClCH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, so but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon. So structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, but that's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Or maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Another way: but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would make it ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3, but wait, but it's but-1-ene, so double bond is between 1 and 2. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. So, the structure is Cl-C(R)=CH2-CH3? Or maybe it's CH2Cl attached to a double bond. Wait, perhaps it's Cl on the same carbon as the double bond. So the molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, but that would make it 1-chloro-2-methyl-1-butene? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So when you have 1-chloro, you're adding Cl to the first carbon. So the structure becomes ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3, but that's not considering the double bond. Oh wait, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So position 1 is the first carbon. So 1-chloro would add a Cl to C
