Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. Okay, the compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, so that's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. I'm a bit rusty on molecular formulas, but I think I can work with that.

The NMR data is given, which should help me figure out the structure. The peaks are at 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), and 3.66 (d, 2H). Let's think about what each of these could mean.

Looking at the peaks: the 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a pretty upfield shift, but wait, no, 9.7 is actually downfield, which is usually where aldehydes or maybe an aromatic proton with strong deshielding would show up. So maybe an aldehyde proton? Or maybe an aromatic proton with strong electron-withdrawing groups nearby.

The 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets, each integrating to 2H. Those are likely to be aromatic protons. Maybe from a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in a para substitution, the protons are typically as two doublets, each integrating 2H. Wait, but sometimes if it's a meta substitution, you get different patterns. But for para, the coupling is usually between adjacent protons. Hmm.

Then 6.27 is a broad singlet for 2H. A broad peak could be something like an enol, or maybe an -OH group, but wait, the integration is 2H. Maybe these are protons on a double bond or something adjacent to an oxygen.

The 3.66 is a doublet for 2H. That might be from a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group. Or perhaps it's part of an alkoxy group attached to something else.

Now, let's think about the possible structure. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So substituting, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So 5 degrees. That could be one ring and two double bonds, or other combinations.

Looking at the NMR, the triplet at 9.72 is probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. So maybe the compound has an aldehyde group. Then, the other parts: two aromatic rings perhaps, given the number of aromatic protons.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. The aromatic rings would take up a lot of carbons. Let's see, if it's two benzene rings, each would be 6 carbons, but that's 12, which is way more than 8. So maybe it's a substituted benzene attached to a smaller chain.

Alternatively, perhaps one benzene ring (6 carbons) plus a side chain with 2 more carbons. But the formula is C8H9NO. Let me think about the possible structures.

Wait, the NMR shows 2H as a doublet in the aromatic region at 6.98 and 6.51. So maybe a para-substituted benzene ring. Let's say we have a benzene ring with two substituents. Maybe para-substituted, each substituent being another group.

Wait, perhaps the compound has a benzaldehyde group. Because the aldehyde proton is at 9.72. So maybe it's something like benzaldehyde with some substituents.

Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene ring, with a group that has an aldehyde and other substituents.

Wait, let's think about the substituents: the 6.27 is a broad singlet for 2H. Maybe that's a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like an enol or a hydroxyl group. Or perhaps it's part of a conjugated system.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the molecule has a benzene ring attached to a carbon chain that includes an aldehyde group and another substituent. Let's try to piece it together.

The 3.66 ppm doublet for 2H suggests that these are protons on a CH2 that's adjacent to an oxygen. So maybe a structure like OCH2CH2something. Or perhaps a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom like oxygen, such as in an ether or ester.

But wait, the 6.27 singlet for 2H could be a conjugated diene or perhaps a vinyl group. Or maybe it's an -OCH2- group where the protons are split into a doublet due to coupling with adjacent groups.

Alternatively, perhaps it's part of a cyclohexene ring, but that's less likely given the NMR data.

Let me consider the reagents given. The reaction sequence is:

1. NaNO2 + HCl
2. H2O
3. aq. KOH, heat

Hmm, NaNO2 and HCl is typically used for diazotization. So the initial compound must have an amine group. But wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. N is present, so maybe it's a primary amine, which upon treatment with nitrous acid would form a diazonium salt.

But wait, the initial compound is treated with NaNO2 and
