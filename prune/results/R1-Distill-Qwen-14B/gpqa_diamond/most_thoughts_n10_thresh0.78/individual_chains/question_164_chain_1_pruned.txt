Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about binary star systems. Hmm, I need to figure out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Let me think about what I know.

Alright, the question says that both systems exhibit eclipses. The periods are given as 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2. Wait, the period is the time between two primary eclipses. So that's the orbital period of the binary system, right? So system_1 has a longer orbital period than system_2.

Then there are radial velocity observations. In system_1, the RV variations have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, they're 15 km/s and 10 km/s. I remember that the radial velocity method involves measuring the Doppler shift, which relates to the velocity of the stars in their orbits. The mass function comes into play here, maybe.

Wait, the radial velocities of the two stars in a binary system are related to their masses. I think the more massive star would have a smaller velocity amplitude because it's less massive stars that are moving faster in response to the gravitational pull. So in system_1, star A has a velocity of 10 km/s, and star B 5 km/s. So star A is moving faster, meaning it's less massive than star B? Because in a binary system, the less massive star moves more quickly. So the mass is inversely proportional to velocity.

So the mass ratio would be (v2)/(v1). For system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5. So the mass ratio is 5/10 = 0.5. That means M1a/M1b = 0.5. So M1a is half the mass of M1b. Therefore, the total mass of system_1 is M1a + M1b = 0.5*M1b + M1b = 1.5 M1b. So the mass of the primary (M1b) is two-thirds of the total mass of system_1, and the secondary (M1a) is one-third.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If the velocity of each star is inversely proportional to its mass. So M1a / M1b = v1b / v1a. Because the more massive
