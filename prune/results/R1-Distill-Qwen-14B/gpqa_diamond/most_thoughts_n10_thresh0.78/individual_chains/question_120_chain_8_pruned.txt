Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So a smaller plx means the star is farther away, and a larger plx means it's closer.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed, which probably means their number doesn't depend on distance in a clustered way. Wait, uniform distribution could mean that the number density is the same throughout space, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's uniform in some other way.

I think I need to relate parallax to the number of stars in a certain range of parallax. Let's see, the parallax formula is plx = 1/d (in parsecs). So distance d = 1/plx.

If stars are uniformly distributed, their number density (number per unit volume) is constant. So the number of stars in a certain volume would be proportional to the volume. But how does that relate to parallax?

Wait, I should think in terms of how many stars are in a shell between plx and plx + dplx. Let me model this. The shell would be a thin layer at a certain distance, with thickness corresponding to the change in parallax.

The volume of a spherical shell at radius d with thickness dd is 4πd² dd. But since parallax plx is 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, because plx is decreasing as d increases, so when plx increases by dplx (positive), d decreases, so dd is negative. But since I'm dealing with absolute numbers, I can ignore the sign for now.

So substituting d with 1/plx, the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, let me recheck. No, wait, the volume is 4π d² dd. Since d = 1/plx, so d² is (1/plx)^2. And dd is the change in d, which is (change in plx) * (change in d per plx). Since plx = 1/d
