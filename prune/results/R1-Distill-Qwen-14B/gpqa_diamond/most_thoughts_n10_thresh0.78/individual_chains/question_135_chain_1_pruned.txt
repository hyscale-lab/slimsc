Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about the decay of a boson field X. Hmm, I remember that bosons are force carriers, like photons or gluons, but this one is called X. The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. The question is asking about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. 

The interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f(y)(ψ_f(y))(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully. Oh, wait, maybe the Lagrangian is written in terms of fermions interacting with the boson X. The form looks like a Yukawa coupling, right? Because the Yukawa term usually couples a scalar field to fermions, something like ψ† ψ multiplied by a scalar. So in this case, X is the scalar (boson) field, and ψ_f are the fermion fields. 

So the interaction is L = -λ f f(y)(something) ... Wait, perhaps the exact form isn't crucial for determining the possible decay channels, but more about the fermions that X can couple to. Because for the decay X → fermion-antifermion pairs, the fermions must be allowed by the interaction term.

Wait, the fermion content in the Lagrangian must be such that the interaction term is allowed. So in the term, it's something like X ψ_f ψ_f, because the Yukawa term is usually something like g X ψ ψ. So X couples to fermion pairs. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair as long as the coupling is allowed and energy (mass) is sufficient.

But wait, what fermions are present in the Standard Model that X can couple to? The problem statement doesn't specify; it just gives the Lagrangian. So perhaps the coupling is to all possible fermions. But wait, in reality, the Yukawa coupling is between a scalar and fermions, but in the Standard Model, the Higgs couples to fermions proportionally to their masses. But here, X is a new boson; perhaps it's a heavy scalar that could couple to various fermions.

But the question is about the kinematically allowed decays, which depends on the fermion masses. Because for X to decay into a pair of fermions f and f-bar, the sum of the fermion masses must be less than the mass of X. So X's mass is 6 GeV. So the possible decay products are fermions whose mass is less than 3 GeV, because each fermion would take at most 3 GeV (since 2m < M_X → m < M_X/2).

Wait, but some fermions are heavier than that. For example, the top quark is way too heavy, but maybe others. Let's list the fermion masses:

- Electron: ~0.511 MeV → much less than 3 GeV, so allowed.
- Muon: ~105.7 MeV → allowed.
- Tau: ~1.78 GeV → allowed since 1.78 < 3.
- Quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top.

Wait, but quark masses are a bit tricky because they're current masses. The up and down quarks are light (like <10 MeV), so their anti-pairs can be produced. The strange quark is about 100 MeV, way under 3 GeV. The charm quark is around 1.5 GeV, so 2m_c is about 3 GeV. Hmm, wait, 2 * 1.5 GeV is 3 GeV. So for X to decay into c c-bar, the mass must be at least 2m_c. Since X is 6 GeV, which is exactly 2 * 3 GeV, but wait, 2m_c is 3 GeV. So 6 GeV is way more than that. So c c-bar is allowed.

Wait, the charm quark mass is about 1.2-1.5 GeV. Let me double-check: my notes say the current masses are approximately: up ~2.2 MeV, down ~4.7 MeV, strange ~95 MeV, charm ~1.5 GeV, bottom ~4.5 GeV, top ~173 GeV.

So, the bottom quark mass is around 4.5 GeV. So 2m_b would be 9 GeV, which is higher than X's mass of 6 GeV. So X cannot decay into b b-bar. Similarly, top quarks are way too heavy (173 GeV each), so 2m_t is even larger, so no decay into
