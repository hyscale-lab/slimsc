Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let's read it carefully. The question is about particles associated with spontaneously broken symmetries. The options are Phonon, Skyrmion, Magnon, and Pion. I need to pick which one is not associated with such a broken symmetry.

Hmm, I remember that when a system undergoes spontaneous symmetry breaking, it leads to the appearance of new particles called Goldstone bosons. These are massless particles that correspond to the broken symmetries. But wait, not all of these particles are Goldstone bosons, right?

Let me think about each option. 

Option A: Phonon. Phonons are quantized sound waves in a crystal lattice. I think they arise from the quantization of elastic vibrations. But wait, are they related to broken symmetry? Well, phonons are usually considered in the context of crystalline structures where translational symmetry is broken. So yes, when a solid forms a crystal, the original translational symmetry (continuous) is broken into a discrete symmetry. So phonons would be associated with this broken symmetry. But wait, I'm not sure if phonons are Goldstone bosons. Because the symmetry breaking in crystals is discrete, not continuous. Oh wait, Goldstone's theorem applies to continuous symmetries. So if the symmetry is discrete, maybe there are no Goldstone bosons. Hmm, so phonons might not be Goldstone bosons. But I'm a bit confused here.

Option B: Skyrmion. Skyrmions are topological solitons, right? They arise in certain field theories, like in models of nuclear physics. I remember that they are associated with pionic matter. Skyrmions are solutions to the equations of motion in a theory with a certain symmetry breaking. So they definitely come from a spontaneously broken symmetry.

Option C: Magnon. Magnons are the quanta of spin waves in a magnetically ordered material. They result from the quantization of spin fluctuations. This occurs when a material has magnetic ordering, which breaks the rotational symmetry (like when a ferromagnet forms). So this is a case of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Magnons are Goldstone bosons in such systems because the continuous rotational symmetry is broken to a discrete symmetry, leading to massless excitations. So magnons are associated with broken symmetry.

Option D: Pion. Pions are mesons, and I remember that in the context of chiral symmetry breaking. Chiral symmetry is a continuous symmetry in QCD which is spontaneously broken at low energies. The pions are the Goldstone bosons of this symmetry breaking. So pions are definitely associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry.

Wait, so the question is which particle is NOT associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. So if I can find which option is not a Goldstone boson, that's the answer.

Phonon: As I thought earlier, in crystals, the symmetry is broken, but it's a discrete symmetry. Since Goldstone's theorem only applies
