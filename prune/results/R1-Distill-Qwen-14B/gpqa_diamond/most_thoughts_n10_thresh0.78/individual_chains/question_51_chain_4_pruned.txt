Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy when a charge is near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think.

Alright, the setup is: a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Wait, potential energy in electrostatics, right? I remember that when you bring charges together, the potential energy changes based on their interactions. But this involves a conducting sphere, which complicates things a bit.

Grounded conducting sphere... Oh right, grounding means the sphere is connected to the Earth, so any excess charge will go to the Earth. Wait no, wait. Wait, actually, when a conductor is grounded, any charge on it can leave or enter the ground. But in this case, the sphere is conducting and grounded, and we're placing a charge near it.

Wait, the sphere is conducting, so the charges will redistribute on its surface. But since it's grounded, the potential on the sphere must be zero because it's the same as Earth's potential. Oh wait, no, wait! Grounded means the sphere's potential is the same as Earth's, which is considered zero. So the sphere's potential is zero, but how does that affect the charge induced on it?

Hmm, when you bring a charge q near a conducting sphere, the induced charges on the sphere will arrange themselves such that the potential on the surface is the same everywhere. But since the sphere is conducting, the induced charges will be on the surface.

Wait, the sphere is initially neutral because it's grounded. So when a charge q is placed near it, the sphere's surface will develop induced charges. The charge q will induce an opposite charge on the near side of the sphere and a same charge on the far side? No, wait, no. Wait, if the sphere is conducting and neutral, then placing a positive charge q near it would cause the electrons in the sphere to be attracted to the near side, leaving positive charges on the far side. So the near side has induced negative charge, far side positive. But since the sphere is grounded, those charges can flow away. Oh wait, no, wait: when you bring a charge near a conductor, the induced charges redistribute, but since it's grounded, the conductor can lose or gain electrons to maintain zero potential.

Wait, maybe I should think about image
