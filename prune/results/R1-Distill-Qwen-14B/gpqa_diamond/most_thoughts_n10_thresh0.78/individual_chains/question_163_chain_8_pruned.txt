Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident about all the steps, but let's try to work through it. 

The question is about dissolving iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, in a strong monobasic acid. The goal is to find out the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid needed and the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D with different pH and volumes.

First, I'll jot down what I know. Fe(OH)3 is a sparingly soluble hydroxide. I remember that when a hydroxide reacts with an acid, it typically produces water and the corresponding salt. Since the acid is monobasic and strong, like HCl, the reaction should be straightforward.

The reaction equation should be something like Fe(OH)3 + H+ → Fe^3+ + H2O. Wait, no, actually, Fe(OH)3 is a trihydroxide, so the reaction would probably involve three H+ ions. So, the balanced equation should be Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. Right, that makes sense because each OH- would react with an H+ to form water.

Next, I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 is present. The problem states 0.1 grams. I should calculate the number of moles here. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is Fe (about 55.85 g/mol) plus 3*(O (16) + H (1)). So, 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol. 

Moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Hmm, that's like 9.36e-4 moles.

Since the reaction is 1:3 (each Fe(OH)3 needs 3 H+), the moles of H+ needed would be 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 moles.

The acid is 0.1 M, which means moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So, Volume = moles / Molarity. Plugging in the numbers: 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L, which is 28.08 cm³. Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 28.05, which is very close. So that's a possible answer.

But wait, the problem says "minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid". So why isn't it exactly 28.08? Maybe because the solution volume is 100 cm³, so does that affect the calculation? Hmm, no, because the volume of the solution is 100 cm³, but the acid is being added to it. Wait, but the acid's volume is part of the total solution volume. So when you add the acid, the total volume becomes 100 cm³ plus the acid's volume. Wait, no, no. The problem says "100 cm³ total volume", so the total solution after adding the acid must be 100 cm³. So the acid volume added plus the initial volume (maybe 100 cm³ is the final volume, which includes the acid). Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, the problem says "dissolve ... in 100 cm³ total volume." So the solution after adding acid and everything is 100 cm³. So when you add the acid, the solution's total volume is 100 cm³. So the volume of acid (V_acid) that is added will be part of that 100 cm³. So the initial volume might be the volume of Fe(OH)3, but I don't think Fe(OH)3's solid volume is considered. Maybe we can ignore it, as it's a small solid. So when you add V_acid, the total solution is 100 cm³, so V_acid is less than 100 cm³.

Wait, but in my initial calculation, I didn't consider the solution's total volume. Let me think again. The initial moles of H+ required are 3 * n(Fe(OH
