Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out which statement is incorrect. Let's break it down step by step.

The question starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, I remember that C3H6 can be either propene or propane. Wait, wait. Propene is C3H6 because it's CH2=CHCH3. Propane is C3H8, so no. So A must be propene, right? Because C3H6 is the formula for propene. So when A undergoes bromination in carbon tetrachloride, that's probably an addition reaction. But wait, what's the condition here? Bromination in CCl4 usually refers to addition across a double bond. So propene would add bromine to form 1,2-dibromopropane. So that's compound B.

Then, B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a base, and if B is a dibromide, that's a dihalide. So in the presence of a strong base like alcoholic KOH, it might undergo elimination. Since B is 1,2-dibromopropane, when KOH is added, it would likely eliminate HBr twice, forming propene again. Wait, wait, no. Wait, let me think. When 1,2-dibromopropane reacts with alcoholic KOH, itâ€™s a dehydrohalogenation. Let me imagine the structure: CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? No, wait, wait. 1,2-dibromopropane would be CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. After adding bromine, it becomes CH2BrCHBrCH3. So when B is CH2BrCHBrCH3, reacting with alcoholic KOH would eliminate two HBr molecules, perhaps.

Wait, no, 1,2-dibromide would be more like CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So when KOH (alcohol) is added, it would eliminate twice, so the double bond could form between C1 and C2 or C2 and C3. Wait, but in propene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So elimination would form propene again. So C would be propene, same as A? Or wait, maybe not. Alternatively, if it's 1,2-dibromide, elimination would form 1-propene or 2-propene? But propene is CH2=CHCH3, which is 1-propene. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me sketch this.

Compound A: CH2
