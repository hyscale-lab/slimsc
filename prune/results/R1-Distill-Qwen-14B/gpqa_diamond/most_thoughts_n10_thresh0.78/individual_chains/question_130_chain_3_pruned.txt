Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy, specifically dealing with quasars and something called Lyman alpha absorption. Hmm, let me try to think through this.

So, the question is about estimating the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen that absorb light from background quasars. The wavelength they're talking about is the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is around 1216 Angstroms. The goal is to find the minimum redshift such that these clouds can be detected using optical ground-based telescopes.

Wait, I remember that redshift is related to how much the wavelength of light stretches as it travels through the expanding universe. So if a quasar emits light at a certain wavelength, and the universe's expansion causes that light to be stretched, we see it at a longer wavelength. The Lyman alpha emission line is usually in the ultraviolet range, right? Because hydrogen emits at 1216 Angstroms, which is about 0.1216 micrometers. But optical telescopes can't see that; they observe longer wavelengths, like visible light, which is about 400-700 nm or 4000-7000 Angstroms.

So the Lyman alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms. For us to see it in the optical range (which ground-based telescopes use), the wavelength must be redshifted into that range. Therefore, the observed wavelength (lambda_observed) should be greater than 4000 Angstroms since that's where optical light starts. Wait, no, because optical is 400 nm (4000 Ang) to 700 nm (7000 Ang). So the observed wavelength needs to be within that range.

But wait, the clouds are neutral hydrogen, so they might absorb the quasar's light at Lyman alpha. So if the quasar's light at 1216 Ang is absorbed by hydrogen in a cloud, then the absorption line would appear at 1216*(1+z), where z is the redshift. But we need to detect this absorption line in the optical range, so 1216*(1+z) should be less than or equal to 7000 Angstroms (since that's the upper limit for optical, assuming). Wait, no, because
