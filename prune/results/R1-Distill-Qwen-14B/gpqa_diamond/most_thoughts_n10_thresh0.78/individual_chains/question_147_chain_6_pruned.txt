Okay, so I have this physics problem about an annihilation process. Hmm, let me see what it's about. The reaction is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A-. Wait, no, wait. The question says it's p plus anti-p, so p and anti-proton. Oh right, so protons and antiprotons annihilating each other.

The question gives me that the antiproton is slowly moving. Oh, so it's moving at a low speed compared to the speed of light, maybe non-relativistic? Or at least not ultra-relativistic. And the mass of A is given as m_A c squared equals 300 MeV. Wait, but protons and antiprotons have their own rest masses. Let me think.

Proton mass is about 938 MeV/c², right? So each has that rest energy. So when they annihilate, they convert their mass into energy, which in this case is creating these A particles. So four particles are produced: two A+ and two A-. So that's two pairs, each A+ and A-.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the velocity of particle A. So each A particle, whether positive or negative, has the same mass because they are matter and antimatter. So their rest mass is 300 MeV each.

Wait, the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. So their rest masses are each 938 MeV. When they annihilate, the total energy available would be the sum of their rest energies plus any kinetic energy they have. But wait, the antiproton is moving slowly. So its kinetic energy is low, maybe not enough to consider relativistic effects. So perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly. Or maybe both are moving, but their speeds are such that the problem simplifies.

Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So it's moving at a speed much lower than c, so perhaps we can approximate it with non-relativistic mechanics. But wait, when
