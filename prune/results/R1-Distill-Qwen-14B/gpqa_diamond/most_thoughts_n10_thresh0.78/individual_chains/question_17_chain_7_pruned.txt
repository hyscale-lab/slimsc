Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see. The question says we have a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, EDTA is that chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+.

The problem gives me KCa-EDTA as 5x10^10. I remember that K is the formation constant, which tells us how strong the complex is. A high K means the complex is stable. So, K is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA form the complex.

The question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. Right, because when you have a complex like that, the calcium isn't free in solution; most of it is tied up in the complex. So we need to find [Ca²+] in this solution.

Wait, what's the reaction here? EDTA is usually in its deprotonated form when it complexes with metals. Since the pH is ideal, I think that means all the EDTA is in the right form to complex with Ca²+. So the reaction is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-

Or wait, actually, the complex is Ca-EDTA, which I think is a 1:1 complex. So the formation constant K is given by:

K = [CaEDTA] / ([Ca²+][EDTA])

Given that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So if all the Ca and EDTA are in the complex, then the initial concentrations must be such that [CaEDTA] is 0.02 M. But wait, no, because in solution, some of the complex may dissociate. So the complex is 0.02 M, and we can assume that the majority is complexed, but there's some free Ca²+ and EDTA.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says it's a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration is 0.02 M of the complex. So, I think I should consider the dissociation of the complex into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

So the formation constant K is:

K = [Ca²+][EDTA] / [CaEDTA]

Wait, no, no. Wait, the formation constant is for the reaction:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- ; K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA])

So given that, we can set up the problem. Let me think about the initial conditions. The solution has 0.02 M of the complex. Assuming that the dissociation is minimal because K is very large (5e10), so the complex doesn't dissociate much. So the concentration of Ca²+ would
