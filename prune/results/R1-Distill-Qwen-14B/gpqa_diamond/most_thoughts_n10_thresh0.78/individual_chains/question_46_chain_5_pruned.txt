Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

First, I should probably draw the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent-1-ene means a five-carbon chain with a double bond starting at the first carbon. So the structure would be CH₂=CHCH(CH₂CH₃)CH₂CH₃? Wait no, wait. Wait, wait. Let me think again. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₂CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent has five carbons. So pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. Wait, but the correct structure is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is C5H10. Wait no, wait, pent-1-ene would be CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3, which is correct. But the compound here is 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. Then, on C3, there's a methyl group.

Wait, let me write the structure. So pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But 3-methyl would mean a methyl group on the third carbon. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH2CH3? Or maybe CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? Wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Wait, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, let's count the carbons. Pent means five carbons. So for 3-methylpent-1-ene, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, that's five carbons. Let me count: 1 (CH₂=CH-), 2 (CH-), 3 (CH(CH3)-), 4 (CH2), and 5 (CH3). Wait,
