Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about bromine undergoing electrophilic substitution with six different aromatic compounds. We need to arrange them based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer's yield. The options are given as A to D.

First, I'll list the compounds as they are:

1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene)
2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)
3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)
4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)
6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)

The reaction is with excess bromine, and each forms only one monobromo derivative. So, for each substituent, I need to determine the directing effect and whether there's steric hindrance or any other factors that might influence the para product's yield.

Electrophilic substitution: The substituents on the benzene ring will direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to certain positions, either ortho, meta, or para. Also, activating groups make the ring more reactive, while deactivating groups make it less reactive.

Let me go through each substituent:

1) Toluene (CH3-): The methyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So, when bromine adds, it can go to para position. But wait, the substituent is in the para position relative to where? Wait, no, the substituent is already on the benzene. So the methyl group directs incoming Br+ to ortho and para positions relative to itself. So the bromine can end up in para to the methyl (which would be meta to itself?), wait no, the substituent is in one position, incoming groups go ortho, meta, or para to that.

Wait, no. When a substituent is attached to benzene, the incoming electrophile adds either ortho (adjacent), meta (two carbons away), or para (opposite) to the substituent. For toluene, which is an activating group, the ring is more reactive and the substituent directs incoming Br to ortho and para positions. So, the major product would be a mix of ortho and para bromo derivatives.

But the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, how much para product is formed compared to ortho.

Wait, when the substituent is ortho/para-directing, the para product is often more favored than the ortho because of steric hindrance. The ortho positions are close to the substituent, so when adding Br, which is a bulky electrophile (since it's Br+ but in practice, it's probably Br2 with HBr as a catalyst?), steric hindrance might make para more favorable.

Wait, but in reality, for toluene (CH3- group), the major product of bromination is para. Because the ortho positions are adjacent to the methyl group, which is bulky, making ortho addition less favored. So para is the major product.

2) Ethyl benzoate (COOEt): The carbonyl group is a substituent. The ester group is a deactivating, meta-directing group. So the incoming Br will go meta to the ester group. So, the product would be meta-bromo ethyl benzoate. Therefore, the para-isomer is not formed here, right? Or wait, no, the substituent is meta-directing, so the bromine adds in the meta position relative to COOEt. So the para product isn't formed. So the para-isomer's yield is zero here. So when the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer, this would be the lowest (zero), but wait the options don't have zero. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. Wait, ethyl benzoate has a carbonyl group. The carbonyl is deactivating and meta-directing. So when bromine adds, it will add meta to the carbonyl. Therefore, the product will be meta-bromo ethyl benzoate. So, the para product is not formed in this case. So, the weight fraction of para is zero. That's the lowest.

3) Chlorobenzene (Cl): Chlorine is a substituent. It's a deactivating (due to its electronegativity) but ortho/para-directing group. So, Cl is a meta director? No, wait: Chlorine is a halogen, which is a special case. It's deactivating because of the electronegativity, but it's ortho/para-directing because of the lone pairs on Cl. So, the incoming Br will go to ortho or para positions relative to Cl.

But wait, the Cl is on the benzene. So, when brominating chlorobenzene, the Br can add either ortho, meta, or para to the Cl.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. The substituent is Cl. So, substituent is at position 1. Then the incoming Br can be at 2 (ortho), 3 (meta), or 4 (para). But Cl is deactivating, ortho/para director. So, the major products are ortho and para.

But which is more? For substituents that are ortho/para directors, the para product is generally more favored because of steric reasons. So, in chlorobenzene, the para product would be the major one. Wait, but wait,
