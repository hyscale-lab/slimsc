Okay, I need to figure out which compound corresponds to the given spectroscopic data. Let's start by analyzing the data step by step.

First, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. The formula is C9H11NO2. I'll use the formula Degrees of Unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is zero. So, C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2.

Plugging in: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2 = (10)/2 = 5 degrees. So, 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a benzene ring (which is 4 degrees, since it's three double bonds or a ring plus three double bonds) plus maybe a carbonyl group or an amide or something. So likely a benzene ring with substituents.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm^-1. Those are probably N-H stretches, like amine or amide groups. The broad nature suggests perhaps an amide, as amines can sometimes be sharper. Also, the strong band at 1720 cm^-1 likely indicates a carbonyl group (C=O). So maybe an amide or an ester. Since the IR shows two peaks around 3400, maybe it's an amide, because amides have N-H stretches in that region. Ester carbonyls are usually around 1740, but this is 1720, which could be an amide's carbonyl.

Moving to the 1H NMR. Let's list the peaks:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H. That's likely a CH2CH3 group, because the triplet and 3H suggests it's next to a CH2. So maybe an ethyl group attached somewhere.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad singlet could be an NH2 group, but wait, but the IR suggests maybe amide N-H. Alternatively, it could be an OCH2 group. Let me think. If it's OCH2, then the 4.0 ppm is where OCH2 would appear. But wait, another peak is at 4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H. Quartet and around 4.5 ppm suggests perhaps a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like an ester's OCH2, or maybe an amide's NCH2. Wait, but if it's an ester, the structure would be R-O-CO-R. So perhaps ethyl ester groups.

So, 1.20 (t, 3H) is the ethyl's CH3. Then 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) could be an OCH2, but the quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) is another CH2. Wait, maybe it's adjacent to another CH2. Let me think of an ethyl group attached to oxygen, like OCH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, ethyl is CH2CH3, so OCH2CH3 would give a triplet around 1.2 and a quartet around 4.1-4.3. Hmm, but in the given NMR, the quartet is at 4.5 and the triplet is at 1.20. That's a bit higher shift for OCH2. Alternatively, perhaps it's adjacent to an electronegative atom, like an ester group.

Let me think about the integration. The triplet (3H) is the ethyl's CH3. The quartet (2H) at 4.5 is probably the CH2 connected to oxygen. So maybe it's an ethyl ester. For example, in ethyl acetate, the ethyl group is at around 1.2 (triplet), and the OCH2 is around 4.1 as a quartet. But in this case, it's at 4.5. Hmm, maybe the ethyl group is part of an amide or another structure.

Wait, looking at the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). This suggests a para-substituted benzene ring, as the two doublets each with 2H would indicate two substituents opposite each other on the ring. So perhaps a substituent at the para position with two groups. Or maybe two substituents that are activating, like an amino group and an ester or something.

Wait, if the substituents are in the para
