Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, I've studied some basics, but I'm a bit rusty, so I need to think this through.

The Hamiltonian given is H equals epsilon times the dot product of sigma and n. Sigma is the vector of Pauli matrices, right? And n is a unit vector. So, mathematically, H = ε (σ · n). Wait, the sigma vector is (σx, σy, σz), so when you take the dot product with n, which is (nx, ny, nz), it becomes ε (σx nx + σy ny + σz nz).

I remember that Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices. Each sigma component is a matrix. So the Hamiltonian H must be a 2x2 matrix as well. And since H is an operator, its eigenvalues will be found by solving the characteristic equation, which involves the determinant.

But wait, there's probably a smarter way to do this without getting into the matrix multiplication. I think diagonalizing the operator is the way to go, but maybe there's a shortcut. Oh right! The Pauli matrices have specific properties when it comes to spin systems. 

Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1. For example, σx, σy, σz all have eigenvalues 1 and -1. But when you take a linear combination like σ · n, the eigenvalues might change. Wait, no, not exactly. Because σ · n is a vector in the Bloch sphere direction, the eigenvalues might be scaled by the coefficients.

Wait, another thought: the operator σ · n is a spin operator. The eigenvalues of spin operators are related to the spin component along a particular direction. For spin-1/2 particles, the spin component S along any direction has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. 

Wait a minute, but wait! The Pauli matrices are related to the spin operators. Specifically, σ = 2 S / ħ. Because S = ħ σ / 2. So if I have H = ε σ · n, substituting S gives H = ε (2 S · n) / ħ. So H = (2 ε / ħ) S · n.

The eigenvalues of S · n are ± ħ/2. So substituting back
