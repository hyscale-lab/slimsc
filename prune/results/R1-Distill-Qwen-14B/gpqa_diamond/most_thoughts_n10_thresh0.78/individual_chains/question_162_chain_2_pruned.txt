Alright, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, okay, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but I'll try to break it down.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, I'm a bit confused because the metric usually has terms involving time and other coordinates, but here it's only in dx and dy. So maybe this is a 2-dimensional metric? Like a 2-manifold embedded somehow?

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh, right! In general relativity, a pseudosphere is a type of solution to Einstein's equations, representing a universe with negative spatial curvature. But I think the metric given here might not be the standard pseudosphere metric. Let me think again.

Wait, the standard metric for a pseudosphere (or hyperbolic space) in 2D is usually something like ds² = dr² + (a² cosh(r/a))² dθ², where a is the radius. But that's in polar coordinates. Alternatively, sometimes it's written in terms of x and y, but I'm not exactly sure how.

Wait, the given metric is expressed in terms of x and y. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). Hmm. Let me see when that denominator is positive because for real ds², the denominator must be positive. So 4 - x² - y² > 0 → x² + y² <4. So this
