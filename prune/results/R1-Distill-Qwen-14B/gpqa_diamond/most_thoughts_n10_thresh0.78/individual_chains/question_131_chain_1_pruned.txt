Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene was dehydrated to form an anhydride. The anhydride has a single peak in the 1H NMR at 7 ppm and two peaks in the 13C NMR at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products, a major and minor, both with formula C13H16O3.

The next part is about the NOESY NMR spectra. The major product has a cross-peak, but the minor doesn't. The question is about which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.

First, the starting material is a cis-dicarboxylic acid. When it dehydrates, it forms an anhydride. The structure of the anhydride probably has two carboxylic acid groups connected by an oxygen bridge, right? But since the starting acid had a cis-alkene, the dehydration would form an anhydride with a double bond. Wait, but dehydration of a diacid would typically form an anhydride without a double bond. Oh wait, no, maybe it's a cyclic anhydride. Wait, perhaps the diacid has two -COOH groups on adjacent carbons, so when the OH from each is lost, it forms an anhydride, and the double bond is formed elsewhere? Or maybe the dehydration is via an elimination reaction, creating a double bond in the process.

Wait, the starting acid is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. So the structure would be something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait, that's not a double bond. Oh, wait, maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, but no, that's not a double bond. Wait, wait. Oh, maybe it's a structure like HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that doesn't have a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that still doesn't have a double bond. Wait, maybe I'm thinking about it wrong. Oh, wait, the starting material is a cis-dicarboxylic acid, meaning that the two COOH groups are on adjacent carbons, and those adjacent carbons are connected by a double bond. So the structure is something like HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but that's not a double bond. Wait, no, perhaps it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but that's a single bond. Oh
