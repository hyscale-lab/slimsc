Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my planetary science, but let's think through this step by step.

The question is asking which exoplanet has the highest density. There are four options, a through d, each describing a planet with different properties. I need to figure out the density for each and compare them.

Wait, density is mass divided by volume. So I remember that for planets, if they have the same composition as Earth, their density might be similar. But when mass and radius change, that affects both mass and volume, so density changes accordingly.

Let me look at each option:

Option a: Earth-mass and Earth-radius. Well, Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, I think. So this planet's density would be the same as Earth's, right? So that's a starting point.

Option b: 2 Earth masses and density 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, wait. The given density is already 5.5, so that's the number right there. So this planet's density is 5.5. So compared to a, which is 5.5 as well—so same density? Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the options. Oh wait, no, option b says the planet has 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5. So its density is given, so no need to compute, it's 5.5.

Option c: Same composition as Earth, but 5 times more massive. Same composition implies same density as Earth, right? Because if the composition is the same, the density remains the same. So if Earth's density is 5.5, this planet's is also 5.5. But wait, density is mass/volume. But if it's 5 times more massive, but same composition, the radius would be larger. But the question is about density, so if composition is same, density is same. So density is 5.5.

Option d: Same composition as Earth, half the mass. Again, same density as Earth, so 5.5. Hmm, so all a, b, c, d have the same density? But wait, no, that can't be right because the options aren't all the same. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, option a's description is both Earth mass
