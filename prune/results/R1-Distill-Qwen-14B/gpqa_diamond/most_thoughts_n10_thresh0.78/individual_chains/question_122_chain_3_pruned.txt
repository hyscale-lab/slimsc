Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many distinct hydrogen signals are in the NMR spectrum of the final product. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting with acetic acid. Let's see each step.

First reaction: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. I remember that when acetic acid reacts with bromine in the presence of acetic anhydride and pyridine, it's a bromination reaction. Specifically, I think it's the formation of an acyl bromide. Acetic acid has an -OH group, and under these conditions, it probably loses a water molecule. So, the product might be acetyl bromide, which is CH3COBr. Because pyridine is a base, it probably helps to absorb the HBr that's formed, making the reaction go to completion.

So product 1 is acetyl bromide, CH3COBr.

Next step: Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid. Hmm, heating an acyl bromide with ethanol and acid—I think that's a nucleophilic substitution reaction. The bromide is a good leaving group, and ethanol acts as a nucleophile. So the ethanol would attack the carbonyl carbon, replacing the bromide. That would form ethyl acetate, right? Because the reaction is an esterification. So product 2 is ethyl acetate, CH3COOCH2CH3.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second. Wait, acetyl bromide is CH3COBr. When it reacts with ethanol (which is a good nucleophile, especially under acidic conditions), the OH in ethanol would attack the carbonyl carbon, displacing Br- as the leaving group. So the product would be CH3CO-OEt (ethyl ester), which is ethyl acetate. So yes, product 2 is ethyl acetate.

Third reaction: Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide. Sodium cyanide is a good nucleophile. So in the presence of an ester, I think the cyanide would attack the carbonyl group. Ester hydrolysis with CN-? Wait, but conditions matter. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic acyl substitution. So the ester, when treated with CN-, would substitute the OEt group with OCN-? Wait, but that might not be right. Alternatively, maybe the ester is converted into a nitrile.

Wait, no, another possibility: the ester has a carbonyl group. When treated with CN- (from NaCN), perhaps it undergoes a substitution. The mechanism would involve the CN- attacking the carbonyl carbon, which is electrophilic. Then, the OEt group would leave as EtO- but wait, that's a poor leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps the ester is first converted into an acid, but wait, no, in presence of a base like CN-? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ester is undergoing a nucleophilic acyl substitution where the OEt is replaced by CN. So the product would be CH3COCN, which is acetylnitrile or ethyl cyanide? No, wait, wait. Let me think. The structure of ethyl acetate is CH3CO-OEt. When CN- attacks, the oxygen would have a lone pair, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the ester is hydrolyzed to the acid, but with NaCN, perhaps the acid is further reacting. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another approach: When an ester reacts with sodium cyanide, under what conditions? Maybe in a basic condition, but I think sodium cyanide is a strong base. Or perhaps it's a substitution. So the ester has the structure R-O-CO-R'. So, the carbonyl is attacked by CN-, leading to the displacement of the OR' group. So, product 3 would be CH3COCN, which is acetonitrile. Wait, no, wait. Acetonitrile is (CH3)2C≡N, isn't it? No, wait. Wait, no. Acetone is (CH3)2CO, and acetonitrile would be (CH3)2C≡N. But wait, our starting material after ester is CH3COOEt. So, when CN- attacks, the product would be CH3CON(CN), which would be CH3C(O)CN. That's acetyl cyanide, also known as propionitrile. Wait, no, wait. Let me think about the structure.

CH3COOEt is the ester. When the oxygen is attached to the carbonyl group, the structure is O=C-OEt. When the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, the OEt group leaves as a leaving group, but wait, OEt- is a poor leaving group. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the ester is first hydrolyzed to the acid, and then the acid reacts with CN-. But that wouldn't make sense because if you have NaCN in a basic solution, maybe the ester isn't hydrolyzed but undergoes another reaction.

Wait, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution. So the ester (CH3CO-OEt) reacts with CN- to form CH3CO-CN, which is acetyl cyanide. So the product 3 would be CH3C(O)CN, which is propanenitrile, I think. So product 3 is acetonitrile? No, wait, wait. Acetonitrile is (CH3)2CN. No, wait, I'm getting my nitriles mixed up. Let's think: the structure of product 3 would have a cyano group attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the structure would be CH3-C(O)-CN? No, that can't be right because the carbonyl would have a negative charge. Wait, no, maybe it's more like CH3-C≡N. No, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused again.

Wait, another perspective: what's the structure of ethyl acetate? It's CH3COOCH2CH3. When treated with NaCN, perhaps it's a substitution where the OCH2CH3 group is replaced by CN. So the product would be CH3COCN.
