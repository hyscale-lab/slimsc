Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish between these two energy levels. The options are A to D.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I remember something about the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time is at least ħ/2. Or was it ħ? Let me think. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. Or maybe I'm mixing this up with something else. Oh, no, wait, I think it's ħ over two, but sometimes people use the approximation without the ½ factor. Hmm.

So the idea is that the shorter the lifetime (Δt) of a state, the less precisely we can know its energy. Because a shorter Δt implies a larger uncertainty ΔE, right? So the energy difference between the two states needs to be larger than the uncertainty for them to be distinguishable. Otherwise, their energies would overlap, making it hard to tell them apart.

Wait, but in this problem, each state has its own lifetime. Oh, wait no, wait. The two states have different lifetimes. So perhaps each state has a certain uncertainty in energy. But we're looking for the energy difference between E2 and E1, let's say ΔE = E2 - E1. We need this ΔE to be such that it's larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state, so that they can be resolved.

Hmm, but how exactly do the lifetimes relate to the energy uncertainty? Oh, right! The uncertainty in energy (ΔE) is inversely proportional to the lifetime (Δt) of the state. So for each state, ΔE = ħ / (Δt). But which Δt do we use here? Wait, the two states have different lifetimes. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties? Because each state's energy is uncertain by its own ΔE. So the minimum ΔE required for them to be distinguishable would be when ΔE is greater than the sum of the individual uncertainties.

Wait, maybe I should approach it more systematically. The line width or the uncertainty in energy for each state is given by ΔE = ħ / (2Δt), but sometimes it's taken as ħ/Δt. Let me double-check. The energy-time uncertainty relation is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, so ΔE ≥ ħ/(2Δt). So for each state, the uncertainty is at least ħ/(2Δt).

So for E1 with Δt = 1e-9 s, ΔE1 = ħ/(2*1e-9). Similarly, E2 has Δt = 1e-8 s, so ΔE2 = ħ/(2*1e-8). The energy difference between the two states needs to be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, I think. Because if their energies are too close, the uncertainties might overlap, making them indistinguishable.

So the required ΔE (E2 - E1) should be greater than (ΔE1 + ΔE2). Because each state's energy is a little uncertain, so the difference has to be more than the sum of the uncertainties to be resolved.

So let's compute that. Let me get the value of ħ in eV·s. I remember that ħ is approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s. So,

ΔE1 = (6.582e-16) / (2 * 1e-9) ) = (6.582e-16) / (2e-9) ) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-7 = 3.291e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = (6.582e-16) / (2 * 1e-8) ) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-8 = 3.291e-8 eV.

So the sum of the uncertainties is 3.291e-7 + 3.291e-8 = let's calculate that. 3.291e-7 is 32.91e-8, adding 3.291e-8 gives 36.201e-8 eV, which is 3.6201e-7 eV.

So the energy difference ΔE must be greater than approximately 3.62e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 is way smaller than 3.62e-7, so no.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller, so no.

C) 1e-4 eV → 1e-4 is 0.0001, which is much larger than 3.62e-7, so yes, this is suitable.

D) 1e-8 eV → 1e-8 is 0.00000001, which is 1e-8 eV. Our required ΔE is 3.62e-7, which is ten times larger than 3.62e-7. Wait, 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, and 3.62e-7 is about 3.6e-7. So 1e-8 is smaller than 3.6e-7. So option D is also not sufficient.

Wait, but wait another thing. The question says "the energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved." So the correct ΔE must be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties. So the smallest acceptable ΔE would be just over 3.62e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, none of them exactly match this. Let's see the options again:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. That's way larger than 3.62e-7 eV (which is 0.000000362 eV). So C is way larger, so it's acceptable.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.00000001 eV. That's smaller than 3.62e-7 eV, so it's not sufficient.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I miscalculate the sum? Let me double-check.

ΔE1 is 3.291e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 3.291e-8 eV.

Adding them together: 3.291e-7 + 3.291e-8 = 3.6201e-7 eV.

So sum is 3.62e-7 eV. So any ΔE greater than that is acceptable.

So option C is 1e-4 eV which is 1e-4 = 1e-4 is approximately 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 * 1e6 meV = 100 meV. Wait, 1e-4 eV is 100 milli-eV. Hmm, but 3.62e-7 eV is 0.362 micro-eV. So 1e-4 is much larger, so it's way beyond the required.

So the correct answer must be C.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C says 1e-4 eV. So that's 0.0001 eV, which is way bigger than 3.62e-7 eV, so it's plenty.

But wait another point: maybe the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty of the measurement, but perhaps I should think in terms of the energy difference being greater than the uncertainty for each state. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the individual ΔE for each state.

Wait, no, because each state's energy is uncertain, so the difference should be larger than the sum of the two uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is less than the sum of the uncertainties, the two states might overlap in energy, making it impossible to distinguish them.

Wait, let me think of it this way: Suppose E1 is uncertain by ΔE1, and E2 is uncertain by ΔE2. For the two states to be distinguishable, the lower end of E2 (E2 - ΔE2) must be higher than the upper end of E1 (E1 + ΔE1). So,

E2 - ΔE2 > E1 + ΔE1

Which implies:

E2 - E1 > ΔE1 + ΔE2

So the minimum energy difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties.

So the required ΔE is sum of (ΔE1 + ΔE2) = 3.62e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way larger than that. So that's acceptable.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.1e-7, smaller than 3.62e-7, so no.

So the correct answer is C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]

Here, \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy, and \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state. For each state, the minimum uncertainty in energy is given by:

\[
\Delta E \geq \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta t}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the uncertainties for each state
The lifetimes of the two states are \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). Using \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \), we calculate:

1. For the first state (\( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \)):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta t_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
   \]

2. For the second state (\( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \)):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta t_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
   \]

### Step 2: Determine the required energy difference
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E > 3.291 \times 10^{-7} + 3.291 \times 10^{-8} = 3.6201 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A (\( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is \( 1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.
- **Option B (\( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is \( 1 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \), which is even smaller than Option A. Not sufficient.
- **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is \( 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.
- **Option D (\( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is \( 1 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

### Conclusion
The energy difference must be greater than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Among the options, only **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))** satisfies this condition.
