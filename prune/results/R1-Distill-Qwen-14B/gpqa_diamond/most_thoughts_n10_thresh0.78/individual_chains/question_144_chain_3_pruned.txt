Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it.

The question says X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance. They give the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different values in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle. The formula I think is something like distance = velocity * lifetime. But wait, how do I get the velocity of the meson? Oh right, from its energy and mass.

So first, I think I should calculate the lifetime of the meson. The lifetime is connected to the width Γ. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant and τ is the lifetime. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, I need to make sure about the units. Let me think. The width Γ is given in MeV, but I need to convert that into energy in J or something compatible with ħ's units.

Alternatively, I remember that the mean lifetime τ is inversely proportional to the width Γ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But let's get into the math.

First, let me get all the constants right. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. Hmm, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and 1 eV is 1.6e-19 joules. But working in GeV units might be easier here.

So Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.3
