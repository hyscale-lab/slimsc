Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules can be modeled using both rotational and vibrational quantum states. The question is about what momentum a photon needs to have so that when it's absorbed, the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So when it absorbs a photon, it must transition to the next higher state. But what exactly defines the next state in the rotation-vibration model?

I think the molecule's energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state would be the lowest rotational state, probably R=0, and the vibrational state ν=0. The next state would be either increasing the vibrational state or the rotational state. Hmm, but what's the next lowest energy state? Because sometimes vibrational transitions are higher in energy than rotational ones.

Wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." Oh, so the next state is the one with the least energy increase. So I need to find the photon energy that corresponds to the smallest possible jump from the fundamental state.

In the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized and given by E_rot = B * R*(R+1), where B is the rotational constant. But wait, wait, I think the rotational constant B is related to the moment of inertia. Oh right, B = (h²)/(8π² I), and I is the moment of inertia, which for a diatomic is I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass. So for the fundamental state, R=0, so the rotational energy is zero. Oh wait no, maybe R starts at 0, but the rotational energy is zero? Or is it the first excited state?

Wait, the fundamental state is the ground state, which for rotation is R=0. So the rotational energy is E_rot = B * (R)(R+1) * something. Wait, the energy levels for a rigid rotor are E_J = (ħ² / (2I)) J(J+1), where J is the rotational quantum number. But in the non-rigid rotor model, this might be more complex, but perhaps for this problem, we're assuming the rigid rotor approximation.

But the problem also involves vibration. The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (
