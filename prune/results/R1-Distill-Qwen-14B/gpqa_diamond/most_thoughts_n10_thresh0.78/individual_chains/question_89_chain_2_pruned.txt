Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me jot down the steps:

1. Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1, which is a light yellow solid.
2. Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2.
3. Product 2 undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethylsulfide to form product 3.
4. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

First, I need to figure out what each product is. Let's start with the first reaction.

Reaction 1: KOH and heat with 1,3-dibromoadamantane.
I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halides on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically E2, forming an alkene. If the dihalide is 1,3-dibromo, wait, wait—no, wait. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Oh, wait, adamantane has a structure where each carbon is connected in a diamond-like structure. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on adjacent carbons. Wait, no. Wait, let me clarify: adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings. Each bridgehead carbon is connected to two other bridgehead carbons. So 1 and 3 would be adjacent bridgeheads. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two adjacent bridgehead carbons.

When heated with KOH, which is a strong base, I think this would cause an elimination reaction. But wait, if the dihalide is vicinal (two adjacent), elimination would form an alkene. However, wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal, right? Wait, 1 and 3 are not adjacent? Wait, wait. Adamantane structure: Each bridgehead is numbered 1, 2, 3, 4? Let me think. No, actually, the structure of adamantane is such that each bridgehead is connected in a way where 1 is adjacent to 2 and 4, and 3 is adjacent to 2 and 4. So 1 and 3 are opposite each other? Or maybe not. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps 1 and 3 are adjacent.

Wait, perhaps I should sketch the structure of adamantane. Adamantane has a structure similar to a diamond, with four cyclohexane rings. Each bridgehead is connected to two others. So the positions 1 and 3 would be on adjacent bridgeheads. So, 1 and 3 are across a bridge, but in any case, the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, making them vicinal. So when KOH is used, elimination would occur, forming an alkene.

Wait, but wait. The product after KOH is a light yellow solid. Hmm, wait, elimination with KOH would form an alkene. But wait, if it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, elimination would form an alkene between carbons 1 and 3? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation. Each Br is on a bridgehead, and upon elimination, the two adjacent bridgeheads would form a double bond. So the product would be adamantene, which is an adamantane with a double bond. Wait, but that's if it's vicinal dihalide. So, product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene or something like that. Wait, no, wait. The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So when eliminating HBr from each Br, the two adjacent carbons (1 and 3) would form a double bond, so the product would be 1,3-diene? Or wait, no, because each elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, but wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclohexene ring within the adamantane structure. Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the NMR data given for product 1.

The 1H NMR of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, IR has a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm^-1. Wait, wait—wait, 1720 cm^-1 is a strong absorption, which is typical for a carbonyl group (C=O). But wait, if product 1 was formed by elimination with KOH, which is a strong base, that would form an alkene, but where's the carbonyl coming from? Oh, wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the reaction. Maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Br atoms on adjacent bridgeheads. KOH is a strong base, but also a nucleophile. Perhaps it's a double substitution. Wait, but substitution would require a good leaving group and perhaps a possible mechanism. But substitution on adjacent carbons might lead to some rearrangement.

Wait, another possibility: when two equivalents of KOH react, each Br is replaced by an -O- group, but that would form a cyclic structure. Wait, no, perhaps elimination is correct, but then how does the IR show a carbonyl?

Alternatively, maybe the product isn't an alkene but something else. Wait, wait a second—if after elimination, the product isn't an alkene but an epoxide? No, because epoxides come from dihalides via an SN2 mechanism with a base, but I don't think KOH would form an epoxide. Or maybe it's an elimination to form a ketone? Hmm, but how.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but the product is a diene. But then why the IR shows a carbonyl?

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me think about the IR absorption. 1720 cm^-1 is a carbonyl. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group. So perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution that forms a ketone.

Wait, how can that happen? If KOH is used with a dihalide. Hmm, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the reaction is a double elimination, but perhaps the base abstracts a proton, and one of the Br leaves, forming a carbocation, but that's less likely with KOH. Alternatively, perhaps the base deprotonates to form an enolate, but that requires a ketone, which we don't have yet.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. If the initial compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and upon heating with KOH, we get product 1 with a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the reaction is oxidation. Wait, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Unless there's some kind of elimination followed by oxidation, but that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination to form a ketone. Hmm, maybe each Br is adjacent to a CH2 group. Wait, maybe the structure is such that when the two Hs are abstracted, each elimination leads to the formation of a carbonyl.

Wait, for example, if you have adjacent Br atoms on CH2 groups, elimination of HBr from each could form a double bond. But if the structure is such that elimination leads to a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a CH2 group, and elimination leads to each CH2 becoming a carbonyl. Wait, but that
