Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Hmm, I need to find the partition function Z. Let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-beta E), where beta is 1/(kT). So each state contributes a term exp(-beta E), and I sum all these for all possible spin configurations.

Wait, since each spin can be +1 or -1, each spin has two possible states. So for three spins, the total number of possible states is 2^3 = 8. Right, that makes sense.

But calculating each term individually might be time-consuming. Maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think about the energy expression.

E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Since each S_i is ±1, each term S_i S_j is also ±1. So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 could be 3, 1, -1, or -3, depending on the spins.

Wait, let me think about the possible values of the sum (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). The maximum value each of the three terms can contribute is 1, so the maximum sum is 3. Can the sum be 3? That would require all three pairs to be 1, which happens when all spins are the same. Like all +1, or all -1.

Wait, no. If all are +1, S1S2 = 1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1 so sum is 3. Similarly, if all are -1, each product is 1 (since (-1)(-1)=1). So sum is 3 again. So that's two states with sum 3.

What about when two spins are +1 and one is -1? Let's say S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1. Wait, but wait: S1S2 is 1, S1S3 is -1, S2S3 is -1. So sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. So in this case, the sum is -1.

Wait, but how many states have sum equal to -1? Let's think about the possible configurations. There are three possible ways to have two +1 and one -1. Each choice of
