Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = 1/2 m ω² r². I remember that this is similar to the 3D version of the quantum harmonic oscillator, which is a common problem in QM.

The question is asking for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with the same energy eigenvalue. The options are given as A, B, C, D. 

First, I need to recall the energy levels of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. I think the energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers in each of the three dimensions. Oh wait, right! In three dimensions, the energy levels are given by the formula E(n_x, n_y, n_z) = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). 

Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed in terms of a single quantum number n, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So the energy is E_n = ħω (n + 3/2). That might be easier to think about. 

So the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. So the states are degenerate for the same n. 

Now, the question is about the third excited state. Hmm. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the ground state is the lowest energy state, so that would correspond to n=0 (n_x=n_y=n_z=0). Then the first excited state would be n=1, second excited n=2, third excited n=3. Because excited states are counted starting from the lowest higher state after the ground state. So third excited is n=3. 

Wait, is that correct? Wait, the ground state is n=0, first excited is n=1 (the lowest possible above ground), second is n=2, third is n=3. So yeah, third excited state is n=3.

So the energy E is ħω (3 + 3/2) )= ħω (9/2). So that would be (9/2) ħω. Let me check the options. Looking at the options, option A has that energy, and option C also has (9/2) ħω but only 3 eigenfunctions.

Next, the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for the same energy. Oh right, that's the degeneracy. Degeneracy is the number of distinct eigenfunctions that have the same energy. So for a given n, in 3D isotropic oscillator, the degeneracy is (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. Wait, is that right? Or is it something else.

Wait, I remember that for each n, the number of possible ways to have n_x + n_y + n_z = n is (n + 2 choose 2), which is (n+2)(n+1)/2. So for n=
