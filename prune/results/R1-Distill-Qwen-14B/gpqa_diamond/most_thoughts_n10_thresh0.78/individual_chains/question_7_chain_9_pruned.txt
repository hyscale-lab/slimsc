Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the annihilation of gamma rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Hmm, the question is asking about the energy at which the lifetime of high-energy gamma-rays is limited by the process γγ → e+ e-. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, I remember that when high-energy photons interact with the CMB, which is a bath of low-energy photons, they can annihilate into electron-positron pairs. The idea is that the high-energy gamma-ray (let's call its energy E) collides with a CMB photon (energy much lower, say ε). For this process to happen, there must be enough energy in the center-of-momentum frame to produce the rest mass of the electron-positron pair.

Wait, the rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, so the total energy in the center-of-mass frame needs to be at least twice that, so 1.022 MeV. Because E_cm = sqrt((E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2) when considering relativistic energies. But wait, the photons are moving in opposite directions, so their momenta might add up. Or are they?

Alternatively, I think the condition is that the product of the two photon energies must be at least equal to (m_e c^2)^2. Because in the frame where the two photons are moving in opposite directions, the invariant s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. Since photons have E = pc, that would be s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = 4 E1 E2. So s must be ≥ (2 m_e c^2)^2. So 4 E γ E_cmb ≥ (2 m_e c^2)^2.

Wait, but E_cmb is the energy of the CMB photon, which is given as 1e-3 eV. So E_cmb = ε = 1e-3 eV. So E γ is the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray, which we're trying to find.

So setting 4 E γ ε ≥ (2 m_e c^2)^2. Let's plug in the numbers.

Wait, 2 m_e c^2 is about 1.022 MeV, so squared is (1.022 MeV)^2.

So 4 E γ ε = (2 m_e c^2)^2 → E γ = ( (2 m_e c^2)^2 ) / (4 ε )

Simplify that: E γ = (m_e c^2)^2 / ε

Because 4 cancels with 2 squared (since 2^2 is 4). Let me compute that.

m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV, so m_e c^2 squared is (0.511)^2 (MeV)^2. Let me compute that: 0.511^2 ≈ 0.261, so 0.261 (MeV)^2.

Then, E
