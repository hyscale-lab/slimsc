Alright, so I have this question about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. I'm a bit rusty on immunology, but let me try to think through this step by step.

Okay, the setup: They tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then, using in vivo imaging, they saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid and some entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. They identified the fluorescent Peyer's patches and isolated proliferating cells. When they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes, there was high variability. The question is, what process is happening?

Hmm. So first, I remember that Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). They're specialized for sampling antigens from the intestinal lumen, right? So when the rotavirus is given orally, it's supposed to be taken up by these patches.

The GFP is on the inner capsid proteins. I think the capsid proteins are the outer shell, and the inner part probably has proteins that help in infecting cells. But in this case, they're tagged so we can track them.

When they delivered it via oral gavage, the rotavirus would first encounter the stomach. Stomach acid destroyed some of the fluorescence. So maybe some of the GFP-tagged proteins were digested there. But some made it through and got into the intestines, where they got stuck in the mucus. Mucus is sticky, so it probably traps some particles, maybe the virus particles here.

Eventually, some of them reach the Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches have specialized cells like M cells that take up antigens from the lumen and present them to immune cells. So the GFP would be presented to B cells, perhaps.

Now, they isolated the proliferating cell population. Proliferating cells in the immune system are likely activated B cells or T cells. Since they're looking at the variable heavy chain gene, which is a B cell receptor gene, they must be looking at B cells.

They observed high variability in the variable heavy chain sequences. High variability suggests that the B cells are diversifying their receptors. Somatic hypermutation comes to mind because that's the process where B cells introduce mutations into their variable regions during the immune response, leading to more diverse antibodies.

Somatic hypermutation occurs during the germinal center reactions. This is where B cells undergo proliferation, activation, and mutation, leading to affinity maturation. So if the B cells are proliferating and their variable regions are diverse, that's probably happening.

Looking at the options:

A) somatic hypermutation: This would cause the variable regions to change, leading to high variability. Fits with the observation.

B) complement activation: That's part of the immune response, but I don't think it directly affects the variability of the heavy chain. Maybe, but I don't think it's the main process here.

C) class switching recombination: That's when the class of antibody (like IgM to IgG) changes. It does happen in activated B cells, but it doesn't create new variable regions. So the variable heavy chain sequence wouldn't show high variability from class switching.

D) VDJ recombination: That's during the initial formation of B cell receptors in the bone marrow. But that's a one-time process in immature B cells. The question implies that this is happening after antigen exposure, so it's more likely to be a process during the immune response, like somatic hypermutation.

So the process taking place is probably somatic hypermutation. That's option A.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. The fluorescence from the GFP-tagged proteins was observed to be partially destroyed by stomach acid and entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches, as part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, are specialized for sampling antigens from the intestinal lumen and presenting them to immune cells. The GFP-tagged rotavirus proteins were likely taken up by M cells in the Peyer's patches and presented to B cells, leading to their activation and proliferation.

The high variability observed in the variable heavy chain gene sequences of the proliferating cell population suggests a process that diversifies B cell receptors. Somatic hypermutation is the immune process responsible for introducing mutations into the variable regions of B cell receptors during the germinal center reaction, leading to increased diversity and affinity maturation of antibodies. This aligns with the observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain sequences.

Other options were considered but do not fit the context:
- **Complement activation (B):** While important in immune responses, it does not directly cause variability in the variable heavy chain sequences.
- **Class switching recombination (C):** This changes the class of antibody (e.g., IgM to IgG) but does not alter the variable regions of the heavy chain.
- **VDJ recombination (D):** This occurs during the initial formation of B cell receptors in the bone marrow, not during antigen-driven immune responses.

The process taking place is somatic hypermutation, which explains the observed variability in the variable heavy chain sequences.

Answer: A
