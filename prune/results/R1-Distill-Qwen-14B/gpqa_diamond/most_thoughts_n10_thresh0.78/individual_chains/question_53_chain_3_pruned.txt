Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying a di-substituted aromatic compound based on its spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. That means it’s probably something like benzene with two substituents attached. The FTIR shows ester groups, so the molecule has an ester functional group somewhere. Esters typically have carbonyl groups, which show up around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹ in IR. So that's a key point.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there are six signals. Let me break that down. Two signals are aromatic H's. So the ring has two different environments for the H's. Since it's di-substituted, the substituents are probably in positions that cause the aromatic protons to split into two sets. For example, if the substituents are para to each other, the aromatic H's might actually be equivalent in two sets. Wait, no, para would make all four aromatic H's equivalent if the substituents are the same. Oh, but wait, the substituents could be different. Or maybe they're in positions that cause two sets of equivalent H's. Like ortho, meta, or para positions.

Then there are two signals for vinyl H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are usually on a double bond, so maybe there's an ester group attached with a vinyl group. Ester groups are R-O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, esters are RCOOR'. So if there's a vinyl group adjacent to the ester, maybe it's part of an aromatic substituent. Like maybe one substituent is an ester, and another is a vinyl group attached to something. Wait, but the NMR shows two signals for vinyl H, which suggests two different environments.

Wait, the two vinyl signals: one is a doublet and the other is a doublet of quartets. So perhaps they are next to each other, causing splitting. Alternatively, maybe they're in a trans configuration. For example, in a double bond, each proton is in a different environment. Or perhaps they're part of an aromatic ring with substituents. Hmm.

Also, there are two signals for -CH3 groups. No signals for -CH2, so no methylene groups. So any methyl groups are either attached directly to something or in a group without CH2 in between. Like perhaps as a substituent on the ester.

Putting this together, maybe the structure has two substituents on the benzene ring. One substituent is an ester group, perhaps something like O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, esters are RCOOR', so maybe the substituent is like COOR. Then the other substituent might be a vinyl group, like CH2CH2... Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-? Or maybe it's part of the substituent on the ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester and another group that has a vinyl group attached. Let me think: the ester group is one substituent, and the vinyl group is another. But wait, in the NMR, the vinyl Hs are two signals, which could be from two different groups.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a group with both the ester and a vinyl group. Like maybe an allyl ester. Or perhaps one substituent is an ester, and the other is a vinyl group attached to another carbon.

Alternatively, maybe the two substituents are an ester and a methoxy group, but that doesn't account for the vinyl Hs.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are an ester and another group with a vinyl group attached, like a vinyl ether or something. Or maybe the substituent itself is a vinyl ester. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the NMR signals again. For aromatic H, two signals mean that the substitu
