Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question is about determining the molecular formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The given data includes FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. Let's unpack the information.

First, the FTIR shows peaks indicating an ester group. Esters typically have a strong absorption around 1740 cm⁻¹ for the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So there's definitely an ester functional group in the compound.

Now looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. There are six signals:

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the aromatic protons could be in different environments. Maybe para substitution? Or maybe ortho? Wait, no, di-substituted can have different patterns. For example, para would have two sets of two protons each. So two signals, each integrating as a doublet perhaps, but I'm not sure yet.

2. Two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl groups usually show up as doublets or other splitting patterns due to coupling with adjacent protons. Since it's two signals, perhaps there are two different vinyl groups or substituents. Hmm, maybe one is part of a substituent, like an ester with a vinyl group.

3. Two signals for –CH3 groups. Each of these would be a triplet or a singlet, depending on neighboring groups. But the absence of –CH2 groups suggests that the methyl groups are either attached directly or in a position without adjacent CH2.

Let me try to visualize the structure. The aromatic ring is di-substituted. One substituent is an ester group. Esters usually have an ORCOOR structure, so maybe something like O-CO-O-R. Wait, no, the ester is R-O-CO-O-R'? No, wait, an ester is RCOOR', right. So maybe it's an aryl ester or an alkyl ester attached to the ring.

Wait, but the presence of vinyl groups suggests maybe a substituent that has a double bond. So perhaps the substituents on the aromatic ring are an ester group and another group that has a vinyl structure.

Wait, the aromatic ring has two substituents. One is an ester, and the other is a vinyl group, perhaps as part of a larger substituent. Or maybe the substituents are each more complex. Let me think.

So, the aromatic ring has two substituents. Let's say one is an ester group, like O-CO-O-R, but wait, the ester group would be –O–CO–OR, where R is an alkyl group. Or perhaps, the ester is attached directly as a substituent, like an aryl ester. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester linked to another group.

Wait, but also, the 1H NMR shows vinyl-H. Vinyl groups have protons on a double bond. So maybe one substituent is an ester, and the other is a vinyl group, like a substituent with a double bond. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group that includes a vinyl, such as a styryl group (like a benzene ring with a double bond attached), but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group, say –OOCR, and the other substituent is a group that has a vinyl, like a propenyl group or something. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an ester and a vinyl ether or something else. But perhaps a better approach is to think about the possible structures and their NMR signals.

Wait, the NMR has two signals for aromatic protons. Since the ring is di-substituted, the possible substitution patterns are ortho, meta, or para. For para substitution, the two substituents are opposite each other, so the aromatic protons would be in two sets of equivalent positions, leading to two signals. Each set would have two protons. So that would fit the two aromatic signals. So maybe para-substituted.

So the aromatic ring has two substituents in para positions. One is an ester group, and the other is a group that has a vinyl group.

Wait, but the substituents could also be more complex. Let me think: perhaps one substituent is an ester (like –OOCR), and the other substituent is another group with a vinyl, like a –CH2CH2– group with a double bond or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ring, making it a styrene-like structure. But wait, in that case, the substituent would have a double bond attached to the ring.

So the di-substituted benzene has two groups: an ester group and another group with a vinyl.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester (like an –OOCR group) and the other is a –CH2CH2O– group or something

Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying a di-substituted aromatic compound based on its spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. That means it’s probably something like benzene with two substituents attached. The FTIR shows ester groups, so the molecule has an ester functional group somewhere. Esters typically have carbonyl groups, which show up around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹ in IR. So that's a key point.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there are six signals. Let me break that down. Two signals are aromatic H's. So the ring has two different environments for the H's. Since it's di-substituted, the substituents are probably in positions that cause the aromatic protons to split into two sets. For example, if the substituents are para to each other, the aromatic H's might actually be equivalent in two sets. Wait, no, para would make all four aromatic H's equivalent if the substituents are the same. Oh, but wait, the substituents could be different. Or maybe they're in positions that cause two sets of equivalent H's. Like ortho, meta, or para positions.

Then there are two signals for vinyl H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are usually on a double bond, so maybe there's an ester group attached with a vinyl group. Ester groups are R-O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, esters are RCOOR'. So if there's a vinyl group adjacent to the ester, maybe it's part of an aromatic substituent. Like maybe one substituent is an ester, and another is a vinyl group attached to something. Wait, but the NMR shows two signals for vinyl H, which suggests two different environments.

Wait, the two vinyl signals: one is a doublet and the other is a doublet of quartets. So perhaps they are next to each other, causing splitting. Alternatively, maybe they're in a trans configuration. For example, in a double bond, each proton is in a different environment. Or perhaps they're part of an aromatic ring with substituents. Hmm.

Also, there are two signals for -CH3 groups. No signals for -CH2, so no methylene groups. So any methyl groups are either attached directly to something or in a group without CH2 in between. Like perhaps as a substituent on the ester.

Putting this together, maybe the structure has two substituents on the benzene ring. One substituent is an ester group, perhaps something like O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, esters are RCOOR', so maybe the substituent is like COOR. Then the other substituent might be a vinyl group, like CH2CH2... Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-? Or maybe it's part of the substituent on the ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester and another group that has a vinyl group attached. Let me think: the ester group is one substituent, and the vinyl group is another. But wait, in the NMR, the vinyl Hs are two signals, which could be from two different groups.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a group with both the ester and a vinyl group. Like maybe an allyl ester. Or perhaps one substituent is an ester, and the other is a vinyl group attached to another carbon.

Alternatively, maybe the two substituents are an ester and a methoxy group, but that doesn't account for the vinyl Hs.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are an ester and another group with a vinyl group attached, like a vinyl ether or something. Or maybe the substituent itself is a vinyl ester. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the NMR signals again. For aromatic H, two signals mean that the substitu
