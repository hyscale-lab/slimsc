Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question is about determining the molecular formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The given data includes FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. Let's unpack the information.

First, the FTIR shows peaks indicating an ester group. Esters typically have a strong absorption around 1740 cm⁻¹ for the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So there's definitely an ester functional group in the compound.

Now looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. There are six signals:

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the aromatic protons could be in different environments. Maybe para substitution? Or maybe ortho? Wait, no, di-substituted can have different patterns. For example, para would have two sets of two protons each. So two signals, each integrating as a doublet perhaps, but I'm not sure yet.

2. Two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl groups usually show up as doublets or other splitting patterns due to coupling with adjacent protons. Since it's two signals, perhaps there are two different vinyl groups or substituents. Hmm, maybe one is part of a substituent, like an ester with a vinyl group.

3. Two signals for –CH3 groups. Each of these would be a triplet or a singlet, depending on neighboring groups. But the absence of –CH2 groups suggests that the methyl groups are either attached directly or in a position without adjacent CH2.

Let me try to visualize the structure. The aromatic ring is di-substituted. One substituent is an ester group. Esters usually have an ORCOOR structure, so maybe something like O-CO-O-R. Wait, no, the ester is R-O-CO-O-R'? No, wait, an ester is RCOOR', right. So maybe it's an aryl ester or an alkyl ester attached to the ring.

Wait, but the presence of vinyl groups suggests maybe a substituent that has a double bond. So perhaps the substituents on the aromatic ring are an ester group and another group that has a vinyl structure.

Wait, the aromatic ring has two substituents. One is an ester, and the other is a vinyl group, perhaps as part of a larger substituent. Or maybe the substituents are each more complex. Let me think.

So, the aromatic ring has two substituents. Let's say one is an ester group, like O-CO-O-R, but wait, the ester group would be –O–CO–OR, where R is an alkyl group. Or perhaps, the ester is attached directly as a substituent, like an aryl ester. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester linked to another group.

Wait, but also, the 1H NMR shows vinyl-H. Vinyl groups have protons on a double bond. So maybe one substituent is an ester, and the other is a vinyl group, like a substituent with a double bond. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group that includes a vinyl, such as a styryl group (like a benzene ring with a double bond attached), but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group, say –OOCR, and the other substituent is a group that has a vinyl, like a propenyl group or something. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an ester and a vinyl ether or something else. But perhaps a better approach is to think about the possible structures and their NMR signals.

Wait, the NMR has two signals for aromatic protons. Since the ring is di-substituted, the possible substitution patterns are ortho, meta, or para. For para substitution, the two substituents are opposite each other, so the aromatic protons would be in two sets of equivalent positions, leading to two signals. Each set would have two protons. So that would fit the two aromatic signals. So maybe para-substituted.

So the aromatic ring has two substituents in para positions. One is an ester group, and the other is a group that has a vinyl group.

Wait, but the substituents could also be more complex. Let me think: perhaps one substituent is an ester (like –OOCR), and the other substituent is another group with a vinyl, like a –CH2CH2– group with a double bond or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ring, making it a styrene-like structure. But wait, in that case, the substituent would have a double bond attached to the ring.

So the di-substituted benzene has two groups: an ester group and another group with a vinyl.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester (like an –OOCR group) and the other is a –CH2CH2O– group or something
