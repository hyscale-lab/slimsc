Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Mott-Gurney equation. Hmm, I remember that equation from my solid-state devices class. Let me think through this carefully.

The question is about the validity conditions of the Mott-Gurney equation. The equation is given as J = (9/8) * ε * μ * (V² / L³). So, I need to recall under what conditions this equation holds true.

I think the Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current-voltage behavior in a semiconductor device. It's specifically for the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. Right, in that regime, the current is limited by the accumulation of charge in the space-charge region, which affects the electric field and thus the current.

So, the equation assumes certain conditions. I remember that it's derived for a trap-free device. Traps would complicate things by causing carrier recombination or delayed emission, right? So the device needs to be trap-free, which means option A, B, or C might be correct because they all say "trap-free" except D, which I'll check later.

Next, the equation is for a single-carrier device. Oh wait, what's that mean? Oh right, in some devices like diodes, both electrons and holes contribute to the current. But in a single-carrier device, only one type (like electrons only) contributes. So the equation applies to single-carrier, which means options A, B, or C are possible because option D talks about two-carrier.

The equation also assumes negligible diffusion current. Wait, in the derivation, I think the Mott-Gurney equation neglects diffusion and relies on drift current only. Because in the SCLC regime, the dominant factor is the space charge building up, and the current is due to the electric field causing drift. So diffusion current, which is about concentration gradients, is considered negligible. Therefore, any option that mentions negligible diffusion current is a candidate.

Looking at the options:

Option A: trap-free, single-carrier, Ohmic contact, negligible drift current. Wait, no, the equation is for negligible diffusion current, not drift. Because in SCLC, drift is the main factor. So if this option says negligible drift current, that might be incorrect. Because the equation uses drift, so drift isn't negligible. So maybe option A is wrong. Or wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, in the derivation, Mott-Gurney comes from when the space-charge region is so thick that the electric field is reduced, and the current is limited by the available space for the carriers to move. So in that case, the dominant current is drift, not diffusion. So the equation assumes negligible diffusion current. So any option that says "negligible diffusion current" is correct.

Looking again:

Option A: ...negligible drift current. No, because the equation assumes drift is the main thing, so if drift were negligible, the equation wouldn't apply. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: ...negligible diffusion current. So that's right. Also, the equation is for a device with no carrier injection barrier. Hmm, what's that mean? Oh, like the contact is ohmic. Because if there's a barrier, like in a Schottky contact, then you have a barrier height which affects the injection. But in the Mott-Gurney equation, I think it's assumed that the contacts are ohmic, meaning no barrier, so that the carriers can move without much hindrance at the contacts. So option B says "no carrier injection barrier" and "negligible diffusion current", and it's a trap-free single-carrier device. That sounds correct.

Option C: ...Schottky contact. Oh, no. Because Schottky contacts have a barrier, so that would imply a barrier, which the equation doesn't account for. The equation is for when the device has Ohmic contacts, not Schottky. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: two-carrier device. No, because Mott-Gurney is for single-carrier. So D is wrong.

So the correct option is B.

Wait, but let me make sure. Ohmic contact means that there's no potential barrier, so carriers can move easily. So the equation applies when the contacts are such that there's no barrier to injection
