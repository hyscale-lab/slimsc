Alright, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let's read through it carefully and break it down step by step. Okay, so the question is about a series of reactions, and then we need to find the molecular symmetry group of product E.

First, let's parse the reactions given:

1. Solid A reacts with gas B, 8 equivalents, to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

Hmm, I need to figure out what these substances are. Let's think about each reaction and the possible compounds involved.

Starting with the first reaction: A + 8 B → C. So A is a solid, B is a gas, and C is bright red. A common bright red solid I know is maybe something like iron(III) oxide? Or perhaps a transition metal compound. Wait, but 8 equivalents of B. Let me think about common gases. Maybe B is something like O2? Let's say B is oxygen gas. So 8 moles of O2 reacting with A forms C.

Wait, but 8 equivalents is a lot. Let me think of a reaction where a solid reacts with O2 in an 8:1 ratio. Iron (Fe) reacts with oxygen to form Fe3O4. The reaction is 3Fe + 2O2 → Fe3O4. Wait, that's 3 Fe to 2 O2. Doesn't match 8 equivalents. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sulfur reaction? Sulfur (S) reacts with O2 to form SO3, but the stoichiometry doesn't match either. Wait, other possibilities: maybe it's a reaction where a metal reacts with O2 to form an oxide with a high O content.

Another angle: the product C is bright red. That makes me think of compounds like Fe(OH)3, but that's a hydroxide. Alternatively, perhaps C is a transition metal oxide. Wait, maybe it's a sulfide? Bright red could be PbS, but that's a sulfide. Alternatively, maybe it's a permanganate? No, those are usually purple.

Wait, another approach. Let's
