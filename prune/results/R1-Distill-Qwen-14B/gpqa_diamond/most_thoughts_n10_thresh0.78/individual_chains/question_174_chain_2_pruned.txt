Okay, so I have this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest-mass. Oh wait, and the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. Interesting.

So initially, the nucleus is at rest, meaning its momentum is zero. After fission, since the system is isolated, the total momentum should still be zero. So the two fragments must move in opposite directions with momenta that cancel each other out. That makes sense.

Let me denote the masses. Let the less massive fragment be m, so the more massive one is 2m. The sum of their rest masses is m + 2m = 3m. And the problem states that 3m = 0.99 M. So M is the initial mass. So m would be (0.99 M)/3, which is 0.33 M each for m and 2m. Wait no, wait, m is the smaller mass. So m = (0.99 M)/3 = 0.33 M? No, because m is the smaller, and the other is 2m, so 3m=0.99M. So m = 0.33 M, and the other is 0.66 M. So the more massive fragment has a rest mass of 0.66 M, and the less has 0.33 M.

Wait, but M is the initial rest mass, but the rest-mass energy is given as 300 GeV. So the initial rest energy is Mc² = 300 GeV. So the rest energies of the fragments would be m1c² and m2c². So m1 is 0.66 M, so its rest energy is 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV. Similarly
