Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem states that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, you can't just use classical mechanics; you have to apply special relativity principles.

The question has two parts: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Let's tackle them one by one.

Starting with the relative speed. Wait, in relativity, velocities don't just add up like in classical mechanics. I think the formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving at relativistic speeds is different. Oh right, the formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Since both are moving in the same direction, v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c, so subtracting them gives 0.1c. But wait, I can't just take the difference because of the Lorentz factor. Let me plug into the formula.

v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c² )

Simplify numerator: 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c, which is about 0.14c, right? So looking at the options, both C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So the relative speed part narrows it down to C or D.

Now for the total energy. Each astronaut has their own relativistic energy. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but each astronaut's mass is different. So for the first astronaut (2m), their energy E1 is gamma1 * 2m c², and the second (3m) has E2 = gamma2 * 3m c². The total energy E_total = E1 + E2.

Let me calculate gamma for each.

First astronaut: v = 0.6c.

gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: v = 0.5c.

gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c² approximately. So about 5.96 mc².

Looking back at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc^2, and option D says 5 mc^2. So the total energy must be approximately 5.96 mc².

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Gamma1: 0.6c.

v²/c² = 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64)=0.8. So gamma1 is 1/0.8=1.25. Correct.

E1: 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c². Right.

Gamma2: 0.5c.

v²/c²=0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75) is about 0.8660, so gamma2 is 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. E2=1.1547 *3m c². Let me compute 1.1547 *3: 3 *1 is 3, 3 *0.1547 is ~0.464. So 3.464 m c². Sum with 2.5 gives 5.964, which is 5.96 mc² when rounded to two decimal places.

So the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C has v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc². Option D has E=5 mc², which doesn't match.

So the correct answer must be option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The formula for the relative velocity between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.142857c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\).

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 \quad \text{where} \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Conclusion
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:
