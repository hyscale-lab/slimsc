Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to break it down.

The question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Now, the question is asking what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, so we're dealing with relative velocities between two frames here. Oh right, this is a problem involving special relativity, probably time dilation or length contraction. Let me think.

In the problem, time passes 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. I need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during that time. But wait, since the two frames are moving relative to each other, I'll need to consider how time and distance transform between them.

Wait, the speed between the two frames is 60,000 km/s. Let me convert that to meters per second for calculations, but maybe I can work with kilometers too. Wait, 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. Let's see, the speed of light is about 3e5 km/s, so this is 0.2 times the speed of light, which is 20% of c. Hmm, not super high, but not negligible either. So relativistic effects might be noticeable but perhaps we can approximate?

Wait, but in special relativity, the time experienced in different frames is different. So someone in the Galaxy's frame would see the ejecta's clock as running slower because of time dilation. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the problem says that from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at v = 6e4 km/s. So the inverse, the ejecta is moving at v towards the Galaxy's frame. So from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v = 6e4 km/s towards the center.

Wait, but the question
