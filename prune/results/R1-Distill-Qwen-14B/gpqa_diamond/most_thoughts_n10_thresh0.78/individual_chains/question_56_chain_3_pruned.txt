Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and dipole transitions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is about the |3,0,0⟩ state decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I remember that in hydrogen, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by certain selection rules.

Wait, what are the selection rules again? Oh right, for electric dipole transitions (which are these), the selection rules are:

- Δn = ±1, ±2, ... (so n can change by any integer as long as it's allowed)
- Δl = ±1 (the orbital angular momentum changes by one unit)
- Δm = 0, ±1 (the magnetic quantum number changes by 0 or ±1)

So the initial state is n=3, l=0 (s orbital), m=0. It's decaying to n=1, l=0, m=0.

Since it's a two-step process, it must go through an intermediate state. Let's think about possible transitions.

First transition: from n=3, l=0 to some state with l=1 because Δl must be ±1. Because initial l is 0, next must be l=1. So the first intermediate state must have l=1.

What about n? For the first transition, the electron could drop by one or two energy levels. Let's see. The initial state is n=3. So possible Δn could be -1 or -2, maybe even more? But wait, the final state is n=1, so in two steps, perhaps the first step is n=3→2, and the second is n=2→1.

So the first transition would be from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1, m⟩, then from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

Wait, but for the second step, from n=2, l=1, m can change by 0 or ±1. So the m in the intermediate must be such that when it changes, it can reach m=0 in the final state.

Let me consider the possible m values.

In the first step, from |3,0,0⟩, when l=0, the possible m is 0. So for the first transition, m can change by 0, +1, or -1. But since initial m is 0, the possible m after transition can be 0, +1, or -1. So the intermediate state could have m=0, +1, or -1.

Wait, but when the electron transitions from the intermediate state to the final state, it must again change m by 0, ±1.

So let's consider the possible paths. Let's say the first transition is to |2,1, m⟩, and then from there to |1,0,0⟩.

For the second transition, the m must change by ±1 or 0. So m_initial (of intermediate state) minus Δm equals 0.

So m_initial could be 0, because 0 - 0 =0. Or if m_initial is 1, then Δm must be -1 (to reach 0). If m_initial is -1, then Δm must be +1. So all three possibilities are allowed.

Wait, but in the second transition, the l must change by ±1. The intermediate state has l=1, so the next state must have l=0 (since 1-1=0). So that's correct.

Now, what about the probabilities? The options give certain probabilities, so I need to find which transition path has the correct probability.

Wait, but how does the probability come into play here? I think the selection rules for dipole transitions are based on the matrix elements, which depend on the integrals of the wavefunctions. The selection rules are necessary but not sufficient for the transition to have non-zero probability.

But perhaps the main point here is the possible intermediate states and whether
