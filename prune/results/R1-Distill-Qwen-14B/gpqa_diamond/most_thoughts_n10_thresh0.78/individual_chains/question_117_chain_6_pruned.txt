Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism happens when a compound can rotate plane-polarized light because it has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. So the question is asking which of the given compounds exhibit this.

Let me look at each option one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl structures can sometimes have stereoisomerism if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates chirality. The 6,6' positions have nitro groups and 2,2' have carboxylate groups. Wait, in biphenyls, if the substituents are in positions that make each ring have four different groups, then they could be chiral. Let me visualize: each carbon attached to a phenyl ring has a nitro, two methyl (since it's dimethyl), and a carboxylate. Wait, no, the structure is a bit different. The central biphenyl has substituents on both rings. So each of the two central carbons (the ones attached to the other phenyl) would have different groups. Maybe each has a nitro, a carboxylate, and two different methyl groups? Or perhaps each has two methyl esters, a nitro, and a carboxylate. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged symmetrically. If the substituents are in positions that make the molecule symmetric, then it might not have a chiral center. Wait, if the substituents are on both phenyl rings in a way that creates an asymmetric carbon, then it could be chiral. So maybe this compound has a chiral center, which would allow for optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is like a CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, the carbon attached to the OH and the two CH3 groups (from the propanoate) and the COOCH3 group. Let me see: the central carbon (C2) has groups: OH, COOCH3, CH3, and another CH3? Wait, no, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but wait, the formula is CH2CH2COO-? No, the structure is CH2CH2COO- but when it's 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure would be HOCH2COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. Propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure is HO
