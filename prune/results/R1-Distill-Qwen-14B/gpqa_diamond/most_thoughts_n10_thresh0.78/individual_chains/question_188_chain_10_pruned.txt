Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. I think it's calculated using some formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices.

Wait, rhombohedral crystals are a type of hexagonal crystal system, right? Or maybe they're a type of cubic? No, wait, rhombohedral is a subclass of cubic, where all edges are equal and the angles are equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. Oh right, yeah, so in a rhombohedral structure, a = b = c, and all angles α, β, γ are equal. So in this case, all are 30 degrees.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between atoms, which in a crystal structure is the edge length, a. So I think the lattice parameter a is 10 Angstroms here.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The formula I remember for interplanar distance, d_hkl, is given by d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) * (cos α) ) or something like that. Oh wait, no, I think that's when the angles aren't 90 degrees. Because in a cubic system, the formula is simpler, but here since the angles are not 90, it's a bit more complicated.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles α, β, γ is a bit more involved. The formula is d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2/(a^2) ) + (k^2/(b^2) ) + (l^2/(c^2)) - (2 hk cos γ)/(a b) - (2 hl cos β)/(a c) - (2 kl cos α)/(b c) ) ) )^(-1/2) ? Wait, no, that's not right. I think I'm mixing up the formula.

Alternatively, in a rhombohedral system where a = b = c = a0, and all angles are equal to α, the interplanar
