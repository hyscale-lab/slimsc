Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when you break and reform carbon-carbon double bonds, right? It's like swapping the ends. Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, usually involving Ruthenium, and it's good for ring-closing metathesis and other olefin metathesis reactions.

So the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw the structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond starts at C1. So, the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)2? Wait, wait, no. 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3) but wait, pent has five carbons. So wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2 but with a methyl group on C3. Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)CH2? No, wait. Maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, the correct structure for 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pentane has five carbons. 1-ene is the double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-? Wait, no. Wait, for pent-1-ene, it's CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So adding a methyl group on C3 (the third carbon), which is the middle of the chain. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, maybe I should number the carbons. Let me write it out:

Carbon 1: double bond starts here. So C1 has CH2=, then C2 is CH-, then C3 is CH- with a methyl group, so CH(CH3). Then C4 and C5. Wait, no, wait. Wait
