Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. Then, it's reacted through a series of reagents, and I need to find the final product from the options given.

First, I'll try to figure out the structure of the starting compound using the NMR data. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. 

Degree of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, X=0 (no halogens). So, (2*8+2 -9 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be a ring and some double bonds or triple bonds, but since the NMR shows aromatic regions, I'm thinking maybe a benzene ring involved.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

9.72 ppm: a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a strong peak, possibly an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, it's a triplet. Aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and appear as singlets or maybe triplets if coupled with something. Maybe it's an enal (alpha, beta unsaturated aldehyde). In that case, the aldehyde proton would be next to a double bond, so it's split into a triplet because it's coupling with two protons (like from a CH2 group adjacent to the double bond). Hmm.

Next, 6.98 ppm: doublet, 2H. That's probably aromatic protons. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. So perhaps a para-substituted benzene ring where each proton is coupled with one adjacent. Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene, the protons are usually as a doublet if it's a di-substituted ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a meta or ortho substitution. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted ring like para-substituted with two substituents.

Similarly, 6.51 ppm: doublet, 2H. Another set of aromatic protons. Maybe it's a di-substituted benzene ring in a certain pattern. Wait, but the first set was at 6.98, which is a lower ppm region, maybe more deshielded. Or perhaps it's a different substituent. Alternatively, maybe these are part of a vinyl group adjacent to an oxygen or something.

Wait, but wait, looking at the other peaks. 6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. That could be an enol proton or maybe some other group. Enol protons are usually around 6-7 ppm but can be broad. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents that cause the protons to split into a broad signal, but that's a bit unclear. 

The other peak is at 3.66 ppm, a doublet for 2H. That's probably a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. So maybe an OCH2 group or something similar.

Putting this together, let's think about possible structures. The compound has an aldehyde group (from the 9.72 ppm peak). Then, perhaps it's attached to a benzene ring. Alternatively, the molecule might have a benzene ring with substituents and a side chain that includes an aldehyde.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count the possible structure. Suppose it's phenyl group(s) attached to a side chain. Let me think: a benz
