Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

So the question is about a reaction where a specific compound is treated with hydrogen bromide (HBr). The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me break that down. The structure is a benzene ring with an ether group attached. The ether's oxygen is connected to a butenyl group. The butenyl is substituted at position 3 (since it's but-3-en-1-yl) and has two methyl groups on the second carbon.

Wait, but wait, butenyl can be a bit confusing. Let me draw this. The main chain is four carbons. The double bond starts at the third carbon, so it's CH2-CH(C2)CH2-CH2? No, wait, no, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, no, wait, the numbering. But-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C2 and C3 because butenyl has four carbons. Let me think again. For but-3-en-1-yl, the structure is CH2CH2CH=CH2? No, that can't be right. Wait, but the way the substituents are placed is important.

Wait, the substituents are on the second carbon. So the structure of the butenyl group is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, the but-3-en-1-yl group would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-benzene. Wait, no, but with substituents on the second carbon. So the butenyl is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond. Oh wait, the structure is CH2=CH(C(CH3)2)CH2-O-Ph? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here, perhaps I should
