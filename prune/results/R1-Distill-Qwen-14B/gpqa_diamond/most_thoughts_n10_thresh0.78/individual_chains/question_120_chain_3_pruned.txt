Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So, that probably means that the number density of stars is the same everywhere. I remember that the number of stars you can see depends on how far away they are. Oh right, because the farther away a star is, the fainter it appears.

Parallax, plx, is the angle subtended by the star's position as seen from two points on Earth's orbit. Oh wait, parallax is inversely related to distance: plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So, a star with a larger parallax is closer.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So, I guess we're looking for the number of stars you'd expect to find in a range of plx values, like between plx and plx + dplx.

Since the distribution is uniform, the number density (n) is constant. So, n = number per unit volume. But we need to relate this to parallax.

Wait, I think I remember something about the volume of a sphere. If we're considering all stars within a certain distance, the volume is (4/3)πd^3. But how does that relate to parallax?

Since plx is 1/d, then d is 1/plx. Substituting that into the volume formula, the volume becomes proportional to (1/plx)^3. So, volume is inversely proportional to plx cubed.

Now, the number of stars in a volume would be n multiplied by that volume. So, in a shell of thickness dr (or in this case, a thin slice of parallax dplx), the number of stars would depend on the volume element.

Wait, but perhaps I should think in terms of differential elements. Since the number density is uniform, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr would be n * 4π d^2 dr. Because it's the surface area (4πd²) times the thickness dr, multiplied by the number density.

But we need to express this in terms of parallax. Since d = 1/plx, then dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, because plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx, so dr/ddplx = derivative of 1/plx with respect to plx. Wait, let me compute that.

d = 1/plx → plx = 1/d → so d = 1/plx. So, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But when considering the number of stars, we can take the absolute value.

So substituting d = 1/plx into the number of stars in the shell:

Number = n * 4π (d)^2 dr = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx² dplx) → wait, because dr is (
