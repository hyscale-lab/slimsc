Alright, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, okay, let me think. 

So the question says that there are two stars, both with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. 

The RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull. The shift detected for planet #1 is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. We need to find how much longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I remember that the RV method's measured shift is related to the velocity of the star in its orbit around the barycenter. The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by something like K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * ... wait, maybe I should think about the relation between the Doppler shift and the planet's orbital period.

Alternatively, I think the key here is the relationship between the velocity semi-amplitude (K) and the orbital period (P). The RV method detects the star's velocity, which is maximum at K. The formula for K is K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) ) ] * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_*) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P * sqrt(1 - e²))) )

But since the planets are Neptune-like and the stars are solar-like, M_p << M_*, so I can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. Also, since the planets are in circular orbits, e ≈ 0. So the equation simplifies.

Wait, but the problem states that both planets have similar masses to Neptune, but the stars are similar to the Sun. Maybe M_p is the same for both, but the Doppler shifts are different. Hmm.

Wait no, the problem says each planet has masses similar to Neptune, but perhaps the actual masses could be different? Or maybe the same. Wait, the question says "both with masses similar to that of Neptune"—so their masses are similar but not necessarily the same. But it's possible that the actual masses are different enough to cause the differing Doppler shifts. But maybe I should think in terms of how the RV signal depends on the planet's mass and orbital period.

I recall that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to
