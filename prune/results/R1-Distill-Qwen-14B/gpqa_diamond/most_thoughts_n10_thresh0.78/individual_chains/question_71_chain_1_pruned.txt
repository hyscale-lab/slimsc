Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see... The question is about five exoplanets discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variation. They’re in orbital resonance with periods in a specific ratio. The planets are numbered 1 to 5, and their periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. They have the same albedo, so that won't affect the calculation. I need to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet 4 and Planet 2.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), where a is the planet's orbital radius. Oh wait, actually, I think the formula is T = T_eff * ( ( L / (16 π σ a² ) )^(1/4) ), but maybe I should think in terms of the inverse square law for flux. The flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance. And temperature is related to the fourth root of the flux because of the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

So, the equilibrium temperature scales with (1/sqrt(a)), because flux is proportional to 1/a², and temperature is proportional to (flux)^(1/4), so that would be (1/a²)^(1/4) = 1/a^(1/2). So T ∝ 1/sqrt(a).

But wait, since the planets are in orbital resonance, their periods are in ratios. So their semi-major axes (since the orbits are circular) will also be in the same ratios as their periods, because orbital period is related to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law. Wait, Kepler's third law says P² is proportional to a³, assuming same star. So, for each planet, a is proportional to P^(2/3). Because P² = (4π²/GM) a³ → a = (G M / (4 π²))^(1/3) * P^(2/3). So, a ∝ P^(2/3).

So, the ratio of the semi-major axes is (P_i / P_j)^(2/3). Wait, but I'm trying to find the ratio of distances a4 and a2. So a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3).

Given the period ratios: the periods are in 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for planets 1-5. So, Planet 2's period is 2 units, and Planet 4's is 3.5 units. So P4/P2 = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75.

So a4/a2 = (1.75)^(2/3). Let me calculate that. 1.75 is 7/4, so (7/4)^(2/3). Hmm, let's compute this. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to find the ratio of inverses since we need 1/sqrt(a) for temperature.

Wait, equilibrium temperature T is proportional to (1/sqrt(a)). So T4/T2 = ( sqrt(a2) ) / ( sqrt(a4) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a4 ) = sqrt( (a2)/(a4) )

Since a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3), then a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3) = (2/3.5)^(2/3) = (4/7)^(2/3). Oh wait, 2/3.5 is 4/7? No, 2 divided by 3.5 is 4/7? Wait 3.5 is 7/2, so 2/(7/2) is 4/7, yes.

So a2/a4 is (4/7)^(2/3). So T4/T2 = sqrt( (4/7)^(2/3) ). Let's compute that.

Wait, sqrt(x) is x^(1/2), so sqrt( (4/7)^(2/3) ) = (4/7)^(1/3). Because (x)^(a)^(b) = x^(a*b). So (4/7)^( (2/3)*(1/2) ) = (4/7)^(1/3). So the ratio T4/T2 is (4/7)^(1/3).

Let me compute 4/7. 4 divided by 7 is approximately 0.5714. The cube root of 0.5714. Hmm, I remember that 0.7 cubed is
