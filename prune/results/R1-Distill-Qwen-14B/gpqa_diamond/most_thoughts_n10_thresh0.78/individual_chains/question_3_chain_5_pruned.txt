Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about expectation values. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.

The problem says a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, right? So σz is the Pauli z-matrix, I think. And the operator given is 10σz + 5σx. I need to find the expectation value of this operator.

Wait, expectation value... Oh right, the expectation value of an operator is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator and ψ is the state vector. So I need to compute this for O = 10σz +5σx.

Breaking it down, the expectation value will be the sum of the expectation values of each term. So that would be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That makes it easier, because I can compute each part separately.

First, let's find ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively.

The state ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me write this as ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a = 0.5 and b = sqrt(3)/2.

The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is |a|²*(+1) + |b|²*(-1). Let me compute |a|² and |b|².

a is 0.5, so |a|² is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. b is sqrt(3)/2, so |b|^2 is (3/4) because (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4. 

So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(1) + (3/4)*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. 

Wait, that's -0.5. So 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, moving on to ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x-matrix. Its eigenstates are not |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, right? So I can't directly compute it like σz. I remember that the expectation value of σx for a given state can be found using the components of the state.

The operator σx in matrix form is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when I compute ⟨ψ|σx| ψ⟩, I can write it out explicitly.

But maybe there's a smarter way. I remember that for a spin-1/2 system, the expectation value of σx is 2 times the real part of the coefficient of |↓⟩ multiplied by the coefficient of |↑⟩. Wait, let's think about it.

Wait, another approach: the expectation value can be found by:
⟨σx⟩ = (a* b + a b*) where a and b are the coefficients of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively.

Wait, no, wait. Let me write it out. So σx is represented as:
σx = |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨
