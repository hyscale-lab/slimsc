Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, a spin-half particle in a linear superposition. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh right, |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z matrix. The question is about finding the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the correct one.

Wait, expectation value. Right, the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on the same state. So for a given state ψ, the expectation of an operator O is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩.

So the operator here is 10σz plus 5σx. So the expectation value would be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. Because expectation is linear, right? So I can compute each part separately.

First, let's find the expectation of σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward.

The given state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me write it as:

ψ = (0.5)|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩

Wait, I should check if this is normalized. The sum of the squares of the coefficients should be 1.

0.5^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + (3/4) = 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.

The eigenvalues for σz on |↑⟩ is +1, and on |↓⟩ is -1. So σz |↑⟩=|↑⟩, σz |↓⟩= -|↓⟩.

So ⟨σz⟩ is the expectation value of σz for ψ. So:

⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩ = (0.5)*⟨↑| + (sqrt(3)/2)*⟨↓|) σz (0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩ )

Since σz acts on the states as eigenvalues, this becomes:

0.5*(0.5)*1 + 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2)*(-1) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5*(-1) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(sqrt(3)/2)*1

Wait, maybe a better way is to compute it as the sum of |c_i|^2 times the eigenvalue.
