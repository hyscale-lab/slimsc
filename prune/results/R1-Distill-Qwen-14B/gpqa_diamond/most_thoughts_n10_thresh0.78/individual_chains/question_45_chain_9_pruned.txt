Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the particles are confined and their energies are quantized. Each particle is a spin-1/2, which probably means electrons or something similar. But wait, the spin part—how does that affect the energy levels here?

The question is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options given are combinations of multiples of E, where E is given as π²ħ²/(2mL²). Right, that's the formula for the energy levels in a 1D infinite potential well for a single particle. The energy levels are quantized and given by E_n = n²E, where n is the principal quantum number.

Wait, but since these are four identical particles, they are fermions, right? Because electrons are fermions with spin-1/2. Oh wait, wait, in a one-dimensional box, I remember that the Pauli exclusion principle applies differently. In 3D, each particle has a unique set of quantum numbers, but in 1D, the quantum number n is the only one, so each particle must have a different n. Wait, no, spin-1/2 particles have two possible spin states. So in a 1D box, each spatial state can hold two particles with opposite spins.

Wait, so for four particles, how does that fill up the energy levels? Let me think. The ground state would have the lowest possible energy for each particle, considering the Pauli principle. So each spatial state can hold two particles. So the first energy level (n=1) can hold two particles, the second (n=2) can hold two, and so on.

So for four particles, the first two levels would be filled. Let's see:

n=1: 2 particles, energy E_1 = 1²E = E
n=2: 2 particles, energy E_2 = 4E
So the total energy for the ground state is E_1 + E_2 = 5E? Wait, but wait, each particle in n=1 contributes E, so two particles would be 2E, and two in n=2 would be 2*(4E) = 8E. So total ground state energy is 2E + 8E = 10
