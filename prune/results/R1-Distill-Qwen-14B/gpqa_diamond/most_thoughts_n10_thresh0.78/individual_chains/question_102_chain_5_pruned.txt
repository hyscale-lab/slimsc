Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question here about gene expression constructs and why a particular fluorescent signal isn't showing up. Let me try to walk through this step by step.

Alright, the setup: We're dealing with a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells, and we're trying to understand their developmental roles. The construct is a bicistronic vector, which means it has two ORFs (open reading frames) under a single promoter. The vector uses loxP sites for recombination, which probably means it's using something like the Cre-Lox system for conditional expression.

So, the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor's ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. I remember that in bicistronic vectors, the two ORFs are usually arranged in a way that allows them to be translated separately. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. The receptor has an IRES element upstream, which is a RNA internal ribosome entry site. IRES allows for the translation of the second ORF without the need for a second promoter, but it's usually dependent on the first gene's expression.

Looking at the stop cassettes: between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP, there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. I think these are stop signals (like a stop codon) flanked by loxP or other recombination sites. So, without Cre recombinase, the stop cassette would block expression of the downstream gene.

Wait, so the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is after an IRES. So when the mRNA is made, the ribosome translates the ligand ORF, and then using the IRES, it can translate the receptor ORF. But wait, the IRES is between the ligand and the receptor? Or is it the other way around? Hmm, the question says the receptor is under the IRES. Wait, no, the ligand is at 5', under CBA, then the IRES is upstream of the receptor. So the structure is probably like CBA promoter -> ligand ORF with a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP), then IRES, then receptor ORF, then stop cassette (lox2272) and then eGFP.

Wait, no, the ligand is fused to mCherry, so maybe the ligand ORF is followed by mCherry, but with a stop cassette. Similarly, the receptor is followed by eGFP, with another stop cassette.

Wait, the vector is bicistronic, so it's probably arranged with one promoter driving both ORFs. The ligand is first, then the receptor. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, but the receptor is probably under a different promoter? Or is it an IRES-driven system?

Wait, the way it's described, the ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. So perhaps the ligand's mRNA is translated, and then mCherry is also co-expressed? Or maybe the ligand and mCherry are in the same ORF, meaning that they are co-expressed as a fusion protein? But that might not make sense because mCherry is a fluorescent marker, so probably it's used for tracking the ligand expression.

Wait, the vector is bicistronic, so each ORF is expressed separately. So the first ORF is ligand with mCherry, and the second ORF is receptor with eGFP. But the stop cassettes are in between, so without Cre, the stop cassettes block expression. So when Cre is introduced, it recombines the loxP sites, removing the stop cassettes, allowing translation of the
