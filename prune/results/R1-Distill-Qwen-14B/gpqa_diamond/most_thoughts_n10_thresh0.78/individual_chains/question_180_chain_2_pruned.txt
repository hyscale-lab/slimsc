Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again.

The problem says: There's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. 12 of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals, and the options are given as A to D.

Hmm, right. So, I remember that when dealing with electric charges, the potential energy between them is involved. Since the system is isolated, I think the energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.

Wait, but since the 13th charge is fixed at point P, the other 12 are at a distance of 2 meters from P. So each of those 12 charges is at 2 meters from the 13th charge.

So, the potential energy would be the energy between the 13th charge (fixed) and each of the 12 charges, plus the potential energy between those 12 charges themselves. But wait, are those 12 charges allowed to move relative to each other? No, the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 meters from P, so perhaps they're all at the same distance from P but can be anywhere on the 2m sphere around P. But for the minimum energy, maybe they arrange themselves in a way that the potential energy among themselves is minimized.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about the system's minimum energy, so perhaps the potential energy between the 12 charges is not considered, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the 12 charges are identical and placed symmetrically at 2m from P, so their mutual potential energy is fixed, perhaps. Or maybe it's part of the system's energy, so I have to calculate it.

Wait, but then, the problem says "the minimum energy of this system." So perhaps the 12 charges are free to move, but their arrangement affects the total potential energy. To minimize the total energy, they would arrange themselves in a way that
