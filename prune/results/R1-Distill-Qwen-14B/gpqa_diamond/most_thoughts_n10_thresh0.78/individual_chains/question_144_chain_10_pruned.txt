Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to work through this step by step.

The question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. They're asking for the mean decay distance, and the options are given in meters, ranging from 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters. 

Wait, mean decay distance... that's the average distance the particle travels before decaying, right? I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle can be found from its width. The decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ by τ = ħ / Γ. Because Γ is the total decay width, and it's connected to the uncertainty principle.

But wait, how do I get from lifetime to the decay distance? Oh right, the mean decay length is the product of the velocity of the particle and its mean lifetime. So L = v * τ. 

So first, I need to find τ. Then find v, and multiply them together.

Let me jot down the steps:
1. Calculate the mean lifetime τ = ħ / Γ.
2. Find the velocity v of the meson.
3. Compute L = v * τ.

Wait, but to find v, I need to know the momentum of the meson. Since we have the energy E and mass m, I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation, E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. Solving for p gives p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4) / c. 

Wait, but in units where c=1, maybe it's easier. Let me think about the units here. The meson
