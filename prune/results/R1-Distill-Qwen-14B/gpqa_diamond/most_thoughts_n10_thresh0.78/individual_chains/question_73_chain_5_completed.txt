Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, we can't just use classical mechanics. I think we have to use special relativity here. So the question is asking about the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Alright, let's break it down. The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively. Both are moving in the same direction, the positive x-axis.

First, I need to find their relative speed. Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as in classical mechanics because velocities don't just add up linearly. Oh right, you use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)), where u and v are the velocities of the two objects as observed from a common frame.

So the astronaut with mass 2m is moving at 0.6c, and the other at 0.5c. Since both are in the same direction, I think the relative speed would be the difference in their speeds divided by that denominator factor. Let me plug the numbers in.

Wait, but wait a second. Do I take u as the faster one and v as the slower? Because the relative speed would be how much faster one is compared to the other. So u is 0.6c and v is 0.5c. So plugging into the formula: (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/(c²)). Let's compute that.

The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator: (0.6*0.5)c²/(c²) is 0.3, so 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the denominator is 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c. So about 0.14c. So looking at the options, both C and D have v_rel=0.14c.

Next, I need to find the total energy of the system. The total energy in relativity is the sum of the energies of each astronaut. Each's energy is gamma multiplied by their rest mass energy. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So first, for the first astronaut with mass 2m and speed 0.6c. Let's compute gamma for him. v² = (0.6c)^2 = 0.36c². So 1 - v²/c² is 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So his energy is gamma * mc² * 2m? Wait, no. Wait, the rest energy is mc². But his mass is 2m, so rest energy is 2m c². So his total energy would be gamma * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, wait, no. No, I think I messed that up. Let me double-check. The rest energy is E = mc². So if the astronaut's rest mass is 2m, then E_rest = (2m)c². So the total energy is gamma * E_rest. So for the first astronaut, it's 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c²? Wait, no, no. Wait, 1.25 times 2m c² would be 2.5 m c²? Because 2m * 1.25 is 2.5 m. Oh right, because 2m * 5/4 is 2.5 m.

Wait, no, 2m * 5/4 is (2 *5)/(4) m = 10/4 m = 2.5 m. So yes, that's right. So first astronaut's energy is 2.5 m c².

Now the second astronaut has mass 3m and speed 0.5c. Let's compute gamma. v² is (0.5c)^2 = 0.25c². So 1 - 0.25 is 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is sqrt(3/4) = (√3)/2 ≈ 0.866. So gamma is 1 / 0.866 ≈ 1.1547.

So the total energy for this astronaut is gamma * 3m c². 1.1547 *3m c² is approximately 3.464 m c².

So total energy of the system is 2.5 m c² + 3.464 m c² ≈ 5.964 m c². Hmm, looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², which matches this. Option B says 4.96, which is lower, and D says 5 mc². So 5.96 is close to option C's value.

Wait, but wait, let me compute the gamma for the second astronaut more accurately. 0.5c is v. So gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) because (0.5)^2 is 0.25. So sqrt(0.75) is sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660254. Thus 1 / 0.8660254 ≈ 1.1547005. So 3m * 1.1547005 c² = 3 * 1.1547005 = 3.4641015 m c².

So 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c², which is option C.

So putting it all together, relative speed is approximately 0.14c and total energy is about 5.96 mc². So the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using principles of special relativity.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \).

#### For the first astronaut (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

The total energy is:
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx \frac{1}{0.866} \approx 1.1547
\]

The total energy is:
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy of the System:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), \( E = 5.96mc^2 \)**.
