Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution and the radiation it emits. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says the charge distribution is spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. So it's symmetric around the z-axis, I guess. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a certain wavelength λ. They're asking about the radiated power per unit solid angle, which is a function f of λ and the angle θ from the z-axis.

The maximum power is A, and they want the fraction of A radiated at θ = 30 degrees, and also what form f takes. The options are A, B, C, D.

Alright, first, I remember that when a charge oscillates, it emits electromagnetic radiation. The power radiated depends on the angle θ, and the wavelength λ. But wait, how does the power vary with θ?

Wait, I think I've heard about the radiation pattern of a dipole antenna. Oh right, for an oscillating dipole, the radiation is strongest perpendicular to the axis (so θ=90 degrees), and it decreases as you move towards the poles (θ=0 or 180). The radiation pattern is like a donut shape, or toroidal.

The formula for the power per unit solid angle (the radiation intensity) for a dipole is given by something like U = ( (μ₀ μ² ω⁴ sin²θ) )/(12π c³) ), but I might be mixing up the exact expression. Alternatively, I remember that the radiation intensity is proportional to sin²θ. So, for each θ, the intensity varies as sin²θ.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the maximum intensity is when sinθ is maximum, which is at θ=90 degrees. So the maximum power per solid angle (A) would be when θ is 90, so sinθ is 1. Then, for any other angle, the fraction is [sin²θ] over [maximum], which is sin²θ.

So the fraction at θ=30 degrees would be sin²(30) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25, which is 1/4. So the fraction is 1/4. Looking at the options, options B, C, and D have 1/4 or 3/4. Wait, option B is 1/4 and option C is 1/4 as the first part. So that would narrow it down.

But wait, wait. Wait, is the maximum the total radiated power? Or is the maximum per unit solid angle? Because the question says, "the maximum power thus radiated is A." Hmm, so perhaps A is the total power, not the maximum per unit solid angle. So then, when the question is asking about the fraction of A that is radiated at θ=30 degrees, that is, the power per unit solid angle at that angle multiplied by the solid angle. Because the total power is the integral of the radiation intensity over all solid angles.

Wait, let's clarify. The problem states that the radiated power per unit solid angle is f(λ,θ). The maximum power is A. So A is the maximum value of f(λ,θ) multiplied by the solid angle? No, wait, no, because the power per unit solid angle is f. So the maximum f would be at a certain angle, say θ_max. So the maximum f is A, or is A the total power? Hmm, the question says, "the maximum power thus radiated is A". So perhaps A is the total power, the integral of f over all solid angles. Or is A the maximum value of f?

Wait, the problem says: "the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle θ = 30^0". So A is the total power radiated, and the question is asking what fraction of A is emitted in the direction θ=30 degrees. Because the power per unit solid angle is f(λ,θ), the total power at θ=30 would be f(λ,30) multiplied by the solid angle element dΩ at that angle. Wait, but that's not correct because f is a function that varies with θ, so the total power in a particular direction is the integral over all possible angles, but that's not quite right either.

Wait, no. Wait, the radiated power per unit solid angle is f(λ,θ). So the total power is the integral of f over all solid angles. So A is equal to the integral of f(λ,θ) over all solid angles. The fraction of A at θ=30 degrees is the value f(λ,30) multiplied by the solid angle element at that θ, but wait, no. Because the solid angle element is dΩ = sinθ dθ dφ. So the total power emitted in the direction around θ=30 would require integrating over all φ (0 to 2π) and considering the contribution at each θ. But perhaps, for a specific θ=30, the question is asking what is the value of f(λ,30) compared to the maximum value of f.

Wait, let me read the question again. It says, "the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle θ=30 degrees".

Hmm, perhaps A is the maximum value of f. No, because the maximum power radiated is A, which would be the maximum value of f multiplied by the solid angle element. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is saying that the maximum possible power per unit solid angle is A. So, for example, the maximum f is A, and then the fraction is f(30)/A.

If that's the case, and if f is proportional to sin²θ, then f(30) = sin²(30) * A. So the fraction is (sin²(30)/sin²θ_max) * (something?), but wait, what is the maximum θ for f?

Wait, for a dipole radiation, the maximum intensity is at θ=90 degrees, so the maximum of f is at θ=90. So if f is proportional to sin²θ, then f_max = sin²(90) = 1. So the fraction of the maximum power would be f(30)/f_max = (sin²30)/(sin²90) = (0.25)/1 = 0.25.

But the question is phrased as the maximum power being A. Wait, maybe A is the maximum value of f, so the fraction would be 1/4.

So the fraction is 1/4, and the form of f is either λ^-3 or λ^-4.

Wait, the second part of the question is about possible form of f. So what is the dependence on λ?

Hmm, I remember that the radiation from an accelerating charge (like in an antenna) depends on the frequency. The power radiated is proportional to the square of the frequency, or some power of it. Wait, let me think about the dipole radiation formula.

The power radiated by an oscillating dipole is given by P = ( (μ₀ μ² ω⁴ sin²θ ) )/(12π c³) ), where μ is the dipole moment, and ω is the angular frequency.

So P is proportional to ω^4 and sin²θ. Since the wavelength λ is related to ω by λ = 2π c / ω, so ω = 2π c / λ. Therefore, ω^4 = (2π c)^4 / λ^4.

So substituting back, P is proportional to (1/λ^4) times sin²θ. So f(λ,θ) is proportional to 1/λ^4.

Wait, but wait, the problem asks for the form of f. So f is proportional to 1/λ^4, and also depends on sin²θ.

So the function f would be proportional to (1/λ^4) * sin²θ.

So in the options, the form part should be λ^(-4). Looking at the options:

A) λ^(-4)

B) λ^(-3)

C) λ^(-4)

D) λ^(-6)

So the forms in options A and C are λ^(-4). So the fraction is 1/4, and the form is λ^(-4).

Looking at the options, option C has fraction 1/4 and form λ^(-4). So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check. The problem says, "the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle θ=30 degrees".

If A is the maximum power, which is when sinθ is maximum, then the fraction of A would be [f(30)/f_max] × [solid angle at 30? Or f(30) is the power per unit solid angle at 30, and A is the maximum of that (which is at 90 degrees). So the fraction would be f(30)/f_max = 0.25, which is 1/4. So the fraction is 1/4, and the form is λ^-4. So option C is 1/4 and λ^-4. So that's correct.


The problem involves an oscillating charge distribution, which radiates power at a wavelength \( \lambda \). The radiated power per unit solid angle is a function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \), and the maximum power radiated is \( A \). The task is to determine the fraction of \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) and the form of \( f(\lambda, \theta) \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Radiation Pattern**: For an oscillating dipole, the radiation intensity is proportional to \( \sin^2\theta \). The maximum intensity occurs at \( \theta = 90^\circ \), where \( \sin^2\theta = 1 \). For \( \theta = 30^\circ \), \( \sin^2\theta = (0.5)^2 = 0.25 \). Thus, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( \frac{1}{4} \).

2. **Dependence on Wavelength**: The power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to \( \omega^4 \), where \( \omega \) is the angular frequency. Since \( \omega = \frac{2\pi c}{\lambda} \), we have \( \omega^4 \propto \lambda^{-4} \). Therefore, the function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \) is proportional to \( \lambda^{-4} \sin^2\theta \).

3. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: \( \frac{1}{2}, \lambda^{-4} \) — Incorrect, as the fraction is \( \frac{1}{4} \), not \( \frac{1}{2} \).
   - **Option B**: \( \frac{1}{4}, \lambda^{-3} \) — Incorrect, as the dependence on \( \lambda \) is \( \lambda^{-4} \), not \( \lambda^{-3} \).
   - **Option C**: \( \frac{1}{4}, \lambda^{-4} \) — Correct, as the fraction is \( \frac{1}{4} \) and the dependence on \( \lambda \) is \( \lambda^{-4} \).
   - **Option D**: \( \frac{3}{4}, \lambda^{-6} \) — Incorrect, as the fraction is \( \frac{1}{4} \) and the dependence on \( \lambda \) is \( \lambda^{-4} \), not \( \lambda^{-6} \).

### Conclusion:
The fraction of \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( \frac{1}{4} \), and the form of \( f(\lambda, \theta) \) is proportional to \( \lambda^{-4} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
