Okay, so I've got this problem about partition functions for a system of three spins. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my statistical mechanics, but let's try to think this through.

So the setup is three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. The options are A to D, so I'll have to calculate Z and see which one matches.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor, which is e^(-β E), where β is 1/(kT). So for each possible configuration of the spins, I calculate e^(-β E), and sum them all up.

First, let me figure out all the possible states. Each spin has two options, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. I should list all the possible states and calculate E for each.

Each state can be represented by the triplet (S1, S2, S3), where each S is +1 or -1.

Let me list them:

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Now, for each state, compute the energy E. Remember E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me compute the sum S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 for each.

1. State (+1, +1, +1):
   S1S2 = 1*1 = 1
   S1S3 = 1*1 = 1
   S2S3 = 1*1 = 1
   Sum S=1+1+1=3
   E = -J * 3 = -3J

2. State (+1, +1, -1):
   S1S2 =1, S1S3=1*(-1)=-1, S2S3=1*(-1)=-1
   Sum S=1-1-1 = -1
   E = -J * (-1) = J

3. State (+1, -1, +1):
   S1S2 =1*(-1)=-1, S1S3=1*1=1, S2S3=(-1)*1=-1
   Sum S= -1 +1 -1 = -1
   E= J

4. State (+1, -1, -1):
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=1*(-1)=-1, S2S3=(-1)*(-1)=1
   Sum S= (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1
   E= J

Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check. For state 4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.
So S1S2 = (+1)(-1) = -1
S1S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1
S2S3 = (-1)(-1)=1
Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J. Yep.

5. State (-1, +1, +1):
   S1S2 = (-1)(1) = -1
   S1S3 = (-1)(1) = -1
   S2S3 = (1)(1)=1
   Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1 → E= J.

6. State (-1, +1, -1):
   S1S2 = (-1)(1)=-1
   S1S3 = (-1)(-1)=1
   S2S3 = (1)(-1)=-1
   Sum: -1 +1 -1= -1 → E= J.

7. State (-1, -1, +1):
   S1S2 = (-1)(-1)=1
   S1S3 = (-1)(1)=-1
   S2S3 = (-1)(1)=-1
   Sum: 1 -1 -1 = -1 → E= J.

8. State (-1, -1, -1):
   S1S2 = (-1)(-1)=1
   S1S3 = (-1)(-1)=1
   S2S3 = (-1)(-1)=1
   Sum: 1 +1 +1=3 → E= -J*3 = -3J.

So now, the energies:

- State 1 and 8: E = -3J each.
- States 2,3,4,5,6,7: E= J each.

Wait, how many states have E= J? States 2-7, except state 4? No, wait, let me recount. States 2 is (+1, +1, -1): E=J. State 3: same. State 4: same. State5: same. State6: same. State7: same. That's six states with E= J. Yes.

So the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp( -β E ).

So for each state, the term is exp( β J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3) ), but wait, since E = -J*(sum), then exp(-β E) = exp( β J sum).

Wait, let me be precise. Each state's energy is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So the exponent is -β E = β J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3).

So for each state, the Boltzmann factor is exp( β J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3) ) = exp( β J (sum) ).

So for the states with sum=3, we have exp(3 β J). For the states with sum=-1, we have exp(-β J).

But wait, let me get back, since E = -J (sum), so -β E = β J sum. So for the sum=3, -β E = 3 β J. For sum=-1, -β E = (-1) β J.

So for state 1 and state 8, each contributes exp(3 β J). There are 2 such states.

For the other six states, each contributes exp(-β J). Because their sum is -1, so -β E = β J * (-1) = -β J → exp(-β J).

So Z = 2 * e^{3 β J} + 6 * e^{ - β J }.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ) + 6 e^{Jβ}.

Wait, but in my calculation, the exponent for the two states is 3Jβ. So that's e^{3Jβ}.

Wait, but the options have e^{Jβ} and e^{-Jβ}.

So let me recheck: For sum =3, the exponent is 3Jβ. So if β=1/(kT), then e^{3Jβ} would be e^{3J/(kT)}.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Z = 2 e^{-3Jβ} +6 e^{Jβ} → No, because we have two terms with 3Jβ.

Wait no, my conclusion was Z= 2 e^{3J β} +6 e^{ - J β }.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2 e^{-3Jβ} +6 e^{Jβ} → No.

Option B: 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ} → This matches my conclusion.

Wait, but let me check. Option B is Z = 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}.

Yes, that's what I have. So the correct Z is option B.

Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the signs.

E = -J (sum of the products). So for the two states where sum is 3, E = -3J. The Boltzmann factor is exp(-beta E) = exp(3 beta J).

Yes, that's correct. So those two states contribute e^{3J beta}.

The other states have sum -1, so E= J. So the Boltzmann factor is exp(-beta E) = exp(-beta J).

Wait, no: E = -J * (sum), so for sum=-1, E= J. So beta E is beta * J. So the Boltzmann factor is exp(-beta * E) = exp(-beta J).

Wait, that's correct. So those six states contribute e^{-beta J} each.

So Z = 2 e^{3 J beta} + 6 e^{- J beta}.

Which matches option B: Z= 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}.

Looking back at the options:

Option B is exactly that. So the correct answer must be option B.


To solve the problem, we calculate the partition function \( Z \) for a system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \). The energy of the system is given by \( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \), and the partition function is defined as:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E},
\]
where \( \beta = \frac{1}{kT} \).

### Step 1: Enumerate all possible states
There are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states, represented as triplets \( (S_1, S_2, S_3) \). These states are:
1. \( (+1, +1, +1) \)
2. \( (+1, +1, -1) \)
3. \( (+1, -1, +1) \)
4. \( (+1, -1, -1) \)
5. \( (-1, +1, +1) \)
6. \( (-1, +1, -1) \)
7. \( (-1, -1, +1) \)
8. \( (-1, -1, -1) \)

### Step 2: Compute the energy \( E \) for each state
The energy is given by \( E = -J(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3) \). For each state, the sum \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \) is calculated:

1. \( (+1, +1, +1): S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \), so \( E = -3J \).
2. \( (+1, +1, -1): S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 \), so \( E = J \).
3. \( (+1, -1, +1): S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 \), so \( E = J \).
4. \( (+1, -1, -1): S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1 \), so \( E = J \).
5. \( (-1, +1, +1): S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1 \), so \( E = J \).
6. \( (-1, +1, -1): S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 \), so \( E = J \).
7. \( (-1, -1, +1): S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 \), so \( E = J \).
8. \( (-1, -1, -1): S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \), so \( E = -3J \).

### Step 3: Classify states by energy
- States 1 and 8 have \( E = -3J \).
- States 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 have \( E = J \).

### Step 4: Compute the partition function \( Z \)
The partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factors \( e^{-\beta E} \) for all states:
\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E}.
\]
- For states with \( E = -3J \), the Boltzmann factor is \( e^{-\beta(-3J)} = e^{3\beta J} \). There are 2 such states, so their contribution is \( 2e^{3\beta J} \).
- For states with \( E = J \), the Boltzmann factor is \( e^{-\beta(J)} = e^{-\beta J} \). There are 6 such states, so their contribution is \( 6e^{-\beta J} \).

Thus, the partition function is:
\[
Z = 2e^{3\beta J} + 6e^{-\beta J}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**Option B: \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \).**

Answer: B
