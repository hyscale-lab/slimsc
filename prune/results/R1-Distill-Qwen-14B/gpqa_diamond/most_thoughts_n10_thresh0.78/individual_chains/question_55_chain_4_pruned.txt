Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are all different types of propenyl or butenyl acetates, either cis or trans. The given NMR data is:

1H NMR (ppm):
7.0 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)
5.5 (1H, dq)
2.1 (3H, s)
1.6 (3H, d)

Hmm. So I need to match this NMR data with one of the four options. Let me first think about the structure of each option.

All the options are acetates, so the structure is something like an acetyl group (OAc) attached to a propenyl or butenyl group. The difference is whether the substituents (like the double bond) are cis or trans.

But wait, wait. Let me clarify. Propenyl acetate would have a three-carbon chain with a double bond. Butenyl would have a four-carbon chain. So, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but wait, no, wait. Oh wait, propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc? Wait, wait, maybe I should draw each structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more like CH2CH2OAc, but with a double bond in the propenyl group. Let me think again. The propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2- but that's for allyl. Wait, propenyl acetate could be CH2=CHCH2-OAc? Or maybe it's CH3CH2CH2-OAc but with a double bond. Wait, no, that's not right. Oh wait, maybe the structure is (Z or E) for the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the compounds are of the structure (E)- or (Z)- propenyl acetate or butenyl acetate. So for propenyl, it's CH2=CHCH2-OAc? But wait, the double bond in propenyl is between carbons 1 and 2, so it's CH2=CH-OAc? No, wait. No, acetate is an
