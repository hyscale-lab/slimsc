Okay, so I've got this NMR problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see, the question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are different types of propenyl and butenyl acetates, either cis or trans. Hmm.

First, I need to understand what each of these compounds looks like structurally. Acetates are esters derived from acetic acid. So, propenyl acetate would have an acetyl group (from the acid) attached to a propenyl group (CH₂CH₂CH₂?), but wait, propenyl is CH₂=CHCH₂- right? Wait, no, propenyl is CH₂CH₂CH₂, but with a double bond. Propenyl would be CH₂=CHCH₂- as an substituent, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, wait, propenyl is actually -CH₂CH₂CH₂- but with a double bond. No, wait no. Let me get this straight. The structure of propenyl group is CH₂=CHCH₂-. But wait, propene is CH₂=CHCH3, so propenyl would be CH₂=CHCH2- as a substituent.

Wait, but in the case of propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH3CO-O-CH₂CH=CH2? Or is it CH₂CH=CH-O-... Hmm, no, wait. The ester functional group is O-C-O, right? So, the general structure of an ester is R-O-CO-R'. So propenyl acetate would be CH3CO-O-CH₂CH=CH2? Or maybe it's CH₂=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3? Wait, that's correct. So the acetate part is the acetyl (CH3COO-) and the propenyl is the substituent on the oxygen. So, the structure is CH3COO-CH2CH=CH2. But wait, wait, propenyl is CH2CH2 with the double bond, so maybe it's CH2=CHCH2-OAc?

But wait, the other compounds are butenyl acetates. So butenyl would have four carbons, with a double bond. So butenyl acetate would be CH3COO-CH2CH=

Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are all different types of propenyl or butenyl acetates, either cis or trans. The given NMR data is:

1H NMR (ppm):
7.0 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)
5.5 (1H, dq)
2.1 (3H, s)
1.6 (3H, d)

Hmm. So I need to match this NMR data with one of the four options. Let me first think about the structure of each option.

All the options are acetates, so the structure is something like an acetyl group (OAc) attached to a propenyl or butenyl group. The difference is whether the substituents (like the double bond) are cis or trans.

But wait, wait. Let me clarify. Propenyl acetate would have a three-carbon chain with a double bond. Butenyl would have a four-carbon chain. So, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but wait, no, wait. Oh wait, propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc? Wait, wait, maybe I should draw each structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more like CH2CH2OAc, but with a double bond in the propenyl group. Let me think again. The propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2- but that's for allyl. Wait, propenyl acetate could be CH2=CHCH2-OAc? Or maybe it's CH3CH2CH2-OAc but with a double bond. Wait, no, that's not right. Oh wait, maybe the structure is (Z or E) for the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the compounds are of the structure (E)- or (Z)- propenyl acetate or butenyl acetate. So for propenyl, it's CH2=CHCH2-OAc? But wait, the double bond in propenyl is between carbons 1 and 2, so it's CH2=CH-OAc? No, wait. No, acetate is an
