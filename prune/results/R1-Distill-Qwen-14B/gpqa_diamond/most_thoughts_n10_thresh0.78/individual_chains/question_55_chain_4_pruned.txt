Okay, so I've got this NMR problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see, the question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are different types of propenyl and butenyl acetates, either cis or trans. Hmm.

First, I need to understand what each of these compounds looks like structurally. Acetates are esters derived from acetic acid. So, propenyl acetate would have an acetyl group (from the acid) attached to a propenyl group (CH₂CH₂CH₂?), but wait, propenyl is CH₂=CHCH₂- right? Wait, no, propenyl is CH₂CH₂CH₂, but with a double bond. Propenyl would be CH₂=CHCH₂- as an substituent, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, wait, propenyl is actually -CH₂CH₂CH₂- but with a double bond. No, wait no. Let me get this straight. The structure of propenyl group is CH₂=CHCH₂-. But wait, propene is CH₂=CHCH3, so propenyl would be CH₂=CHCH2- as a substituent.

Wait, but in the case of propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH3CO-O-CH₂CH=CH2? Or is it CH₂CH=CH-O-... Hmm, no, wait. The ester functional group is O-C-O, right? So, the general structure of an ester is R-O-CO-R'. So propenyl acetate would be CH3CO-O-CH₂CH=CH2? Or maybe it's CH₂=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3? Wait, that's correct. So the acetate part is the acetyl (CH3COO-) and the propenyl is the substituent on the oxygen. So, the structure is CH3COO-CH2CH=CH2. But wait, wait, propenyl is CH2CH2 with the double bond, so maybe it's CH2=CHCH2-OAc?

But wait, the other compounds are butenyl acetates. So butenyl would have four carbons, with a double bond. So butenyl acetate would be CH3COO-CH2CH=
