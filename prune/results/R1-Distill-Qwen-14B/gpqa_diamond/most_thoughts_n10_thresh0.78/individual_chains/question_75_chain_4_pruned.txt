Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the transgenic mouse model. The researcher used a plasmid with the gene coding sequence modified by adding a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells and selected for antibiotic resistance, but the protein isn't showing up as expected.

Let me read through the problem again. The issue is that the plus strand of their construct has a specific sequence. Hmm, I should look at that sequence to see if there are any obvious issues.

Wait, the plus strand is the sense strand, right? So the coding sequence should start with a start codon, which is ATG. Let me look through the sequence for ATG. Oh, the very beginning is ATG TAC... Wait, wait. The first few nucleotides are 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... So the sequence starts with ATG, which is methionine, the start codon. That's good.

But then the next codon is TAC, which is tyrosine. Wait, the start codon is ATG, and the next codon is TAC (tyr). So the reading frame is correct. The sequence seems okay.

Wait, but why isn't the protein being expressed? The options are A to D. Let's analyze each step.

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. So the hemagglutinin tag's sequence is wrong. But the question says the coding sequence is modified by introducing the HA sequence at the N-terminus. If the HA sequence is wrong, that would affect the protein's structure, but why would it prevent overexpression? Maybe if the HA tag has a stop codon or disrupts the reading frame. But the sequence starts with ATG, which is the start, so unless there's a frameshift earlier, which isn't the case here.

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early. That would happen if there's a stop codon in the sequence. Let me check the end of the sequence. It ends with TGA. Wait
