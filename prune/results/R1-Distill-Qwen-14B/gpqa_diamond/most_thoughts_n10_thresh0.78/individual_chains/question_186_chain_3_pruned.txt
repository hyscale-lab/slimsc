Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

The compound in question is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Hmm, I need to visualize its structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is like a norbornane structure. The substituents are at positions 1 and 4. The 2-vinyl means there's a vinyl group attached to the second carbon. The 'azabicyclo' part indicates there's a nitrogen in the ring. So, the structure probably has a bridge with a nitrogen.

Wait, the numbering might help. The bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has two bridgeheads. The 1S and 4R configurations suggest the substituents are on specific bridgeheads. So, the structure must have a bridge with a nitrogen, making it a bicyclic amine.

The reaction is a Cope rearrangement. From what I remember, the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of 1,5-dienes to form another 1,5-diene. The reaction typically occurs in a six-membered transition state, like a chair-like structure. But wait, sometimes when the diene is constrained, like in a bicyclic system, the rearrangement can lead to different products.

Wait, in this case, the starting material is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So, perhaps the structure has a bridge with a vinyl group attached to a nitrogen. Let me draw it out mentally. The bicyclo system with two two-membered bridges and one one-membered bridge. So the nitrogen is at position 2, and there's a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, the structure is 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So the double bond is between carbons 5 and 6 (if numbered as per bicyclo systems). But wait, in bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, the double bond is in
