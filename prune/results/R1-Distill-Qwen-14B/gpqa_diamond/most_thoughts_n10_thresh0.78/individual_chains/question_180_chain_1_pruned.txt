Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and jot down what I know.

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. So, each particle has a charge of 2 times the elementary charge, which is about 2 * 1.6e-19 coulombs. Wait, no, wait. Wait, e is the elementary charge, so 2e is 3.2e-19 C. Got it.

These particles have negligible mass, so I don't have to worry about their mass affecting anything else, like kinetic energy or gravitational interactions. Just charge and their positions matter here.

Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, point P is where the 13th charge is. So, the setup is that 12 charges are each 2 meters away from P, and the 13th is fixed at P.

The question is about finding the minimum energy of this system. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, okay. So I think this is an electrostatic potential energy problem because we're dealing with charges and their potential energy in a system. Since the system is isolated, I guess we're considering the potential energy between all the charges.

Wait, wait. So each of the 12 charges is at 2 meters from P, and the 13th is at P. So, the 13th charge is fixed, so maybe it's not moving, but the others are constrained but fixed as well. So all the charges are fixed in place.

I remember that the electrostatic potential energy (U) of a system of point charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. And the formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

But when calculating the total potential energy of the system, you have to consider all pairs of charges. Because each charge interacts with every other charge.

Wait, but in this case, maybe I can model it as each of the 12 charges interacting with the 13th charge, which is at P.

Wait, but the 12 charges are all located at 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 is distance 2 m from the 13th charge at P. So each of those 12 has a potential energy relative to the 13th.

But wait, the 13th charge is fixed. So when calculating the potential energy of the system, we're considering the energy stored in the configuration of all the charges, which includes the interactions between each pair.

So the total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. Since each pair is considered once, to avoid double-counting, we can calculate it for each pair and sum them all.

But
