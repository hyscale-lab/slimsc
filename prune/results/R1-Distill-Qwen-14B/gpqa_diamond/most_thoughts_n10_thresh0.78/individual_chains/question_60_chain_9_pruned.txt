Okay, so I've got this question about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. Right, that's from Einstein's theory of relativity. So the astronaut is traveling at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's super fast, almost light speed. 

The question says the astronaut is 22 years old and we need to find out how long it takes for them to reach Earth from their own perspective. Wait, but time dilation is from the perspective of someone else, like an observer on Earth. So the astronaut's own clock would experience less time due to time dilation. Or wait, no, maybe I mixed that up. Let me think again.

Time dilation means that the moving clock (the astronaut's) runs slower compared to a stationary clock (like Earth's). Wait, no, that's from the perspective of Earth. So from Earth's frame of reference, the spaceship's time is moving slower. But the astronaut on the ship experiences their own time normally. Oh wait, no, wait. No, the time experienced by the astronaut would be less because of the effects of relativity.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So for the spaceship, the journey would take less time because of length contraction. Because from their perspective, the distance to Earth is contracted. So the time experienced by the astronaut is less than what an Earth observer would calculate.

Wait, the problem is asking, from the astronaut's point of view, how long does the trip take? So we need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut.

First, I think I need to find the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Wait, wait. The problem says it's the Large Magellanic Cloud, but it doesn't give the distance. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Oh wait, maybe the problem is using a different approach. Let me read the question
