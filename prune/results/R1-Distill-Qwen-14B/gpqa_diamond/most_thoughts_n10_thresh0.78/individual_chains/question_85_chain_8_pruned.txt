Okay, so I've got this problem here about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see what I remember about equilibrium temperature. I think it's related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star, right?

The star's parameters are given: mass is 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. Oh wait, the effective temperature is where the star emits most of its radiation. The two planets are detected via transit and radial velocity methods, which I think means we can get both their masses and orbital periods.

Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii, while Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo, which I think affects how much light they reflect. Oh, but albedo is the same, so I guess it cancels out in the ratio.

The problem mentions shifts in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Ã…. Wait, I think the transit method measures the drop in brightness as the planet passes in front of the star, but radial velocity detects the Doppler shift due to the star's movement from the planet's gravity. So the shifts given are from the RV method. Oh, but wait, the question says both methods detected the planets. Hmm, but for equilibrium temperature I don't think the RV data matters, except for getting the mass and orbital period.

Wait, equilibrium temperature formula: T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.5. Oh, but since albedo is same for both, it cancels out. So the ratio will be sqrt(R_star/(2a1)) / sqrt(R_star/(2a2)) ) = sqrt(a2 / a1). Because T_eq is proportional to sqrt(R_star/(2a)). So the ratio would be sqrt(a2/a1).

Wait, but how do I find a1 and a2, the semi-major axes of the planets? Oh, radial velocity method gives the mass and the velocity, but I think the velocity is related to the star's movement, which depends on the planet's mass and the distance. Oh, right, from the RV method, the
