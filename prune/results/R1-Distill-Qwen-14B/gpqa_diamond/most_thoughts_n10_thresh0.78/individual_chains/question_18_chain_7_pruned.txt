Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances and I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step. 

First, I'll read the problem again to make sure I get all the details right. There are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, and Star_2 is 1.2 solar masses. But wait, the mass might not be directly relevant here. The question is about elemental abundances determined using the EW method under LTE.

The given abundances are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex and [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Also, [Fe/H]_1 is 0 and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. Oh, and the solar photosphere has 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and same for Mg being 7. So I need to find the ratio [Si/Star1]/[Si/Star2], or wait, the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. So maybe the ratio of silicon to hydrogen? Or perhaps the ratio between the two stars' silicon abundances?

Wait, the question says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So that would be (n_Si1 / n_Si2)? Or is it (n_Si1/n_H1) divided by (n_Si2/n_H2), which would be [Si/H]_1 divided by [Si/H]_2? Because the ratio of silicon atoms would depend on the total number of atoms in each photosphere as well, but perhaps under the assumption that the stars have similar compositions, or maybe it's just the [Si/H] that matters. Hmm.

Let me think about the given data. For Star_1, [Fe/H] = 0, which means [Fe/H] is log(n_Fe1 / n_H1) - log(n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) ) = 0. So n_Fe1 / n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.

Wait, the [Fe/H] is the logarithm of the ratio of Fe to
