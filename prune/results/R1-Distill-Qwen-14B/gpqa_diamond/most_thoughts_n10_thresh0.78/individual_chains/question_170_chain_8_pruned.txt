Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, so that's a two-component spinor, right? So the state vector is χ = [3i, 4]^T. I remember that spin states are represented as two-component vectors in the Pauli spin matrices framework.

The expectation value of an operator is given by the formula: <S_y> = <χ| S_y |χ>. Oh wait, S_y is the spin component along y. And I recall that the Pauli matrices are involved here. The σ_y matrix is given as:

[[0, -i],
 [i, 0]]

But wait, the spin operator S_y isn't just σ_y. Oh right, for electrons, the spin operators are (ħ/2) σ_x, (ħ/2) σ_y, etc. So S_y should be (ħ/2) multiplied by the σ_y matrix.

So S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Now, to find the expectation value, I need to compute χ† S_y χ. Let me write that out.

First, the state vector χ is [3i, 4]^T. The dagger (adjoint) of χ would be [ -4, -3i ] since I need to take the complex conjugate and transpose it. Wait, wait, no. The adjoint is the conjugate transpose. So χ† would be [ (3i)* , (4)* ] as a row vector. So (3i)* is -3i, since the complex conjugate of i is -i. And 4 is real, so it's 4. So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, no, wait, no, wait. Wait a second. The state is given as (3i, 4). So the first component is 3i, second is 4. So when I take the conjugate transpose, χ† is the row vector [3i*, 4*]. 3i's conjugate is -3i, and 4's is 4. So χ†
