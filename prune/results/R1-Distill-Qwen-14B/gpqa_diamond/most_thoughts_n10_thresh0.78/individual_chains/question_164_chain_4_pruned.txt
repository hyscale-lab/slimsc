Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, binary stars, right? They orbit each other, and sometimes we can observe eclipses when they pass in front of each other from our point of view. The question is comparing two systems, system_1 and system_2, and I need to find out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2.

Let me read the question again. Both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. So system_1 has a longer orbital period. But wait, what do I know about binary stars and their periods? Oh right, the period is the time it takes for the two stars to orbit each other once.

Then, the spectroscopic observations show radial velocity (RV) variations. For system_1, the amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, it's 15 km/s and 10 km/s. Radial velocity variations happen because as the stars orbit each other, they move toward and away from us, causing Doppler shifts. The amplitude of these shifts depends on the mass of the companion and the inclination of the orbit, I think.

Wait, but the question gives us the RV amplitudes, so maybe I can find the mass function or something. Oh right! There's this formula involving the radial velocity semi-amplitude. The formula is something like K = (v * sin i) / (1 + q), where q is the mass ratio of the two stars, right? Or maybe another approach.

Alternatively, I remember that the mass function for a spectroscopic binary relates the period, the velocity semi-amplitudes, and the masses. The mass function is f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) ), but wait, that's for a single-lined spectroscopic binary. But in this problem, they have two-lined RVs, I think. Because both stars are showing sinusoidal variations.

Wait, no, in the question, for each system, we have two RV amplitudes, so both stars are visible in the spectra, meaning it's a double-lined spectroscopic binary. So for each system, the two stars' velocities are measured.

In a double-lined binary, the mass ratio can be determined. I think the formula for the mass ratio is (K1 / K2) =
