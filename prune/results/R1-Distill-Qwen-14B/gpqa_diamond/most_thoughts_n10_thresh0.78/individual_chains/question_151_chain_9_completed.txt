Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting the value 0 at a specific time t. The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, I should probably represent that as a vector. Oh right, it's a column vector, so it's a three-component vector: [-1, 2, 1]^T. 

The observable P is a matrix operator, and I have its elements. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. So P looks like this:

0       1/√2    0
1/√2    0      1/√2
0       1/√2    0

Wait, no, wait—wait. No, wait, the observable P is a matrix operator. Quantum mechanics observables are Hermitian operators, right? Because their eigenvalues are real, which correspond to possible measurement outcomes.

Looking at the matrix P, let me check if it's Hermitian. A matrix is Hermitian if it's equal to its conjugate transpose. Since all the elements here are real, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. So let me transpose P and see if it's the same.

The transpose would have the first column as [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], which matches the first row of the original. The second column is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], which matches the second row. The third column is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], which matches the third row. So yes, P is Hermitian. That makes sense because it's an observable.

Now, the question is to find the probability of measuring 0 when we measure P. To find the probability of a particular outcome in quantum mechanics, we need to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P. The probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude (the inner product of the state vector with the corresponding eigenvector).

So the plan is:

1. Find the eigenvalues of P.
2. For each eigenvalue, find the corresponding eigenvectors.
3. Identify which eigenvalues are 0 (since we're looking for the probability of measuring 0).
4. For each eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0, compute the inner product with the given state vector.
5. The probability is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of these inner products.

Let me start by finding the eigenvalues of P. The matrix P is 3x3. Let's write it out again:

Row 1: [0, 1/√2, 0]
Row 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0, 1/√2, 0]

To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

The matrix P - λI is:

[-λ, 1/√2, 0]
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2]
[0, 1/√2, -λ]

I need to compute the determinant of this matrix and set it to zero.

The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be a bit tricky. Let me write it out.

The determinant formula for a 3x3 matrix is:

a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)

Where the matrix is:

[a b c]
[d e f]
[g h i]

So applying this to our P - λI matrix:

First row: a = -λ, b=1/√2, c=0
Second row: d=1/√2, e=-λ, f=1/√2
Third row: g=0, h=1/√2, i=-λ

Plugging into the determinant formula:

(-λ) * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] 
- (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ]
+ 0 * [ ... ]

So let's compute each term.

First term: (-λ) * [ (λ^2 ) - (1/2) ) ] because (1/√2)^2 is 1/2. So that's (-λ)(λ^2 - 1/2) = -λ^3 + (λ)(1/2).

Wait, no: (-λ) multiplied by ( ( -λ * -λ ) - (1/√2)*(1/√2) ) → (λ^2 - 1/2). So (-λ)*(λ^2 - 1/2) = -λ^3 + (λ/2).

Second term: -(1/√2) multiplied by [ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ] → -(1/√2) * (-λ / √2 ) = -(1/√2)* (-λ/√2) = (λ)/(2).

Wait, no, the formula is minus b times (d i - f g). Wait, in the determinant formula, the second term is -b multiplied by (d i - f g). Let me recheck:

In the determinant formula, it's -b*(d i - f g). 

So here, b is 1/√2, d is 1/√2, i is -λ, f is 1/√2, g is 0.

So d i is (1/√2)*(-λ) = -λ/√2.

f g is (1/√2)*0 = 0.

So (d i - f g) is (-λ/√2) - 0 = -λ/√2.

So the second term is - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2) = (1/√2)(λ/√2) = λ/(2).

Third term is zero because c is zero.

Putting it all together, the determinant is:

(-λ^3 + (λ/2)) + (λ/2) ) → -λ^3 + (λ/2 + λ/2) → -λ^3 + λ.

So determinant is (-λ^3 + λ) = 0.

We can factor this: -λ (λ^2 - 1) = 0 → -λ (λ -1)(λ +1) ) = 0.

So the eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ =1, and λ = -1. Wait, but wait: let me double-check the determinant calculation because I might have messed up a sign.

Wait, the determinant was:

(-λ)*(λ^2 - 1/2) - (1/√2)*( (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ) + 0.

Wait, the first term: (-λ)(λ^2 - 1/2) = -λ^3 + (λ/2).

Second term: -(1/√2) multiplied by [ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ] → -(1/√2)* ( -λ /√2 ) = -(1/√2)*(-λ/√2) ) = (λ)/(2).

So the total is (-λ^3 + λ/2) + (λ/2) ) = -λ^3 + (λ/2 + λ/2) = -λ^3 + λ.

So yes, the determinant is -λ^3 + λ = 0 → λ^3 - λ = 0 → λ(λ^2 -1) =0 → λ=0,1,-1.

So eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

So the possible outcomes when measuring P are 0, 1, and -1.

The question is about the probability of getting 0.

So we need to find the eigenvector(s) corresponding to λ=0.

Then, take the inner product of the given state vector with each of these eigenvectors, square the magnitude, and sum them (if there are multiple eigenvectors for λ=0, but I think each eigenvalue here is non-degenerate as the matrix is 3x3 and eigenvalues are distinct: 0,1,-1).

So let's find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

We need to solve (P - 0 I ) |v> = 0 → P |v> = 0.

So the matrix P is:

0       1/√2    0
1/√2    0      1/√2
0       1/√2    0

We can write the system of equations for P|v> = 0.

Let me denote the components of |v> as [x, y, z]^T.

So the equations are:

(1) 0*x + (1/√2) y + 0 * z = 0 → (1/√2) y = 0 → y = 0.

(2) (1/√2) x + 0 * y + (1/√2) z = 0 → (1/√2)(x + z) = 0 → x + z = 0 → z = -x.

(3) 0 *x + (1/√2) y + 0 * z = 0 → same as equation (1), so y=0.

So the eigenvector must satisfy y=0, z = -x.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 can be written as [x, 0, -x]^T = x [1, 0, -1]^T.

So the eigenvectors are scalar multiples of [1, 0, -1]^T. So the normalized eigenvector would be [1, 0, -1]^T divided by its norm.

The norm squared is 1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 = 2 → norm is sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.

Wait no, wait: [1,0,-1] has squared norm 1^2 +0 + (-1)^2 = 2, so norm is sqrt(2). So the unit vector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))^T.

So the eigenvector is |v> = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.

Now, the state of the system is given as |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. 

Wait a second, in quantum mechanics, state vectors are supposed to be normalized, right? The norm is the square root of the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components. Let me compute that.

|ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T.

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6).

So the state vector is not normalized. That's fine because probabilities are calculated using the inner products, but we can either normalize it or work with it as is. Wait, no, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are typically normalized because the probabilities must sum to 1. So perhaps the given state is given without normalization. Hmm, but in this problem, the state is given as (-1, 2, 1), so perhaps we should proceed with that vector as is, without normalizing it.

But when calculating the inner product, we should take the conjugate transpose (bra) and multiply by the vector (ket). Since all components are real here, it's just the dot product.

So the amplitude (inner product) between |ψ> and the eigenvector |v> is:

a = <v|ψ> = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) )= (-2/sqrt(2)) = -sqrt(2).

Wait, wait. Let me compute that again.

v is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.

ψ is [-1, 2, 1]^T.

Their inner product is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1) = (-1)/(sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(2)) = (-2)/(sqrt(2)).

Simplify that: (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2) * (2)/ (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) ) → Hmm, wait, 2/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2). So 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)/sqrt(2) )= sqrt(2). So 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2). So (-2)/sqrt(2)= -sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait. Let me compute 2/sqrt(2):

sqrt(2) is about 1.414. 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) / sqrt(2) )= sqrt(2).

So yes, 2/sqrt(2) equals sqrt(2). Thus, (-2)/sqrt(2) is -sqrt(2).

The amplitude is -sqrt(2).

The probability is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude. So |a|^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.

Wait, but that's 2. But the state vector |ψ> is not normalized. Oh wait, that's a problem. Because in quantum mechanics, the probabilities must sum to 1, but here the state is not normalized. So perhaps we need to normalize it before computing the probability.

Wait, so the state vector |ψ> is given as [-1, 2, 1]^T. Its norm squared is 6. So the normalized state is |ψ> / sqrt(6).

So when we compute the inner product, we should calculate <v| (ψ / sqrt(6)) >.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The state vector is |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. To compute the probability of getting the eigenvalue 0, we find the inner product of |ψ> with the eigenvector |v>, then square the magnitude. But if |ψ> is not normalized, then the probabilities might sum to something else. So perhaps I should normalize |ψ> first.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the inner product between |ψ> and |v>, then divide by the norm of |ψ>, and then square the magnitude. Because in quantum mechanics, the state is a unit vector, so when you compute the probability, you don't have to worry about normalization.

Wait, let me think. The general formula is: 

Probability = | <v|ψ> |^2 / <ψ|ψ> 

Wait, no. Wait, no, in standard quantum mechanics, the state |ψ> is a unit vector, so <ψ|ψ> =1. But in this problem, |ψ> is not normalized. So perhaps the way to compute the probability is to first normalize |ψ> and then compute the inner product.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is | <v|ψ> |^2 / ( <ψ|ψ> ), since the state is not normalized.

Wait, I might be getting confused here. Let me recall the correct formula.

In quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the inner product of the state vector with the corresponding eigenvector, provided the state is normalized. If the state is not normalized, the probability is the squared inner product divided by the squared norm of the state.

So the formula is:

Probability = | <v|ψ> |^2 / ( <ψ|ψ> )

Where <v|ψ> is the inner product, and <ψ|ψ> is the norm squared.

So in this case, <v|ψ> is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) +0 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2), as I calculated earlier.

The norm squared of ψ is 6.

So | <v|ψ> |^2 is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.

Thus, the probability is 2 / 6 = 1/3.

Wait, that makes sense. So the probability is 1/3.

Let me double-check the calculations.

<v|ψ> = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 = (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

So the magnitude squared is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.

The norm squared of ψ is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2=1+4+1=6.

So probability is 2/6 = 1/3.

So the correct answer is option C) 1/3.


To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) and obtaining the value \( 0 \) at time \( t \). The state of the system is given as the column vector \( |\psi\rangle = [-1, 2, 1]^T \), and the observable \( P \) is represented by the Hermitian matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( P \)
To find the eigenvalues of \( P \), we solve the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). The matrix \( P - \lambda I \) is:

\[
P - \lambda I = \begin{bmatrix}
-\lambda & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\lambda & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\lambda
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The determinant is computed as:

\[
\det(P - \lambda I) = -\lambda \left( \lambda^2 - \frac{1}{2} \right) - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( -\frac{\lambda}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = -\lambda^3 + \lambda.
\]

Setting \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \), we solve:

\[
-\lambda^3 + \lambda = 0 \implies \lambda (\lambda^2 - 1) = 0.
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \).

### Step 2: Eigenvector for \( \lambda = 0 \)
For \( \lambda = 0 \), we solve \( P |v\rangle = 0 \). This gives the system of equations:

\[
\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} y = 0, \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} x + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} z = 0, \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} y = 0.
\end{cases}
\]

From \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} y = 0 \), we find \( y = 0 \). From \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (x + z) = 0 \), we find \( z = -x \). Thus, the eigenvector is:

\[
|v\rangle = x \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize, we divide by the norm \( \sqrt{1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{2} \), giving:

\[
|v\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Inner Product and Probability
The state vector \( |\psi\rangle = [-1, 2, 1]^T \) is not normalized. Its norm squared is:

\[
\langle \psi | \psi \rangle = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 6.
\]

The inner product between \( |\psi\rangle \) and \( |v\rangle \) is:

\[
\langle v | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (-1) + 0 (2) + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} (1) = \frac{-1 - 1}{\sqrt{2}} = -\sqrt{2}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( \lambda = 0 \) is:

\[
P(\lambda = 0) = \frac{|\langle v | \psi \rangle|^2}{\langle \psi | \psi \rangle} = \frac{(-\sqrt{2})^2}{6} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
