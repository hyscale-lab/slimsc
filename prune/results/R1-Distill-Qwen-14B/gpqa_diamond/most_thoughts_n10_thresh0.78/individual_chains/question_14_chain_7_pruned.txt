Okay, so I've got this ChIP-seq question about why some peaks disappear when using a different fixation method. Hmm. Let me think through this.

So, the question is about using PFA-fixed samples versus PFA+DSG. I remember that PFA is paraformaldehyde, which cross-links proteins to DNA. But wait, what's DSG? Oh right, DSG is a detergent, Dithiocarbamate. It's used in some fixation protocols to help solubilize chromatin and maybe break up some crosslinks. Oh wait, no, wait. I think PFA is a fixative that crosslinks DNA-protein interactions. DSG is often used in a procedure called "formaldehyde crosslinking followed by sonication" but maybe DSG helps in the crosslinking process.

Wait, so in the first case, they used PFA alone for fixation, and then in the second, PFA plus DSG. The result is that some ChIP peaks (IKAROS binding sites) disappeared when using PFA+DSG.

So why would that happen? I think I remember that when you fix with PFA, it's a reversible crosslinking. But when you add DSG, which is sometimes used as an enhancer of crosslinking, it makes the crosslinks more stable or thorough. Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, no. I think DSG is a reducing agent and also can enhance crosslinking. Or perhaps it's used in the washing steps.

Wait, another angle: The standard fixation for ChIP is usually crosslinking with formaldehyde, which is a strong fixative that stops transcription and crosslinks proteins to DNA. PFA is another fixative, perhaps less harsh than formaldehyde? Or more? Wait, PFA is paraformaldehyde, which is often used in situ hybridization, but I'm not sure about its crosslinking efficiency compared to formaldehyde.

Wait, but in the question, the sample was fixed with PFA, then the same sample was processed with PFA+DSG. Oh, perhaps DSG is used in a different way. Wait, DSG is used in methods like the one for crosslinking in Dignam's protocol or something else. Oh wait, in some protocols, DSG is used in the lysis buffer
