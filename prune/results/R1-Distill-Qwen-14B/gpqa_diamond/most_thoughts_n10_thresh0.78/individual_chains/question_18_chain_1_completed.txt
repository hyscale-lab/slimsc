Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, it's a bit confusing, but let me try to break it down. 

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a mass 1.5 times the Sun, and Star_2 is 1.2 times. The problem gives me some abundance ratios using the EW method. I remember that [X/Y] means the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y relative to the Sun. 

Wait, the given values are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0. Oh, and the Sun's photosphere has 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7. 

The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, I need to find [Si/Star_2] / [Si/Star_1], or maybe (n_Si1 / n_Si2)? I'm not entirely sure, but I think I need to compute the silicon abundance in each star relative to the Sun and then take their ratio.

Let me jot down what I know:

For Star_1:
- Mass = 1.5 Msun
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → so Si/Fe = 10^0.3 ≈ 2 (since 10^0.3 is about 2, because 10^0.3 is around 2, yeah, 10^0.3 is approximately 2 because 10^0.3 ≈ 2, right? Let me think, 10^0.3 is about 2 since 10^0.3 is about 2 because 10^0.3 is approximately 2, yeah, about 2.)

Wait, no. 10^0.3 is actually approximately 2. So, 0.3 dex means the ratio is 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So, [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. 

Wait, no, the notation is [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. So, if [X/Y] is positive, it means X is more abundant relative to Y than in the Sun.

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log10(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = log10(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) + 0.3.

But wait, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, meaning Fe is same as the Sun's Fe abundance. So, [Fe/H] = log(n_Fe1/n_H1) - log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) = 0 → log(n_Fe1/n_H1) = log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun). So, n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun. 

Wait, but H is hydrogen. So, in Star_1, the ratio Fe/H is same as Sun. So, n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1 / n_H_sun). 

But in the Sun, n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. Wait, no: the problem says 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. Wait, that can't be right. Oh, wait, perhaps it's 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5? That would make log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me write down the given data:

For the Sun:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5.

Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) =7 -12= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

So, Sun's nFe/nH is 10^-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5, and nMg/nH is 1e-5.

Now, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → log(n_Fe1/n_H1) - log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) =0 → log(n_Fe1/n_H1) = log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun). So, n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun. Same as Sun's Fe/H ratio. So, the number of Fe atoms is same relative to H as in the Sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → [Si/Fe]_1 = log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) - log(n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun) =0.3.

Let me compute log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) +0.3.

So, n_Si1/n_Fe1 = 10^{log(n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun)} * 10^{0.3}.

Wait, but from the Sun's data, n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun is 3.16e-5, and n_Si_sun is not directly given. But wait, in the Sun, using the data for [Mg/Si]_sun? No, wait, the Sun's [Mg/Si] is not given. Hmm, but maybe I can calculate it using the given data.

Wait, no, in the Sun, the [Mg/H] is not given; but [Mg/Si] is not given for the Sun. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of Si to Fe in the Sun, since I have [Fe/H] and [Mg/Si] for the stars, but not directly for the Sun.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me first compute the ratios for each star and then find the ratio of their silicon abundances.

Let me start with Star_1.

Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → [Fe/H] = log(n_Fe1/n_H1) - log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) =0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun.

So, the Fe abundance is same as the Sun. So, [Fe/H]=0 implies that Star_1 has the same Fe abundance as the Sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) +0.3.

So, n_Si1/n_Fe1 = (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But I don't know n_Si_sun. Wait, but maybe I can find n_Si_sun in terms of other elements. Wait, I'm given n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun=1e-5, but how does that help? Hmm.

Wait, the Sun's composition is given as 12 + log(nFe/nH)=7.5 → nFe/nH=1e-4.5. And 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

So, in the Sun,

n_Fe_sun = 3.16e-5 * n_H_sun,

n_Mg_sun = 1e-5 * n_H_sun.

But what about n_Si_sun? I don't have [Si/Fe]_sun. Hmm, maybe I can assume that in the Sun, [Si/Fe] is zero, but wait, that's not necessarily correct. Wait, but perhaps in the problem statement, the Sun's [X/Y] values are not given, except for the ones we have. So perhaps I have to find a way around.

Wait, perhaps for Star_1, since [Fe/H] is 0, and [Si/Fe] is 0.3, then:

n_Si1 = n_Fe1 * 10^{0.3}.

But n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1 / n_H_sun).

Wait, but n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun → n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1 / n_H_sun).

Wait, but n_H1 is the hydrogen number density in Star_1. But since we're dealing with ratios, maybe the actual H density cancels out.

Alternatively, maybe I can express all the abundances relative to hydrogen.

Let me think about Star_1.

In Star_1:

n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1 / n_H_sun).

n_Si1 = n_Fe1 * 10^{0.3} = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1 / n_H_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

Similarly, in the Sun:

n_Si_sun = n_Fe_sun * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun).

Wait, but I don't know [Si/Fe]_sun. Hmm, perhaps we can express all ratios in terms of the Sun's parameters.

Alternatively, maybe I can model this using the fact that [X/Fe] is the logarithm of (n_X/n_Fe) relative to the Sun.

Wait, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3, which is log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) - log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) =0.3.

So, log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) +0.3.

Which implies n_Si1/n_Fe1 = (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

But I can't proceed without knowing n_Si_sun. Hmm. Maybe I can relate [Mg/Si]_2 to find more info.

Wait, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) = log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) +0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → log(n_Mg2/n_H2) = log(n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun) → n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun.

So, n_Mg2 = n_Mg_sun * (n_H2 / n_H_sun).

Similarly, n_Si2 = n_Mg2 / (10^{0.3}) ) → because [Mg/Si] =0.3 → n_Mg2/n_Si2 = (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) *10^{0.3} → n_Si2 = (n_Mg2) / ( (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) *10^{0.3} ) )

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can express each element's abundance relative to H and then find the ratio of Si in each star.

Let me try to model the abundance for each star.

Starting with Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.

So, n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H1.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) +0.3.

So, n_Si1 = n_Fe1 * 10^{0.3} * (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun).

But n_Fe1 is (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H1 → so,

n_Si1 = [ (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H1 ] * 10^{0.3} * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun )

Simplify:

n_Si1 = (n_Fe_sun * n_H1) / n_H_sun * 10^{0.3} * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun )

The n_Fe_sun cancels out:

n_Si1 = (n_H1 / n_H_sun) * 10^{0.3} * n_Si_sun.

Hmm. So, n_Si1 is proportional to (n_H1 / n_H_sun) * 10^{0.3} * n_Si_sun.

But I don't know n_Si_sun. So, perhaps I need to find n_Si_sun in terms of the Sun's other abundances.

Wait, but I don't have [Si/Fe]_sun. So, maybe that's a problem. Hmm. Maybe I can relate n_Si_sun to n_Mg_sun via the [Mg/Si] ratios of the stars.

Wait, what if I proceed to express everything in terms of the Sun's [Si/Fe]?

Let me denote:

In the Sun, [Si/Fe]_sun = log(n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun) = let's say, S.

Similarly, in the Sun, [Mg/Si]_sun = log(n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) = M.

But wait, from the Sun's data, n_Mg_sun =1e-5 * n_H_sun, and n_Fe_sun =3.16e-5 *n_H_sun.

So,

n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun =1e-5 *n_H_sun /n_Si_sun.

But without knowing n_Si_sun, I can't proceed. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the ratio of silicon in Star_1 and Star_2 relative to the Sun and then take their ratio.

So, I need to find (n_Si1 / n_Si2) = ?

Wait, let me think.

In Star_1:

n_Si1 = n_Fe1 * 10^{0.3}.

In Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → n_Mg2 = n_Si2 * 10^{0.3}.

And [Mg/H]_2 =0 → n_Mg2 = n_Mg_sun * (n_H2 / n_H_sun).

So,

n_Si2 = n_Mg2 / 10^{0.3} = [n_Mg_sun (n_H2 / n_H_sun)] /10^{0.3}.

Wait, but I also have [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → [Mg/Si] = log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) - log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) =0.3.

So, n_Mg2/n_Si2 = (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Which gives n_Si2 = n_Mg2 / [ (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun ) * 10^{0.3} ]

But I'm not making progress because I don't know n_Si_sun.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Since the problem is only asking for the ratio of silicon in Star_1 and Star_2, maybe the solar constants will cancel out.

Let me proceed step by step.

For Star_1:

n_Si1 = n_Fe1 * 10^{0.3}.

But n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) *n_H1.

So,

n_Si1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) *n_H1 *10^{0.3}.

But [Fe/H]_1=0 → n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun * n_H1 ) / n_H_sun.

Wait, but without knowing n_H1 or n_H2, I'm stuck. Hmm, perhaps I can express everything in terms of the Sun's H.

Wait, perhaps the ratio will eliminate H. Let's see.

We need to find (n_Si1 / n_Si2).

Expressed as:

(n_Si1 / n_Si2) = [n_Si1] / [n_Si2]

Now, from Star_1:

n_Si1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) *n_H1 *10^{0.3}.

From Star_2:

We have [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → n_Mg2 =n_Si2 *10^{0.3}.

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H2.

So,

n_Si2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H2 / 10^{0.3}.

So,

n_Si1 /n_Si2 = [ (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H1 *10^{0.3} ] / [ (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H2 /10^{0.3} )

Simplify:

= [n_Fe_sun *n_H1 *10^{0.3} *10^{0.3} ] / [n_Mg_sun *n_H2 ]

= [n_Fe_sun /n_Mg_sun ] * (n_H1 /n_H2 ) *10^{0.6}.

Hmm, but I don't know n_H1 or n_H2. Well, but wait, perhaps we can relate n_H1 and n_H2 via the stellar masses.

Wait, the mass of a star is roughly proportional to the total number of particles (n) times the mass per particle. But for main-sequence stars, the mass is determined by the Hydrogen content, so perhaps n_H is proportional to the mass. But wait, that's not exactly correct. Let me think.

Each star's photospheric composition is similar to the interstellar medium, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the number density of hydrogen in each star is proportional to the inverse of the star's radius? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: perhaps the ratio of H in the two stars can be found via the stellar masses and their radii. But without knowing the radii, that's tough.

Wait, but the problem doesn't mention anything about the radius, so perhaps the ratio of H in the two stars is the same as the ratio of their masses? Hmm, but that's a big assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the mass ratio equals the H number density ratio.

Wait, but that might not be correct because the number of hydrogens depends on the star's overall composition. For example, a star with higher metallicity (more heavy elements) would have higher mass but same H number density as another star with same H content. Hmm, perhaps this is a dead end.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed such that the H number density in each star is the same as in the Sun, but that's probably not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem ignores the H variation and treats it as a constant, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, but what if I assume that the number of hydrogen atoms in each star is the same as in the Sun? That would make n_H1 =n_H_sun and n_H2=n_H_sun, which would simplify things. But that's probably incorrect, but perhaps the problem expects that.

If I make that assumption, then n_H1 =n_H2 =n_H_sun.

Then,

n_Si1 /n_Si2 = [n_Fe_sun /n_Mg_sun ] * 10^{0.6}.

Because (n_H1/n_H2) is 1.

Now, what's n_Fe_sun and n_Mg_sun in terms of n_H_sun?

From the Sun's data:

n_Fe_sun = (10^(-4.5)) * n_H_sun.

n_Mg_sun = (10^(-5)) *n_H_sun.

So,

n_Fe_sun /n_Mg_sun = (1e-4.5 ) / (1e-5 ) = 10^{0.5} ≈ 3.162.

So,

n_Si1/n_Si2 = 3.162 * 10^{0.6}.

Wait, 10^{0.6} is about 3.98, so 3.162 *3.98 ≈ 12.57.

Hmm, that's around 12.6, which is option B.

But wait, I made the assumption that n_H1 =n_H2. But that might not be correct. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem gives the mass of each star. Star_1 is 1.5 Msun, Star_2 is1.2 Msun. If we assume that the number of hydrogen atoms is proportional to the star's mass (since H is the main component), then n_H1 =1.5 *n_H_sun and n_H2=1.2 *n_H_sun. Because the Sun has 1 Msun, and if all the mass is H, then n_H would be proportional to mass. But stars have more H, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of H atoms is proportional to the star's mass. So,

n_H1 =1.5 * n_H_sun,

n_H2=1.2 *n_H_sun.

Then,

n_Si1/n_Si2 = [n_Fe_sun /n_Mg_sun ] * (n_H1 /n_H2 ) *10^{0.6}.

n_Fe_sun/n_Mg_sun =3.162 as before.

n_H1/n_H2 =1.5/1.2=5/4=1.25.

So,

n_Si1/n_Si2= 3.162 *1.25 *3.98 ≈ 3.162 *5. (approx).

Wait, 3.162 *5=15.81. Hmm, but none of the options are that high. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of H atoms isn't directly proportional to the mass. Perhaps it's better to ignore the H and proceed with the ratios.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's compute each star's [Si/H] and then find their ratio.

For Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1=0 → [Fe/H]=0.

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) +0.3.

But [Fe/H]_1=0 → log(n_Fe1/n_H1) = log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun).

So, n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1/n_H_sun).

So,

n_Si1 = n_Fe1 * 10^{0.3} * (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun).

But n_Si_sun can be expressed as (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H_sun.

Wait, perhaps it's better to find [Si/H] for each star.

For Star_1:

[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 → [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, [Fe/H]_1 is 0 → [Si/H]_1 =0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → [Mg/Si] =0.3 → log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) = log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) +0.3 → n_Mg2/n_Si2 = (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) *10^{0.3}.

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → [Mg/H] = log(n_Mg2/n_H2) - log(n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun) =0 → n_Mg2 =n_Mg_sun * (n_H2/n_H_sun).

So,

n_Si2 = (n_Mg2) / [ (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) *10^{0.3} ) ].

Which becomes:

n_Si2 = (n_Mg_sun * (n_H2/n_H_sun)) / [ (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) *10^{0.3} ) ]

Simplify:

n_Si2 = [n_Mg_sun * n_H2/n_H_sun * n_Si_sun ] / [n_Mg_sun * 10^{0.3} ]

Simplify more:

n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun * n_H2) / (n_H_sun * 10^{0.3} )

So,

[Si/H]_2 = log(n_Si2/n_H2) - log(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) 

= log( [ (n_Si_sun * n_H2)/(n_H_sun *1e0.3) ) ] / n_H2 )

= log( n_Si_sun/(n_H_sun *1e0.3) )

= log( (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) * 1e-0.3 )

= log(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) + log(1e-0.3 )

= [12 + log(n_Si_sun/n_H)]_sun ... wait, no, wait the Sun's [Si/H] is not given.

Wait, wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] is 7.5 when 12 is added, but no, wait the Sun's [X/H] is given as 12 + log(nX/nH) = value. So,

For the Sun:

12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 =-4.5 → nFe/nH=1e-4.5.

Similarly, for Mg:

12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)=7-12=-5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But what about Si? We don't have [Si/H]_sun. Hmm. Maybe I can find it from the problem.

Wait, but I don't think we have enough information. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong approach earlier. Let me think again.

The ratio we need is (n_Si1 / n_Si2). Let me express each in terms of n_H.

For Star_1:

n_Si1 = n_Fe1 *10^{0.3}.

But n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun *n_H1 ) /n_H_sun.

So,

n_Si1 = (n_Fe_sun *n_H1 /n_H_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

In the Sun,

n_Fe_sun =3.16e-5 *n_H_sun.

So,

n_Si1 = (3.16e-5 *n_H_sun *n_H1 /n_H_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Simplify,

n_Si1 =3.16e-5 *n_H1 *2 → because 10^{0.3} ≈2.

So,

n_Si1 =6.32e-5 *n_H1.

For Star_2:

We have [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → n_Mg2 =n_Si2 *10^{0.3}.

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg2 =n_Mg_sun * (n_H2 /n_H_sun).

n_Mg_sun=1e-5 *n_H_sun.

So,

n_Mg2 =1e-5 *n_H_sun * (n_H2 /n_H_sun) =1e-5 *n_H2.

But n_Mg2 =n_Si2 *10^{0.3} → n_Si2 =n_Mg2 /10^{0.3}.

Substitute n_Mg2:

n_Si2 = (1e-5 *n_H2 ) /10^{0.3}.

10^{0.3}=2, so,

n_Si2 = (1e-5 /2) *n_H2 ≈5e-6 *n_H2.

Now, the ratio (n_Si1 /n_Si2) = [6.32e-5 *n_H1 ] / [5e-6 *n_H2 ].

Simplify:

= (6.32e-5 /5e-6) * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

= (12.64) * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

Now, to find n_H1 /n_H2.

But how?

Hmm, stars' masses are given: Star_1 is 1.5 Msun, Star_2 is1.2 Msun.

Assuming that the number of hydrogen atoms is proportional to the mass (since H is the main component), then:

n_H1 =1.5 *n_H_sun,

n_H2=1.2 *n_H_sun.

So,

n_H1 /n_H2 =1.5/1.2 =5/4=1.25.

Thus,

(n_Si1/n_Si2)=12.64 *1.25 ≈15.8.

But none of the options are close to 15.8. The options are A) ~3.9, B) ~12.6, C) ~0.8, D) ~1.2.

Hmm, so maybe I made a wrong assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the number of H atoms isn't directly proportional to the mass.

Alternative approach: perhaps the number of hydrogen atoms is the same in both stars as in the Sun, so n_H1 =n_H2 =n_H_sun.

Then,

(n_Si1/n_Si2)=12.64 *1 =12.64 → which is option B.

So that's probably the intended answer. But why would n_H be the same? Because maybe the problem assumes that the photospheric hydrogen density is the same for both stars, perhaps because they have the same temperature and radius? Not sure, but since it's a multiple-choice question, and option B is 12.6, which matches the calculation when n_H1=n_H2, I think that's the intended approach.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the provided data for the Sun's photospheric composition.

   - [Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3 → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si1}}/n_{\text{Fe1}}) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{SiSun}}/n_{\text{FeSun}}) + 0.3 \).
   - [Fe/H]₁ = 0 → \( n_{\text{Fe1}}/n_{\text{H1}} = n_{\text{FeSun}}/n_{\text{HSun}} \).

2. **Star_2**:
   - Mass = 1.2 × Solar Mass.
   - [Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3 → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg2}}/n_{\text{Si2}}) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{MgSun}}/n_{\text{SiSun}}) + 0.3 \).
   - [Mg/H]₂ = 0 → \( n_{\text{Mg2}}/n_{\text{H2}} = n_{\text{MgSun}}/n_{\text{HSun}} \).

3. **Sun's Photospheric Composition**:
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{FeSun}}/n_{\text{HSun}}) = -4.5 \), so \( n_{\text{FeSun}}/n_{\text{HSun}} = 10^{-4.5} \).
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{MgSun}}/n_{\text{HSun}}) = -5 \), so \( n_{\text{MgSun}}/n_{\text{HSun}} = 10^{-5} \).

### Analysis:
#### For Star_1:
- From [Fe/H]₁ = 0, \( n_{\text{Fe1}} = n_{\text{FeSun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H1}}/n_{\text{HSun}}) \).
- From [Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3, \( n_{\text{Si1}} = n_{\text{Fe1}} \cdot 10^{0.3} = n_{\text{FeSun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H1}}/n_{\text{HSun}}) \cdot 10^{0.3} \).

#### For Star_2:
- From [Mg/H]₂ = 0, \( n_{\text{Mg2}} = n_{\text{MgSun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H2}}/n_{\text{HSun}}) \).
- From [Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3, \( n_{\text{Si2}} = n_{\text{Mg2}} / 10^{0.3} = n_{\text{MgSun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H2}}/n_{\text{HSun}}) / 10^{0.3} \).

#### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si1}}}{n_{\text{Si2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{FeSun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H1}}/n_{\text{HSun}}) \cdot 10^{0.3}}{n_{\text{MgSun}} \cdot (n_{\text{H2}}/n_{\text{HSun}}) / 10^{0.3}}.
\]

Simplify:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si1}}}{n_{\text{Si2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{FeSun}}}{n_{\text{MgSun}}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H1}}}{n_{\text{H2}}} \cdot 10^{0.6}.
\]

#### Substituting Known Values:
- \( n_{\text{FeSun}}/n_{\text{MgSun}} = (10^{-4.5}) / (10^{-5}) = 10^{0.5} \approx 3.162 \).
- \( 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \).

Assuming the hydrogen number density ratio \( n_{\text{H1}}/n_{\text{H2}} = 1 \) (i.e., the hydrogen density is the same in both stars), we get:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si1}}}{n_{\text{Si2}}} = 3.162 \cdot 3.98 \approx 12.6.
\]

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **12.6**.
