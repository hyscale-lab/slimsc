Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that a cyclotron is a type of particle accelerator. But wait, a synchrocyclotron is a special kind, right? Oh right, it's a cyclotron that uses a varying magnetic field to keep the particles in sync with the accelerating voltage. So the particles spiral outwards, increasing their radius over time because the magnetic field strength is changing.

The question says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is almost zero. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy of T1 = 950 MeV. The voltage applied is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. And the given data is Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV.

Wait, what's the question again? Oh right, how many revolutions does the proton make in the synchrocyclotron?

I think I need to find the number of times the proton goes around the circular path (revolutions) as it's accelerated. So each time it completes a half-cycle of the voltage, it gains some energy. But wait, in a cyclotron, the frequency of the electric field needs to match the natural frequency of the particles so that each time they cross the gap between the D-shaped boxes, they get a push.

But wait, in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field isn't constant. It's varying with time, which
