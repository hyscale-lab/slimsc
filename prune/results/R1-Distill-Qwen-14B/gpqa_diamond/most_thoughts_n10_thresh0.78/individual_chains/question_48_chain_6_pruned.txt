Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. Then it goes through a series of reactions. Let me list each step:

1. Cyclohexanone treated with bromine → product 1.
2. Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide → product 2.
3. Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine → product 3.
4. Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → product 4.

The question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)7.

Hmm. Let's go through each reaction.

First step: Cyclohexanone + Br2. Wait, cyclohexanone has a ketone group. When a ketone reacts with bromine, what happens? Oh, right! That's the haloform reaction. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the haloform reaction is when a methyl ketone reacts with X2 (like I2 or Br2) in basic conditions. But cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, not a methyl ketone. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, another possibility: bromine adds to the carbonyl group. But wait, cyclohexanone's carbonyl is in a ring. So perhaps it's an addition reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's an enolate formation. Wait, no, Br2 might do something else.

Wait, wait, another thought: cyclohexanone can undergo bromination via the enol mechanism. So, when cyclohexanone is treated with bromine (Br2), it would add across the carbonyl group. The mechanism would be: the carbonyl oxygen attacks Br2, leading to the formation of a bromohydrin. Wait, but wait, I think that's more when there's water present. Alternatively, in the presence of a base, it could form the enolate, which then reacts with bromine.

Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugate addition? No, I'm a bit confused. Or perhaps, it's a diaddition. Wait, cyclohexanone has a ketone group. Reaction with bromine (Br2) might involve the formation of a bromide via an enol intermediate. Or maybe it's a ring-opening, but the ring is six-membered, so it's probably not that.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is the dihydroxylation of the ring? No, wait, that's for alkenes. Wait, cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Hmm.

Oh wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the reaction conditions. Cyclohexanone plus bromine. Oh, wait, maybe it's the bromination of the carbonyl group. So, the ketone (C=O) reacts with Br2. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps it's the formation of a bromoalkane via the benzoin addition? No, that's for aldehydes in the presence of a strong base. Hmm.

Wait, another way: perhaps when a ketone like cyclohexanone reacts with bromine, it undergoes a substitution reaction. Wait, but ketones are usually not very reactive
