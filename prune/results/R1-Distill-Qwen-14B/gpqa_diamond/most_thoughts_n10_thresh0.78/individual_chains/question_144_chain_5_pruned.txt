Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance given the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each a very small distance in meters.

I remember that when a particle is produced, it doesn't last forever; it decays. The mean decay distance would be how far it travels before decaying. To find that, I think I need to calculate the particle's lifetime and then multiply by its velocity. But wait, how do I get the lifetime from the given parameters?

Oh right! The width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime τ through the uncertainty principle. The formula I recall is Γ ≈ ħ/τ, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Let me think about the units here.

The Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, I should make sure all the units are compatible. Γ is given in MeV, so I should convert that to GeV. Γ_X is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ. Plugging in the numbers: τ ≈ (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV. Let me calculate that. 6.582 divided by 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, no, wait. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.568. So τ ≈ 20.568e-25 seconds? Wait, no, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is 20.568e-25? Wait, no, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is the same as 6.582 / 0.32 times 1e-25. So 6.582 / 0.32
