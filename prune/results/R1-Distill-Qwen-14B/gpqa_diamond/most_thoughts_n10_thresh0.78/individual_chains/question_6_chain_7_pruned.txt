Okay, so I'm looking at this quantum mechanics problem, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to take it step by step. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, potentials can sometimes be separable into radial and angular parts, which would help in solving the problem.

First, I should probably write down the potential and see if it can be rewritten in a way that separates r and θ. Let me see: V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. I can factor out (1/2)k r² from both terms. Wait, let's see:

V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Wait, because 1/2 + 3/2 is 2, but no, wait, the first term is multiplied by 1, the second by 3. So, it's (1/2 kr²)(1) + (3/2 kr²)(cos²θ). So that's (1/2 kr²) [1 + 3 cos²θ]. So that's the same as (1/2 kr²)(1 + 3 cos²θ).

Wait, but perhaps I can express this in terms of other trigonometric functions to make it easier. I remember that cos²θ can be written using a double-angle identity. Cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² [1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2]. Let me compute the terms inside the brackets. 1 is 1, 3*(1/2) is 3/2, and 3*(cos2θ)/2 is (3/2)cos2θ. So adding 1 and 3/2 gives 5/2. So the whole thing becomes (1/2)k r² [5/2 + (3/2) cos2θ]. Wait, no, wait: 1 + 3*(1/2) is 1 + 1.5 = 2.5 or 5/2. And 3*(cos2θ)/2 is (3/2) cos2θ. So the brackets become 5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ.

So V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² * [5/2 + (3/2) cos2θ]. Hmm, maybe I can factor this further. Let's see, 5/2 is 2.5 and 3/2 is 1.5. Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as another form of potential that's easier to handle.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the potential can be considered as a sum of two terms. The first term is (1/2)k r², which is a harmonic oscillator in two dimensions. The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, but in two dimensions, it's possible that the potential can be expressed in terms of Cartesian coordinates, or perhaps in polar coordinates, but that might complicate things.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the energy spectrum, which suggests that the problem will separate into radial and angular parts. So perhaps each part of the potential contributes to the energy levels in their respective variables.

Alternatively, maybe I can rewrite the potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Let me think: in polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So, cosθ = x/r. So cos^2θ = x²/r². So the potential becomes V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² (x²/r²) )= (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x².

Wait, because (x²/r²) is cos²θ. So substituting in, the potential becomes V = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x². But r² is x² + y², so substituting that, V = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x². Let's simplify that:

V = (1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x². Adding the x² terms: (1/2 + 3/2)k x² = 2k x². So V = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Wait, that's interesting. So the potential in Cartesian coordinates is 2k x² + (1/2) k y². Oh, this looks like a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in each direction. Because in general, a 2D harmonic oscillator has potential V = (1/2) m ω_x² x² + (1/2) m ω_y² y². The energy levels are then E = (n_x + n_y + 1) ℏ ω, where ω depends on each direction.

Wait, but in this case, the potential is not symmetric. The x-direction has a coefficient of 2k, and the y-direction has 1/2 k. So let me find the effective frequencies for each direction.

For the x-direction: V_x = 2k x². Let's write it as (1/2) m ω_x² x². So 2k = (1/2) m ω_x² → ω_x² = (4k)/(m) → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, for the y-direction: V_y = (1/2)k y² → (1/2) m ω_y² y² = (1/2)k y² → ω_y² = (k)/(m) → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So the potential is a 2D harmonic oscillator with ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m) and ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

In such a case, the energy levels are E = (n_x + n_y + 1) (ℏ/2) (ω_x + ω_y) ?

Wait, no, wait. The energy levels for a 2D isotropic harmonic oscillator are E = (n_x + n_y + 2) ℏ ω, but in this case, the oscillator is not isotropic. So each direction contributes separately. So the energy should be E = n_x ℏ ω_x + n_y ℏ
