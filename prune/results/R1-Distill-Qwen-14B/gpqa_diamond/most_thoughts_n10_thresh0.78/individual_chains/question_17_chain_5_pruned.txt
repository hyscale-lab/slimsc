Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. 

Alright, the question says: What's the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, T is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex is probably the fully formed complex, like CaY²− where Y is the EDTA^4- after deprotonation. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. 

I think the problem involves finding the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in solution. Because EDTA complexes are known for their high stability, which means that most of the EDTA is bound to the metal, so the free ion concentration is really low. 

The formation constant K is given as 5e10. I remember that the formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA^2−. So, Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]).

But wait, in solution, the EDTA exists in different protonated forms. However, the problem states that the pH is ideal, which I think means that the pH is such that EDTA is predominantly in the Y^4− form (the deprotonated form). So we don't have to worry about the different protonation states of EDTA for this calculation. That simplifies things.

So, the total concentration of EDTA species is the sum of all forms, but since most is in the Y^4− form under ideal pH, the total EDTA (free) is approximately equal to [Y^4−]. But wait, in solution, the EDTA could be either free or bound as the Ca-EDTA complex. 

Wait, no. The solution contains the Ca-EDTA complex at 0.02 M. So, the total Ca is all in the complex, and the free Ca²+ is what we're trying to find.

Wait, another approach. The total concentration of EDTA in solution is the sum of free EDTA and the EDTA bound to Ca²+. So, [EDTA_total] = [Y^4−] + [CaY²−].

But wait, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But the total amount of EDTA would be 0.02 M multiplied by the stoichiometry. Since the complex is 1:1, the EDTA in the complex is 0.02 M. But wait, the free EDTA (Y^4−) is also present. So the total EDTA is 0.02 + [Y^4−], but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, no. Because the only source of EDTA in solution is the complex and the free EDTA. So, [EDTA_total] = [Y^4−] + [CaY²−]. But since the complex is 0.02 M, [CaY²−] is 0.02. So, [EDTA_total] = 0.02 + [Y^4−]. But I'm not sure if I know [EDTA_total], so maybe that's not the way to approach it.

Alternatively, let me think about the formation constant expression. Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²
