Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says the Hamiltonian operator is H = ε σ · n. Hmm, ε is a constant with energy dimensions, and n is an arbitrary unit vector. The σ are the Pauli spin matrices. I need to find the eigenvalues of H.

Wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices, right? And when you take their dot product with a vector, you're essentially doing a sum of each σ component multiplied by the corresponding component of the vector. So σ · n would be σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z.

But I'm not sure how to find the eigenvalues of such an operator. Eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(H - λI) = 0. But maybe there's a simpler way here because of the properties of Pauli matrices.

Wait, I think the Pauli matrices are traceless and have a trace of zero. Also, each Pauli matrix squared is the identity matrix multiplied by something. Oh right! For each σ_i, σ_i squared is the identity matrix times one. So σ_x^2 = σ_y^2 = σ_z^2 = I, where I is the 2x2 identity matrix.

Wait, but here we're dealing with a linear combination of Pauli matrices. So H is equal to ε times a vector of Pauli matrices dotted with a unit vector. So H = ε (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z).

I remember that any such combination can be thought of as a spin operator in a particular direction. For example, the usual spin-z component is (σ_z)/2, but wait, no. Let me think: the spin operator along a direction n is (ħ/2) σ · n. So σ · n would have eigenvalues ±1 when multiplied by ħ/2. 

Wait, but in this problem, H is ε times σ · n. So the eigenvalues would come from the eigenvalues of σ · n, multiplied by ε.

What are the eigenvalues of σ · n? Because σ · n is a 2x2 matrix. Well, the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so their linear combination with n (a real vector) is also Hermitian. The eigenvalues of any Hermitian matrix must be real.

In general, for a matrix like σ · n, the eigenvalues are ±1. Because, for example, σ_z has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Similarly, any σ · n would have eigenvalues ±1 because when you diagonalize it, the trace is zero (since n is a unit vector, and the coefficients are 1 each?), so the sum of eigenvalues is zero. So each eigenvalue must be +1 and -1.

Wait, let me think again. Suppose I have a matrix A = a σ_x + b σ_y + c σ_z, where a² + b² + c² =1. Then the eigenvalues of A would be ±1. Because, for example, if you have A = σ_x, eigenvalues are ±1. Similarly for σ_y and σ_z. So for any unit vector, the eigenvalues are ±1.

Wait, but in this problem, H is ε times that matrix. So if σ · n has eigenvalues ±1, then H, which is ε*(σ ·n), must have eigenvalues ε*(±1) = ±
