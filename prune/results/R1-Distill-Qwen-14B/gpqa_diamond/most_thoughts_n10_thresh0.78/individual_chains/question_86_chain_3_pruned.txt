Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct starting materials for two reactions. Let me try to understand what's going on.

The question says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents on unknown compounds, A and B. The products are both (4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one), but they have different configurations: one is R and the other is S. 

Wait, the products are enantiomers because their configurations are R and S. That probably means that the starting materials (A and B) are different in their stereochemistry, leading to different products upon reduction.

The reactions are:

A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one

B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one

Hmm, I remember that LiBH4 and BH3 are both reducing agents, especially for carbonyl groups. But wait, LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, I think BH3 is a weaker reducing agent and is often used in more controlled conditions, maybe with a catalyst like THF or something. Oh right, BH3 is typically used for ketone reductions, but wait, wait, LiBH4 is more powerful and can reduce more stubborn groups, maybe esters or amides, but in this case, the product is a cyclic ketone.

Wait, the product is a ketone. So the starting material must have been a carbonyl group that upon reduction forms the ketone. Or wait, no—if the product is tetrahydro pyranone, perhaps the starting material was a cyclic ester, like a lactone, and the reduction opens it up.

Wait, tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is a cyclic ketone. So, maybe the starting material was a γ-lactone, because when you reduce a lactone, you get a diol, or maybe an alcohol which could form a ring. Wait, but the product is a ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone itself, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a ketone with an adjacent ester group or something else.

Wait, another possibility: The starting material could be a cyclic ester (lactone), which upon reduction would open up. Wait, but LiBH4 usually reduces esters to alcohols. Let me think: an ester R-O-CO-O-R' would be reduced by LiBH4 to form a diol. Hmm, but the product is a ketone, so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a ketone with a neighboring carbonyl group. Oh, maybe the starting material is a cyclic diketone? But that
