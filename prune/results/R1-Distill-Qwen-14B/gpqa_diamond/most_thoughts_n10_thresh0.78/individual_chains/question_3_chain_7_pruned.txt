Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work it out.

Alright, the problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σ_z, the Pauli z-matrix. We need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σ_z +5σ_x. Oh wait, and the options are given, so I just need to compute the expectation value and match it.

First, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator and ψ is the state vector. So, in this case, the operator is 10σ_z +5σ_x. That means I'll have to find ⟨ψ| (10σ_z +5σ_x) |ψ⟩. 

Wait, I can break this into two parts. The expectation value of 10σ_z plus the expectation value of 5σ_x. Oh, because expectation values are linear, right? So, E[10σ_z +5σ_x] = 10 E[σ_z] +5 E[σ_x].

So, first, let me compute E[σ_z]. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σ_z, this should be straightforward. The eigenvalues of σ_z for |↑⟩ is +1 and for |↓⟩ is -1.

The state ψ is a linear combination: ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a=0.5 and b= sqrt(3)/2. Wait, let me check: 0.5 squared is 0.25 and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4. Adding them gives 1, so it's normalized. Good.
