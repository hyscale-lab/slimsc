Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the expectation value of a certain operator. Let me see what I remember from my studies. Hmm, the particle is a spin-half, so its spin states are up and down. The state given is a linear combination: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh wait, right, these are eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z matrix.

The operator is 10σz + 5σx. I need to find the expectation value of this operator. I think the expectation value is calculated as ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So I'll need to compute each part separately, maybe.

Breaking it down, O = 10σz + 5σx. So the expectation value would be 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩. So I can calculate ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ separately and then combine them.

First, let's find ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward. σz|↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩, and σz|↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩. The state ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So the expectation value for σz is |0.5|^2*(+1) + |sqrt(3)/2|^2*(-1). Let me compute that.

|0.5|^2 is 0.25, and |sqrt(3)/2|^2 is 3/4 = 0.75. So 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) equals 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Oh, so ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Wait, but wait, wait a second. No, wait, that's the expectation value of σz. So 10 times that would be 10*(-0.5) = -5. Hmm, but I'll hold on that until I get the σx part.

Now, σx is the Pauli x matrix. Its eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. But for σx, the expectation value might be a bit more involved. Let me think. The operator σx can be written in terms of the spin states.

I remember that σx = |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|. So when I calculate ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, it's going to involve cross terms.

Let's compute it step by step. The state ψ is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2) when written in the basis |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Wait, actually, the coefficients are a = 0.5 and b = sqrt(3)/2. So ψ is a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩.

So ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is (a*⟨↑| + b*⟨↓|) σx (a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩). 

Expanding σx, which is |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|, the product would be:

a* a ⟨↑|↑⟩⟨↓|↑⟩ + a* b ⟨↑|↓|↓⟩ + b* a ⟨↓|
