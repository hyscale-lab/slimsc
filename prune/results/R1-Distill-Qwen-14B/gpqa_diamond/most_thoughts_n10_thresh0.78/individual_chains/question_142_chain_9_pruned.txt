Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or in a statistical mixture. The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I think I need to figure out where this density matrix sits in the qubit space.

Wait, qubit space... Oh right, each qubit can be represented as a vector in a 2-dimensional complex Hilbert space. But when we talk about their geometrical position, maybe we're referring to the Bloch sphere representation. Oh yeah, the Bloch sphere is a geometrical way to represent qubit states, especially pure states. But wait, ρ here is a density matrix, which could represent a mixed state.

Wait, let me think. For a pure state |ψ⟩, the density matrix is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. In this case, ρ is given as an average of |0⟩ and |1⟩. So ρ = (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Hmm, that's a mixed state because it's a statistical mixture of two orthogonal pure states.

So, the density matrix is a mixed state of |0⟩ and |1⟩, each with equal probability. How does this translate to the Bloch sphere? The Bloch sphere for a qubit has axes along |0⟩ and |1⟩. The pure states |0⟩ and |1⟩ are at the poles of the sphere—|0⟩ at (0,0,1) and |1⟩ at (0,0,-1), if I'm not mistaken. But since ρ is a mixture, maybe it's the average of these two points.

Wait, the density matrix for a mixed state of |0⟩ and |1⟩ with equal weights would be ρ = ½ I, where I is the identity matrix. Because |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| is the identity matrix for 2x2. So ρ = (I)/2. 

Now, the Bloch vector representation. A general density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The density matrix can be expressed as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector and σ are the Pauli matrices. So if ρ is (I)/2, then (I)/2 = (I + r·σ)/2. Subtracting, I/2 - (I + r·σ)/2 = 0 => -r·σ/2 = 0. That implies r must be zero vector.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That would be the origin. Which option corresponds to that? Let me look at the options. Option C is (0,0,0), so that must be the answer.

Wait, but I should double-check. The Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubits where pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. If the density matrix is a completely mixed state (like this
