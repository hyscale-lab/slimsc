Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone with a six-membered ring. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone group (O) attached.

The first reaction is cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2), forming product 1. Bromine usually adds to double bonds in alkenes, but wait, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group, not a double bond. Oh wait, wait! I think I might be mixing things up. Adding bromine to a ketone... Maybe it's a different kind of addition. Oh right, ketones can undergo a haloform reaction, but wait, that's when you have multiple alpha carbons. Wait, cyclohexanone has only one alpha carbon (the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl). So the haloform reaction isn't possible here because that requires at least two alpha carbons. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's some kind of addition to the carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: when ketones react with bromine, sometimes there's a possibility of some kind of bromination. Oh wait, maybe it's a conjugate addition? Or perhaps it's an enolate formation. Wait, but cyclohexanone's enolate would form under basic conditions, but in this case, the reaction is just with bromine, which is a dienophile perhaps?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. Cyclohexanone with Br2. Oh, wait! The carbonyl group can undergo a bromination if there's an alpha hydrogen. So the bromine would add to the carbonyl carbon, but wait, that's not right. Wait, no, that's for the haloform reaction, which requires more than one alpha carbon. Alternatively, maybe it's a Michael addition, but I don't think that's applicable here.

Wait, another thought: Maybe it's a dihydroxylation? No, that's with something like OsO4. Alternatively, maybe bromine is adding as a dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction, but cyclohexanone doesn't have a conjugated diene. Hmm. Maybe I'm wrong about the first step. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the ketone undergoes an addition of bromine via a cyclic bromonium intermediate. So perhaps the carbonyl oxygen acts as a nucleophile, attacking bromine? Or maybe the Br2 adds across the carbonyl group, but that's not typical. Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a bromination via some kind of peroxide effect, but that's usually for alkenes.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the reactions. Another approach: Let me think about adding bromine to a cyclic ketone. Wait, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group, which is a good site for electrophilic addition. So maybe the Br2 adds to the carbonyl, but that would require the formation of a bromide. Wait, but wait, adding bromine to a carbonyl group would form a geminal dibromide? No, wait, that's when you have two bromines adding to the same carbon, but that's typically for aldehydes and ketones under certain conditions. But wait, cyclohexanone's reaction with excess HBr would lead to the formation of a geminal dibromide. But in this case, it's just Br2, so maybe it's adding across the carbonyl. Hmm, maybe it's an example of the addition of bromine to a ketone to form a bromohydrin. Wait, no, bromohydrin is when you have a Br and an OH added across the double bond. But again, cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look up the reaction of ketones with bromine. Oh, wait, I think I remember that ketones can react with bromine in a process called the Baeyer reaction, which is a kind of electrophilic substitution. But wait, Baeyer reaction is for aromatic compounds,
