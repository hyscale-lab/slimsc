Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about a particle of mass m moving in two dimensions. The potential is given as V(r,θ) = (1/2) k r² + (3/2) k r² cos²(θ). We need to find the energy spectrum, and there are four options to choose from.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, especially for two-dimensional potentials, it's helpful to switch to polar coordinates. Oh wait, right, because the potential here is given in terms of r and theta, so polar coordinates make sense.

So the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me break this down. The first term is (1/2)k r², which is like a harmonic oscillator potential in two dimensions. The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, I'm trying to think what kind of potential that is. Oh wait, in polar coordinates, cos²θ can be expressed using a double-angle formula. Cos²θ is (1 + cos(2θ))/2. So maybe this can be rewritten somehow.

Wait, let me write V(r,θ) again: (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me factor out (1/2) k r² from both terms. So that's (1/2) k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Oh, but that might not directly help. Alternatively, let me express the second term using the identity cos²θ = (1 + cos(2θ))/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * [ (1 + cos(2θ)) / 2 ]

Let me compute that. The first term is (1/2)k r². The second term becomes (3/4) k
