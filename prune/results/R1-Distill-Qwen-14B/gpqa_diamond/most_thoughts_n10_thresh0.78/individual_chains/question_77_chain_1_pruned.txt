Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement and another reaction. Hmm. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question has two parts: reaction A and reaction B. The first part is about BuLi and H+ producing compound A from a starting material, and the second part is a Cope rearrangement upon heating to give compound B. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving A and B products.

Let's start with reaction A. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let me draw that structure. So, benzene ring attached to a methylene group (CH2), which is connected to an oxygen (O), and then another butenyl group. Wait, the butenyl is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. So that's a four-carbon chain. The double bond is between C2 and C3, and a methyl is on C3.

So the structure is benzene-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, the but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait. Let me count: 1-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-. But but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2-CH2. Wait, the substituents: 1 is the starting point. So 1, 2, 3, 4. The double bond is between 2 and 3. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2 with the double bond between 2 and 3. Wait, no. Wait, but for but-2-en-1-yl: position 1 is the point of attachment. So the group is CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, but that would be four carbons. Wait, but it's but-
