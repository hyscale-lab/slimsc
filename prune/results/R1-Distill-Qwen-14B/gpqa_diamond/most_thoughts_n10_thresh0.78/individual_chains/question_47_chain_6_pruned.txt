Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. The question is about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data. The compound has the molecular formula C9H11NO2. Hmm, let's see what I can figure out.

First, the IR data. The strong bands in IR are around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are usually indicative of N-H stretches. Since there are two bands, maybe it's an amide because amides typically show two N-H stretches due to the amide group. Alternatively, it could be an amine with more than one N-H, like a secondary amine, but I'm not sure yet. Then there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, the compound likely has an amide or ester group because those have carbonyl groups. Amides have lower wavenumbers than esters, but wait, 1720 is more on the ester or maybe a ketone side. Or perhaps an amide is possible if it's around 1680, but this is 1720, which is higher. Hmm, maybe it's an ester then.

Looking at the 1H NMR data. Let's break it down:

- 1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H. That's probably a CH2CH3 group. The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2. So maybe an ethyl group attached to something else, like an oxygen in an ester.

- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Broad singlet around 4 ppm... Could be an N-H group? Or maybe an ether or some type of adjacent protons. Wait, but if it's a broad peak, maybe it's an amide proton. Or perhaps it's an OCH2 group. But the fact that it's 2H and broad makes me think of either amide N-H or possibly an ethylene group, but I'm not sure.

- 4.5 ppm, quartet (q), 2H. Quartet with 2H. A quartet usually comes from coupling with a CH2. So, maybe this is an OCH2CH2 group, but wait, what's next to it? If it's at 4.5, it's probably an oxygen adjacent group. Like an ethyl ester's OCH2CH3? Wait, but the 1.20 ppm triplet is likely the CH3 of an ethyl group. So maybe the quartet is from the CH2 next to an oxygen. Let me think, in an ester like ethyl something, the OCH2CH3 would split into a quartet for the OCH2. So the 4.5 q (2H) could be the OCH2 from an ethyl ester.

Wait, but looking at the integration, the 4.5 quartet is 2H, so that's the CH2 in the ethyl ester. The triplet at 1.20 is the CH3 of the ethyl group, so that makes sense. So if the compound is an ethyl ester, that would fit.

Then, looking at the aromatic region:

- 7.0 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. 

- 8.0 ppm, doublet (d), 2H.

So that suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. The doublets indicate coupling between adjacent protons. So maybe two substituents on the benzene ring in the para positions. Each substituent has two protons adjacent, so the doublets would make sense. Wait, but if it's para substitution, each set of protons would couple with each other. So each doublet is two protons. So perhaps each substituent is a group that takes two protons. Wait, no, each substituent is a single group. Wait, no, the substituents could be groups that each take two protons, like a methylene group attached, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, the substituents could be meta to each other? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe each substituent is a group that deshields the protons, like an electron-withdrawing group. Wait, but the 7.0 and 8.0 ppm doublets, each integrating to 2H, makes me think of a para-substituted ring where each substituent is a group that causes the adjacent protons to resonate in those regions.

Putting this together, perhaps the molecule has a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions. One substituent is an ester group (like OCH2CH3), and the other might be an amide or something else.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H1
