Okay, so I've got this question about pericyclic reactions, specifically sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through each part step by step.

The question has three reactions, and each produces a product A, B, or C. I need to match the options given.

Starting with the first reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol in the presence of H+ and heat to give product A.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine... so that's like (CH3O)2CH-NH2. And but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CHCH2OH, but wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2OH? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4 if it's but-3-en-2-ol? Wait no, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2? No, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2OH? Wait, no. Butenol. Let me draw it. The structure of but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 in a four-carbon chain. So, for but-3-en-2-ol, the OH is on carbon 2, and the double bond is between 3 and 4. So structure is CH2(OH)CH2CH2CH2? No, that can't be right. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait, position 3 in but-3-en-2-ol would be the third carbon in a four-carbon chain, so perhaps it's CH2=CHCH2OH? Wait, but that's but-2-en-3-ol. Hmm, maybe I got the numbering wrong. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2 with double bond starting at C3. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2-OH. No, wait, but that's but-1-en-3-ol. I think I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should move on and come back.

The reaction conditions are H+ and heat, which suggests an acid-catalyzed rearrangement. And the reaction is a sigmatropic rearrangement, so perhaps a Cope or Claisen rearrangement, but I'm not sure. Wait, the starting material is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. So that's (CH3O)2CH-NH2. So when it reacts with but-3-en-2-ol,
