Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The problem describes an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity, and the center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Then, they put a small positive charge +q somewhere inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the center of the cavity is l. Both L and l are greater than R, so P is definitely outside. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options given are A to D, each with a different formula involving these variables.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with charges inside cavities in conductors, the conductor's charges redistribute themselves in a certain way. Since the conductor is uncharged initially, but now has a charge inside the cavity, how does that affect the conductor itself?

Wait, right. When a charge is placed inside the cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface will develop an induced charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. So the inner surface would have -q. But wait, the conductor itself is neutral, so the outer surface must have +q to balance it out. Because the total charge of the conductor is zero, the inner surface has -q and the outer surface has +q.

But wait, no, wait. The conductor was initially uncharged. The charge +q is inside the cavity. So the inner surface of the conductor would have an induced charge of -q to cancel the electric field inside the conductor material. Then, the outer surface would have +q because the total charge of the conductor remains zero (initially neutral, so the outer surface must have +q to make the total charge zero? Wait, no. Because the conductor is neutral, the total charge inside it (from cavity) is +q. So the conductor must have a total charge of -q on the inner surface and +q on the outer surface? Wait, that can't be because the conductor's total charge is zero. Wait, I'm
