Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to figure out which one has the highest density. Let me think about what I remember from my classes.

The question gives four options, a to d, each describing a planet with certain characteristics. I remember that density is calculated as mass divided by volume, right? So density = mass/volume. And volume for a sphere is (4/3)πr³. Oh wait, so if two planets have the same radius, the one with more mass will have higher density. But if their masses and radii are different, it's not so straightforward.

Let's go through each option one by one.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So, Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³. I think that's the average for Earth. So this planet has the same as Earth's density.

Option b: 2 Earth masses, density about 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but the density here is given. If it's the same as Earth's, but more mass, does that mean the radius is larger? Because density is mass over volume. If mass doubles and density stays the same, volume must also double. Since volume depends on radius cubed, so maybe the radius increases by cube root of 2, which is about 1.26 times Earth's radius. So this planet's density is the same as Earth's, so same as option a.

Option c: Same composition as Earth but 5 times the mass. Hmm, composition affects density. If it's same composition, it should have similar density as Earth. Wait, but wait. Density might not change if mass and radius scale similarly. Let me think: Earth's density is mass/volume. If the planet is 5x more massive, but radius increases as well. How?

If the composition is same, then the density should stay the same. Because density is a function of composition. For example, if you have a larger Earth-like planet, if it's made of same materials, it would have same density. So in this case, the density would be same as Earth's. So option c would have density same as a and b. So same as 5.5 g/cm³.

Option d: Same composition as Earth but half the mass. Again, same composition implies same density. So same as Earth, 5.5
