Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about. The problem says that a particle of mass m is moving in two dimensions under a potential V(r, θ) which depends on both r and θ. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. The question is asking for the energy spectrum, and there are four options provided.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, when dealing with potentials that depend on the position, especially in two dimensions, it's helpful to separate the variables and see if the problem can be broken down into simpler parts. But wait, this potential seems to involve both r and θ. Let me think about the form of the potential.

The potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. I can factor out kr² to see it as V(r,θ) = kr² [1/2 + (3/2)cos²θ]. That might help. Alternatively, perhaps I can rewrite it as V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ.

Wait, I recall that in polar coordinates, sometimes it's useful to separate the radial and angular parts. But in this case, the potential depends on r² and cos²θ, which suggests that it's not spherically symmetric but depends on the angle. So maybe the problem can be treated using cylindrical coordinates or by considering angular momentum?

Wait, another thought: maybe this potential can be rewritten in a way that separates the r and θ parts. Let me try that. Let me see: the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Let's factor out kr²/2: V = (kr²/2)(1 + 3 cos²θ). Hmm, but that doesn't directly separate r and θ. Alternatively, perhaps we can think of the cosine squared term in terms of a trigon
