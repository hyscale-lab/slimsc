Okay, so I've got this metric given here, and I need to find the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in general relativity, the area of a sphere is calculated using the metric tensor. The metric provided is:

ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²)

Wait, that looks a bit unusual. I'm more familiar with metrics in terms of differentials like dr and dθ, but maybe this is in a coordinate system where x and y are the variables. Hmm, perhaps it's a 2-dimensional metric embedded in some way.

Wait, a pseudosphere—oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But in general relativity, when dealing with areas, I think I need to look at the line element and then figure out the area integral.

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. I think radius in this context might be related to the curvature. For a pseudosphere, the Gaussian curvature is negative, usually expressed as K = -1/(r^2), where r is the radius of curvature. So if r is 2, then K = -1/4.

But how does that relate to the metric given here? Let me look at the metric again. The line element is ds² = (32)/(4−x²−y²) (dx² + dy²). So this seems to be in 2D, since it's only dx and dy. Maybe it's a metric in
