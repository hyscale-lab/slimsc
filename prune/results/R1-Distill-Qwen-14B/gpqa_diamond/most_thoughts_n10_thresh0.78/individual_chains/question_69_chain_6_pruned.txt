Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with particle physics yet. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem is about a decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. The particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and the proper lifetime is given as τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. The question is asking about the minimum resolution needed in the chamber to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Hmm, I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime as measured in a lab frame is longer than their proper lifetime due to time dilation. The formula for the dilated lifetime is τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. The Lorentz factor is calculated using the velocity of the particle, which is related to its energy and mass.

Wait, the energy provided is 27 GeV. So the total energy E is 27 GeV. The rest mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. I think the Lorentz factor γ can be found using E = γ * m₀ * c². Oh wait, but since units are in GeV, perhaps I can just calculate γ as E/(m₀), because the c² would be accounted for in the units. So γ = E / m₀. Let me compute that.

E is 27 GeV, m₀ is 3.41 GeV. So γ = 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that: 27 divided by 3.41. Let me see, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, subtract that from 27, gives 3.13. 3.41 * 0.9 is about 3.069. So 7.9 would be around 27. So maybe around 7.9 or so. Let me compute it more accurately: 3.41 × 7 = 23.87. 27 - 23.87 = 3.13. 3.13 /3.41 is approximately 0.917. So total γ is about 7.917.

So γ is approximately 7.917. Then, the lab frame lifetime τ = γ * τ₀. τ₀ is 8e-16 s. So τ = 7.917 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that. 7.917 *8 is about 63.336. So τ is 63.336e-16 s, which is 6.3336e-15 seconds.

But wait, wait. The question is about the minimum resolution needed. Hmm, I think I need to find the minimum distance the decay products travel so that the chamber can detect them. The resolution is about the smallest distance the detector can distinguish. So the particles will travel a certain distance before decaying, and the detector must have a resolution (a precision) that can capture that. So the minimum detection distance is when the probability of decay is at least 30%, I think.

The proper lifetime is τ₀, and the lab frame lifetime is γτ₀. The mean decay length is c * τ. Wait, but the decay length L is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. The decay follows an exponential distribution, so the probability that a particle decays within a certain length is 1 - exp(-L/(cτ)).

Wait, right, the decay probability P is 1 - exp(-L/(cτ)). Because for a decay length L, the probability that the particle has decayed before traveling L is given by that equation.

We want at least 30% of
