Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, it's like a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl (C=O) stretch around 1700-1750 cm^-1. So, there's an ester functional group present.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: six signals. Two aromatic-H signals. Wait, benzene rings typically have symmetry, so maybe the substituents are in positions that cause the aromatic protons to split into two sets. For a di-substituted benzene, if the substituents are para, then there are two equivalent sets of H. Or if they are ortho, maybe more splitting, but maybe the substituents are such that there are two sets. Or perhaps the substituents are different, leading to different environments. But wait, in the NMR, there are two aromatic-H signals. So maybe each set has two or more Hs.

Then, two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are like those attached to a double bond, maybe in an ester group or another substituent. Oh wait, the ester group structure is O-C-O, but the carbonyl is between the two oxygens. The vinyl Hs might be part of a substituent attached to the benzene ring.

Also, two signals for –CH3 groups. So maybe two different methyl groups. No signals for –CH2 groups, so no methylene groups in the molecule. So, the structure doesn't have any CH2 groups.

Putting this together, the molecule has an ester group and other substituents. Let me think about what substituents would fit.

Esters can be part of a substituent. For example, an ester group could be attached as a substituent on the benzene ring. So, the structure might be something like an aryl ester or perhaps a vinyl ester.

Wait, another possibility: the ester could be part of a substituent like an acetyl group, but that's a ketone, not an ester. No, wait, an ester is O-C-O connected to two different R groups.

Wait, let's think about the substituents. The aromatic ring is di-substituted. One substituent is an ester group, maybe. Let me think about the structure. Perhaps the substituents are an ester and another group.

Let's think about the NMR. Two aromatic H signals. So maybe the ring has two substituents that are para to each other, leading to two sets of equivalent aromatic protons. For example, if the substituents are in para positions, then each substituent is attached to the ring in such a way that the remaining Hs are in two equivalent sets.

Wait, but wait, if the substituents are para, the benzene would have two sets
