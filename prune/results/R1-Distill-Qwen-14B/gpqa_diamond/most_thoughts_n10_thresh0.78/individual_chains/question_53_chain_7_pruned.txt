Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that I prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows an ester group, so that tells me there's an ester functional group present. Esters typically have a carbonyl group (C=O) and an OR group. The O in the carbonyl and the OR would come from the ester, so the formula will have O2, which matches the options given.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: there are six signals. Let's break down the signals. The aromatic-H part: two signals. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring (6-membered aromatic ring), the substituents probably are in a certain position. For example, para-substituted would give two equivalent aromatic protons, but wait, that's for a single substituent. Wait, no, di-substituted. Let me think about that. Di-substituted benzene rings can be ortho, meta, or para. But wait, the substituents could be identical or different. The NMR shows two aromatic signals, each with a certain integration.

Wait, the aromatic region has two signals. So maybe the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. For example, in para substitution, if there's an ester group in the para position, but wait, it's di-substituted so maybe the substituents are such that the ring has two types of aromatic Hs. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the substituents are ortho to each other, but that might cause more complex splitting. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are a vinyl group and another group. Wait, the NMR says there are two vinyl-H signals. Oh wait no, the NMR says two signals corresponding to vinyl-H, and one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm, maybe the substituents include a vinyl group.

Wait, the NMR breakdown: two aromatic-H signals, two vinyl-H signals (doublet and doublet of quartets), and two –CH3 groups. No –CH2 groups. So the molecule doesn't have any methylene (CH2) groups.

Let me think about the structure. The aromatic ring is six-membered, so maybe it's a benzene ring with substituents. The ester is one of those substituents. The other substituent could be a vinyl group or maybe a group with methyl groups.

Wait, the NMR shows two –CH3 signals. So two different methyl groups. So perhaps a substituent that includes two methyl groups, like an ester with a methyl ester group and another substituent with a methyl group.

Wait, but the ester group is O-CO-O-R, but wait, esters are usually O-CO-O-R, but in an aromatic substitution, the ester would be attached as a substituent. So perhaps one substituent is an ester group (e.g., O-CO-O-R or R-O-CO-O-R?), no, wait, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So if the substituent is an ester, then maybe it's O-CO-O-R, but that's not standard. Wait, more accurately, the ester
