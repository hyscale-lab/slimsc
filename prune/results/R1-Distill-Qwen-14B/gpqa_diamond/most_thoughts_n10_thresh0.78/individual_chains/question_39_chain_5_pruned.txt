Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. Each particle can move along the x-axis in a tube. The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, and when they measured the position, the particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. So that must mean the wave function is zero outside this region, right?

Wait, but the wave function they provided is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. That seems a bit odd. Normally, wave functions are complex, but the real and imaginary parts should be considered together. Oh wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me think again. The wave function is typically written as a sum of real and imaginary parts, but in this case, it's given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. So the real part is (a / sqrt(1 +x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the imaginary part shouldn't be a constant,
