Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully and think about each step.

The question involves two reactions, and then analyzing the products using HPLC. The chemist uses both normal-phase and chiral HPLC columns. I need to figure out how many peaks each will show.

First, let me break down each reaction.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually used to reduce carbonyl groups. Hexan-3-one has a ketone at position 3. So, when reduced, the ketone becomes an alcohol. But wait, wait. Wait, the structure is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So hexan-3-one would be CH2CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3, but the 5th carbon has a methoxy group.

Wait, let me draw the structure. Hexan-3-one is like:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2CH2(C=O)CH2CH2CH3. But in this case, the 5th carbon (the second carbon from the end) has a methoxy group. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let me count. Hexan-3-one means the ketone is on C3. So positions are:

1 2 3 4 5 6

So C3 is the ketone. So structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-OCH3? Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one is:

CH3CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Let me think again. Hexan-3-one would be CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, maybe better to write it as:

The molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.

So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3

Wait, no. Let me think again. Hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(=
