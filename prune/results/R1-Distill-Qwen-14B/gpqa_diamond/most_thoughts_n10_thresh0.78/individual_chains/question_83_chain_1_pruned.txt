Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because titration calculations can get a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, I remember that pH calculations involve the dissociation of acids and bases, and titration points can change the situation a lot.

Alright, let me break down the problem. We have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20.00 cm³ of water. So first, I think I should find out the new concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Because when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes.

So initially, the moles of acetic acid are Molarity × Volume. Wait, volume should be in liters. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then, when we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is moles / total volume. That's 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Oh wait, no, wait: 0.001 / 0.04 is 0.025 M? Let me double-check. 0.001 divided by 0.04 equals 0.025. Yup, that's right.

So now, the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M. Next, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Let me think about each part separately.

First, the equivalence point. At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will be equal to the moles of acetic acid present. So I need to calculate how much NaOH is needed.

Wait, the moles of acetic acid we have is 0.001 moles (from the initial 0.05
