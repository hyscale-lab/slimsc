Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which mutant would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar. The question says that the gene responsible has five exons and four introns. The problem is that the compound is making it unusable for food, so I need to find a mutation that stops the synthesis of this compound. 

Looking at the sequencing results, all the mutants have changes in the first exon. So the mutations are in the exons, which are the coding regions, meaning they could affect the protein structure. 

The wild-type gene sequence is provided, and each mutant has a different alteration. I think I need to look for a mutation that would disrupt the gene's function. Usually, this could be a nonsense mutation (creates a premature stop codon) or a frameshift mutation, which changes the reading frame and leads to a completely different protein from the mutation point onwards. Alternatively, a missense mutation might change an amino acid, but if it's critical, it could disrupt function.

Let me look at the sequences step by step.

First, the wild-type sequence starts with 5’-ATG TTT CTG C TGG TAC TT... etc. So the first part is ATG, which is the start codon, methionine. Let's break down each mutant.

Mutant 1:
The change is in the area of the first exon. Let's compare. The wild-type first part is ATGTTTCTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA TTT ATT GTC GTC… 

Mutant 1 has ATGTTCTAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA TTT ATT GTC GCG… 

Wait, let me line them up:

WT: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA TTT ATT GTC GTC… 

Mutant1: ATG TTT CT A CG ... Hmm, maybe I should look for the exact spot where the change occurs. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the exact nucleotide differences.

Wait, perhaps I should compare each mutant's sequence with the wild-type to see where the changes are.

Looking at the mutant 1 sequence: 

Starts the same as WT, ATG, then the next triplet is TTT in WT, but in mutant 1, it's TTA. Wait no, let me count letters. Let's see:

Wild-type: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT… 

Mutant 1: ...TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC… 

Wait, perhaps the difference is in the third nucleotide. Let's see:

Looking at the third position after the start. Wait, perhaps it's better to compare the sequences.

Wild-type: positions 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…
