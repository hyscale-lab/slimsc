Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of isomers and tautomerism. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question talks about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. I remember that constitutional isomers have different connectivity of atoms, while stereoisomers are about the spatial arrangement. But wait, the problem is about tautomerism and optical isomerism, which I think are related to different types of isomerism.

The first part, question A, is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism. The options given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I'm a bit fuzzy on tautomerism. So what's tautomerism again? Oh right, it's when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair between two adjacent atoms, leading to different structures. For example, keto-enol tautomerism in ketones and aldehydes.

Benzoquinone, I think, is a quinone. Quinones are cyclic di-ketones. So they have two carbonyl groups. Wait, but do they have any hydrogens alpha to the carbonyl? Because for tautomerism to occur, you need those alpha hydrogens. Let me visualize benzoquinone. It's a benzene ring with two ketone groups, I think in the para positions. So the structure is O=C6H4-C=O. So each ketone is in the 1 and 4 positions of benzene. Now, the carbons next to the carbonyl groups (the alpha carbons) are the ones attached to the benzene. But wait, in benzoquinone, the carbonyl carbons are directly attached to the benzene, so the alpha carbons are part of the aromatic ring. But aromatic rings are deprotonated and don't have hydrogens in positions that can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. So benzoquinone probably doesn't have any alpha hydrogens, right? Because the alpha positions are part of the aromatic ring and don't have H's attached. So it can't undergo tautomerism. Hmm, but wait, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups, right? So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1,3,5. Each of these carbonyl groups is connected to a CH2 group on either side. Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is O=C-C-O-C-C-O, but arranged in a ring. No, wait, more accurately, it's a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at every other carbon. So each carbonyl is at positions 1, 3, and 5. So each carbonyl group is adjacent to two CH2 groups? Or maybe each is between CH2 groups. Let me sketch it mentally: positions 1,3,5 are carbonyls, and positions 2,4,6 are CH2. So each carbonyl is attached to two CH2 groups. So in that case, the carbonyl carbons are adjacent to CH2, which have alpha hydrogens. So each carbonyl group is flanked by two CH2 groups, each with H's. So in such a molecule, each of those CH2 groups has H's on the alpha position. So for each carbonyl, there are two alpha H's. So the molecule can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Because each ketone can lose a proton, form an enol, which would shift between the carbonyl groups.

Wait, but wait. Tautomerism in a compound with multiple carbonyl groups would require that the enol form can tautomerize between different carbonyl groups. Let me think. For instance, in a diketone like 1,3-cyclohexanedione, can it undergo tautomerism? I believe so. Because the enol formed at one carbonyl can tautomerize to another. So in this case, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have multiple positions where tautomerism can occur. So it can show tautomerism.

So if the question is which does not show tautomerism, A would be the one that doesn't have alpha hydrogens. Benzoquinone, because the carbonyls are directly attached to the benzene ring, which doesn't have alpha hydrogens available for tautomerism. So the compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone.

Wait, but wait again. I'm a bit confused. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups. The structure is O=C6H4-C=O. So the carbonyl groups are at positions 1 and 4. The carbons next to these (positions 2 and 6, I think) are CH groups. Wait, no. In benzene, each carbon is attached to one substituent. So in benzoquinone, each of the two carbonyl groups is attached to the benzene ring at positions 1 and 4. So those carbonyls are connected to the two benzene carbons. So the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl (the ones attached to the benzene) are actually the ring carbons, which are sp² hybridized. So, those carbons are part of the aromatic ring and are each connected to one hydrogen? Or maybe not.

Wait, the structure of para-benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups opposite each other. So each ketone is at position 1 and 4. The adjacent carbons (like 2 and 6 for the first ketone) are part of the benzene ring. So each of those adjacent carbons is bonded to two other carbons in the ring, a hydrogen, and the ketone oxygen. No, wait, no. Each carbon in the benzene ring is bonded to two other carbons, a hydrogen, and either a substituent (like the O) or another. Wait, in the case of the quinone, the substituents are the two carbonyl groups. So for positions 1 and 4, the carbons have a carbonyl group. The adjacent carbons (2 and 6 for position 1) are each connected to one substituent (the carbonyl) and two ring carbons and a hydrogen. So those adjacent carbons (positions 2,3,5,6) are CH groups. So each of those has a hydrogen attached. But wait, in that case, could the alpha position have a hydrogen? Wait, the alpha position to the carbonyl is the carbon adjacent, which is the ring carbon.

But in this case, those ring carbons are sp² hybridized, so the hydrogens are in the plane. Are they acidic enough to lose a proton and form an enol? Hmm. The alpha hydrogens are adjacent to the carbonyl, so they can be deprotonated. In such cases, tautomerism (keto-enol) is possible. But wait, benzoquinone has two ketone groups opposite each other. So perhaps when a hydrogen is removed from position 2, it forms an enol which connects to the other ketone. Wait, but if only one hydrogen is removed, maybe it can form an enol between the two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of another approach. Do quinones typically show tautomerism? I think I've heard that quinones can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. For example, in para-benzoquinone, the enol form would have conjugated double bonds. But wait, since the molecule is already a conjugated diketone, perhaps the tautomerism isn't possible because there's no H in the right place. Or perhaps it can't tautomerize because the positions are all conjugated, so any enol form would be less stable. Or maybe in this case, the alpha hydrogens are too acidic and the tautomerism is possible.

Alternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't undergo tautomerism. Wait, earlier I thought it could. Because each carbonyl is adjacent to CH2 groups which have alpha hydrogens. So if that's the case, then cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism.

So, going back, the question is which of the two compounds doesn't show tautomerism. If benzoquinone doesn't have any alpha hydrogens, then it can't. But wait, earlier I thought it does have alpha hydrogens. Hmm. Maybe I'm wrong about that.

Wait, another approach: in which compounds can keto-enol tautomerism occur? It requires that there's a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl group. So in a ketone, the adjacent carbon (alpha) must have a hydrogen. So if the alpha carbon is part of an aromatic ring, which is sp² hybridized, and has a hydrogen attached, then it's possible.

Wait, but in aromatic rings, the alpha position is part of the ring. So the H's are on the ring itself. For example,
