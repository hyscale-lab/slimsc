Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's break it down. The question is about identifying Compound X based on the NMR data of the product after a reaction. Hmm, the reaction uses 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. I'm a bit rusty on what that reagent does. Oh wait, that's a common reagent for epoxide ring-opening reactions, right? So maybe Compound X is an epoxide that reacts under these conditions.

Looking at the product data, the 1H NMR and 13C NMR are provided. Let's analyze them. 

Starting with the 1H NMR:
- δ 2.28 and 2.31 each have 3H singlets. So that's two methyl groups. Singlets mean no neighboring protons, so maybe attached to carbonyls or something else that doesn't split the signal.
- Then we have a doublet at δ6.75 (1H), followed by δ7.08 (2H, d), then δ7.68 (1H, d), and δ7.71 (2H, d). So, that's a pattern of aromatic protons, maybe with some coupling. Let me think about the splitting. The doublets could be from a para-substituted benzene ring. Wait, but the multiplicity doesn't exactly fit a benzene ring. Alternatively, maybe a vinyl group attached to something else?

Looking at the 13C NMR:
- 21.3 and 28.4 are the two singlets for the methyl carbons. Those are pretty low for carbons, so maybe they're attached to something like an oxygen. Wait, 21.3 is about where a methyl group attached to an oxygen would be, like in an epoxide. Or perhaps in a diethyl ether, but in this case, maybe an epoxide ring.
- The next set is 126.9 (two carbons), 127.1 (one C), 129.1 (two C), 130.3 (one C), 141.5 and 144.1 (each one C), and 197.7 (one C, which looks like a carbonyl, maybe a ketone? But wait, the reaction involved an epoxide, so maybe a carbonyl from ring-opening but that's a bit confusing.)

Wait, the product's 13C shows a carbonyl at 197.7. Hmm, that's a high value. Could that be a carbonyl from an epoxide ring-opening? If the epoxide opened, maybe it formed a carbonyl group. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Oh, right! That's a base, and it's used in epoxide ring-opening reactions, especially for acid-catalyzed or base-catalyzed conditions. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is actually a bulky amine, used as a base in certain ring-opening reactions. So, with an epoxide, when you open the epoxide ring in a basic condition, you get a trans-diol or something like that. But wait, in nonpolar solvent and at 403 K, maybe it's a different pathway.

Wait, another thought: sometimes in some conditions, especially with certain solvents and temperatures, the epoxide might undergo ring-opening via a different mechanism. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening to form another structure, but I'm a bit confused here.
