Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because these reaction mechanisms can get pretty tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about determining the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product. There are four steps involved, each involving different reactions. I need to figure out what each step does and then analyze the structure of the final product.

Let me start by reading the problem again. The initial compound is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So that's a bicyclic structure, right? Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, with a substituent at position 7. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group. So, tert-butoxy is O- attached to a tert-butyl group.

Next, this compound is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. The product is called product 1. Hmm, what kind of reaction could this be? Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, maybe in an SN2 reaction. But the other compound has two dibromomethyl groups on cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So perhaps it's a substitution where the tert-butoxy group acts as a leaving group or maybe something else.

Wait, wait. The starting material has a tert-butoxy group, which is a good leaving group because it's a strong base? No, wait, tert-butoxy is a poor leaving group. Or maybe under certain conditions, it can leave. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening reaction. Let me think.

Alternatively, the reaction might be a Grignard-like addition or perhaps a Diels-Alder reaction. Wait, the starting material is a diene. The other compound is a diene as well. Oh, maybe a Diels-Alder reaction?

Wait, let's think: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene has two double bonds. So it's conjugated diene? The other compound is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So that's a cyclohexene with two methyl groups each attached to Br, at positions 5 and 6. So each of those methyl groups has two Br atoms? Wait, no, the structure is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl). So each of those positions has a CH2 group, and each CH2 is substituted with two Br atoms. So each CH2Br2 group is on carbons 5 and 6 of the cyclohexa-1,3-diene.

Hmm. So when two equivalents of this are reacting, maybe each of the dibromomethyl groups will undergo some kind of substitution. Sodium iodide is presentâ€”maybe it's a Finkelstein reaction, where Br is replaced by I? But that might not explain using two equivalents.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienes are undergoing a Diels-Alder reaction. But I'm not sure. Wait, the starting bicyclic compound is a diene, and the other is also a diene. Would that be a Diels-Alder? But the diene would need to be a diene and a dienophile.

Wait, the starting material has two double bonds. So maybe it's a bicyclo structure with conjugated dienes, making it a good dienophile? Or maybe the other compound is the dienophile.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening. The starting bicyclic compound might undergo some kind of ring-opening with the other molecule.

Wait, another thought: the bicyclo structure is similar to norbornene. Norbornene can react with dienophiles in Diels-Alder reactions. But the other compound here is a cyclohexa-1,3-diene with two dibromomethyl groups. Wait, that's a conjugated diene. So perhaps the bicyclic diene is acting as the dienophile, and the cyclohexa-1,3-diene is the diene in a Diels-Alder reaction. So the bicyclo compound would react with the cyclohexene diene?

Wait, but the other molecule has two dibromomethyl groups. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system via some nucleophilic attack.

Wait, the starting compound has a tert-butoxy group. Tert-butoxy is a bulky group. Maybe under certain conditions, it can leave, perhaps forming an epoxide or something else? But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening via an elimination. Wait, but with NaI, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. But the structure is bicyclic, which is a rigid structure. So substitution might not be feasible unless there's a good leaving group.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the tert-butoxy group is being displaced in an SN2, but given its bulkiness, that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination, but the product would be something else.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a bicyclo with a bridge, and with the reaction, the bridge is opened. Let me think about the structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So the ring is a norbornene derivative. When it reacts with another diene, perhaps it's undergoing a cycloaddition. So maybe the norbornene is reacting with the cyclohexene in a Diels-Alder to form a new ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the iodide from NaI is acting as a nucleophile, attacking the dibromomethyl groups. Wait, the other compound has two CH2Br2 groups. So perhaps the NaI is causing a substitution where Br is replaced by I. But why two equivalents?

Wait, but the starting material is the bicyclic compound with tert-butoxy. Maybe the reaction is a substitution where the tert-butoxy group is replaced by something else.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about each step.

Step 1: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene reacts with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dib
