Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ is the Pauli spin matrices, n is an arbitrary unit vector, and ε is an energy constant.

Hmm, I remember that Pauli matrices are involved in spin systems. Each Pauli matrix σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are 2x2 matrices. The dot product σ · n would be like n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. So H is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ε.

Eigenvalues of H. Right, for a 2x2 Hermitian matrix like this, the eigenvalues are the solutions to the characteristic equation det(H - λI) = 0.

Wait, but I also recall that the Pauli matrices are traceless and their squares are identity matrices. Each σ_i squared is I, the 2x2 identity matrix. So σ · n squared would be (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2. Let's think, that would be n_x² σ_x² + n_y² σ_y² + n_z² σ_z² + cross terms.

Wait, no. When you square a sum, you get cross terms. But since σ_i and σ_j anti-commute when i ≠ j, their products are iσ_i σ_j where i is the imaginary unit. But wait, when you square the sum, let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler approach. Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² =1. So when we square σ · n, it becomes (n_x σ_x + ... )^2. Let's expand it.

Each σ_i squared is I, so σ_x² = I, same for σ_y and σ_z. The cross terms would be σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i, but since σ_i and σ_j anticommute when i≠j, their product is - I for each pair. Wait, no, σ_i σ_j = i ε_ijk σ_k where ε is the Levi-Civita symbol, but that's for the product, not the square.

Wait, maybe it's easier to calculate (σ · n)^2. Since each σ_i is a matrix, (σ · n)^2 = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2.

Expanding that, each σ_i^2 term will be I, so n_x^2 I + n_y^2 I + n_z^2 I plus cross terms. The cross terms involve terms like σ_i σ_j and σ_j σ_i.

Each σ_i σ_j = i ε_{ijk} σ_k, but when you have σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i, that's equal to 2 δ_{ij} I, because σ_i and σ_j anticommute. So when i≠j, σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i = 0. When i=j, it's 2 I.

Wait that makes sense. So expanding (σ · n)^2 gives sum_i (n_i^2) I + sum_{i≠j} n_i n_j (σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i). But since σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i is 2 δ_{ij} I, each term where i≠j becomes zero. So (σ ·n)^2 = (n_x^2 +
