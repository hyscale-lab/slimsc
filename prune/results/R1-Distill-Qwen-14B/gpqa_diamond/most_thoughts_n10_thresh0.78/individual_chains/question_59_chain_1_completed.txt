Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let's see... The question is about determining the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So the key here is probably to find out whether there's excess acid or base after all possible neutralizations. If there's an excess, I can calculate the concentration of H+ or OH- ions, and then find the pH. But if they completely neutralize each other, maybe the solution is neutral, but that's probably not the case here since the amounts are different.

Let me list out the given information:

- Volume and concentration of CH3COOH (acetic acid): 500 mL, 0.1 M
- Volume and concentration of HCl: 400 mL, 0.2 M
- Volume and concentration of Ba(OH)2: 300 mL, 0.3 M

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates completely in water. Each formula unit gives two OH- ions because Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2 OH⁻. So the concentration of OH- from Ba(OH)2 would be 0.3 M × 2 = 0.6 M.

Similarly, HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely into H+ and Cl⁻. The concentration of H+ from HCl is 0.2 M.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. I'll need to account for that.

The plan is to calculate the total moles of H+ from the acids and the total moles of OH- from the base. Then, find out which is in excess and compute the pH accordingly.

So, first, calculate the moles for each component.

Moles = concentration (M) × volume (L)

Let me compute each:

1. Moles of CH3COOH:
Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L
Molarity = 0.1 M
Moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles

2. Moles of HCl:
Volume = 400 mL = 0.4 L
Molarity = 0.2 M
Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. Since HCl is strong acid, moles of H+ is 0.08.

3. Moles of Ba(OH)2:
Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L
Molarity = 0.3 M
Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles.
Each mole gives 2 moles of OH-, so total OH- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but wait. When you mix these, the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH will react with the OH- from Ba(OH)2. So, the strong acid H+ will react first, and any remaining OH- will react with the weak acid.

Let me think: strong acids react quickly, so H+ from HCl will neutralize the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

So, let's compute the net acid or base after this reaction.

Total H+ (from HCl) = 0.08 moles
Total OH- (from Ba(OH)2) = 0.18 moles

Reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O

So, the H+ will neutralize 0.08 moles of OH-, leaving OH- = 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

So after this, Ba(OH)2 has 0.10 moles of OH- left.

Now, we have the acetic acid, which is a weak acid, CH3COOH. Acetic acid can donate H+ ions, but since OH- is present, they will react.

The OH- will react with CH3COOH. The reaction is:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O

So, each mole of OH- will consume one mole of CH3COOH and produce one mole of acetate ion (CH3COO^-).

We have 0.10 moles of OH- and 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

Wait, let's see: CH3COOH is 0.05 moles. OH- is 0.10 moles. So OH- will react with all the CH3COOH available, which is 0.05 moles, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH-.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The OH- will react with CH3COOH until either runs out. Since OH- is 0.10 and CH3COOH is 0.05, the CH3COOH will be fully consumed, and OH- will be reduced by 0.05, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH-.

So after this, we have 0.05 moles of OH- remaining. That means the solution is basic because there's excess OH-.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps.

1. HCl (strong acid) provides 0.08 mol H+.
2. Ba(OH)2 provides 0.18 mol OH-.
3. The H+ and OH- neutralize each other: 0.08 vs 0.18. H+ is less, so all H+ is neutralized, leaving 0.10 mol OH-.
4. Then, the remaining OH- (0.10) reacts with CH3COOH (0.05 mol). So 0.05 mol OH- reacts with CH3COOH, producing 0.05 mol CH3COO^- and leaving 0.05 mol OH-.

So now, the net OH- is 0.05 mol.

Now, what's the total volume of the solution? Because concentrations depend on this.

Total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M.

Wait, but wait. Let me confirm the moles after each step.

After neutralizing H+ from HCl with OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.08 H+ neutralizes 0.08 OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol OH-.

Then, the CH3COOH (0.05 mol) reacts with OH- (0.10 mol). So, the CH3COOH is all consumed, producing 0.05 mol CH3COO^- and leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol OH-.

So, total OH- left is 0.05 mol.

Wait, but wait another thing. When Ba(OH)2 is a base, the OH- is 0.18 mol. Then, HCl provides H+ 0.08 mol which neutralizes 0.08 OH-, so remaining OH- is 0.10. Then, CH3COOH is 0.05 mol. Each mole of CH3COOH can react with one mole of OH-.

So, 0.05 mol OH- will react with 0.05 mol CH3COOH, producing 0.05 mol CH3COO^- and 0.05 mol H2O. So, after that, we have 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol OH- remaining.

So, the solution is basic, with [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 L = 0.041666... M.

Then, the pH can be found using pOH first. pOH = -log[OH-] = -log(0.041666...).

Let me compute that.

Wait, 0.041666 is approximately 1/24. So, 0.041666 is 4.1666e-2.

pOH = -log(4.1666e-2). Let's compute this.

Log(4.1666e-2) = log(4.1666) + log(1e-2) = ~0.62 + (-2) = -1.38? No, wait. Wait, wait. Let me compute log(0.041666).

Log(0.04) is about -1.39794. Since 0.041666 is a bit higher, let's think.

Compute 0.041666 = 4.1666e-2.

Log(4.1666e-2) = log(4.1666) + log(1e-2) = 0.6196 (since log(4)=0.6021, log(4.1666) is about 0.6196) plus (-2) = -1.3804.

So, pOH = 1.3804. Thus, pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.3804 ≈ 12.6196.

Looking at the options, option A is 12.62, which matches this.

Wait a second, but I have to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the steps.

Alternative approach: Maybe I should calculate all the H+ and OH- from all sources, including the weak acid.

Wait, when the OH- is neutralizing the weak acid, it's consuming both the OH- and the weak acid. But after that, the remaining OH- is in solution. So, the OH- would contribute to the solution's basicity.

Wait, but another thing: when OH- reacts with CH3COOH, it generates CH3COO^- and water. The CH3COO^- is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it can hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions. But wait, but in this case, since we have excess OH- from Ba(OH)2, the solution is already basic. Would that affect the acetate ion's hydrolysis? Hmm, maybe the acetate would not hydrolyze much because the solution is already highly basic. Or does it?

Wait, but in this scenario, after neutralization, there's an excess of OH- (0.05 mol), but the acetate ions (0.05 mol) are present. However, in a basic solution, the acetate ion is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it can hydrolyze:

CH3COO^- + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH^-

But if the solution is already basic (high OH- concentration), the hydrolysis of acetate would be suppressed because Le Chatelier's principle says that the system will oppose the change. So, the acetate won't contribute much to the OH- concentration in this case. Therefore, the main source of OH- is the excess from Ba(OH)2 that hasn't been neutralized.

Thus, the pH is determined by the concentration of OH- from the excess Ba(OH)2.

So, the initial calculation holds: [OH-] = 0.05 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.041666 M.

pOH ≈ 1.38, so pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Looking at the options, option A is 12.62. So, the answer should be A.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the mixing of the given acids and base:

1. **Given Data**:
   - Volume and concentration of CH₃COOH (acetic acid): 500 mL, 0.1 M.
   - Volume and concentration of HCl: 400 mL, 0.2 M.
   - Volume and concentration of Ba(OH)₂: 300 mL, 0.3 M.

2. **Calculate Moles**:
   - Moles of CH₃COOH:  
     \[
     \text{Moles} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol}.
     \]
   - Moles of HCl:  
     \[
     \text{Moles} = 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{mol}.
     \]
   - Moles of Ba(OH)₂:  
     \[
     \text{Moles} = 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol}.
     \]
     Since Ba(OH)₂ dissociates completely, it provides \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol OH}^- \).

3. **Reaction Between H⁺ and OH⁻**:
   - H⁺ from HCl reacts with OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:  
     \[
     \text{H⁺ (0.08 mol)} + \text{OH⁻ (0.18 mol)} \rightarrow \text{H₂O}.
     \]
     After neutralization, \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{mol OH}^- \) remains.

4. **Reaction Between Remaining OH⁻ and CH₃COOH**:
   - CH₃COOH reacts with the remaining OH⁻:  
     \[
     \text{CH₃COOH (0.05 mol)} + \text{OH⁻ (0.10 mol)} \rightarrow \text{CH₃COO}^- + \text{H₂O}.
     \]
     All 0.05 mol of CH₃COOH is consumed, leaving \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{mol OH}^- \).

5. **Final OH⁻ Concentration**:
   - Total volume of the solution:  
     \[
     500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}.
     \]
   - Concentration of OH⁻:  
     \[
     [\text{OH}^-] = \frac{0.05 \, \text{mol}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M}.
     \]

6. **Calculate pH**:
   - pOH:  
     \[
     \text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH}^-] = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38.
     \]
   - pH:  
     \[
     \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
     \]

7. **Conclusion**:
   The pH of the solution is approximately **12.62**, which corresponds to option **A**.
