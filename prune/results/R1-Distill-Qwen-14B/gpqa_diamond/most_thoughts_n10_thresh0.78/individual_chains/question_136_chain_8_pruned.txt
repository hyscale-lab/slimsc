Okay, so I have this vector calculus problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R. Hmm.

Alright, let's start by understanding what the problem says. The vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². So, in spherical coordinates, the field has components only in the radial direction. That means, in spherical terms, the vector field is something like f(r) = (F, 0, 0), where F is the magnitude, which is 1/r². Wait, no, actually, in spherical coordinates, the radial component is often denoted differently, but yeah, the field's only along the radial direction, so the other components (like theta and phi) are zero.

The question asks for the volume integral of the divergence of this field, ∇·f, inside a sphere of radius R. So I need to compute ∫∫∫ (∇·f) dV over the volume of the sphere.

Wait, but I remember from the divergence theorem that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field equals the surface integral of the field over the boundary. Oh, right! So instead of computing a triple integral, I can just compute the flux through the surface of the sphere. But wait, the divergence theorem applies to closed surfaces, which this sphere is. So that should work.

So, divergence theorem says ∫∫∫ (∇·f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dA, where n is the outward normal vector on the surface.
