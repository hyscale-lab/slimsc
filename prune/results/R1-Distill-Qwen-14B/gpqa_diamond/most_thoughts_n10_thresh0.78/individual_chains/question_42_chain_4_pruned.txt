Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about exoplanets and their orbital periods. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

So, the problem states that there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Maybe it's just context.

The key information given is about the equilibrium temperatures and masses. The equilibrium temperature ratios are between Planet1 and Planet2 as 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3 as 2.3. Also, the mass ratios are Planet1/Planet2 ≈1.15, and Planet2/Planet3≈1.35. Wait, wait, so Planet1 is a bit more massive than Planet2, and Planet2 is more massive than Planet3 by about 35% each step.

But the question isn't about mass or temperature directly. It's about the orbital period. They want to find by what factor Planet3's period is larger than Planet1's. And all have the same albedo of 0.3, similar to Earth.

So, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to its distance from the star and its albedo. The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσ)) )^(1/4) * ( (1 - a) / ( (1 + e)^(1/2) ) )^(1/4) ... wait, no. Maybe I should think of it more simply. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_eff (star) * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), but wait, no, that's not right either.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)) * ( (1 - a) )^{1/4} ), where a is the semi-major axis, R is the star's radius, T_star is its effective temperature. Hmm, but if all three planets are around the same star, then R and T_star would be the same for each. So, for each planet, T is proportional to sqrt(R) * (1 - a)^{1/4} / a^{1/2} }.

Wait, let me think again. The equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^{1/4}.

Since all the planets have the same albedo (0.3), that term is the same for all, so when taking ratios, it cancels out. So the ratio of their temperatures depends only on sqrt(R_star/(2a)).

But wait, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is given. The ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4. Let me denote T1 as Planet1's temperature, T2 as Planet2's, etc.

So T1/T2 = 1.4. From the temperature formula, since T is proportional to sqrt(R/(2a)), then:

T1 / T2 = sqrt( (R/(2a
