Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this decay probability problem. Let me start by understanding the question.

So, there's an atom that has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. We're told that 50 minutes have passed, and it hasn't decayed yet. Now, they're asking what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Hmm, wait, no, wait. After 50 minutes, the next 150 minutes would be a total of 200 minutes? Or is the next 150 minutes starting from the current 50-minute mark? Oh, right, because the 150 minutes is the remaining time from now, so the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But wait, the question might be about the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, meaning within the next 150 minutes regardless of the previous time. But I'm not sure yet.

Wait, no, no. Let me think again. The decay process is a Poisson process, I think. Because radioactive decay follows an exponential decay law. So the probability of decay is independent of time, right? So even if 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed, the probability for the next period doesn't change based on that past time.

So, the key point is that the decay is memoryless. The probability that the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes doesn't affect the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes. Wait, but that's not exactly right. Because the decay probability over a time period depends on the decay constant.

Wait, the given 32% is the probability of decay in 100 minutes. So, the decay constant lambda can be calculated from that. Let me remember the formula for radioactive decay. The probability of decay within time t is 1 minus e^(-lambda t). So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-lambda * 100). So, e^(-100 lambda) = 0.68. Taking the natural log of both sides: -100 lambda = ln(0.68). So, lambda = -ln(0.68)/100.

Wait
