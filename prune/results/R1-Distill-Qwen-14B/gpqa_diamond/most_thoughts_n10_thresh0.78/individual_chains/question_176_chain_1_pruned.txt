Hmm, okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

So, the question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, in a given state. The state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1), which I think is a column vector, right? So it's a 3-dimensional vector since it has three elements.

The first thing I remember is that for any observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of its corresponding matrix operator. So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for both P and Q because the measurement outcomes depend on these.

Let me start with operator Q because its matrix looks simpler. The matrix for Q is diagonal, which should make things easier. The matrix is:

[1 0 0]
[0 0 0]
[0 0 -1]

So, the diagonal elements are 1, 0, -1. Since the matrix is diagonal, the eigenvalues are just the diagonal entries. So the possible outcomes for Q are 1, 0, and -1.

Now, for operator P, the matrix is given as:

[0, 1/√2, 0]
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
[0, 1/√2, 0]

Hmm, this looks a bit more complicated. I'll need to find its eigenvalues. Let me think about how to find the eigenvalues of this matrix. The eigenvalues are the solutions to the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

Let me write out the matrix P - λI:

[-λ, 1/√2, 0]
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2]
[0, 1/√2, -λ]

The determinant of this matrix should be zero. Calculating the determinant for a 3x3 matrix can be a bit tedious, but let's try expanding it.

Alternatively, maybe I can look for some symmetry or patterns. I notice that the matrix is symmetric, which is good because it's diagonalizable with real eigenvalues. Also, the matrix might have some nice eigenvectors.

Wait, another thought: sometimes for such symmetric matrices, the eigenvectors can be found in terms of basis vectors or simple combinations. Let me try to see if any of the standard basis vectors are eigenvectors.

Let's take the first basis vector e1 = (1,0,0)^T. When we multiply P by e1, we get:

P * e1 = [0, 1/√2, 0]^T. But that's 1/√2 * e2. So, P*e1 is not a multiple of e1, so e1 isn't an eigenvector.

Similarly, let's check e2 = (0,1,0)^T. P*e2 is [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]^T, which is (1/√2)e1 + (1/√2)e3. Again, not a multiple of e2, so not an eigenvector.

Maybe e3 is the same as e1 in this case. Probably not. So perhaps the eigenvectors are not aligned with the standard basis. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the matrix has eigenvalues that sum to zero. The trace of P is 0, so the sum of the eigenvalues is zero. That means if there are three real eigenvalues, they sum to zero. So possibilities could be 1, 0, -1? Or maybe something else.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the matrix is a representation of a spin operator or something, but not sure. Alternatively, looking for possible eigenvalues by other means.

Alternatively, perhaps I can guess the eigenvalues. Let me think.

Since the matrix has zeros on the diagonal, and the off-diagonal elements are 1/√2 where possible, maybe the eigenvalues are symmetric. Let's consider that.

Assume that the eigenvalues are a, b, c. a + b + c = 0 (since trace is 0).

Looking at the matrix, perhaps the eigenvalues are √2, 0, -√2. Because when you square the matrix, you might get a diagonal matrix with 2, 0, 2, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1 multiplied by √2? Let me check.

Wait, let's compute the square of matrix P. Let's see:

P^2 = P multiplied by P.

Calculating each element:

First row of P:
(0, 1/√2, 0)

Multiply by first column of P:
0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 = (1/2)

Second element of first row: 0* (1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) = 0.

Third element: same as first, 1/2.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me compute each element.

Wait, another approach: Since P is symmetric, it can be diagonalized, and its eigenvalues squared would be the eigenvalues of P squared. So if I can compute the eigenvalues of P squared, maybe I can find the eigenvalues of P.

Compute P^2:

P^2 = 

Row 1:

[0, 1/√2, 0] multiplied by each column of P.

First column of P is (0,1/√2,0)^T.

So first element: 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2.

Second element: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) = 0.

Third element: 0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2.

So row 1 is [1/2, 0, 1/2].

Row 2 of P: (1/√2, 0, 1/√2)

Multiply by each column:

First column: (1/√2)*0 + 0* (1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 = 0.

Second column: (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1.

Third column: same as first, 0.

So row 2 is [0,1,0].

Row 3 of P: (0,1/√2,0).

Same as row 1, so row 3 of P^2 is [1/2,0,1/2].

So P^2 looks like:

[1/2, 0, 1/2]
[0, 1, 0]
[1/2, 0, 1/2]

Wait, this is interesting. The diagonal elements are 1/2, 1, 1/2.

So the trace of P^2 is 1/2 + 1 + 1/2 = 2. Since trace is sum of squares of eigenvalues, so if the eigenvalues of P are a, b, c, then a² + b² + c² = 2.

We also know that a + b + c = 0, from the trace of P.

Hmm, let's see. Let's say the eigenvalues are x, y, and -x-y.

Then, x² + y² + (x + y)^2 = 2.

Wait, because ( -x - y )^2 = (x + y)^2.

Wait, that's x² + y² + (x + y)^2 = x² + y² + x² + 2xy + y² = 2x² + 2y² + 2xy = 2.

Divide both sides by 2: x² + y² + xy = 1.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvalues are ±√2 and 0. Let's test that.

If the eigenvalues are sqrt(2), -sqrt(2), and 0.

Their squares are 2, 2, 0. Sum is 4, which is greater than 2, so that can't be right.

Wait, maybe another approach. The matrix P has rank 2? Because looking at P^2, the rank is 2. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, since the matrix is symmetric, perhaps the eigenvalues are symmetric around zero.

Wait, another thought: maybe the matrix P is a projection matrix or something else. Wait, no, the trace is zero, so it's not a projection matrix (since projection matrices have trace equal to their rank, which is <= dimension).

Wait, maybe think about the eigenvectors. Let me consider possible eigenvectors.

Suppose that an eigenvector is (1, a, 1). Let's see if it's an eigenvector.

Multiply P by this vector:

P*(1, a,1) = [ (0)(1) + (1/√2)(a) + 0*(1), (1/√2)(1) + 0*a + (1/√2)(1), (0)(1) + (1/√2)(a) + 0*(1) ]

= [ (a)/(√2), (2)/(√2), (a)/(√2) ) ]

= [ a/√2, √2, a/√2 ]

For this to be a multiple of (1, a, 1), the components must be proportional.

So, looking at the first component: a/√2 = λ * 1.

Second component: √2 = λ * a.

Third component: a/√2 = λ * 1.

So from first and third, same equation: λ = a/√2.

From the second component: √2 = λ a → substitute λ: √2 = (a/√2) * a → √2 = a² / √2 → multiply both sides by √2: 2 = a² → a = ±√2.

So possible a's are √2 and -√2.

So for a = √2: λ = (√2)/√2 = 1.

Check the second component: λ * a = 1 * √2 = √2. Which matches.

Similarly for a = -√2: λ = (-√2)/√2 = -1.

Check second component: λ * a = (-1)*(-√2) = √2, which matches.

So, we have two eigenvalues: 1 and -1, each with eigenvectors (1, √2, 1) and (1, -√2, 1), respectively.

Wait, but wait. The sum of the eigenvalues must be zero because the trace is zero. So if two eigenvalues are 1 and -1, the third should be zero. So the eigenvalues are 1, -1, 0.

Ah, that makes sense. So P has eigenvalues 1, -1, and 0. So when you measure P, the possible outcomes are 1, -1, and 0.

Now, the problem is asking for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring P first and then Q.

Wait, no, the measurement is first P and then Q. Because the question says, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. Wait, no, the question says: "the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?"

Wait, no, wait. The measurements are done one after the other. So when you measure P first, the system collapses into an eigenstate of P. Then, when you measure Q, it's in that state.

But the question is looking for the probability of getting 0 when measuring P, and then -1 when measuring Q.

Wait, but the way it's worded is a bit ambiguous. It says "the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements." So I think it's the product of the probabilities of each outcome in sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the joint probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring both.

But the way the problem is set up, the measurements are done in sequence: measure P, then measure Q.

Wait, but the initial state is (-1, 2, 1). So first, when you measure P, the state collapses to an eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Then, when you measure Q, you get the eigenvalue for Q in that state.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. When you measure P, the system collapses into an eigenvector of P. So, if the outcome is 0, the state becomes the eigenvector corresponding to 0. Then, measuring Q in that state will give the eigenvalue of Q for that eigenvector.

So I think the process is: measure P, get 0, so the state is the eigenvector of P for eigenvalue 0. Then measure Q on this state, and the outcome is the eigenvalue of Q for that state.

So the probability is P(measuring 0 for P) multiplied by P(measuring -1 for Q given the state is the eigenvector of P for 0).

Alternatively, perhaps the order is reversed: measure Q first, but the question says measure P first, then Q.

Wait, no, the question says, "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P". So the sequence is P first, then Q.

So the process is:

1. Start in state ψ = (-1, 2, 1)^T.

2. Measure P. If the outcome is 0, the state becomes the eigenvector of P corresponding to 0.

3. Then measure Q on this new state. What's the probability of getting -1?

So the overall probability is the product of the probability of P=0 and the probability of Q=-1 given P=0.

Alternatively, perhaps you can compute this as the inner product squared between the initial state and the eigenstate of P corresponding to 0, multiplied by the inner product squared between that eigenstate and the eigenstate of Q corresponding to -1.

Wait, but since the eigenstates of P and Q might not be the same, this might not be straightforward. Hmm.

Wait, but Q is diagonal, so its eigenvectors are easy. The eigenvectors for Q are the standard basis vectors, because Q is diagonal. So the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1, with eigenvectors e1, e2, e3.

So the eigenvectors for Q are:

For eigenvalue 1: e1 =
