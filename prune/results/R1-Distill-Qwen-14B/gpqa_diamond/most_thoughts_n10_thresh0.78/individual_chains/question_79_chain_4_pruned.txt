Okay, so I've got this NMR problem in front of me, and I need to figure out which compound X is. Let's see what I can do. I remember that NMR spectra can give a lot of structural information, especially about the environment of the protons and carbons. 

The compound X has the formula C11H12O. The reaction conditions involve 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, bulky base, I think. Oh, right! It's often used in the epoxide ring-opening reactions, especially under specific conditions. But wait, maybe the reaction is different. Alternatively, since that's a bulky base, perhaps it's used to induce some kind of elimination or rearrangement?

Wait, the product's NMR is given. So the product is the result of X reacting with this base. Hmm. I need to find what X is, based on the NMR of the product.

Looking at the options, they're all epoxides. Let me check the options:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So that's an oxirane (epoxide) where the substituents are at position 2, and the styryl group is at the 4-methyl position.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. Hmm, so the substituent is a propenyl group with a phenyl at position 1 and a substituent at 2, attached to the oxirane.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the oxirane has a methyl at position 2 and a styryl at position 3.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. So the styryl group is at position 2 of the epoxide.

Now, the product's NMR. Let's look at the 1H NMR first.

The signals are:
δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s). Two singlets, each integrating to 3H. So maybe two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split their signals—like if they're next to an electronegative atom or in a symmetric position. Like perhaps two methyl groups attached to the same carbon? Or maybe they are both adjacent to an oxygen, but I'm not sure.

Then, in the aromatic region:
6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

Looking at the 13C NMR, there's a signal at δ 197.7, which is a carbonyl carbon. Wait, but the product is from a reaction with a base. If the starting material was an epoxide, and the base opened it, maybe the product has a ketone or another carbonyl group? Or perhaps that's from a ring-opening that forms a carbonyl.

Wait, but the 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is around the region for a carbonyl (like ketone, aldehyde, ester). So maybe the product is a ketone.

Wait, but the starting material is an epoxide, and the reaction is with a base. Epoxide ring-opening under basic conditions would typically form an alkoxide, but that's not likely to form a carbonyl. Unless it's a more complex reaction. Alternatively, maybe the base induced some elimination after opening.

Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't the epoxide itself but something else. Wait, but the product is after reaction with the base, so X is the starting epoxide.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diol, but why is there a carbonyl?

Alternatively, maybe the epoxide ring opened in a way to form a carbonyl. Wait, how? Oh, wait, if the epoxide was adjacent to a carbonyl group, upon ring-opening, but that seems unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not ring-opening but something else. Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is also used as a catalyst in some cases, but I'm more familiar with it as a base for ring-opening epoxides.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the reaction is an elimination reaction. For example, if X is an epoxide and upon treatment with a base, it undergoes ring-opening followed by elimination to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, let me think. Suppose the epoxide is adjacent to a carbonyl group. When the base opens the epoxide, perhaps a neighboring group effect occurs, leading to formation of a carbonyl. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol, and the 13C NMR is showing the diol's carbons, but I don't see obvious OH groups in the 1H NMR. I see aromatic signals but no broad peaks that would suggest OH.

Wait, but the 1H NMR shows a singlet at δ 2.28 and 2.31, which could be two methyl groups attached to electronegative atoms—like oxygen. But wait, in an epoxide, the adjacent carbons are usually not methyl groups. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. If the starting epoxide had adjacent groups that could form a carbonyl upon ring-opening.

Wait, let me try to think about each option and what their product would look like when reacted with the base.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So the structure would be an epoxide where the substituent is a styryl group (vinyl benzene) attached at the 4-methyl position. So when this epoxide reacts with a base, what would happen? The base would open the epoxide. The ring-opening of epoxides typically forms two adjacent alcohols or two adjacent groups, depending on the base and the structure. But if the epoxide is part of a styryl group, perhaps the ring-opening leads to a diol adjacent to the aromatic ring.

But looking at the NMR, the 13C shows a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So maybe the ring-opening leads to a carbonyl group. How?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an elimination after ring-opening. Let's think: upon ring-opening, a diol is formed. If the diol then undergoes elimination (like E2), it would form a double bond and possibly a carbonyl.

Wait, but that usually requires adjacent hydroxyl groups and a base to take a proton, leading to formation of a double bond as the hydroxyls lose a proton and a leaving group. Not sure if that would form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is next to a carbonyl group. So when the base opens the epoxide, it could form an enolate, leading to a conjugated carbonyl.

Hmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's look at the NMR data again.

The 1H NMR has two singlet methyl groups. Maybe they're both attached to the same carbon or in symmetrical positions.

Looking at the 13C NMR, the carbons are as follows:

21.3 (1C, s) and 28.4 (1C, s) for the two methyl groups.

Then, the rest are in the aromatic and carbonyl regions.

So, 197.7 is a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone. How would that form from an epoxide? Perhaps through a pinacol rearr
