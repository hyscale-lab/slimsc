Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I need to figure out which planet has a higher chance of transiting so the researchers should observe that one. Let's break down the information given.

So, there are two planets: Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, detected via the RV method. Planet_1 has a shorter orbital periodâ€”three times shorter than Planet_2. Oh, so if Planet_1's period is, say, P, then Planet_2's is 3P. Wait, no, the question says Planet_1's period is three times shorter. So Planet_1's orbital period is P, Planet_2's is 3P. Because if Planet_1's period is shorter, it's moving faster around its star.

Both have circular orbits. So that simplifies things, maybe. The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. Wait, why? Because the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved but same radius. Interesting. So same radius, but different masses.

The question is about the probability of a transit. I remember that the transit probability depends on the relative size of the planet's orbit to the star's size, or more specifically, the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. Oh wait, the formula for transit probability is something like (R_star + R_planet)^2 / (a_planet)^2, but wait, I might be mixing up some terms.

Wait, no, transit probability is more about the alignment. The probability is proportional to (R_star / a_planet), but squared? Or is it (R_star / a_planet) squared over something else. Hmm. Or maybe the probability is (R_*/a)^2 * (1 + (M_planet/M_star) ) or something like that? Wait, I think I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, I should think about the formula. I remember that for a planet to transit, the orbital plane must be edge-on relative to us
