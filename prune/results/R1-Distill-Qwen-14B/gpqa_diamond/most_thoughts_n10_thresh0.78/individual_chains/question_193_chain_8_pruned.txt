Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance, given a specific relationship between the number of stars and parallax.

Hmm, the question states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/(plx)^5. Wait, parallax is usually denoted as 'p' sometimes, but here it's written as plx. Oh right, I remember that parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star due to Earth's orbit around the Sun. The formula for distance in parsecs is distance = 1/parallax. So distance (r) is 1 over parallax (p), right? So r = 1/p, which means p = 1/r.

Wait, the number of stars N varies with parallax as 1/(plx)^5. So mathematically, N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Substituting p with 1/r, that would be N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that.

So 1/( (1/r)^5 ) is the same as r^5. Because (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, and the reciprocal is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So the number of stars increases with r^5. But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So it's about the density or how much the number increases as
