Okay, so I have this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be +1 or -1, and the energy is given by E = -J [S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. Hmm, partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right?

First, I should figure out all the possible states of the system. Since each spin can be ±1, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3. So let me list them out.

The states are:
1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Now, for each state, I need to compute the energy E, then calculate exp(-βE), and sum all these to get Z.

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way instead of computing each state individually. Because evaluating each of 8 states might take time, but perhaps I can group the states based on their energy.

Let me think about the energy expression: E = -J (S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3). Each term S_i S_j is 1 if the two spins are the same, and -1 if they're different. So each term contributes either +1 or -1.

Wait, wait. Let me compute each term. So S1 S2 is 1 if S1 and S2 are the same, else -1. Same for S1 S3 and S2 S3.

So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 would be the sum of these three terms. Let me compute what each state's sum is.

Another approach: For each state, count how many pairs are aligned (i.e., S_i = S_j). Each aligned pair contributes +1 to the sum. Because S_i S_j would be 1. So if a state has m aligned pairs, then sum is m. But wait, each term is S_i S_j, so for each aligned pair, it adds 1; for anti-aligned, it subtracts 1.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think: if S_i and S_j are the same, S_i S_j = 1. If different, it's -1. So each pair contributes either 1 or -1. So the sum is (number of aligned pairs)*1 + (number of anti-aligned pairs)*(-1). Since there are three pairs, the sum can be 3 (all aligned), 1 (two aligned, one anti), -1 (one aligned, two anti), or -3 (all anti-aligned).

Wait, let's calculate for each state.

1. (+1, +1, +1): All pairs are aligned. So each term is 1. Sum is 3. E = -J*(3) = -3J. So exp term is exp(3J beta).

2. (+1, +1, -1): S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1. E = -J*(-1) = J. So exp is exp(-J beta).

3. (+1, -1, +1): Same as case 2.
