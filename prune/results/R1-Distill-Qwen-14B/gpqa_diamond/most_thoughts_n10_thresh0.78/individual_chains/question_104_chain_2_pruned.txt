Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, radial velocity detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. Right, when a planet orbits a star, the star wobbles, and that causes the spectral lines to shift periodically.

The question says both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and they each have a planet with masses similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. So, the setup is two stars with identical masses, each with a Neptune-like planet.

The shift in spectral lines is given: planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and planet #2 causes a shift of 7. Wait, I think the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star. So a larger shift would mean the star is moving faster.

The RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. The formula I remember is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(2/3) )) )... Hmm, maybe I should think about it differently. Wait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ), but since M_p is much less than M_star, we can approximate it as K ≈ ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ).

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the relation between K and the orbital period. Let me recall: the velocity semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the orbital
