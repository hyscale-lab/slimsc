Okay, so I'm trying to solve this electron microscopy question. Let me read it carefully.

Mike is working with a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using a very high accelerating voltage, 1000 kV. He connected vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to remove as many gas molecules as possible because gas can cause problems in electron microscopy, like scattering the electrons and reducing image quality.

But even after pumping, some gas particles remain. The mass spectrometer detects them. Mike calculates the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? It depends on things like pressure and temperature. I remember the formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d^2 * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the molecular diameter, and P is pressure.

Wait, so when the electron beam starts, Mike notices that the mean free path changes. It's now λ2 instead of λ1. But the temperature is the same, so T hasn't changed. So why would λ change?

Hmm, mean free path depends on pressure and temperature. If T is same, then pressure must have changed. But wait, the pressure in the vacuum was already ultra-high, but maybe when the electron beam is on, things change.

Wait, the electron beam is a high-energy beam. High-energy electrons can interact with the gas molecules. One possibility is that the beam heats the gas. But the question says the sample compartment's temperature remains the same, so maybe it's not that.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is being ionized by the electron beam. If the electrons collide with the gas molecules, they might knock electrons off, turning the gas into ions. Or, perhaps the ions are created via another mechanism.

Wait, but in a vacuum, with such a low pressure, I think the primary effect would be that these gas molecules are getting charged. Because when the electrons from the beam hit the gas atoms/molecules, they could cause them to become charged. Like, the electrons could transfer charge to the gas particles.

So, if the gas particles are neutral, they don't interact much with the electrons. But if they become charged, then perhaps the charged gas ions experience a force from the electric field of the electron
