Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's see what the question is about.

The first part is a reaction: butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Oh wait, I remember that ketones reacting with nitriles usually involve some kind of nucleophilic substitution or addition. Oh right, the formation of a cyanohydrin. Yeah, so when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, like NaCN, under certain conditions, it forms a cyanohydrin. The cyanide acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon.

Wait, but what's the role of the reagent here? I think the reaction often uses an acid catalyst. Because the cyanide ion is a good nucleophile but maybe needs some activation. So, the ketone would react with CN- in the presence of an acid. The acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks, leading to the formation of the cyanohydrin. So, the reagent A is probably an acid. Looking at the options, I see H3O+ as a possibility in options A and B.

Next, the second reaction is the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid using reagent B, which is either H2O or another acid. Wait, no, actually, the second reaction is in the presence of B, which is H2O or another substance. Wait, the question says the reagents are A and B, where B is (H2O). Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me re-read the problem. The first reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A â†’ product. The second reaction is that product plus B (which is H2O) gives the acid. So, the second part is the reaction of the cyanohydrin with some acid. Oh wait, no, wait. The product of the first step is a cyanohydrin, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile
