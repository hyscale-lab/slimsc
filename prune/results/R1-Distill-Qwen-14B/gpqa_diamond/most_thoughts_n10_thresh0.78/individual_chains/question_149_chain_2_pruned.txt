Okay, so I've got this question about an NMR and LC-MS analysis of a synthesized peptidic compound. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that the 1H NMR of the crude compound shows peaks consistent with the expected molecule, except there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. Also, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So what does that mean?

Wait, if the integral adds up to 1H and they have the same shift, but it's the same alpha proton, maybe there's some kind of splitting happening. But the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin, so it's not like another proton is causing this. Hmm. So maybe the molecule is in a different environment causing the same proton to split into two. But wait, if the coupling isn't spin-spin, then what else could cause double peaks?

Then there's the LC-MS part. Both peaks have the same mass, same spectrum. They have equal intensity. So the MS doesn't show a higher mass like a dimer or something. So it's not a precursor because a precursor would have a different mass, right? So option A is probably not.

Wait, but the MS shows two peaks of the same mass. So the mass is the same. So the compound isn't a different isomer, but same structure. So what else could cause two peaks in LC-MS? Maybe if there are different conformations? No, I don't think that would split into two peaks in LC-MS. Or maybe it's a diastereomer or enantiomer.

If the compound is a mixture of enantiomers, then in the NMR, they would have the same shifts because enantiomers have the same environment for protons. So the NMR would look like a single peak, not two. But the NMR in the question has two peaks for the same proton, so maybe it's not enantiomers. Because enantiomers wouldn't split the peak.

But wait, the question says the NMR has two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton. So that doesn't fit with enantiomers. So option B probably isn't the answer.

What about diastereomers? Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR spectra would show different shifts. But in this case, the two peaks have similar chemical shifts. So maybe the diastereomers are in very similar environments, so the shifts are close but not identical. But wait, the question says the two peaks have similar shifts, but I'm not sure if diastereomers would have that.

Alternatively, what if the compound is a mixture of diastereomers but with a specific arrangement where the alpha
