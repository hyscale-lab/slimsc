Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the problem is asking.

The question is about finding the uncertainty of P_z in a given quantum state. The state is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The system's state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I need to calculate the uncertainty ΔP_z.

First, I remember that the uncertainty of an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So in this case, A is P_z, so I'll need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩, then plug them into that formula.

The given matrices for P_x, P_y, and P_z are provided. Since the state is given, and the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. That's helpful because the matrix for P_z in this basis should be diagonal, which would make calculating expectation values easier.

Wait, looking at the matrix for P_z:
It's a 3x3 matrix with first row (ħ, 0, 0), second row (0,0,0), third row (0,0,-ħ). So the diagonal elements are ħ, 0, -ħ. So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ. The basis vectors are the corresponding eigenvectors.

The state vector given is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me check if it's normalized. The sum of the squares of the absolute values should be 1.

Calculating the squared magnitudes:

(-1/2)^2 = 1/4,
(1/√2)^2 = 1/2,
(-1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Adding them: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4 = 1. So yes, the vector is normalized.

Since the state is |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T, and the basis is the eigenvectors of P_z, the components of |ψ> in the P_z basis correspond to the coefficients of each eigenstate.

Let me think about the eigenstates of P_z. The matrix P_z is diagonal, so its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors in this representation. So the first basis vector |1> corresponds to eigenvalue ħ, the second |2> to eigenvalue 0, and the third |3> to eigenvalue -ħ.

So |ψ> can be written as a linear combination of |1>, |2>, |3>:

|ψ> = a|1> + b|2> + c|3>.

From the vector, a is -1/2, b is 1/√2, and c is -1/2.

Now, to find the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩, I can compute the weighted average of the eigenvalues using the squares of the amplitudes.

⟨P_z⟩ = |a|^2 * ħ + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (-ħ).

Compute |a|^2: (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

|b|^2: (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

|c|^2: (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

So,

⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ)
= (1/4 - 1/4) ħ
= 0.

Hmm, that's interesting. So the expectation value is zero. 

Next, I need ⟨P_z^2⟩. Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, P_z^2 will also be diagonal, with each diagonal element being the square of the eigenvalues. So P_z^2 will have entries (ħ^2, 0, ħ^2) on the diagonal.

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = |a|^2*(ħ^2) + |b|^2*0 + |c|^2*(ħ^2).

Plugging in the values:

= (1/4) * ħ^2 + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)* ħ^2
= (1/4 + 1/4) ħ^2
= (1/2) ħ^2.

Now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

We have ⟨P_z²⟩ = ħ²/2, and ⟨P_z⟩² = 0.

So ΔP_z = sqrt( (ħ²/2) - 0 ) = sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Let me double-check the calculations. 

Wait, but wait a minute. The state is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. How does that affect things? Well, the uncertainty in P_z would involve the expectation values, but since the state is a superposition in the P_z basis, the uncertainty could be non-zero. But according to our calculation, the expectation of P_z is zero, so the uncertainty comes from P_z squared.

Another point: The uncertainty is about the spread in the possible outcomes of P_z measurements. Since the state is a linear combination of states with P_z eigenvalues ħ, -ħ, and 0, the variance arises from the probabilities of each eigenvalue.

Wait, but in our calculation, the coefficient for |2> (which has P_z=0) is 1/√2, so its square is 1/2. The other two terms have |a|^2 and |c|^2 as 1/4 each.

So the probabilities for each eigenvalue are:

- P(ħ) = 1/4,
- P(0) = 1/2,
- P(-ħ) = 1/4.

The average of P_z is (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = 0, which matches our previous result.

The average of P_z squared is (1/4)*ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So the variance is 1/2 ħ², and the standard deviation is sqrt(1/2) ħ, which is ħ / sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which matches our calculation.

So the answer should be B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The given state is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix $P_z$ is diagonal in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. The eigenvalues correspond to the basis states $|1\rangle$, $|2\rangle$, and $|3\rangle$, respectively. The coefficients of $|\psi\rangle$ in this basis are:

\[
a = -\frac{1}{2}, \quad b = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad c = -\frac{1}{2}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot (-\hbar).
\]

Compute $|a|^2$, $|b|^2$, and $|c|^2$:

\[
|a|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Substitute these into the formula:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is also diagonal in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, with diagonal entries $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substitute the values of $|a|^2$, $|b|^2$, and $|c|^2$:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substitute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2$ and $\langle P_z \rangle^2 = 0$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} \hbar = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$.

Answer: B
