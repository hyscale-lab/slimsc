Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct molecular formula based on the given spectral data. Let me start by reading through the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So that means it's something like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group, which makes sense because esters have a carbonyl group (C=O) and an ester functional group. The 1H NMR gives some specific signals: two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals for –CH3 groups. No –CH2 signals, which suggests that there are no methylene groups in the structure.

Hmm, let's break this down. The aromatic ring being di-substituted means that there are two substituents attached to the benzene ring. The ester group is one of them, right? So the substituents could be an ester group and something else.

Wait, but esters are typically R-O-CO-O-R', or more accurately, an ester is an acyloxy group, like O-CO-O-R. No, wait, correction: esters are R-O-CO-R'. So the structure would be where an oxygen is connected to a carbonyl and another oxygen connected to an alkyl group. So the benzene ring has two substituents, one of which is an ester group.

But wait, the NMR shows two types of aromatic protons. In a benzene ring, the number of protons can vary depending on the substitution. For a di-substituted benzene, if the substituents are para, then there are two equivalent protons each in the ortho positions. If they are meta, then each substituent's adjacent protons would be different. Wait, but in a di-substituted ring, the substituents can be in para, meta, or ortho positions. Wait, but if the substituents are para, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. For example, if substituents are para, then the aromatic protons would be in two sets: two each. Wait, but the NMR shows two signals for aromatic protons. So maybe each aromatic proton is a pair but split into different signals. Hmm, perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the ring has two distinct sets of aromatic protons.

Wait, let me think. If the substituents are para, then each of the two substituents is opposite each other, leading to two sets of equivalent aromatic protons. For example, in para-dimethylbenzene (para-xylene), each ortho position has two equivalent Hs, so the NMR would show two singlets for the aromatic H. Wait, no, in para-xylene, the two substituents are opposite, so the ring has two sets of equivalent protons: the two Hs adjacent to each substituent are equivalent. So each set has two Hs, but they are split into two different signals because of the substituents' positions. Wait,
