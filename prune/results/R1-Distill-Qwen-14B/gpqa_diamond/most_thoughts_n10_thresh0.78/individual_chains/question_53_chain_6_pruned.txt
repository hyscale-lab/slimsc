Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So that's like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group. Esters have that carbonyl peak around 1700 cm^-1, so that's a key point. So the molecule must have an ester functional group, which is usually something like R-O-CO-R'.

Looking at the NMR data: There are six signals. Let's break down each part. Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents' positions will affect the splitting. If it's para-substituted, the aromatic protons would be a pair each as AB quartets, but maybe in some other pattern depending on the substituents.

Wait, but the problem says two signals for aromatic-H. Oh, wait, di-substituted benzene can have different substitution patterns. Like ortho, meta, or para. Each would have different NMR signals. For example, para would have two sets of equivalent protonsâ€”maybe each as a doublet, but perhaps more complex if the substituents are different.

Then, two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are from double bonds. Ester groups often have a carbonyl but might not have vinyl groups unless there's a double bond elsewhere, maybe in a substituent. Wait, but if the compound has an ester, perhaps one substituent is an ester group, and the other is something else, maybe a vinyl group?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The ester is O-CO-O, but if the substituent is an ester, then the other substituent might be a vinyl group or something else. But the NMR shows two vinyl-H signals. Hmm.

Wait, the substituents on the benzene ring could be an ester and a vinyl group. But wait, vinyl groups are CH2=CH-. So if the substituent is a vinyl group, like a CH2CH2 group attached to the ring, but then the protons on the vinyl would split into certain patterns.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a phenyl group attached via a double bond, like a styrene group. Wait, but that's a substituent with a double bond.

Wait, the NMR shows two vinyl-H signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So perhaps a vinyl group with two sets of protons, maybe on adjacent carbons. Like in a propenyl group or something else.

Another thought: perhaps one substituent is an ester, and the other substituent is a group with a double bond, like a vinyl group. For example, if one substituent is an ester like OAc (acetyloxy), and the other is a vinyl group (like CH2=CH2?), but maybe more complex.

Wait, maybe the substituents are such that each has a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2CH2COO... No, maybe it's better to think about the structure.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows two signals for -CH3 groups. Each with their own signals. So maybe two different methyl groups. So perhaps one is part of the ester (like OAc has a CH3COO group), but another methyl from somewhere else. Or perhaps the substituents
