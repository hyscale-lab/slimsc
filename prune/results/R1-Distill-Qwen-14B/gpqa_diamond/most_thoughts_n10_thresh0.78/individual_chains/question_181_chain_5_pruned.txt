Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun and their flux in two different energy bands. Hmm, I remember that the Sun produces neutrinos through various nuclear reactions in its core, and the pp chain is a big part of that. The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I should recall what the pp-III branch is. Oh right, the proton-proton chain has a few branches. The pp-I branch leads to boron-8 and then to carbon-12 via other reactions. The pp-II and pp-III are other branches, but I'm not entirely sure of the specifics. Wait, the pp-III branch involves higher mass states or maybe higher energy reactions, or perhaps it refers to a specific part of the pp chain that produces different neutrino energies.

Neutrinos are produced in the Sun mainly via the decay of boron-8 (I think that's from the pp chain), which emits a positron and a neutrino. The energy of these neutrinos probably depends on the specific reaction. So if the pp-III branch stops, that would affect the production of certain neutrinos.

The question is about the flux ratio between two bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to find what fraction of the neutrinos are in each band before and after the pp-III branch stops.

Wait, but the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Since neutrinos take about 8 minutes to travel from the Sun's core to Earth, that means any neutrinos emitted after the pp-III branch stopped would not have been produced. But neutrinos already on their way would still reach us.

Wait, no. If the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, that means any neutrinos emitted from the Sun's core in the last 8.5 minutes would have to come from processes that continued after the branch stopped, but wait, noâ€”if the branch stopped, any new neutrinos from that branch wouldn't be produced anymore. So the neutrinos we are detecting now are those that were emitted before the branch stopped.

Wait, but the Sun's core is about 8 minutes away in terms of light travel time. So
