Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem states: Two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Hmm, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction like in classical mechanics. Oh right, I remember the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1v2)/(c²)). Wait, or is it (v1 + v2) for opposite directions? No, wait, since both are moving in the same direction here, I think it's (v1 - v2) divided by (1 - (v1v2)/(c²)).

So let me plug in the numbers. v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So the numerator is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator would be 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²). Let me compute that part: 0.6 * 0.5 is 0.3. c times c is c², so denominator becomes 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c) / 0.7 = 0.142857c, which is approximately 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's a clue.

Now for the total energy. I think each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma times m c squared. So I need to calculate gamma for each mass and then sum their energies.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). 

First astronaut: mass 2m, velocity 0.6c. So v²/c² is 0.36. So denominator is sqrt(1 - 0.36) = sqrt(0.64) = 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So his energy is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, velocity 0.5c. v²/c² is 0.25. So sqrt(1 - 0.25) is sqrt(0.75) ≈ 0.8660. Gamma is 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So his energy is approx 1.1547 * 3m c². Let me calculate that: 3 * 1.1547 is about 3.464 m c².

So the total energy is 2.5 + 3.464 = about 5.964 m c². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², which matches. Option D is 5 mc², which is a bit lower. So the correct E would be 5.96 mc².

Looking back at the options, option C has v_rel =0.14c and E=5.96 mc². That matches both calculations I did.

So the answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic formulas.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is given by:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### First Astronaut (Mass \(2m\), Velocity \(0.6c\))
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Second Astronaut (Mass \(3m\), Velocity \(0.5c\))
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
