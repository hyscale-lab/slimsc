Okay, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. I remember that isomers can be constitutional or stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have different connectivity, while stereoisomers have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements.

The question has two parts: part A and part B. Let me tackle them one by one.

First, part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which doesn't show tautomerism. I think tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair, leading to different isomers, right? Like in ketones and aldehydes, but wait, no, that's keto-enol tautomerism. Benzoquinone—I think it's a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. Oh wait, benzoquinone can tautomerize, but wait, wait. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups, but if they're on a ring, maybe it can't? Or maybe it can. Alternatively, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups. Let me think about tautomerism conditions. For a compound to show tautomerism, it must have a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group. So, if the carbonyl is at a position where the adjacent carbon has a hydrogen, then tautomerism is possible.

Benzoquinone—like 1,4-benzoquinone. Structure-wise, it's a benzene ring with two ketone groups at the 1 and 4 positions. Each ketone is attached to a CH group. Wait, so each carbonyl is next to a CH, so each can potentially tautomerize. So benzoquinone can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. So if it can, then it does show tautomerism. Then which one doesn't?

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring, each at alternate positions. Each ketone is attached to a CH2 group maybe? Wait, no—cyclohexane is a six-membered ring, so 1,3,5-trione would have ketones at positions 1,3,5. So each of those carbons is connected to two other carbons in the ring and a carbonyl. Wait, each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group. So, the carbonyl is at a carbon that's attached to two other carbons, but does that mean the adjacent carbons (like the 2 and 6 positions) have hydrogens?

Wait, let me visualize. Imagine the cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at 1,3,5.
