Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about exoplanets and their orbital periods. I remember that Kepler's laws have something to do with this. Let me think.

Wait, the problem says the equilibrium temperatures are given. Oh right, the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star. The formula I recall is T = [(L (1 - a))/(16πσ D²)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and D is the distance. Since all three planets have the same albedo (0.3), that part should cancel out when taking ratios.

The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4. Let me write that as T1/T2 = 1.4. But wait, since T is proportional to (L/(D^2))^(1/4), the ratio would be (D2/D1)^(1/2), because T is inversely proportional to D^(1/2). So:

T1/T2 = (D2/D1)^(1/2) → 1.4 = (D2/D1)^(0.5). Squaring both sides gives (D2/D1) = 1.96. So D2 is about 1.96 times D1.

Next, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3's temperatures is 2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3. Using the same logic, (D3/D2)^(1/2) = T2/T3 → (D3/D2) = (2.3)^2 = 5.29. So D3 is 5.29 times D2.

Wait, but I think I might have inverted that. Wait, the formula is T is proportional to (1/D)^0.5, so T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1). So if T1 is higher than T2, D2 is larger than D1. Because closer planets are hotter. Right, so yes, D2 = 1.96 * D1.

Then, T2 is higher than T3. Wait, no, the ratio T2/T3 is 2.3. So T2 is bigger than
