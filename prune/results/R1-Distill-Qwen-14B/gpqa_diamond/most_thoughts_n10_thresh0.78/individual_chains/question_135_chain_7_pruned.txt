Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see. The question is about the possible decays of a boson X into fermion-antifermion pairs. The Lagrangian is given, and the mass of X is 6 GeV. I need to find which decay channels are kinematically allowed.

Hmm, right. When a particle decays, the energy of the parent particle must be at least the sum of the rest masses of the decay products. So for X to decay into a pair of fermions, each fermion's mass must be less than half of X's mass, because each gets some energy, but the minimum would be when they're at rest relative to each other. So X's mass is 6 GeV, so each fermion must have a mass less than 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait—actually, each fermion's mass must be less than or equal to half the mass of X. Because the combined rest mass of the two would be 2m, which must be less than or equal to the parent mass. So 2m ≤ 6 GeV → m ≤ 3 GeV.

So let's list the known fermion masses. Let me think. The top quark is way too heavy—like around 173 GeV. So that's way above 3 GeV, so it can't be a decay product. Next, the bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV, so that's out too. The charm quark is around 1.5 GeV, which is under 3. So charm can be a decay product. What about other quarks? Up, down, strange. Up is like 2 MeV, down maybe around 4-5 MeV, strange around 100 MeV. All way below 3 GeV. For leptons: electrons, muons, taus. Electrons are about 0.5 MeV, muons around 100 MeV, taus around 1.78 GeV. So the tau is 1.78 GeV, which is under 3 GeV. So the tau can be a decay product. Muons and electrons are also way under.

Wait, but wait: the tau is 1.78 GeV. So each tau is 1.78 GeV, so 2m is about 3.56 GeV. Oh wait, but X's mass is 6 GeV. Wait, wait. That's for the rest mass. But when X decays, the fermion pair must have rest mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. But wait, each fermion's mass is half that? Wait, no—each fermion's mass must be ≤ 3 GeV because the sum of the two rest masses can't exceed X's mass.

So for a pair like b bbar, each b quark is about 4.5 GeV, so 2*4.5=9 GeV, which is way more than X's 6 GeV. So b quarks can't be decay products. Same with top quarks, but top is already excluded because it's way heavier. So for the quarks, only the lighter ones (u, d, s, c) are possible. Wait, but let's check their masses:

u quark: ~2 MeV
d quark: ~4-5 MeV
s quark: ~100 MeV
c quark: ~1.5 GeV

All these are under 3 GeV, so their pairs are allowed. But wait, what about the tau? Tau is 1.78 GeV. So 2m would be 3.56 GeV. Wait, that's more than 6 GeV? No, wait no—oh wait, no, wait. X is 6 GeV. The sum of the two tau masses is
