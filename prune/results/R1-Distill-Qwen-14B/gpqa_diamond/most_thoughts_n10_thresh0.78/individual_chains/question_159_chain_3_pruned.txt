Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and cosmology. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So the question says that observations of a quasar are done in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. There's a peak at about 790 nm, and the flux drops a lot at wavelengths shorter than that. I'm supposed to figure out the comoving distance of this quasar from Earth based on the given cosmological parameters.

Wait, what do I remember about quasar observations and flux? Oh right, when you observe a quasar, the peak in the spectrum could be due to emission lines. But flux dropping at shorter wavelengths suggests something about the redshift. Oh, maybe it's about the Lyman-alpha forest or the Lyman limit. Because if the flux drops at wavelengths less than 790 nm, that might mean that certain emission lines are redshifted into the observed range. 

Wait, I think the Lyman-alpha line is at about 121 nm in the rest frame. If that line shifts to 790 nm, then the redshift z can be calculated. Redshift z is (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) minus 1. So 790 divided by 121 is roughly... let's calculate that. 790 / 121 is approximately 6.528. So z = 6.528 -1 =5.528. So z is about 5.53.

Wait, but wait a second. Because sometimes the Lyman-alpha emission line is at 121.6 nm. So if the peak is at 790 nm, the observed wavelength is 790 nm, which would mean the rest wavelength is 121.6 nm. So z = (790 / 121.6) -1. Let me compute that. 790 divided by 121.6 is approximately 6.499. So z is about 5.499. So roughly z=5.5.

But wait, another thought: quasars can have emission lines like Lyman-alpha. But if the flux drops for wavelengths less than 790, maybe that's the Lyman limit. Oh, wait, the Lyman limit is at 91.2 nm. So if the observed wavelength is 790, that would mean that
