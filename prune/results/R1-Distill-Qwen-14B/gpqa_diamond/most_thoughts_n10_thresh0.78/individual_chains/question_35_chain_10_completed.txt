Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, denoted as A_y. It's represented by a 2x2 matrix A_y, which is given as c multiplied by the matrix S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a specific 2x2 matrix.

The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So S looks like:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

The task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y and determine which of the given statements (A to D) is correct.

Hmm. So first, I think I need to write out the matrix A_y. Since A_y = c * S, and c is h/(4π), let's compute that.

So c = h/(4π). So each element of S gets multiplied by c.

So A_y is:
[ 0      -i * c ]
[ i * c    0   ]

Which substituting c:
[ 0      -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))   0    ]

But wait, maybe I should compute c*S first before worrying about the actual values. Because when we find eigenvalues, perhaps the structure is more important than the exact constants.

So, the matrix A_y is:

0      -i c
i c     0

Now, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(A_y - λ I) = 0.

The matrix (A_y - λ I) is:
[ -λ       -i c      ]
[ i c      -λ       ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i c)(i c) ) ].

Let me compute that.

Determinant = λ² - [ ( (-i c)(i c) ) ]

Wait, (-i c)(i c) is equal to (-i)(i) c². Because when you multiply the elements, the (1,2) and (2,1) entries are multiplied as (-i c)(i c) ?

Wait, no. The determinant is (a11 * a22) - (a12 * a21). So in this case, a11 is -λ, a22 is -λ. a12 is -i c, a21 is i c.

So determinant = (-λ)(-λ) - (-i c)(i c).

Let's compute each part:

First term: λ².

Second term: (-i c)(i c) = (-i * i) c². Since i * i is -1, so (-i) * i = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the product is (1) c².

Wait no, wait: (-i)*(i) = (-i * i) = -i² = -(-1) )= 1.

So the second term is 1 * c². So the determinant becomes λ² - (1 * c²) = 0.

So the equation is λ² = c².

Taking square roots, λ can be +c or -c. So the eigenvalues are λ = ± c.

But wait, what is c? c is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π) ?

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, the matrix A_y is c times S, and S is given as [[0,-i],[i,0]]. So when I compute A_y's matrix, each element is c multiplied by the elements of S.

So in the determinant calculation:

The matrix (A_y - λ I) is [[-λ, -i c], [i c, -λ]].

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (-i c)(i c).

So let's compute the product (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) * c².

Multiply (-i)(i): (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So (-i c)(i c) = 1 * c².

So determinant is λ² - (1)(c²) = 0 → λ² = c² → λ = ± c.

So the eigenvalues are c and -c, which are h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A says that the imaginary parts are ±2πh and the real parts are ±h/(4π), which doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues here are real? Or wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait a minute, because S is a 2x2 matrix. Wait, but S is a Hermitian matrix? Let me check.

Wait, S is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. Let's see if it's Hermitian. A Hermitian matrix has S = S†, where † is the conjugate transpose.

So S† would be the transpose of the conjugate of S. So the original matrix:

S = [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

The conjugate is [ [0, i], [-i, 0] ]

Transpose of that is [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

Which is the same as the original S. So yes, S is Hermitian.

If S is Hermitian, then c*S is also Hermitian (since c is real). So A_y = c S is Hermitian. Which means its eigenvalues are real. So the eigenvalues are real numbers, ± c.

So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). So their real parts are ± h/(4π), and the imaginary parts are zero. So any option claiming the eigenvalues are complex is wrong.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Im eigenvalues are ± 2πh and Re are ± h/(4π). So that's saying eigenvalues are complex, which can't be right since A_y is Hermitian. So Option A is incorrect.

Option B: Im parts are ±1/2, Re are ±1. Again, eigenvalues are real, so B is incorrect.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. Hmm. A^2 would be (c S)^2. Let's compute S^2.

S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So S^2 = S*S.

Compute each element:

First row, first column: (0)(0) + (-i)(i) = 0 + (-i²) = 0 - (-1) = 1.

First row, second column: (0)(-i) + (-i)(0) = 0 +0=0.

Second row, first column: (i)(0) + (0)(i) = 0 + 0=0.

Second row, second column: (i)(-i) + (0)(0) = -i² +0= -(-1) = 1.

So S^2 is [[1,0],[0,1]] = I.

So (c S)^2 = c² S^2 = c² I.

So A_y squared is (c S)^2 = c² I.

The eigenvalues of A_y squared would be (c^2) and (c^2), since I is the identity matrix multiplied by c². So each eigenvalue squared would be c², so that holds.

So the eigenfunctions of A_y are also eigenfunctions of A^2 because A^2 is a multiple of the identity matrix. So any vector is an eigenvector of A^2.

But what about Az? Az is another component of angular momentum, say, the z-component. I'm not exactly sure about the structure of Az, but in quantum mechanics, the different components of angular momentum (like S_x, S_y, S_z) don't generally share eigenvectors unless the system has certain symmetries.

So, for a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenstates of S_y are spin-up and spin-down in the y-direction. The eigenstates of S_z are spin-up and spin-down in the z-direction. These are different states. So if a state is an eigenstate of S_y, it's not an eigenstate of S_z unless it's some combination. So the statement in option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. So that's correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Hmm. Wait, I'm not exactly sure. The basis functions of the operator would likely be the eigenfunctions, but wait, the operator's matrix is 2x2, so its eigenvectors would form a basis for the space (since it's a 2x2 matrix), so perhaps D is correct. But wait, the statement is more about whether the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator Ay. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis for the space. So any vector in the space can be expressed in terms of these eigenvectors. So yes, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the operator. I'm not sure yet, but perhaps.

Wait, looking back: the question says, which statement is correct. Let's check each option.

Option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A^2 but not of Az. Since A^2 is c² I, as we saw, all vectors are eigenvectors. So C is correct because eigenfunctions of Ay will be eigenvectors of A^2, but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of Ay. So, the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator's space, which is correct. Because any 2x2 operator's eigenvectors (assuming they are diagonalizable) form a basis. So D seems correct as well.

Wait, but let me think again. The statement in option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. I'm not exactly sure what that means, but perhaps it's correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

Wait, but the question is which of the options is correct. So perhaps I need to evaluate which options are correct.

Wait, but let's look at the options again.

Option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az.

As I said, A^2 is c² I, so yes, any state is an eigenstate. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A^2. But what about Az? If Ay and Az don't commute, then their eigenvectors don't overlap. So a state that's an eigenstate of Ay won't be an eigenstate of Az. So C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Since the operator is 2x2, its eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but the options are presented as possible correct statements; the question is which statement is correct.

Wait, but in reality, the eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis for the space, so D is correct. But C is also correct. But looking at the options, which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I need to check the other options.

Wait, the problem statement says "which statement will you consider to be correct?" So we have to choose the correct option.

So let's reevaluate all the options.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be eigenfunction of A^2, but not of Az. That's correct because A^2 is proportional to identity, so all vectors are eigenfunctions, but Az has different eigenvectors.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Well, for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors (assuming they are two and linearly independent) form a basis. So the statement in D is correct.

Wait, but let me think again. All matrices have a basis of eigenvectors if they are diagonalizable. Since S is a Pauli matrix, it's diagonalizable, so A_y is diagonalizable, so its eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

So both C and D could be correct statements. But that's not possible because the options are mutually exclusive. Let me check the problem again.

The question asks which statement is correct, so perhaps all the options are presented, and only one is correct.

Let me think about each option again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az.

As established, since A^2 = c² I, all states are eigenstates, so the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A^2. So the first part is correct. The second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. That's correct because Az has different eigenvectors.

So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Yes, the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space, which is the same space that the matrix operates on. So D is correct.

Wait, but that would suggest both C and D are correct. But that can't be the case because the options are presented as choices.

Hmm. Let me re-express the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the eigenvalues. Let me go back.

Wait, the matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is a 2x2 matrix. Let me compute its eigenvalues.

The characteristic equation is det(S - λ I) = 0.

So determinant of [[-λ, -i], [i, -λ]] is λ² - ( (-i)(i) ) = λ² - (1) =0 → λ² = 1 → λ = ±1.

So the eigenvalues of S are ±1. So when we multiply S by c = h/(4π), the eigenvalues of A_y = c S are ±c.

So the eigenvalues of A_y are h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

So looking back at the options, option A says eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). But no, the eigenvalues are real, so A is incorrect.

Option B also suggests complex eigenvalues, which is incorrect.

So correct statements are C and D, but let me look at the answer options again.

Wait, each option is a statement, and we have to choose the correct one.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be eigenfunction of A^2, but not of Az.

Because the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenvectors of A^2 (as A^2 is c² I), which is correct. And they are not eigenfunctions of Az because the eigenvectors of Ay and Az don't align.

So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So yes, they form a basis because they are eigenvectors of a 2x2 matrix. So D is also correct.

Hmm, but wait, the options are presented as four choices, and only one is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in either C or D.

Wait, let's look at the statements again.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A^2 but not of Az.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator.

So let's analyze each.

Statement C is correct because A^2 is a multiple of identity, so any vector is an eigenvector. Thus, the eigenfunctions of Ay are indeed also eigenfunctions of A^2. As for Az, since the operator doesn't commute with Ay, their eigenvectors are different. So C is correct.

Statement D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Well, the matrix operator's eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space, which is 2D for a 2x2 matrix. So D is correct.

But that would imply that both C and D are correct, which isn't possible in a standard multiple-choice question. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps option D is not correct. Let me think again.

The statement in D is: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Wait, the basis functions refer to the functions used to express the operator as a matrix. The matrix representation depends on the basis chosen. The eigenfunctions of Ay form an orthonormal basis, but they are not necessarily the same basis as the one used to represent Ay as a matrix. Wait, no, because when you represent a matrix in its eigenbasis, it's diagonal. But in the question, the operator is given in a certain basis, which may or may not be its eigenbasis.

Wait, the matrix S given is not diagonal, so the basis used to represent S is not its eigenbasis. Therefore, the eigenfunctions of Ay are not the basis functions of the operator as given. So statement D is incorrect.

Wait, no. The eigenfunctions are a basis regardless of how the matrix is represented. The operator is expressed in the standard basis, but its eigenfunctions form another basis. So D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Well, the basis functions are the vectors that form the basis for the operator's space. So yes, the eigenfunctions form a basis. So D is correct.

But earlier analysis suggests C is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the question is only giving one correct option. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the eigenvalues.

Wait, S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Its eigenvalues are ±1. So when we multiply by c, A_y's eigenvalues are ±c.

So the eigenvalues are real, so options A and B are out.

So the correct options are either C or D.

Let me think about the eigenvectors.

To find eigenvectors of A_y:

For λ = c:

(A_y - c I) v = 0.

So matrix becomes:
[-c   -i c ]
[i c   -c ]

So the equations are:

- c v1 - i c v2 = 0 → -v1 - i v2 = 0 → v1 = -i v2.

So the eigenvector can be written as [ -i v2 ; v2 ] = v2 [ -i; 1 ].

So the eigenvector is proportional to (-i, 1) or (i, -1) if we factor out a negative.

Similarly, for λ = -c:

(A_y + c I) v = 0.

The matrix is:
[c    -i c ]
[i c   c ]

Equations:

c v1 - i c v2 = 0 → v1 = (i) v2.

So the eigenvector is [i v2; v2 ] = v2 [i; 1 ].

So the eigenvectors are [ -i; 1 ] and [i; 1 ].

These are the basis vectors for the eigenspaces.

Now, for option D: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. So the operator's matrix in this eigenbasis would be diagonal. But the given matrix S is not diagonal, so the basis in which S is expressed is not the eigenbasis. So the eigenfunctions (the eigenvectors) form a different basis. So the statement in D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. So the basis used to write the matrix operator as a 2x2 matrix is not necessarily the eigenbasis.

Wait, perhaps the wording is tricky. The operator's matrix is given in a certain basis, but its eigenfunctions form another basis. So the statement in D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the matrix operator. I think that's correct because any set of eigenvectors forms a basis for the space, regardless of how the operator is represented in another basis. So the statement in D is correct.

But earlier I thought C is correct. But perhaps the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is not correct because the basis functions of the operator are the ones in which the operator is represented, not necessarily the eigenfunctions.

Wait, perhaps the question is about whether the eigenfunctions are the basis of the operator. The operator's matrix is given in a certain basis (like the z-basis), but the eigenfunctions are in another basis (like the y-basis). So the statement in D is incorrect because the eigenfunctions are not the same as the basis used to represent the matrix operator. So option D is incorrect.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to think differently.

The options are:

Which is correct?

A: eigenvalues have Im parts ±2πh, Re parts ±h/(4π) → wrong because eigenvalues are real.

B: same issue, wrong.

C: eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A^2 but not Az → correct.

D: eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the operator → correct.

But the options can't both be correct. So perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option D. The basis functions of the operator are the basis in which the operator is expressed as a matrix. So the matrix given is in the z-basis, perhaps. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are not in that basis, so their basis is different. So statement D is false.

Wait, but the question states that the matrix S is given, and the operator is A_y = c S. So the operator's matrix is in some basis. The eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors of the operator, which form their own basis. So whether the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator depends on the context.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is saying that the eigenfunctions are the basis for the operator, meaning that the operator can be represented as a diagonal matrix in that basis. So statement D is correct.

But maybe the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about which options are correct.

Looking again at the options:

Option C: Correct because eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², but not Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator → correct.

But if both are correct, which one is the correct option?

Wait, looking at the problem statement again, the question asks, during the calculation, which statement will you consider to be correct.

So which of the options is correct based on the calculation.

I think I should proceed with the conclusion that option C is correct.

So, the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are real. So the options A and B can be eliminated. The eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors of Ay, which are orthogonal. Since A_y and A_z (the z-component) don't commute, their eigenvectors are different. So C is correct. The eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A^2 but not of Az.

As for option D, perhaps it's incorrect because the eigenfunctions are not necessarily the basis in which the operator is represented, unless the operator is diagonal in that basis. Since the matrix S is not diagonal, the eigenfunctions are not the basis in which the operator is expressed. So option D is incorrect.

Alternatively, the statement in D may be correct because the operator's eigenvectors form a basis, regardless of the original basis. So the statement in D is correct.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. But based on the analysis, I think option C is correct.

Wait, but what about the calculation of eigenvalues? Let me make sure.

The eigenvalues of A_y are ± c, which is h/(4π). So they're real.

So the correct statement regarding eigenvalues is none of A and B, because they suggest complex eigenvalues. So the correct statements are C and D.

But I have to choose between C and D.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C.

So the correct answer is option C.


The problem involves the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), represented as a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( S \) is Hermitian, as \( S = S^\dagger \). This ensures that \( A_y \), being a scaled version of \( S \), is also Hermitian. Therefore, its eigenvalues are real.
   - The eigenvalues of \( S \) are \( \pm 1 \), as solving the characteristic equation \( \det(S - \lambda I) = 0 \) yields \( \lambda^2 = 1 \). Consequently, the eigenvalues of \( A_y = c \cdot S \) are \( \pm c = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).
   - Options A and B are incorrect because they suggest complex eigenvalues, which contradicts the Hermitian nature of \( A_y \).

2. **Eigenvectors of \( A_y \):**
   - For \( \lambda = c \), the eigenvector is proportional to \( \begin{bmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).
   - For \( \lambda = -c \), the eigenvector is proportional to \( \begin{bmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).
   - These eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis for the \( 2 \times 2 \) space.

3. **Option C:**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), since \( A^2 = (c \cdot S)^2 = c^2 \cdot I \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix. Thus, all vectors are eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \).
   - However, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \) (the Z-component of angular momentum), as the eigenvectors of \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not align (they correspond to different directions in angular momentum space).
   - This makes Option C correct.

4. **Option D:**
   - The statement claims that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the operator \( A_y \). While the eigenfunctions do form a basis for the \( 2 \times 2 \) space, the matrix representation of \( A_y \) is given in a different basis (not its eigenbasis). Thus, the eigenfunctions are not the basis functions of the operator as represented.
   - This makes Option D incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is **Option C**, as the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) but not of \( A_z \).

Answer: C
