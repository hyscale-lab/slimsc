Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what's being asked here.

The question starts with cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, right? So it's a six-membered ring with a ketone group attached. 

First step: treated with bromine, forming product 1. Hmm, adding bromine to a ketone... Wait, I think when ketones react with bromine, it's a type of addition reaction. Oh, right! It's the addition of bromine to the carbonyl group. So the carbonyl oxygen (O) is attacked, and the double bond breaks, adding Br across. So cyclohexanone (which has the structure (CH2)5CO) would add Br2. The product would be 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. Wait, no, wait. No, wait. When a ketone adds bromine, where does the Br go?

Wait, alternative thought: maybe it's a different reaction. Oh, wait! Oh, I think I made a mistake. Because cyclohexanone doesn't open up the ring when adding bromine. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing with another reaction. Let me think. Cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. When bromine is added, such as in an addition reaction, it would add across the carbonyl. So the carbonyl (C=O) becomes C-Br-O-Br? No, wait, that's not right. Oh wait, no. Bromine adds to the carbonyl, which is a ketone. So the mechanism is that the carbonyl oxygen is a good leaving group once the Br attacks. Wait, no, that's more like an acid-catalyzed addition. Alternatively, maybe it's an enolate formation? Or perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, maybe it's a dihydroxylation? No, that's with something else, like OsO4 or another oxidizing agent. Oh wait, bromine in a different solvent? If cyclohexanone is treated with bromine (maybe in a non-polar solvent), perhaps it undergoes an electrophilic addition. So the carbonyl group (C=O) would react, with Br adding to the carbonyl carbon. Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Another possibility is that cyc
