Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation. Hmm, annihilation usually involves a particle and its antiparticle. In this case, it's a proton and an antiproton annihilating into two A+ and two A- particles. I remember that in annihilation, the rest mass energy is converted into other forms, maybe kinetic energy or other particles.

The problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving. So if the antiproton is slow, maybe its kinetic energy is low compared to the rest mass. Wait, but wait, in high-energy physics, even slow might be significant, but perhaps we can treat it using non-relativistic speeds. Or maybe not. I'm not sure yet.

The mass of A is given as mA c² = 300 MeV. Oh, right, the rest mass energy of each A particle is 300 MeV. So each A has a rest mass of 300 MeV/c².

The question is asking for the velocity of particle A. So I need to find v in terms of c.

Let me think about conservation laws here. Since it's an annihilation process, both energy and momentum must be conserved. Also, since the initial movement is only from the antiproton, but wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Wait, the proton is moving? Or is the antiproton moving? The problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so I think the initial system has some momentum.

Wait, the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Proton has charge +e, and antiproton has -e. When they annihilate, they produce two A+ and two A- particles. So the charges must balance. Let me check: A+ has +e, and A- has -e. Two each: 2*(+e) + 2*(-e) = 0. The initial system is p + p̄, so the charge is zero as well. So charge is conserved.

But the main point is energy and momentum. The initial system has the proton at rest? Or both moving? Wait, no, the problem states the antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly. Alternatively, maybe it's a head-on collision, but I'm not sure. Wait, the problem states it's an annihilation process, so it's probably a collision between p and p̄.

Wait, the initial setup is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A-. The antiproton is moving slowly, so I'll assume its speed is much less than c, but maybe that's not the case. Hmm.

Wait, but if the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is small compared to its rest mass energy. So perhaps in that case, the total energy is approximately the sum of their rest energies plus a small kinetic part. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait, let's think about the initial and final states. The initial state has a proton at rest (maybe) and a moving antiproton. So the initial momentum is just that of the antiproton. The final state has four particles: two A+ and two A-.

Wait, but the problem says 2A+ and 2A-. So four particles in total. But each pair would have opposite charges, but how about their momenta? Maybe they're all moving in some symmetric way. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's symmetric, so the two A+ and two A- are moving in some symmetric pattern to conserve momentum. Maybe they are moving in pairs, or maybe all four are moving in the same direction but with some arrangement.

Wait, but dealing with four particles is a bit complicated. Maybe there's a way to simplify the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the annihilation produces two pairs of particles, each pair moving in opposite directions to conserve momentum. But I'm not sure.

Wait, considering the initial momentum. Since the proton is at rest, the antiproton's momentum is p = gamma m_p v, where v is the velocity of the antiproton. Since it's moving slowly, perhaps we can approximate gamma as close to 1, so p ≈ m_p v.

The final state has four particles. To conserve momentum, their total momentum must equal the initial momentum. But if all four are moving in the same direction, their momenta would add up. Alternatively, perhaps two are moving in one direction and two in the opposite, but that might complicate things.

Wait, another approach: the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe it's in the non-relativistic limit. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps we can use conservation of energy and momentum with relativistic equations.

Hmm, another thought. The annihilation happens, and the products are two A+ and two A-. But maybe the process is symmetric, so the two A+ and two A- are emitted in a symmetric way, perhaps in pairs. Maybe each A+ and A- are moving in opposite directions, so their combined momentum cancels each other. But that doesn't make sense because
