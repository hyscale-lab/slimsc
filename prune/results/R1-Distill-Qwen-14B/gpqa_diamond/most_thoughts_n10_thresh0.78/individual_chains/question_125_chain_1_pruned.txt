Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, it's about a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given as V(r) = (1/2)mω²r². I remember that the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator can be treated as three independent 1D harmonic oscillators in each direction (x, y, z). But wait, in spherical coordinates, it's a bit different. Oh right, because in spherical coordinates, the potential depends only on r, so it's isotropic.

So the question is asking for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with the same energy eigenvalue. Let me think.

First, I need to recall the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. The energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is a non-negative integer (n = 0, 1, 2, ...). Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. In 3D, the energy levels are determined by the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Oh right, the energy is E = (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) ħω. But since the system is isotropic, the states with the same sum nx + ny + nz have the same energy. So the energy depends on the total quantum number, which I think is called n, where n = nx + ny + nz.

Wait, but another way I've heard it is that for each energy level, you can have different combinations of the quantum numbers nx, ny, nz that sum up to the same n. So the energy depends only on this sum. So the energy levels are E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...). So each state is determined by the sum n = nx + ny + nz.

Wait, but sometimes the principal quantum number is used, but in 3D harmonic oscillator, the states are labeled by n_x, n_y, n_z.

Wait, so the ground state is n=0, with E = (0 + 3/2) ħω = (3/2) ħω. So the first excited state would be n=1, E = (1 + 3/2) ħω = (5/2) ħω. Second excited state is n=2, E= (2 + 3/2) ħω = (7/2)ħω. Third excited state is n=3, E= (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2)ħω. So the energy is (9/2)ħω.

Looking at the options, option A and C have (9/2)ħω as the energy. Option C says the number of eigenfunctions is 3, which I don't think is right.

Now, the second part: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue? That is, how many distinct eigenfunctions correspond to the same energy level, which is the degeneracy of the state.

In 3D harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy for a given n is (n + 1)(n + 2)/2? Wait, no. Wait, for each energy level with a given n, the number of possible states (i.e., the degeneracy) is the number of ways to write n as the sum of three non-negative integers, which is a classic combinatorial problem. The formula for the number of states with a given total n is (n + 2 choose 2), which is (n+2)(n+1)/2. Wait, wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Oh wait, when you have three variables, the number of non-negative integer solutions to nx + ny + nz = n is (n + 3 -1 choose 3 -1) ) = (n + 2 choose 2) = (n+2)(n+1)/2. So yes.

So for n=3, the number of
