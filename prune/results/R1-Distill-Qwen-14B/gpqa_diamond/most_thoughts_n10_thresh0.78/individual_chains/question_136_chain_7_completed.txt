Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r². The magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, ∇·f, inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. The options are provided, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, okay. So first, I remember that divergence is a measure of how much a vector field spreads out or converges at a point. The divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the surface integral of the field over the boundary. But wait, maybe I can compute the divergence directly and then integrate it over the volume.

Given that f(r) has only a radial component, let's denote the vector field as f(r) = f(r) * r̂, where r̂ is the unit radial vector in spherical coordinates. Since f(r) = 1/r², f(r) = (1/r²) r̂.

Now, I need to compute the divergence of f. In spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field A = A_r r̂ + A_θ θ̂ + A_φ φ̂ is given by:

∇·A = (1/r²) [ ∂(r² A_r)/∂r + (1/r) ∂(A_θ r sinθ)/∂θ + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂(A_φ sinθ)/∂φ ]

But in this case, our vector field only has an A_r component, so A_θ and A_φ are zero. That simplifies the divergence to:

∇·f = (1/r²) ∂(r² f(r)) / ∂r

Because the other terms vanish. So substituting f(r) = 1/r² into this expression:

r² f(r) = r² * (1/r²) ) = 1

So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. Therefore, ∇·f = (1/r²) * 0 = 0.

Wait, does that mean the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin? Because at r=0, the field isn't defined since f(r) would be 1/0, which is infinity. But for r>0, the divergence is zero.

If the divergence is zero everywhere inside the volume (except the origin, which is a point of measure zero in integration), then the volume integral of the divergence over the sphere of radius R would be zero.

But wait, wait a second. There's a catch here. I remember that for vector fields with a singularity at a point (like the electric field of a point charge), the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, but the integral over a volume enclosing the origin is not zero. Because the divergence theorem says the integral of divergence is the flux through the surface. For example, for electrostatics, Gauss's law says that the integral of E·dA is Q_enc / ε₀, which isn't zero unless there's no charge enclosed.

Wait, but in this case, the divergence itself is zero except at r=0. So the integral over the volume should be zero? That can't be right because I remember that for a vector field like the electric field of a point charge (which is similar: radial field, depends on 1/r²), the divergence is zero except at the origin, but the flux through a Gaussian surface is non-zero, but the volume integral of the divergence is zero because the divergence is zero.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The divergence theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the flux through the surface. So if the divergence is zero everywhere inside except the origin, then the integral would be zero. But for the electric field, the divergence is zero everywhere except origin, but the flux isn't zero because the field lines terminate or start at the origin. So in that case, the divergence at the origin would account for the flux.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me approach this more carefully.

If the vector field is defined everywhere except the origin (r=0), then for any r>0, the divergence is zero. So integrating ∇·f over the entire sphere of radius R (assuming R is not zero) would give zero because the integrand is zero everywhere in the volume except at r=0.

But wait, what about the origin? The divergence at r=0 is undefined because the field isn't defined there, but the volume integral is over r from 0 to R. So mathematically, the integral is the sum over all points except the origin, where it's zero. So the integral should be zero.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the divergence theorem again. The divergence theorem says that the volume integral of ∇·f over a volume V is equal to the flux of f through the surface of V. So if I have a vector field that behaves as 1/r², like the electric field of a point charge, then the flux through a sphere of radius R would be Q_enc / ε₀, which is non-zero.

But in that case, the divergence of the electric field is zero except at r=0, where it's a delta function. So the integral of the divergence over the volume would be the charge enclosed. So for a positive charge at the origin, the integral would be positive.

Wait a minute! So in this problem, the vector field is similar. So what's the divergence in this case? Let me compute it correctly.

The field is f(r) = (1/r²) r̂. Let's compute the divergence.

Using the spherical coordinates formula:

∇·f = (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² f_r) + ... (other terms are zero because f_θ and f_φ are zero)

So f_r = 1/r².

r² f_r = r² * (1/r²) ) = 1.

d/dr (1) = 0.

So ∇·f = (1/r²) * 0 = 0.

So the divergence is zero everywhere except where r=0, which is a point. But the integral over the volume would be zero because the divergence is zero except at a single point, which doesn't contribute to the integral (since it's measure zero).

But wait, wait. I'm getting a contradiction here. Because in the case of the electric field, the divergence is zero everywhere except the origin, but the integral is non-zero because of the delta function at the origin.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the divergence. Let me recalculate.

Wait, another approach: in the case of the electric field, E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q r̂ / r²), and the divergence of E is zero except at r=0, where it's a delta function. So ∇·E = (1/ε₀) δ³(r).

So integrating ∇·E over all space would give 1/ε₀ times the charge enclosed. But in this problem, perhaps the field isn't the same as the electric field.

Wait, but the problem states that the field's magnitude is 1/r² and it's radial. So perhaps it's similar to the electric field of a charge, but maybe without the 1/(4πε₀) factor. But regardless, the divergence would be zero except at the origin, leading to a volume integral that's zero except when the origin is included.

Wait, but the problem says the field is defined as 1/r², so perhaps the divergence is zero except at r=0.

So the volume integral of the divergence would be zero because the divergence is zero everywhere in the volume except at r=0. But wait, the sphere of radius R includes the origin if R is positive. So whether the origin is included or not.

Wait, when R is greater than zero, the sphere definitely includes the origin. So, how does that affect the integral?

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the divergence theorem again. The divergence theorem says that the flux through the surface is equal to the integral of the divergence inside. But if the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, then the integral is zero. But in reality, the flux is not zero, which suggests there's a mistake in the divergence computation.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the divergence. Let me check.

The vector field f(r) = (1/r²) r̂. So f_r = 1/r². The other components are zero.

Compute ∇·f in spherical coordinates:

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r) + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂(f_φ sinθ)/∂φ + (1/r) ∂/∂θ (f_θ sinθ)

But since f_θ and f_φ are zero, their terms vanish. So:

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) ) = (1/r²) d/dr (1) = 0.

So the divergence is zero everywhere except r=0. But according to the divergence theorem, if the divergence is zero except at a point, the integral over any volume that includes that point would not necessarily be zero. Because the divergence doesn't exist there, but the flux does.

Wait, perhaps the divergence is zero, but in reality, the field isn't defined at r=0, but for r>0, the divergence is zero. So integrating over any finite volume (like the sphere of radius R>0) would just give zero because the integrand is zero everywhere except at a single point, which contributes nothing to the integral.

But I'm confused because in the case of the electric field, the divergence is zero except at the origin, but the flux is non-zero. So the integral of the divergence is the enclosed charge.

Wait, but in that case, the divergence isn't zero everywhere else. The divergence of E is (1/ε₀)ρ, where ρ is the charge density. For a point charge, ρ is a delta function at the origin. So ∇·E = (1/ε₀) δ³(r). So the integral of ∇·E over any volume that contains the origin is (1/ε₀) q_enc, which is the charge enclosed.

In our problem, the vector field f(r) = (1/r²) r̂. Let's compute the divergence again.

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr [ r² (1/r²) ) ] = (1/r²) d/dr (1) = 0.

So the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0. But wait, is there a delta function contribution? Because in the case of the electric field, the divergence includes a delta function at the origin.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the concepts here. Let's think about the problem again. The divergence is zero everywhere except r=0, which is a point. So the integral over any volume that includes r=0 would be zero, because the integrand is zero everywhere except at a point, which doesn't contribute to the volume integral.

Wait, but wait. When you have a vector field that behaves like 1/r², and you compute the divergence, perhaps the divergence isn't zero in the mathematical sense, but it has a delta function contribution. Because the divergence theorem says that the integral is equal to the flux, which for such a field would be a delta function at the origin.

So perhaps I need to compute the divergence more carefully, considering the origin.

Let me think again: the vector field f(r) = (1/r²) r̂.

Compute the divergence:

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² (1/r²)) ) = (1/r²) d/dr (1) ) = 0.

But this is only valid for r≠0. At r=0, the field is singular. So, mathematically, the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, but the integral over any volume containing r=0 would involve a delta function.

Wait, perhaps not. Because the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, but the flux through the surface isn't zero. So I'm getting conflicting results.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the flux through the surface of the sphere of radius R and then see what that implies for the integral of the divergence.

The flux Φ is the integral of f · dA over the surface. f is radial, so f · dA is f(r) * r² sinθ dθ dφ.

So Φ = ∫ (1/r²) * r² sinθ dθ dφ over the surface. The r in the denominator cancels with the r² in the numerator. So Φ = ∫ sinθ dθ dφ from 0 to π and 0 to 2π, respectively.

The integral becomes ∫ (from 0 to 2π) dφ ∫ (from 0 to π) sinθ dθ.

The φ integral is 2π. The θ integral is ∫0^π sinθ dθ = 2.

So Φ = 2π * 2 = 4π.

Wait, but according to the divergence theorem, the flux Φ should equal the integral of the divergence over the volume.

But earlier calculation suggested the divergence is zero, so the integral would be zero. But the flux is 4π.

This is a contradiction. So where did I go wrong?

Ah, I think I see. My approach to compute the divergence as zero is correct in regions where r>0, but the divergence isn't zero in the mathematical sense because the field has a singularity at r=0. So the divergence isn't zero in the distributional sense. It must have a delta function contribution at the origin.

Wait, but how does that work. Let me think.

In the case of the electric field, E(r) = (1/(4πε₀)) (q r̂ / r²). The divergence of E is (1/ε₀) δ³(r). So the integral of ∇·E over any volume containing the origin is q/ε₀.

So in our problem, if the vector field is f(r) = (1/r²) r̂, the divergence would be something similar. Let me compute it.

Compute the divergence using the formula for the divergence in spherical coordinates.

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r) + other terms (which are zero here).

f_r = 1/r².

So ∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr ( r² * (1/r²) ) = (1/r²) d/dr (1) ) = 0.

But this is only valid for r ≠ 0.

However, when considering the flux through a surface enclosing the origin, the divergence must account for the singularity at r=0. So perhaps the divergence isn't zero in the distributional sense. Let me compute it using the limit approach.

The flux through a small sphere of radius a around the origin.

Flux Φ_small = ∫ f · dA = ∫ (1/a²) * a² sinθ dθ dφ = ∫ sinθ dθ ∫ dφ = 4π.

So the flux through any small sphere around the origin is 4π. According to Gauss's law, this flux is equal to the integral of the divergence over the volume enclosed.

So ∫ (over volume) ∇·f dV = Φ_small = 4π.

But wait, since f(r) is given as 1/r², and the flux through any small sphere is 4π, it suggests that the integral of the divergence over a volume enclosing the origin is 4π.

But earlier, I thought that the divergence was zero except at the origin, leading to the integral being zero. But that's not correct because the divergence has a delta function at the origin. So the correct approach is to realize that ∇·f includes a delta function term.

Thus, the integral of ∇·f over the sphere of radius R would be 4π, since the volume encloses the origin.

Wait, but earlier my calculation suggested that the divergence is zero. This is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the identity for the divergence of a radial vector field in spherical coordinates. Let me recall that formula.

For a radial vector field F(r) = F(r) r̂, the divergence is:

∇·F = (1/r²) d/dr (r² F(r)).

So applying this to F(r) = 1/r²:

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) ) = (1/r²) d/dr (1) ) = 0 for r≠0.

But this doesn't account for the singularity at r=0.

So, the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, but the integral over any volume enclosing r=0 is 4π.

Wait, that makes sense now. So when we integrate the divergence over the volume, the integral equals 4π, which is the flux through the surface, because the divergence has a delta function at the origin contributing 4π δ³(r).

Wait, but how do we reconcile this with the earlier calculation where divergence was zero?

I think the mistake was in assuming that the divergence is zero, but in reality, the divergence is a distribution with a delta function at the origin. So, the divergence isn't zero; it's zero everywhere except at r=0, where it's a delta function.

So the integral of ∇·f over the sphere of radius R is 4π, because the volume encloses the origin and the divergence contributes a delta function there.

But wait, the options given don't have 4π as the correct answer for the integral. Let me look at the options again.

Options are:

A) 4 π

B) 1

C) 4/3 π R 

D) 0

Wait, the problem says that the field's magnitude is 1/r², and the field is only radial. So according to the flux calculation, the integral of the divergence is 4π, but the options include 4π as option A.

But wait, earlier I thought that the divergence is zero except at the origin, so the volume integral would be zero. But that's not correct if the divergence includes a delta function.

So the correct answer would be 4π, which is option A.

But wait, in the problem statement, the vector field is only defined as having magnitude 1/r² and radial. So the flux through a surface of radius R would be 4π, as calculated earlier (since Φ=∫ f · dA = ∫ (1/r²) * r² sinθ dθ dφ = ∫ sinθ dθ ∫ dφ = 4π).

So according to the divergence theorem, the integral of the divergence ∇·f over the volume is equal to the flux, which is 4π.

But wait, the question is about the volume integral of the divergence, which would be 4π.

So the correct answer is option A) 4π.

But wait, that's conflicting with my earlier calculation where the divergence is zero. What's the confusion here?

Ah, perhaps the problem is that the divergence is zero except at the origin, leading to the integral being zero. But the divergence theorem says that the integral equals the flux, which is 4π. So something is wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing two different approaches. Let me think again.

If the vector field f(r) is given as 1/r² radial, then the divergence is zero except at the origin. So the integral over any volume that doesn't include the origin would be zero. But if the volume includes the origin, like the sphere of radius R>0, then the integral is the flux through the surface, which is 4π.

But according to the divergence formula, the divergence is zero, which would imply the integral is zero. But according to the flux calculation, it's 4π. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in how I compute the divergence. Let me recompute it.

f(r) = (1/r²) r̂.

Compute ∇·f in spherical coordinates:

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r) + ... (other terms are zero)

f_r = 1 / r².

So,

(1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ) ] = (1/r²) d/dr (1) = 0.

So, mathematically, the divergence is zero except at r=0, but physically, the flux isn't zero. So there's a contradiction.

Ah, I think the mistake is that the vector field f(r) = 1/r² r̂ is not the same as the electric field of a point charge. Because for the electric field, the divergence is a delta function at the origin, but for this f(r), the divergence is zero except at the origin.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because the divergence depends only on the form of the vector field.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the vector field f(r) isn't the same as the electric field. Let me think about the units. The electric field of a point charge has a divergence of (charge)/(ε₀ r³), which is a delta function. But for f(r) = 1/r², perhaps the divergence is zero everywhere except the origin, but the flux is 4π.

Wait, but the flux I calculated earlier was 4π, which would imply that the integral of the divergence is 4π. But according to the divergence formula, the divergence is zero, so the integral should be zero. So which one is right?

Alternatively, perhaps the divergence is not zero, and I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's compute the divergence again, but in a different way. Let's take the gradient of f(r) and see.

Wait, f(r) is a vector field, so perhaps I can write it as f(r) = F(r) r̂, where F(r) = 1/r².

The divergence is ∇·(F r̂) = (1/r²) d/dr (r² F) )

= (1/r²) d/dr ( r² * (1/r²) ) )

= (1/r²) d/dr (1) ) = 0.

So again, I get zero.

But then, why does the flux through the surface give 4π?

Ah, perhaps the field isn't defined at r=0, so the divergence theorem doesn't apply directly because the field isn't differentiable at r=0. But the flux through the surface is still 4π, which suggests that the integral of the divergence over the volume is 4π, despite the divergence being zero elsewhere.

This suggests that the divergence must have a delta function contribution at r=0, which would make the integral non-zero.

But according to the mathematical calculation, the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0. So the integral over the volume would be zero, but the flux is 4π.

So I'm stuck. Let me think about similar vector fields.

In the case of the electric field of a point charge, the divergence is (1/ε₀) ρ, where ρ is the charge density. For a point charge, ρ is a delta function. So in that case, the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, and the integral of the divergence over any volume containing the origin is (1/ε₀) q.

In our problem, the vector field is f(r) = (1/r²) r̂. So perhaps the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, but the flux through a surface enclosing the origin is 4π. So the integral of the divergence would be 4π.

But according to the divergence formula, the divergence is zero, which would imply the integral is zero. So this is a contradiction.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the divergence in terms of distribution theory. The vector field f(r) has a divergence that is zero everywhere except at r=0, but in the distributional sense, it includes a delta function. So the divergence is ∇·f = 4π δ³(r). Then, the integral of ∇·f over the volume would be 4π times the number of enclosed origins, which is 1. So the integral is 4π.

But wait, how do I know that ∇·f is 4π δ³(r)?

Because when I compute the flux through a small sphere around the origin, I get 4π, which must equal the integral of ∇·f over that small volume. So ∫ (∇·f) dV = 4π. Since the small volume contains the origin, the only contribution comes from the delta function. So, ∇·f = 4π δ³(r).

Therefore, the integral of ∇·f over the sphere of radius R is 4π, because the origin is inside R.

So the correct answer should be 4π, which is option A.

But wait, earlier I thought that the divergence is zero, leading to the integral being zero. But that's only when the vector field is differentiable everywhere in the volume. Since f(r) is singular at r=0, the divergence isn't zero in the distributional sense. So the correct approach is to include the delta function.

Therefore, the integral is 4π, option A.


The problem involves evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field \( \mathbf{f}(r) \) inside a sphere of radius \( R \) centered at the origin. The vector field is radial, with magnitude \( f(r) = \frac{1}{r^2} \), and it has no components in the angular directions (\( \theta \) or \( \phi \)) in spherical coordinates.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Divergence Calculation**:  
   In spherical coordinates, the divergence of a radial vector field \( \mathbf{f}(r) = f(r) \hat{r} \) is given by:
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 f(r) \right).
   \]
   Substituting \( f(r) = \frac{1}{r^2} \), we find:
   \[
   r^2 f(r) = r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} = 1.
   \]
   Taking the derivative with respect to \( r \), we get:
   \[
   \frac{d}{dr} (1) = 0.
   \]
   Therefore, the divergence is:
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \cdot 0 = 0 \quad \text{for } r \neq 0.
   \]
   The divergence is zero everywhere except at \( r = 0 \), where the field is singular.

2. **Flux Through the Surface**:  
   Using the divergence theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the flux of \( \mathbf{f} \) through the surface of the sphere of radius \( R \). The flux is given by:
   \[
   \Phi = \int \mathbf{f} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\pi f(r) r^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi.
   \]
   Substituting \( f(r) = \frac{1}{r^2} \), the \( r \)-dependence cancels out:
   \[
   \Phi = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\pi \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi.
   \]
   The \( \phi \)-integral gives \( 2\pi \), and the \( \theta \)-integral gives \( 2 \). Thus:
   \[
   \Phi = 2\pi \cdot 2 = 4\pi.
   \]

3. **Divergence Theorem and Singularity**:  
   While the divergence \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} \) is zero everywhere except at \( r = 0 \), the singularity at the origin contributes a delta function in the distributional sense. The flux through the surface of the sphere (which encloses the origin) is \( 4\pi \), so the volume integral of the divergence must also equal \( 4\pi \).

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The volume integral of the divergence of \( \mathbf{f} \) inside the sphere of radius \( R \) is \( 4\pi \), as the divergence includes a delta function contribution at the origin.

### Critical Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (\( 4\pi \))**: Correct, as the flux through the surface is \( 4\pi \), and the divergence theorem ensures the volume integral equals this value.
- **Option B (\( 1 \))**: Incorrect, as the integral is not a dimensionless number like \( 1 \).
- **Option C (\( \frac{4}{3}\pi R \))**: Incorrect, as the integral does not depend linearly on \( R \).
- **Option D (\( 0 \))**: Incorrect, as the integral is not zero due to the singularity at the origin.

### Final Answer:
The volume integral of the divergence of the field inside the sphere is \( 4\pi \).  
**Answer: A**
