Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Alright, let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem says that a Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino's rest mass is probably negligible since neutrinos are super light, right? So I can treat it as zero for this problem.

Hmm, the question is about the kinetic energy of each product. Oh wait, but since the pion is at rest initially, the total momentum before decay is zero. So the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum. That makes sense.

So, the total energy before decay is just the rest mass of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. But wait, the neutrino has negligible mass, so its energy is just its kinetic energy since its rest mass energy is almost zero.

Let me write down the conservation equations. 

Conservation of energy:
m_π c² = E_mu + E_nu

Conservation of momentum:
p_mu = p_nu (since opposite directions, their magnitudes are equal)

Each particle's energy is given by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². Since neutrino's mass is near zero, E_nu = pc. So E_mu = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 )

Wait, so plugging into the energy conservation equation:

m_π c² = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) + p c

Let me denote m_π as M, m_mu as m. So,

M c² = sqrt( p² c² + m² c^4 ) + p c

I can square both sides perhaps to eliminate the square root. Let's rearrange first.

sqrt( p² c² + m² c^4 ) = M c² - p c

Now square both sides:

p² c² + m² c^4 = (M c² - p c)^2

Expanding the right side: (M c²)^2 - 2 M c^3 p + p² c²

So, left side: p² c² + m² c^4 = M² c^4 - 2 M c^3 p + p² c²

Subtract p² c² from both sides:

m² c^4 = M² c^4 - 2 M c^3 p

Rearranging to solve for p:

2 M c^3 p = M² c^4 - m^2 c^4

p = (M² - m²) c / (2 M)

Wait, let me check that again. So, moving the terms:

m² c^4 = (M² c^4 - 2 M c^3 p + p² c² ) - p² c² → m² c^4 = M² c^4 - 2 M c^3 p

So, move the 2 M c^3 p to the left:

2 M c^3 p = M² c^4 - m² c^4

Factor out c^4 on the right:

= c^4 (M² - m² )

So, p = [ c^4 (M² - m²) ] / (2 M c^3 )

Simplify the expression:

p = [ c (M² - m²) ] / (2 M )

So, yeah, p = c (M² - m^2)/(2 M )

Wait, but let's compute it numerically. Let me plug in the numbers.

M is 139.6 MeV/c², m is 105.7 MeV/c².

Compute M²: 139.6^2 ≈ let's see, 140^2 is 19600, but 139.6 is 0.4 less. So 139.6^2 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 (MeV/c²)^2.

Wait, but I might just calculate it directly. 139.6 *139.6.

Let me compute 139 *139 first. 139^2 = (140-1)^2= 140² - 2*140*1 +1 = 19600 -280 +1= 19321.

Then 139.6 is 139 +0.6. So,

(139 +0.6)^2 = 139² + 2*139 *0.6 + 0.6² = 19321 + 166.8 + 0.36 = 19488.16 (MeV/c²)^2. Right.

Similarly, m^2 is (105.7)^2.

105^2 is 11025. 105.7 is 105 +0.7.

(105.7)^2 = (105)^2 + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7² = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49 (MeV/c²)^2.

So M² - m² = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 (MeV/c²)^2.

Now, numerator is c times this, so p = (c * 8315.67 ) / (2 *139.6 )

Wait, wait. Let me compute it step by step.

p = [ c (M² - m²) ] / (2 M )

So, plugging in the numbers:

= c * (8315.67) / (2 * 139.6 )

Compute denominator: 2*139.6 = 279.2.

So 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's calculate.

279.2 * 29 = let's see, 280 *30 is 8400, which is a bit higher than 8
