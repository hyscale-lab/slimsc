Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember all the details, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says: We have a particle of mass m moving in an isotropic three-dimensional potential V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh wait, I remember that this is the potential for a 3D harmonic oscillator. So the potential is like a 3D version of the simple harmonic oscillator. And the force obeys Hooke's law, which makes sense because the potential is quadratic in r.

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions exist for that energy eigenvalue. Hmm, okay.

First, I need to recall how the energy levels work for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. I think the energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers in each direction. Since it's isotropic, the potential is the same in all directions, so the energy should depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction.

In a 3D isotropic HO, the energy levels are given by E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), right? Or wait, maybe it's (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) multiplied by ħω? Let me think. Each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so adding them up gives ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2). Yeah, that sounds right.

Now, the total quantum number for the energy level is n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So the energy depends on n. The ground state is n=0, first excited n=1, second n=2, third n=3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the ground state is the lowest energy, so the energy for n=0 would be 3/2 ħω. Then, the first excited state is when n=1, leading to energy (1 + 3/2) ħω = (5/2) ħω. Second excited state would be n=2, energy (2 + 3/2) ħω = (7/2) ħω. Third excited state is n=3, energy (3 + 3/2) = (9/2) ħω. So the energy is (9/2) ħω. That would make the first part of the answer (9/2) ħω.

Now, the second part: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy? That's the degeneracy of the energy level. Because for each n, the number of states depends on the number of ways you can write n as the sum of n_x, n_y, n_z, where each n_i is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...).

So for a given n, the degeneracy is the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = n. Hmm, I remember that this is a combinatorial problem. The formula for the number of solutions is (n + 3 - 1 choose 3 - 1) ) which is (n + 2 choose 2). Wait, but wait, is that correct?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c = n is (n + 3 - 1 choose 3 -1) )= (n +2 choose 2) ). So yes, that's (n+2)(n+1)/2.

But wait, wait. Let me think about it again. For n =0: the only solution is (0,0,0), so degeneracy is 1. For n=1: possible states are (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). So 3 states. The formula (1+2) choose 2 would be 3 choose 2 = 3, which matches. For n=2: the solutions are permutations of (2,0,0) and (1,1,0). So 3 (from 2,0,0) and 3 (from 1,1,0) but wait, no. Wait, for (2,0,0), there are 3 permutations. For (1,1,0), how many permutations? Well, 3 ways. So total 3 + 3 =6. Using the formula (2+2 choose 2 )=4 choose 2=6. Yep, that's correct.

So for the third excited state, n is 3. Therefore, the number of eigenfunctions is (3+2 choose 2 )=5 choose 2 = 10. So the degeneracy is 10.

So putting it together, the energy is (9/2) ħω, and the degeneracy is 10. So looking at the options, option A says (9/2) ħω and 10. That should be the correct answer.

But let me double-check the options.

Option A: (9/2) ħω, 10.

Option C: (9/2) ħω, 3 — so that would be if degeneracy was 3, which is for n=1. Because n=1 had 3 states. So that's not correct for the third excited state.

So the correct answer is option A.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle of mass $m$ moving in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$. The energy levels of such a system are quantized and given by:

\[
E = \hbar \omega \left(n_x + n_y + n_z + \frac{3}{2}\right),
\]

where $n_x$, $n_y$, and $n_z$ are the quantum numbers in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions, respectively. The total quantum number is $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, and the energy depends on $n$. The degeneracy of each energy level corresponds to the number of ways $n$ can be expressed as the sum of $n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers. This degeneracy is given by the combinatorial formula:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{n + 2}{2}.
\]

For the third excited state, $n = 3$. Substituting into the energy formula:

\[
E = \hbar \omega \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

The degeneracy for $n = 3$ is:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{3 + 2}{2} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy eigenvalue. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**A) $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 10$**

Answer: A
