Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. Let me go through each piece of information one by one.

First, the FTIR spectrum. A very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1 usually indicates the presence of O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But it's a broad peak, so maybe it's an alcohol because carboxylic acids tend to have very strong and broad O-H stretches, but sometimes it's hard to tell. Then, there are strong absorptions at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in a conjugated carbonyl or perhaps an ester or ketone.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the molecule probably has a double bond, maybe something like an alkene group.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z 45. I remember that 45 is often indicative of the tropylium ion, which comes from benzene rings, but wait, benzene's molecular weight is 78, so maybe it's a substituted benzene? Alternatively, the fragment could be from something else. Let me think about common fragments. 45 could also be CH3CO+ (the acetyl group), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an ethene fragment or something else.

Now, considering the options:

Options are:
A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

Each has different degrees of unsaturation. Let me calculate the degrees of unsaturation (DoU) for each.

DoU formula is DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X (halogens) or N here.

For each option:
A) C6H12O2: C=6, H=12, O=2.
DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So that's one ring plus one double bond, or two double bonds, or a ring and a double bond.

B) C6H10O: DoU = (14 -10)/2 = 2. So two rings, or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

C) C6H10O2: DoU = (14 -10 - 0 +0)/2 = 2. Same as B, but two oxygen atoms.

D) C6H12O: DoU = (14-12)/2 =1. So same as option A but with one oxygen.

The FTIR suggests a carbonyl group (1700 cm^-1), which is a double bond (C=O). That would account for one DoU. The 1650 cm^-1 might be another carbonyl or possibly an aromatic ring. Wait, aromatic C=C rings have strong absorption around 1600 cm^-1. But if it's a conjugated carbonyl, maybe it's lower.

So let's think about possible structures. If the molecule has a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid), then that's one DoU. If there's a double bond (vinyl H's in NMR), that's another DoU. But wait, the NMR says vinyl H's, so that's a double bond, which is another DoU.

So the DoU should be at least two: one for the carbonyl, one for the double bond.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: DoU 1. Not enough because we have at least two DoU (C=O and double bond). So A is unlikely.

Option B: DoU 2. So that fits, two DoU. What could that be? Maybe a cyclic compound with an oxygen. But wait, if it's C6H10O, with DoU 2, that could be a cyclic ether with a double bond, but that would need to have an O in the ring, like a dioxolane or something. Or maybe a carbonyl and a double bond.

Option C: DoU 2. So same as B, but with two oxygen atoms. So possibilities include two carbonyl groups or a carbonyl and something else. Or perhaps an ester group (which has a carbonyl and an ether linkage, which would contribute two DoU: the carbonyl and the ether as a ring? No, wait, ether is single bond, so ether doesn't contribute to DoU. Wait, no: ether is O connecting two carbons, which doesn't add any DoU. So in an ester, the carbonyl is one DoU, and the ester group is O connected to two carbons, which doesn't add DoU. So if the molecule has a carbonyl and a double bond, that's two DoU. For option C, which is C6H10O2, that would be possible if there's a carbonyl and a double bond elsewhere.

Option D: DoU 1. So only one DoU. So if there's only a carbonyl, but no double bond? But the NMR says vinyl H's, meaning a double bond. So D is unlikely.

So options B and C could be possible.

But wait, the FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000, which suggests an -OH group. So looking at the options:

Option B: C6H10O. So formula would have one O. Could be an alcohol or something else. If an alcohol, then the O is in an -OH group.

Option C: C6H10O2. Two O's. Could be an ester (like R-O-CO-R'), which would have two O's, but would also have an ester group which has a carbonyl. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid (which would have -COOH, which is two O's in that group). But a carboxylic acid would have a broad O-H stretch, which fits the FTIR.

Wait, the FTIR IR has a very broad peak at 3000, which is typical for an -OH (like in an alcohol or carboxylic acid). Also, the strong peaks at 1700 (C=O) and 1650. So if it's a carboxylic acid, the C=O would be around 1700. But then, the 1650 could perhaps be an aromatic ring? Or another carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is the C=C in an alkene.

Wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so there's a double bond. So perhaps the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid or ester. That would explain the 1650 cm^-1 as the conjugated C=C.

So considering that, let's think about structures.

If it's a carboxylic acid, like perhaps acrylic acid (but that's C3H4O2). But the molecular formulas are all C6, so maybe something like hex-2-enoic acid (but let me check the formula: C6H10O2). Wait, that would fit option C. Let me think: the formula for a carboxylic acid is CnH2nO2. So hex-2-enoic acid would be C6H10O2. Because the general formula is CnH2n-1COOH, which is Cn+1H2n+1O2. Wait, maybe I'm getting the formula wrong here. Let me think again.

Wait, for a carboxylic acid: RCOOH. So the formula would be CnH2nO2. So for a six-carbon carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), it's C6H12O2. But if there's a double bond (like in acrylic acid, which is CH2=CHCOOH), which is C3H4O2. So for a six-carbon with a double bond, it would have one less hydrogen. So for CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH, that would be C6H10O2. That fits option C.

Alternatively, the compound could be an ester with a double bond. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3. But the formula would be C9H12O2, which is more than the options given. So perhaps it's a cyclic ester or another arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ketone with an alcohol group? No, that's more complicated.

But looking back, the mass spectrum has a peak at m/z 45. Let me think about possible fragments. 45 could correspond to the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but wait, that's 91. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, the fragment could be from an ethyl group? Wait, 45 is the mass for (CH2CH2O) something? Or perhaps a methyl group with some oxygen.

Wait, another thought: 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CO+ (acetone ion?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, 45 is the mass of CH3COO+ (acetic acid's ion). Because CH3COOH has a molecular weight of 60, but if it loses a proton, it would be 60-1=59? Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, 45 could be C3H7O+. Or maybe it's the fragment from the loss of something else. Hmm. Maybe it's the ethyl group (if the compound is losing a larger fragment), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's the loss of water or something else.

But perhaps another approach is to look at the molecular formulas and calculate their degrees of unsaturation.

Option C: C6H10O2. So DoU is (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. So that can be a carbonyl (1) and a double bond (1). Which fits with the data: FTIR shows C=O, and the NMR shows vinyl H's (double bond).

Alternatively, if the structure is a cyclic ester (like a lactone), which would have both a carbonyl and a ring, so that's two DoU. But then, would the NMR show vinyl H's? A lactone doesn't necessarily have a double bond. So that might not fit. Unless it's a gamma or delta lactone with a double bond elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diol with a carbonyl? Not sure.

Another angle: the FTIR shows peaks at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is probably a carbonyl. The 1650 could be an aromatic ring (C=C stretch around 1450-1600 cm^-1), but if it's a conjugated carbonyl, the C=C could be at around 1650. So, maybe an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl group. That would mean the molecule has both a carbonyl and a double bond conjugated to it. That would fit with the NMR showing vinyl H's.

So putting all together, the compound has a carbonyl group (1700 cm^-1) and a conjugated double bond (1650 cm^-1) and an O-H group (broad peak at 3000 cm^-1). So, maybe it's a carboxylic acid with a conjugated double bond.

If that's the case, then the formula would likely be C6H10O2 because it has two oxygen atoms (from the -COOH group) and the double bond.

Alternatively, it could be an ester with a double bond, but the O-H peak in the IR suggests a hydroxyl group, which would be present in a carboxylic acid but not in an ester. Unless it's an ester with an alcohol, but that's less likely.

So, if it's a carboxylic acid with a double bond, the formula would be C6H10O2. That's option C.

Wait, but option A is C6H12O2. That formula would have DoU= (14-12)/2=1. So only one ring or double bond. But earlier, we thought there's a carbonyl (double bond) and a double bond elsewhere (vinyl H in NMR), which would require two DoU. So option C seems more likely.

Another point: The mass spectrum. If it's a carboxylic acid, perhaps it loses CO2 or something else. But the fragment at m/z 45 might come from the loss of some group.

Wait, let me think about the possible structures. If the formula is C6H10O2, and the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH. Then, during mass spectrometry, it might break in a way that a fragment with m/z 45 forms. For example, losing the COOH group as CO2 (mass 44) and leaving a CH2=CHCH2CH2+ which would be 56. Hmm, not matching 45.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is something like methyl vinyl ketone with an O-H group? Not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the molecular ion breaks into a fragment that's C3H7O+ with a mass of 45. Because (3*12)+(7*1)+(16)= 36+7+16=59. No, that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe it's CH3COO+ (which is 45: 12*2 + 1*3 + 16*2= 24+3+32=59? Wait, no, 12*2=24, 1*3=3, 16*2=32. 24+3=27+32=59. So that's 59, not 45.

Wait, perhaps it's something else. Maybe the fragment is (CH2)2O, which is 44. So close. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH2CH2O), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH3CH2O group, which would be 45? Wait, CH3CH2O would be 45: 2 carbons (24) + 5 H (5) + O (16) = 45. So yes, 45 is the mass of CH3CH2O+ (ethoxy group). So maybe the compound has an ethoxy group.

Wait, but the original formula for option C is C6H10O2. If the fragment is ethoxy (CH2CH2O, mass 45), which has a mass of 45, then that might suggest that the compound has an ethoxy group. But in that case, the molecular formula would have O2, which would fit option C (two O's).

Alternatively, if the compound is an ester like ethyl something-ester, then upon fragmentation, it might lose the ethyl group as a fragment. But wait, the fragment is at 45, which is the mass of the ethoxy group. So the parent ion could lose the ester group, leaving behind the rest.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely confident about this. Another approach is to think about the molecular formulas.

The molecular formulas are:

A) C6H12O2 → Degree of Unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2 =1 → one ring or double bond.

B) C6H10O → DoU = (14-10)/2 =2 → two rings or double bonds.

C) C6H10O2 → DoU=2.

D) C6H12O → DoU=1.

The IR suggests a carbonyl (1700, so one DoU). The NMR has vinyl H's (another DoU). So the compound must have at least two DoU. So option A and D have only one DoU, which is insufficient. So the correct formula must be either B or C.

Now, considering the IR shows a broad peak at 3000, which suggests an O-H group. Option B is C6H10O. So the O is in an -OH group (since it's a broad peak). So the structure could be a cyclic ether with a double bond and an -OH group? Or perhaps a diol with a double bond. Alternatively, it could be an alcohol with a conjugated carbonyl group.

But wait, the IR shows a strong absorption at 1700 and 1650. So if option B has only one O, it's more likely that O is in an alcohol group, so the 1700 peak must come from somewhere else. But an alcohol doesn't have a carbonyl. So perhaps that's a problem. Because the IR shows a carbonyl group (1700 cm^-1), which would require an O in a carbonyl. So if option B is C6H10O, which has only one O, that O is in an alcohol group, but where is the carbonyl coming from? That doesn't add up. Because the O is in the alcohol, and there's no other O for a carbonyl.

So if the FTIR shows a carbonyl, which requires another O, then option B can't have that. Because option B only has one O. So option B is less likely.

That leaves option C: C6H10O2. So two oxygen atoms. One in a carbonyl group (C=O) and another perhaps in an -OH group. That would fit the IR data: broad peak from -OH, and strong peak from C=O.

So putting it all together: the compound has a carbonyl group (C=O), an -OH group, and a double bond (vinyl H's). The molecular formula has two oxygen atoms, which fits option C.

So the correct answer should be option C: C6H10O2.


To determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound, we analyze the provided data:

### FTIR Analysis:
- A broad absorption at **3000 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of an **O-H group** (likely an alcohol or carboxylic acid).
- Strong absorption at **1700 cm⁻¹** suggests a **C=O group** (carbonyl).
- Absorption at **1650 cm⁻¹** could correspond to a conjugated **C=C bond** or another carbonyl group.

### ¹H NMR Analysis:
- Peaks corresponding to **vinyl hydrogens** indicate the presence of a **C=C double bond**.

### Mass Spectrometry:
- A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** suggests the presence of a **CH₃CH₂O⁺ (ethoxy group)** or similar fragment.

### Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):
The DoU is calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{DoU} = \frac{2C + 2 - H}{2}
\]
- **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂):**  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{2(6) + 2 - 12}{2} = 1
  \]
  This is insufficient, as the compound requires at least two DoU (one for the C=O and one for the C=C).

- **Option B (C₆H₁₀O):**  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{2(6) + 2 - 10}{2} = 2
  \]
  While the DoU matches, the single oxygen atom cannot account for both the O-H and C=O groups, making this option unlikely.

- **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂):**  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{2(6) + 2 - 10}{2} = 2
  \]
  This fits the data: one DoU for the C=O and one for the C=C. The two oxygen atoms can account for both the O-H and C=O groups.

- **Option D (C₆H₁₂O):**  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{2(6) + 2 - 12}{2} = 1
  \]
  This is insufficient, as the compound requires at least two DoU.

### Conclusion:
The compound must have a **C=O group**, a **C=C double bond**, and an **O-H group**. Based on the FTIR, NMR, and mass spectrometry data, the molecular formula **C₆H₁₀O₂** (Option C) is the most consistent, as it satisfies all the observations.

Answer: C
