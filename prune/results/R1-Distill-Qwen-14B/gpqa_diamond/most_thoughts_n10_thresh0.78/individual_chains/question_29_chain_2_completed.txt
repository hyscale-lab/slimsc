Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's read through it carefully.

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and then sequenced the target gene in all these mutants. The changes are in the first exon area. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Hmm, so the intact gene has a specific sequence, and each mutant has a different change. The idea is that disrupting the gene, probably through a mutation that causes a premature stop codon or a significant change in the protein structure, would stop the production of the compound.

Let's look at each mutant's sequence.

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.
So the first part is ATG, which is the start codon. Then TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGT...

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Compared to the intact gene, let's see. The first part is ATGTTCTA... Wait, the fourth nucleotide: intact is T, mutant 1 is T. Wait, let me line them up.

Intact: 5’-ATG T TT C TCG C TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA CAT...
Mutant 1: 5’-ATG T TCT A CGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, looking at the first part: the intact has TTTCTC. Mutant 1 has TTCTAC. So perhaps a substitution at position 4 or 5. Let me count the letters.

Alternatively, maybe looking for frameshifts or in-frame changes. But all the options seem to be point mutations, not insertions or deletions. Because each mutant's sequence is the same length as the wild type. So they're substitution mutations.

So, the question is which substitution leads to a change in the amino acid that would disrupt the gene's function. If the change is in a critical part of the protein, maybe leading to a nonfunctional enzyme, thus stopping the production of the anti-nutritional compound.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the mutation creates a premature stop codon. If a stop codon is introduced early, the protein would be truncated and likely nonfunctional.

Looking at each mutant:

First, let's look for stop codons in the mRNA. The mRNA is read in triplets, so any mutation that changes a codon to UAA, UAG, or UGA would cause a stop.

But let's think about the DNA sequences. The original gene starts with ATG, which is the start codon (methionine) in mRNA as AUG.

Looking at the first exon area. Let's focus on the changes.

Mutant 1's sequence: The first part is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So, in the DNA, the original is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.
Mutant 1: the fourth nucleotide is T in the original, but in mutant 1, maybe it's C? Wait, maybe I should compare the sequences.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look at the differences. Let me compare each position:

Intact:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

Mutant 1:
ATG TTCTACGCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ...

Wait, maybe I can split them into codons to see the amino acid changes.

Intact gene's first few codons:

ATG (start) - TTT (Phe) - CTC (Leu) - GCT (Ala) - GGT (Gly) - ACT (Thr) - TCT (Ser) - GTG (Val) - GAT (Asp) - GAA (Glu) - CAT (His) - ATT (Ile) - TAT (Tyr) - TGT (Cys) - CGT (Arg) ...

Mutant 1's sequence:

ATG - T TCT ACG C TGG TAC T TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ...

Wait, maybe it's better to write out each codon.

Wait, the original is 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA-3’.

Mutant 1: 5’-ATG TTCTACGCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA-3’.
Wait, perhaps I should parse each triplet.

Wait, maybe aligning the sequences:

Intact: 
Position 1-3: ATG
4-6: TTT
7-9: CTC
10-12: GCT
13-15: GGT
16-18: ACT
19-21: TCT
22-24: GTG
25-27: GAT
28-30: GAA
31-33: CAT
34-36: ATT
37-39: TAT
40-42: TGT
43-45: CGT

Mutant 1:
Look at the sequence. Let me see:

Mutant 1: ATG T TCT A CGC TGG TAC T TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC… TGA.

Wait, perhaps the first few codons are ATG, then T TCT A, which would be ATG, then T, TCT, A... Wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe the mutation is in the third codon.

Wait, perhaps I should write each codon for each mutant.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutations are causing a stop codon. Let me check each mutant for any possible stop codons in frame.

Wait, another approach: look for any codon that becomes a stop codon (UAA, UAG, UGA) in the mRNA.

But wait, the DNA is given as 5' to 3'. The mRNA is the same as the DNA but T becomes U.

So, for each mutation, let's see if any codon becomes a stop codon.

Let's take each mutant one by one.

Mutant 1:

DNA: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Looking at the first part:

ATG T TCT A CGC TGG TAC T TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC…

Wait, the first few codons:

ATG (start) → methionine.

Next, the next three nucleotides after ATG in the intact gene are TTT (codon Phe). In Mutant 1, the next three after ATG are T TCT A, but that doesn't form a proper triplet. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the alignment.

Wait, perhaps the first codon is ATG, then the next codons are based on the next triplets.

Intact:

Positions 4-6: TTT → Phe

7-9: CTC → Leu

10-12: GCT → Ala

Mutant 1:

Looking at the same positions: 4-6 would be TCT, because the DNA is ATG T TCT... Hmm, maybe not. Let me try to line up the sequences.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that each mutant's DNA is longer, but I'll have to see the exact point of mutation.

Alternatively, perhaps each mutant has a substitution in the first exon, which is part of the coding sequence.

The problem is that without knowing exactly where the mutations are, it's a bit tricky, but perhaps looking for a frameshift or a stop codon.

Alternatively, maybe the mutations are missense, but which one would disrupt the protein's function.

Wait, but the anti-nutritional compound is made by the protein product of this gene. So, disrupting the gene (so the protein is not made, or is nonfunctional) would eliminate the compound.

So, the best way is to find a mutation that causes a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation), leading to a truncated, nonfunctional protein.

Let's look for any of the mutants where a codon becomes a stop codon.

Let me go through each option.

Option A) Mutant 2.

Mutant 2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So, same as Mutant 1 but perhaps the middle part is different.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is:

ATG T TCT AAG CTG G... Hmm, let's look for stop codons.

AAG in DNA is AAA in mRNA, which is lysine. Not a stop. CTG is GCT in DNA—wait, no, wait.

Wait, CTG is the DNA, so mRNA would be CUG, which is leucine. Hmm, not a stop.

Wait, perhaps a different approach. Let me look for any triplet in the DNA that, when converted to mRNA, would be a stop codon.

So, for a stop codon, mRNA would have UAA, UAG, or UGA.

Looking for any codon in each mutant that becomes one of these.

Let's do this for each mutant.

Mutant 1:

5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Looking for triplet sequences that would become stop codons.

Let's look at each codon:

ATG → AUG (start, Met)
TTCTA → Wait, that can't be. Oh wait, each codon is three nucleotides. So let's line up each codon.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact mutations. Maybe a better approach is to look for a frameshift, but all the mutants have the same length as the intact gene, so no frameshift. So it's substitution only.

So, perhaps the mutation alters a codon to a stop.

Looking for any codon that when read as mRNA would be UAA, UAG, or UGA.

Let me check each mutant's sequence.

Mutant 1: Let's see the codons.

ATG (start)
Then, next triplet after ATG is TTCTA? Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the first codon is ATG, then the next codons are TTT in the intact gene. Let me compare.

Intact gene's first few codons:

ATG (1-3)
TTT (4-6)
CTC (7-9)
GCT (10-12)
GGT (13-15)
ACT (16-18)
TCT (19-21)
GTG (22-24)
GAT (25-27)
GAA (28-30)
CAT (31-33)
ATT (34-36)
TAT (37-39)
TGT (40-42)
CGT (43-45)
... and ends with TGA, which is a stop codon in DNA, but in mRNA, TGA would be UGA, which is a stop.

Wait, wait. The intact gene ends with ...TGA-3', which is the stop codon. So in the DNA, the stop codon is at the end.

So, now looking at each mutant.

Mutant 1:

Looking at the DNA sequence, the first part is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.

So, the first few codons are:

ATG (1-3) → Met
TTT (4-6) → Phe in the intact gene. In Mutant 1, the 4-6 would be TCT perhaps? Wait, let me see:

Wait, the intact gene's first exon starts as ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant 1: ATG TTCTACGCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, perhaps the change is in the third codon. Let me see:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant 1: ATG T TCT ACG C TGG TAC T TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, perhaps the third codon in the intact is CTC (Leu), and in Mutant 1, it's TCA or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the second codon in the intact is TTT (Phe), and in Mutant 1, it's TCT (Ser) or something else.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to look for any triplet that becomes UAA, UAG, or UGA in the mRNA.

Looking at Mutant 1's sequence:

After ATG, let's see what comes next. The DNA is TTCTACGCT... So, the first codon after ATG is TTCTA? No, each codon is three nucleotides. So:

ATG is first triplet (1-3). Then, the next triplet is TTT in intact, but in Mutant 1, perhaps it's TCT.

Wait, perhaps I can write the DNA as:

ATG T TCT A CGC TGG TAC T TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try for each mutant.

Mutant 1:

Looking for any triplet that's TAG, TGA, or TAA in DNA. Because these in DNA would translate to UAG, UGA, UAA in mRNA, which are stop codons.

Looking through the DNA of Mutant 1, any triplet that matches TAG, TGA, or TAA?

The end is TGA, which is the same as the intact gene. So that's the normal stop codon.

So in Mutant 1, is there any other TGA or TAG?

Looking at the sequence:

The beginning: ATG T TCT ACG C TGG TAC T TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC… TGA.

Wait, the first few triplets after ATG:

Triplet 4-6: TTA? No, in the intact it's TTT. In Mutant 1, perhaps it's TCT.

Wait, perhaps I should find if any codon in any mutant has a triplet that is a stop codon.

Let me check each mutant:

Mutant 1:

Looking for TAG, TGA, TAA in the DNA. The very end is TGA, which is the normal stop. So no earlier stop.

Mutant 2:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Same as Mutant 1 but perhaps different in the middle.

Looking for TAG, TGA, TAA.

In the middle: AAG.

In DNA, AAG is the triplet. So mRNA would be AAA, which is lysine, not a stop. CTG is GCT in DNA, but mRNA is CUG → Leu.

No stop codons in the middle. The end is TGA again.

Mutant 3:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Looking for any stop codons.

Any TAG, TGA, TAA?

Looking through the sequence:

After ATG, the next triplet is TTT (same as intact) → Phe.

Then TAC → in DNA, TAC is TAC. mRNA is UAC → Tyr.

Wait, but in the mutant, the next triplet after TTT is TAC. Maybe?

Wait, no, let me parse the DNA sequence of Mutant 3:

ATG TTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

So, the first triplet is ATG.

Second triplet is TTT (positions 4-6).

Third triplet: TAC (positions 7-9), which would be Tyr.

Then GCT (10-12) → Ala.

GGT (13-15) → Gly.

ACT (16-18) → Thr.

TCT (19-21) → Ser.

GTG (22-24) → Val.

GAT (25-27) → Asp.

GAA (28-30) → Glu.

CAT (31-33) → His.

ATT (34-36) → Ile.

TAT (37-39) → Tyr.

TGT (40-42) → Cys.

CGT (43-45) → Arg.

Wait, looking for any triplet being TAG, TGA, or TAA.

The end is TGA, same as before.

So, no early stop codon.

Mutant 4:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Looking for any triplet that's TAG, TGA, TAA.

The sequence starts with ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, first triplet: ATG. Second: TTT → Phe. Third: TAC → Tyr. Fourth: GCT → Ala. Fifth: ACT → Thr. Sixth: TCT → Ser. Seventh: GTG → Val. Eighth: GAT → Asp. Ninth: GAA → Glu. Tenth: CAT → His. Eleventh: ATT → Ile. Twelfth: TAT → Tyr. Thirteenth: TGT → Cys. Fourteenth: CGT → Arg. Fifteenth: ... perhaps another triplet.

Wait, the end is TGA again. No earlier stop codons.

Wait, but wait. Maybe the DNA has a TGA somewhere else.

Looking at Mutant 4's DNA:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA.

Hmm, so where else is there a TGA? Only at the end.

Wait, but in the middle, perhaps the DNA has CTG, which is CTT in some mutant? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach is needed. Maybe the mutation changes a codon to a stop.

Alternatively, maybe the mutation is in a splice site, but the question says the changes are in the first exon area, so probably not affecting splicing.

Alternatively, perhaps look for any codon that is changed to a stop in the mRNA.

Wait, perhaps the mutation in Mutant 4 changes a codon to a stop.

Wait, let's look at each mutant for any codon that becomes a stop.

Mutant 1:

DNA: ATG T TCT A CGC TGG TAC T TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... TGA.

Looking at each codon:

ATG → Met.

T TCT A → Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the next few codons are TCT, ACG, etc. Let me think:

After ATG (1-3), the next codon is TCT (4-6) → Ser. 

Then ACG (7-9) → Thr.

TGG (10-12) → Trp.

TAC (13-15) → Tyr.

TCT (16-18) → Ser.

GTG → Val.

GAT → Asp.

GAA → Glu.

CAT → His.

ATT → Ile.

TAT → Tyr.

TGT → Cys.

CGC → Arg.

No stop codons except the last one.

Mutant 2:

DNA: ATG T TCT AAG CTG GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... TGA.

Codons:

ATG → Met.

TCT → Ser.

AAG → Lys.

CTG → Leu.

GGT → Gly.

ACT → Thr.

TCT → Ser.

GTG → Val.

GAT → Asp.

GAA → Glu.

CAT → His.

ATT → Ile.

TAT → Tyr.

TGT → Cys.

CGC → Arg.

No stops except the end.

Mutant 3:

DNA: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA.

Codons:

ATG → Met.

TTT → Phe.

TAC → Tyr.

GCT → Ala.

GGT → Gly.

GTC → Val.

ACT → Thr.

TCT → Ser.

GTG → Val.

GAT → Asp.

GAA → Glu.

CAT → His.

ATT → Ile.

TAT → Tyr.

TGT → Cys.

CGT → Arg.

No stops except the end.

Mutant 4:

DNA: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA.

Codons:

ATG → Met.

TTT → Phe.

TAC → Tyr.

GCT → Ala.

ACT → Thr.

TCT → Ser.

GTG → Val.

GAT → Asp.

GAA → Glu.

CAT → His.

ATT → Ile.

TAT → Tyr.

TGT → Cys.

CGT → Arg.

Hmm, so none of the mutants have a stop codon in the middle except the end TGA.

So perhaps another approach is needed. Maybe the mutation changes a critical amino acid, leading to a nonfunctional protein. Alternatively, perhaps the mutation is a nonsense mutation elsewhere.

Wait, but all the mutants don't have any new stop codons except the normal one. So perhaps I need to think about missense mutations that disrupt the protein's function.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation is in the start codon. Let me check.

In all the mutants, the first codon is ATG, so the start is fine.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation creates a new start codon upstream, leading to a longer protein. But that's less likely to disrupt the function.

Wait, perhaps the mutation introduces a frameshift. But all the mutants are same length as the original, so no frameshift.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

The problem says that the anti-nutritional compound is made by the gene product. So, disrupting the gene would stop production.

If the mutation creates a stop codon elsewhere, the protein would be shorter and possibly nonfunctional. Alternatively, perhaps the protein's active site is disrupted.

Wait, perhaps the mutation is in a critical region, such as a catalytic site. For that, I'd need to know which amino acids are critical, but I don't have that info.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation in one of the codons changes it to a stop codon.

Wait, let me check each mutation again.

Looking for any triplet in the DNA that becomes TAG, TGA, or TAA in the mRNA.

Wait, the DNA is given as 5' to 3', and the mRNA is same as the DNA but T→U. So, any triplet in DNA that is TGA would become UGA in mRNA, which is a stop.

So, looking for any occurrence of TGA in the DNA, apart from the end.

Mutant 1:

Sequence has TGA only at the end. So, same as original.

Mutant 2:

Same as above; only the end has TGA.

Mutant 3:

No TGA except the end.

Mutant 4:

No TGA except the end.

Hmm, so none have an early TGA.

Wait, but let's look for TAG in DNA. TAG in DNA would translate to UAG in mRNA, which is also a stop.

Looking for any TAG in the DNA.

Mutant 1:

Looking at the sequence, any TAG? Let me see:

ATG T TCT A CGC TGG TAC T TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... TGA.

No, I don't see a TAG triplet.

Mutant 2:

ATG T TCT AAG CTG GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... TGA.

No TAG.

Mutant 3:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA.

No TAG.

Mutant 4:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA.

No TAG.

Hmm, so no early stop codons.

Wait, then perhaps the mutation caused a missense that disrupts a critical function.

But without knowing the structure or function of the protein, it's hard to say. However, perhaps the correct answer is the one that introduces a stop codon. But none of the mutants have that.

Wait, another possibility: the mutation creates a stop codon via a different reading frame. But no, the mutations are substitutions, so in the same frame.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant 4, the sequence earlier is altered. Looking at Mutant 4's DNA: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

So, the sequence is ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA.

Wait, the fourth codon is TAC → Tyr.

But perhaps looking for a situation where a codon is changed to a stop.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mutation is in a splice site, but the question states that the changes are in the first exon, so probably not affecting splicing.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation is a nonsense mutation that creates a stop codon in a different location.

Wait, perhaps I missed a mutation in one of the options.

Looking at Mutant 4 again. The DNA is ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA.

Wait, the fifth codon is ACT (Thr), sixth is TCT (Ser), seventh is GTG (Val), etc.

Looking for any triplet that would be a stop codon.

No, all are normal.

Wait, perhaps the fourth codon in Mutant 4 is GCT, which is Ala. Original is GCT as well.

Wait, maybe the change is in the sixth codon. Let me see:

Original sixth codon is ACT → Thr.

Mutant 4's sixth codon is ACT → same as original.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mutation is in the third codon. Let me look again.

Intact gene's third codon is CTC (Leu).

Mutant 1's third codon is TCA? Or something else.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the exact changes in each mutant.

The intact gene's first exon starts as ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant 1: ATG TTCTACGCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

So, instead of CTC (third codon Leu), mutant 1 has TCA?

Wait, perhaps the third codon is changed from CTC to TCA. Let me see.

In the intact gene: positions 7-9 are CTC.

In Mutant 1: positions 7-9 are TCA? Because the DNA starts with ATG T TCT A C G..., perhaps.

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the second codon is changed.

Wait, perhaps the second codon in the intact is TTT (Phe), and in Mutant 1, it's TCT (Ser). So, a point mutation changing Phe to Ser.

But would that disrupt the protein function? Maybe, but not necessarily. It depends on the region.

Alternatively, perhaps the third codon in Mutant 1 is changed from CTC (Leu) to CGC (Arg). Because the DNA for the third codon in Mutant 1 is CGC.

Wait, looking at the DNA:

Intact third codon: CTC → mRNA CUC → Leu.

Mutant 1 third codon: CGC → mRNA CGG → Arg.

So, Leu changed to Arg. That's a missense mutation, but would that disrupt the function? Possibly, but without knowing the exact function, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the change in Mutant 4 is more drastic.

Wait, looking at Mutant 4's DNA: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Comparing to intact: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Wait, in the intact gene, after TTT, it's CTC. In Mutant 4, after TTT, it's TAC.

So, the third codon in intact is CTC (Leu), and in Mutant 4, it's TAC (Tyr).

So, Leu → Tyr. Another missense.

But which of these mutations is more likely to disrupt the function?

Alternatively, perhaps a nonsense mutation is more effective. But none of the mutants have that.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the mutation changes a critical exon, such as the start codon or a splice site, but the question says the changes are in the first exon, and all have ATG intact.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant 4 because the change is in the fifth codon.

Wait, in the intact gene, the fifth codon is GCT (Ala).

Mutant 4's fifth codon is ACT (Thr), as the DNA is ACT.

Wait, so the fifth codon in the intact is GCT (Ala), but in Mutant 4 it's ACT (Thr). So, Ala → Thr.

But again, without knowing the protein structure, it's hard to tell.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again.

The correct mutation should disrupt the gene's function, leading to no compound. The most effective way is a premature stop codon.

But none of the mutants have an early stop codon.

Wait, perhaps the mutation is in the start codon, but all have ATG intact.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation creates a new start codon upstream, leading to a truncated protein.

Wait, but in all the mutants, the first codon is ATG.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps another way: the mutation in the first exon is in a critical region, such as the beginning of the gene where a crucial part of the protein is formed.

Mutant 3 has a change in the fourth codon.

Intact fourth codon: GCT (Ala).

Mutant 3's fourth codon: GCT → GCT? No, in Mutant 3, the DNA is GCT as well. Wait, no:

Wait, looking again, in Mutant 3 the DNA is TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT ... So the fourth codon is GCT (Ala), same as intact.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation is causing a frameshift, but all sequences are same length.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant 1 because it has a substitution in the third codon. Let me think.

Wait, in Mutant 1, the third codon is changed from CTC (Leu) to CGC (Arg).

That's a change from Leu to Arg. Leu is a hydrophobic residue, Arg is positively charged. That could significantly affect the protein structure.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant 4 because it has a change in the fifth codon from GCT (Ala) to ACT (Thr). Both are similar in size, so perhaps less disruptive.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mutation disrupts a critical enzyme activity site. For example, if the gene encodes a protein that synthesizes the anti-nutritional compound, a mutation in the active site would prevent the compound's synthesis.

But without knowing the location, perhaps the best bet is to look for an early stop codon, which none have.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that in Mutant 4, the DNA has a shorter sequence, but no, the sequences are same length.

Wait, the question states that the gene has five exons and four introns. So, any mutation in the exons would affect the protein.

But the changes are in the first exon.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant 4, the sequence is shorter. Let me check the length.

The intact gene's sequence given is longer, but the mutants seem to have the same length, so no frameshift.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant 2. Let me look at Mutant 2's DNA:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.

So, the DNA is ATG T TCT AAG CTG GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Looking for any triplet that is a stop codon.

The fifth codon is CTG (Leu). mRNA is CUG.

No stop codons.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant 4, because the fourth codon is changed from GCT (Ala) in the intact to ACT (Thr) in Mutant 4. That's a change in the fourth codon.

Alternatively, perhaps no. I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about creating a loss-of-function mutation, which would prevent the production of the compound. A nonsense mutation is the most effective way, but none have that. So, perhaps the next best is a missense mutation in a critical region.

Looking at the options, which mutation changes an amino acid in the first part of the protein, perhaps in a crucial area.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant 3, which has a change in the sixth codon.

Wait, in Mutant 3, the sixth codon is ACT (Thr) in the intact, and in Mutant 3 it's ACT (Thr) as well. No change.

Hmm.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of the most probable scenario.

The question is about which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That would happen if the gene is nonfunctional.

The most straightforward way is a premature stop codon. But in the given options, none have that.

So, perhaps the correct answer is one where a critical part of the gene is altered, like the start codon or a splice site.

Wait, but all have ATG as the start codon.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation is in a critical exon. For example, the first exon might contain a critical region. So, any mutation in it could disrupt function.

Looking at the options, perhaps Mutant 4 has a larger change in the first exon.

Alternatively, perhaps none of the options have a nonsense mutation, so the best bet is a missense mutation that disrupts the function.

In that case, which one would be more likely? Maybe Mutant 4, which changes GCT to ACT, which are similar but different.

Wait, GCT is Ala, ACT is Thr. Both are similar in structure (small, similar side chains), so perhaps less likely to disrupt.

Whereas Mutant 1 changes CTC (Leu) to CGC (Arg), which is a bigger change, from hydrophobic to charged.

That might disrupt the protein's structure more.

So, perhaps Mutant 1 is the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps Mutant 4 is the one that disrupts an important part of the gene.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant 2 because it has a different change in the middle.

But again, I can't tell without more info.

Wait, the correct answer is probably the one where a stop codon is introduced, but since none have that, perhaps the answer is none. But that's not an option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again.

Looking at Mutant 4's DNA: 5'-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

So, the codon after TTT is TAC (Tyr), then GCT (Ala), then ACT (Thr), then TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), etc.

Wait, in the intact gene, the sequence is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

So, in Mutant 4, the second codon is TTT (same as intact).

Third codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu) in the intact.

Wait, wait: in the intact gene, the third codon is CTC (Leu). In Mutant 4, the third codon is TAC (Tyr).

So, the third codon changed from CTC to TAC. That's a big change. CTC is Leu, TAC is Tyr.

So, in the protein, that's a Leu → Tyr substitution.

Leu is a hydrophobic amino acid, while Tyr is hydroxylated and can be involved in hydrogen bonding. This substitution could disrupt the protein's structure if that region is important.

So, perhaps this is the critical mutation that disrupts the protein function.

But looking at the options, Mutant 4 is option D.

But wait, the question says that the anti-nutritional compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food. So, we need a mutation that stops the synthesis.

If the third codon is changed from Leu to Tyr, would that disrupt the protein? Possibly, but not necessarily.

Alternatively, the correct answer is option B) Mutant 3.

Wait, looking at Mutant 3's DNA: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

So, the third codon is TAC (Tyr), same as Mutant 4.

Wait, the fourth codon in Mutant 3 is GCT (Ala), same as intact.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant 1, which changes the third codon from CTC (Leu) to CGC (Arg), which is a bigger change.

So, considering all, I think the correct answer is C) Mutant 1.


To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the mutations in the first exon of the gene. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, either by introducing a premature stop codon or altering a critical region of the protein.

### Key Observations:
1. **Intact Gene Sequence**:  
   The intact gene starts with `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA`.  
   - `ATG` is the start codon (Met).  
   - The sequence continues with codons for Phe, Leu, Ala, Gly, Thr, Ser, Val, Asp, Glu, His, Ile, Tyr, Cys, Arg, and ends with `TGA` (stop codon).

2. **Mutation Analysis**:  
   Each mutant was compared to the intact gene to identify changes in the coding sequence. The focus was on whether the mutations introduced a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation) or altered a critical amino acid (missense mutation).

### Mutant Analysis:
#### **Mutant 1**:  
- DNA: `5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`  
- Codons:  
  - `ATG` (Met)  
  - `TCT` (Ser) instead of `TTT` (Phe)  
  - `ACG` (Thr) instead of `CTC` (Leu)  
  - The rest of the codons remain unchanged.  
- **Outcome**: A missense mutation changes Leu (CTC) to Thr (ACG). This could disrupt the protein's structure or function, but no premature stop codon is introduced.

#### **Mutant 2**:  
- DNA: `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`  
- Codons:  
  - `ATG` (Met)  
  - `TCT` (Ser) instead of `TTT` (Phe)  
  - `AAG` (Lys) instead of `CTC` (Leu)  
  - The rest of the codons remain unchanged.  
- **Outcome**: A missense mutation changes Leu (CTC) to Lys (AAG). This could also disrupt the protein, but no premature stop codon is introduced.

#### **Mutant 3**:  
- DNA: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`  
- Codons:  
  - `ATG` (Met)  
  - `TTT` (Phe) remains unchanged  
  - `TAC` (Tyr) instead of `CTC` (Leu)  
  - `GGT` (Gly) remains unchanged  
  - The rest of the codons remain unchanged.  
- **Outcome**: A missense mutation changes Leu (CTC) to Tyr (TAC). This could significantly alter the protein's structure or function, but no premature stop codon is introduced.

#### **Mutant 4**:  
- DNA: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`  
- Codons:  
  - `ATG` (Met)  
  - `TTT` (Phe) remains unchanged  
  - `TAC` (Tyr) instead of `CTC` (Leu)  
  - `GCT` (Ala) remains unchanged  
  - The rest of the codons remain unchanged.  
- **Outcome**: A missense mutation changes Leu (CTC) to Tyr (TAC). This could disrupt the protein's function, but no premature stop codon is introduced.

### Conclusion:
None of the mutants introduce a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation). However, Mutant 1 and Mutant 3 involve significant changes in critical codons (Leu to Thr or Tyr). Among these, Mutant 1 changes Leu (hydrophobic) to Arg (charged), which is a more drastic alteration and could significantly disrupt the protein's structure or function. Therefore, Mutant 1 is the most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.
