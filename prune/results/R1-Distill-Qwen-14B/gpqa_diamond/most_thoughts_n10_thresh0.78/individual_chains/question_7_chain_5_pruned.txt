Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about high-energy gamma-ray annihilation. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. 

The question is asking about the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetime in the universe is limited by the process where they annihilate with a CMB photon to produce electron-positron pairs. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV. 

Wait, so the process is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-. Right, because gamma-rays are high energy photons, and the CMB photons are low energy. So when a high-energy gamma-ray interacts with a CMB photon, they can annihilate into an electron-positron pair. 

I remember that this kind of interaction is relevant for determining the maximum energy of cosmic particles because if they can annihilate quickly, their lifetime in the universe is limited. So the problem is about finding the gamma-ray energy where this annihilation process becomes significant enough to limit their lifetime. 

I think I need to calculate the energy threshold where such a process becomes possible. For pair production to happen, the combined energy of the two photons must be at least equal to the rest mass of an electron (times c squared, but maybe we can ignore factors of c here). 

The rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, or 0.511e6 eV. So each photon's energy must be sufficient so that their sum is at least 2 * 0.511 MeV (since each electron and positron has 0.511 MeV rest mass). Wait, no, wait. Actually, the total energy in the center of mass frame needs to be at least twice the electron mass because each particle has that rest mass. So the sum of the energies of the two photons should be equal to or greater than 2 * m_e c². 

But wait, the CMB photon is much lower energy. Let's denote the high-energy gamma-ray as having energy E_gamma, and the CMB photon as E_cmb = 1e-3 eV. 

But wait, when two photons collide, their combined energy in the center of mass frame needs to be at least 2 m_e c² for pair production to occur. So the condition is E_gamma + E_cmb >= 2 m_e c². 

Wait, but wait, no. Because photons can have different energies, so the condition isn't just the sum but the energy in the center of mass frame. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the invariant quantity, the square of the total four-momentum. 

The invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. For photons, since they're massless, E = |p| c. So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 + E2)^2 * (cos(theta))^2, where theta is the angle between the two photons. Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, the maximum s occurs when the photons are moving directly towards each other (head-on), so theta = 180 degrees, meaning cos(theta) = -1. 

Wait, when the photons are moving in opposite
