Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. The state given is (3i, 4). 

Wait, wait a second. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. So, in quantum mechanics, the expectation value of an operator is calculated using the formula <A> = ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩, right? So for S_y, the operator is σ_y multiplied by ħ/2 because I remember that spin operators are (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) multiplied by ħ/2.

Oh wait, the Pauli matrices! The σ_y matrix is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So the spin operator S_y should be (ħ/2) times that matrix.

The state vector is (3i, 4). I should represent this as a column vector. Let me write that down. So ψ is [3i; 4]. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually column vectors. So ψ is a 2x1 vector with top component 3i and bottom 4.

To find the expectation value, I need to compute ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩. Oh, right, and since S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, I can factor that out.

So first, let's write S_y as (ħ/2) times σ_y. Then the expectation value becomes (ħ/2) ⟨ψ| σ_y |ψ⟩.

Now, I need to compute ⟨ψ| σ_y |ψ⟩. Let's compute σ_y |ψ⟩ first.

The matrix σ_y is:
[0, -i]
[i, 0]

Multiplying σ_y by |ψ⟩ which is [3i; 4], so:

First component: (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-4i) → -4i.
Second component: (i)(3i) + (0)(4) → 3i^2. Hmm, since i^2 is -1, that's 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y |ψ⟩ is [-4i; -3].

Now, I need to compute ⟨ψ| σ_y |ψ⟩, which is the inner product of [3i, 4] (as a row vector) with [-4i, -3].

So that's (3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3).

Let's calculate each term:

First term: 3i * (-4i) = -12 i^2. Since i^2 is -1, this becomes -12*(-1) = 12.

Second term: 4 * (-3) = -12.

Adding them together: 12 + (-12) = 0.

Wait, that can't be right. So ⟨ψ| σ_y |ψ⟩ is zero. Then the expectation value would be (ħ/2) * 0 = 0.

But wait, none of the options are zero. So I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go through the steps again
