Okay, let me try to figure out this chemistry problem. Hmm, it's a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step. So the question is about binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. There are five such compounds, and we need to find the molecular weight range of substance A4.

First, let's parse the information given. 

Substance A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, around 20°C) into A2 and fluorine. The oF (I think that's the oxidation state or maybe it's a typo for something else?) is 31.96% for A2. Oh wait, maybe oF stands for the oxygen-free or something else? Wait, maybe it's the oxidation state of F? No, because fluorine usually has a -1 oxidation state. Oh wait, perhaps it's the percentage composition of fluorine in A2. So A2 is a compound where F makes up 31.96% by mass.

So when A1 decomposes, it produces A2 and F2. Let's consider that decomposition reaction. A1 → A2 + F2.

A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so if A1 oxidizes it, A1 must be a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent, but maybe A1 is a compound like F2 itself? Or perhaps another fluoride? Wait, but if A1 oxidizes Xe, maybe it's involved in a fluorination reaction with Xe. For example, Xe can be oxidized by F2 to form XeF2 or XeF4 or XeF6. Since A1 is a binary compound, it's YF_n.

Wait, but A1 is a bright-red substance. I recall that some fluorine compounds are red. For example, ClF3 is a reddish-brown gas, but wait, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, I think of the element Y being iodine because I remember that IF5 is a red-brown liquid
