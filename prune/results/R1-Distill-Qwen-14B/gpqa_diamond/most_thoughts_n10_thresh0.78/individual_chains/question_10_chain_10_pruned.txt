Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, let me think through this. The question is asking which exoplanet has the highest density among the given options. 

First, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. Oh wait, and the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So, if two planets have the same radius, the one with more mass will have a higher density. But if they have different radii, I need to calculate both mass and volume to find the density.

Looking at the options:

Option a) is an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So its density would be same as Earth's. I think Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, right? Because Earth is made of rock and metal.

Option b) is a planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, that's interesting. Wait, but wait. If it's 2 Earth masses and same density as Earth, would that make sense? Because if the mass is higher but density is same, the volume must be twice that of Earth's. Because density is mass over volume. So if mass is 2 and density same, volume is 2. So the radius would be bigger, since volume scales with radius cubed. So for Earth, volume is (4/3)πR³. If the new volume is double, the radius would be cube root of 2 times Earth's radius. So this planet is larger than Earth but same density.

Option c) says same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Same composition implies same density as Earth, right? Because composition affects density. So if it's 5x Earth's mass, same density. Then the radius would be bigger. Since density is same, mass is proportional to volume. Volume is proportional to radius cubed. So 5 times mass, so volume is 5 times. So radius would be cube root of 5 times Earth's radius. So this planet is much bigger.

Option d) is same composition as Earth but half the mass. So same density. Then the volume would be half of Earth's. So radius would be cube root of 0.5 times Earth's radius. So smaller planet.

Wait, but the question is about which has the highest density. All the options a, c, d have same density as Earth
