Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the question is about exoplanets discovered using the TTV method. TTV stands for Transit Timing Variations, right? That's a method used to detect planets by observing the changes in the timing of a planet's transit as it passes in front of its star. So, these three planets—Planet1, Planet2, Planet3—are orbiting a star, and their orbits are circular.

The problem gives me some ratios. The equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 are in a ratio of about 1.4. And between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 2.3. Also, the masses have their own ratios: Planet1 to Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 1.35.

The question is asking by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1. All three have the same albedo, 0.3, similar to Earth. So, I don't think albedo will factor into the calculations here because it's the same for all.

Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature relates to the distance from the star. The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T_star * ( (L/L_sun) / (a (1 - albedo) ) )^0.5. Wait, but actually, the star's luminosity might be a factor here, but since all three planets are orbiting the same star, the L/L_sun term would be the same for all. So maybe the distance 'a' is the main variable here.

Let me think. The equilibrium temperature T is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star. So T ∝ 1/sqrt(a). So, if Planet1 and Planet2 have a T ratio of 1.4, that should relate to their a ratios.

Wait, no. Because T is proportional to (L / (a (1 - a)) )^0.5. Oh, but since albedo is the same for all, (1 - a) is the same. So the ratio of temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 would be sqrt(a2/a1) = T1/T2. Wait, wait, let me get that right. Because, T1 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a1), T2 to 1/sqrt(a2).

So, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). So, if T1/T2 is 1.4, then sqrt(a2/a1) = 1.4. Squaring both sides, a2/a1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So a2 is about 1.96 times a1.

Similarly, T2/T3 is 2.3. So, T2 is 2.3 times T3. So, T2/T3 = sqrt(a3/a2). Wait, wait: because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), so T2 = T3 * sqrt(a3/a2). So T2/T3 = sqrt(a3/a2). So 2.3 = sqrt(a3/a2). Squaring, a3/a2 = (2.3)^2 ≈ 5.29. So a3 = 5.29 * a2.

So, a3 is 5.29 times a2. But from before, a2 is 1.96 times a1. So a3 is 5.29 * 1.96 * a1. Let me compute that.

5.29 * 1.96: Let's see, 5 * 1.96 is 9.8, 0.29 * 1.96 is approx 0.5684. Adding them, 9.8 + 0.5684 = ~10.3684. So a3 is approximately 10.3684 times a1. So a3 ≈ 10.37 a1.

Now, I need to find the ratio of the orbital periods. The period of an orbit is given by Kepler's third law: P² = (4π²/G(M)) * a³, where M is the mass of the star. But since all three planets are orbiting the same star, M is the same for all. So, P² is proportional to a³. So, P1²/P3² = (a1³)/(a3³). So the ratio P3/P1 is sqrt( (a3/a1)^3 ). Because sqrt(a3^3/a1^3) = (a3/a1)^(3/2).

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Kepler's third law: P^2 is proportional to a^3 when the mass of the star is much larger than the planet masses. Since M is the same for all, and given that the planet masses are 1.15 and 1.35 times each other, but that's probably negligible compared to the star's mass, so we can ignore planet masses in this context. So, P^2 ∝ a^3.

So, P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2). So a3 is about 10.37 a1. So, (10.37)^(3/2) is what?

Wait, 10.37 is approximately 10. Let's compute 10^(3/2) = sqrt(10^3) = sqrt(1000) ≈ 31.62. But with 10.37 being a bit more than 10, perhaps 32 or so. Hmm, but wait, let me compute 10.37^(3/2) more accurately.

Wait, 10.37 is 10.37. Let's compute its square root first. sqrt(10.37) ≈ 3.22. Then, 3.22^3.

3.22 * 3.22 is about 10.3684. Then, 10.3684 * 3.22 ≈ let's see, 10 * 3.22 =32.2, 0.3684*3.22 ≈ 1.185. So total is about 33.385.

So, (10.37)^(3/2) ≈ ~33.38. So P3 is about 33.4 times P1. So the factor is approx 33.4. So the answer would be D) ~33.4.

Wait, but let me recheck the steps because sometimes I make a mistake in the ratios.

Wait, earlier I found a2/a1 = (T1/T2)^-2, because T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) → a2/a1 = (T1/T2)^2. Wait, no—wait, I think I may have gotten the reciprocal earlier.

Wait, let's go back. Let's think again: T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So, T1 = k / sqrt(a1), T2 = k / sqrt(a2). So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). So, if T1/T2 = 1.4, then sqrt(a2/a1) = 1.4 → a2/a1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So a2 is 1.96 a1. That's correct.

Then, T2/T3 is 2.3. So T2 = 2.3 T3. So, T2/T3 = 2.3. Using T = k / sqrt(a), T2/T3 = sqrt(a3/a2) → 2.3 = sqrt(a3/a2). Squaring both sides, a3/a2 = 5.29 → a3 =5.29 a2.

So a3 =5.29 a2 =5.29 *1.96 a1. Let's compute 5.29 * 1.96:

5 *1.96 =9.8, 0.29 *1.96 =0.5684. So total is 9.8 + 0.5684=10.3684. So a3 is 10.3684 a1.

So, Kepler's law gives P^2 proportional to a^3 → P proportional to a^(3/2).

So, P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(3/2).

Calculating 10.3684^(3/2):

First, sqrt(10.3684) ≈3.22.

Then, 3.22^3.

Let me compute 3.22 *3.22: 3*3=9, 3*0.22=0.66, 0.22*3=0.66, 0.22*0.22=0.0484. So 3.22^2 is (3 +0.22)^2 = 3^2 + 2*3*0.22 + 0.22^2 → 9 + 1.32 + 0.0484 = 10.3684. So, 3.22^2 is 10.3684. Then, 3.22 *10.3684.

Let me compute that: 3 *10.3684=31.1052, 0.22 *10.3684=2.281048. So total is 31.1052 +2.281048 ≈33.3862.

So (10.3684)^(3/2) is approximately 33.386. So P3 is about 33.4 times P1. So the answer is D) ~33.4.

But wait, the options are:

A) ~10.4

B) ~3.2

C) ~4.4

D) ~33.4

So, the correct answer is D.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we use the given ratios of equilibrium temperatures and distances, along with Kepler's third law.

### Step 1: Relating equilibrium temperatures to distances
The equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star (\( T \propto 1/\sqrt{a} \)). Using the given temperature ratios:

1. For Planet1 and Planet2:  
   \[
   \frac{T_1}{T_2} = 1.4 \implies \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = 1.4 \implies \frac{a_2}{a_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96
   \]
   Thus, \( a_2 = 1.96 a_1 \).

2. For Planet2 and Planet3:  
   \[
   \frac{T_2}{T_3} = 2.3 \implies \sqrt{\frac{a_3}{a_2}} = 2.3 \implies \frac{a_3}{a_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29
   \]
   Thus, \( a_3 = 5.29 a_2 \).

Substituting \( a_2 = 1.96 a_1 \) into \( a_3 = 5.29 a_2 \):
\[
a_3 = 5.29 \times 1.96 a_1 \approx 10.37 a_1
\]

### Step 2: Using Kepler's third law
Kepler's third law states that \( P^2 \propto a^3 \). Therefore, the ratio of orbital periods is given by:
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{a_3}{a_1}\right)^{3/2}
\]
Substituting \( a_3 \approx 10.37 a_1 \):
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.37)^{3/2}
\]

### Step 3: Calculating \( (10.37)^{3/2} \)
1. Compute \( \sqrt{10.37} \):  
   \[
   \sqrt{10.37} \approx 3.22
   \]
2. Compute \( (3.22)^3 \):  
   \[
   (3.22)^3 = 3.22 \times 3.22 \times 3.22 \approx 33.38
   \]

Thus, \( (10.37)^{3/2} \approx 33.38 \), meaning \( P_3 \) is approximately 33.4 times \( P_1 \).

### Final Answer
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1.
