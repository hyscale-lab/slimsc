Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about the substitution of bromine on different aromatic compounds. The substances are numbered 1-6, each with a benzene ring attached to some group. They’re all undergoing an electrophilic substitution with excess bromine, and only one monobromo derivative is formed. I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. Hmm.

Wait, so the weight fraction of the para-isomer refers to how much of the product is the para-substituted bromine compared to the others (ortho and meta). The more the para product, the higher its weight fraction. But the question is about increasing order, so from least para to most para.

I remember that directing groups on the benzene ring determine where the substitution occurs. Activating groups direct incoming electrophiles to certain positions, and deactivating groups do the opposite. Also, whether a group is ortho/para or meta directing affects where the substitution happens.

Let me list out each substituent and their directing effects:

1) C6H5-CH3: This is toluene. The methyl group is an activating, ortho/para director. So when bromine reacts, the substitution would primarily occur at the ortho and para positions relative to the methyl group. But wait, the problem says only one monobromo derivative is formed. No, wait, no—each substituent is on the benzene ring, and when bromine adds, it's another substituent. So maybe the substituent affects where the bromine adds.

Wait, perhaps each substance is a monosubstituted benzene, and when bromine (as an electrophile) adds, it adds in a position relative to the existing substituent. So the substituent directs where the Br goes.

So for each substance, the substituent's directing effect determines which positions (ortho, meta, para) the Br will add in. But wait, bromine is a strong electrophile, but in electrophilic substitution, the substituent directs the incoming group.

So, for each substituent, what's the major product?

Substituent 1: CH3 (methyl). Activating, ortho/para director. So when Br adds, it'll be either ortho or para to the methyl. But wait, wait, no: wait, each substance is a benzene ring with substituent X, and then adding another Br.

Wait, but wait. The problem says each undergoes an electrophilic substitution with excess bromine. But each is only forming one monobromo derivative. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, maybe each reaction is on a monosubstituted benzene, which can form multiple products (ortho, meta, para), but the question says only one monobromo is formed. Or perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene, but wait no, because each substituent is one group attached to benzene, and then adding another Br.

Wait, perhaps the initial substituent is such that it's a meta director, so only meta substitution
