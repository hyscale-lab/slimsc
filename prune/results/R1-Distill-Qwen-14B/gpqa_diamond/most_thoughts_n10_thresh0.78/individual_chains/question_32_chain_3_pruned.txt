Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required to make a certain nucleus reach a speed of 0.96c. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to figure out what the nucleus X is. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So lithium has an atomic number of 3. The isotopic notation would be Li with 3 neutrons. So the mass number A is protons plus neutrons. Li typically has 3 protons, so with 3 neutrons, that makes A = 6. So X is Li-6.

Next, I need to calculate the energy needed to accelerate this nucleus to 0.96 times the speed of light. Since it's a relativistic problem, I remember that the energy is given by the total relativistic energy formula, which is E = gamma * m * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which accounts for the effects of relativity at high speeds.

The speed given is 0.96c. To find gamma, I use the formula gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me plug in v=0.96c. So v² is (0.96c)², which is 0.9216c². Then, 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Wait, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, because 0.28² is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.28 times 3.5714: 0.28 * 3 is 0.84, 0.28 *0.5714 is approx 0.16, so total 1. Hmm, yeah, that seems right. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, I need to find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus to plug into the energy formula. The mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its constituent protons and neutrons, but considering binding energy. Wait, but for heavy particles like nuclei, the rest mass is roughly the atomic mass. So for Li-6, I should look up the atomic mass.

I remember that the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.014 atomic mass units (u). Let me confirm that. Oh wait, but exact value might be needed for precise calculation. Let me try to recall: Carbon-12 is 12 u, so each u is about 1.66e-27 kg. But perhaps I should just use the given atomic mass of Li-6 as 6.014 u.

Wait, but perhaps I
