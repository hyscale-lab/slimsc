Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. Hmm, let me break it down. The question is about a process that's happening after they tag rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and give them to mice orally. 

So, the setup is that some of the GFP fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, and some got stuck in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. Then they found fluorescent Peyer's patches and isolated the proliferating cells. When they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes, they saw high variability. I need to figure out which process this is.

Wait, what are Peyer's patches? Oh right, they're structures in the intestinal lining, part of the mucosal immune system. They're involved in sampling antigens from the gut and initiating immune responses. So the rotavirus proteins probably got there and triggered an immune response, leading to the activation of B cells.

In the experiment, the inner capsid proteins are tagged with GFP. When they are delivered via oral gavage, some are destroyed by stomach acid. But some make it to the intestines, where they get into the Peyer's patches. Then these patches have fluorescent areas, and they isolated the cells that are proliferating. Those cells likely are B cells activated by the antigen.

Now, when they look at the variable heavy chain genes of these cells, they see high variability. Oh, right, the variable regions of antibodies are diverse because of certain processes. The main one I can think of is somatic hypermutation. 

Somatic hypermutation occurs during the immune response in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues. It introduces mutations into the variable regions of the B cell receptors, increasing the diversity and affinity of the antibodies. This process happens after the B cells are activated and start proliferating. So the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes must be due to somatic hypermutation.

Other options: Complement activation is more about opsonizing pathogens and causing lysis, not directly about antibody variability. Class switching changes the type of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but that doesn't explain the variability in the variable regions. VDJ recombination happens during the initial formation of B cell receptors in the bone marrow, leading to initial diversity, not the additional mutations later on during the immune response.

So the process here is somatic hypermutation. That's option A.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, and some proteins are entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the Peyer's patches, which are specialized structures in the intestinal lining. These patches are part of the mucosal immune system and are responsible for sampling antigens and initiating immune responses. The fluorescent Peyer's patches indicate that the rotavirus proteins reached these sites and triggered an immune response, leading to the activation of B cells.

The isolated proliferating cell population from the Peyer's patches shows high variability in their variable heavy chain genes after sequencing. This variability is a result of somatic hypermutation, a process that introduces mutations into the variable regions of B cell receptors during the immune response. These mutations increase the diversity and specificity of antibodies, particularly in the germinal centers where B cells undergo clonal expansion and further maturation.

Other options can be ruled out as follows:
- **Complement activation** is involved in opsonizing pathogens and causing lysis but does not explain the variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **Class switching recombination** changes the type of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not account for the increased variability in the variable regions.
- **VDJ recombination** generates initial diversity in B cell receptors during their development in the bone marrow but does not explain the additional mutations observed in this experiment.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs during the immune response in lymphoid tissues like the Peyer's patches.

Answer: A
