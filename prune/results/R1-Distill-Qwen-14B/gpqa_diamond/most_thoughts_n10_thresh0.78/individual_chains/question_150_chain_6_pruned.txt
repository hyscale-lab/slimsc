Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR and reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So plugging in: C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. Wait, wait, what's the formula again? Oh right, it's (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2. Let me compute that. 18-9 is 9, plus 1 is 10, divided by 2 is 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be from a benzene ring (which accounts for 4), and a double bond or a carbonyl group (another one, so total 5). So probably an aromatic compound with a carbonyl group.

Now looking at the NMR data. Let's parse that.

The peaks are:
9.72 ppm (t, 1H) – that's a triplet. High ppm, around 9.7, which makes me think of an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. But wait, another possibility is an acidic proton like a phenol, but 9.7 is higher than typical phenol OH (which is usually broader and maybe around 5-7 ppm). So maybe it's an aldehyde proton. But wait, this is a triplet. Aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and appear as singlets because they don't have neighboring Hs. Wait, unless it's part of a conjugated system, like conjugated to an oxygen. Or perhaps it's an enol tautomer? Hmm.

Next, 6.98 ppm (d, 2H). That's likely aromatic protons, maybe part of a para-substituted ring or something. And 6.51 ppm (d, 2H) – another pair of aromatic protons. This could be a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. The coupling between these could be from adjacent protons in a di-substituted benzene, like para substitution. Wait, but in para substitution, each proton is next to the ring, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a di-substituted ring where the substituents are in positions that create this coupling. Hmm.

Then, 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H). Broad singlet? That's a bit tricky. Maybe it's a pair of protons that are undergoing some exchange, like an enol or an aromatic ring with some substituent that deshields them. Or perhaps it's an aldehyde's neighboring protons? Wait, no, the aldehyde would be a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated double bond, like an enol.

The last peak: 3.66 ppm (d, 2H). A doublet, probably two protons. This could be a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom, maybe an oxygen. Like an OCH2 group. Or perhaps it's a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl, like in an acetal or something.

Putting this together: the structure likely has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group. Let's think about the possible structures.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the atoms. 8 carbons: maybe two benzene rings (each with 6 C) but that's too much. Wait, no. Wait, molecular formula is C8H9NO. So with two benzene rings, that would be 12 C, which is way more. So perhaps one benzene ring and a side chain.

Wait, maybe the compound is a benzaldehyde derivative. For example, something like benzalacetone? Or a cinnamaldehyde type structure.

Wait, but looking at the NMR, the triplet at 9.72 could be an aldehyde proton. Wait, but aldehydes are usually singlets. So perhaps it's not an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha proton to a carbonyl. Let me think: maybe a ketone? Or an enone system.

Wait, another possibility: the al
