Hmm, okay, so I've got this pretty detailed question about molecular biology constructs and their expression in a mouse model. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So, the setup: a ligand-receptor pair is being studied. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices, and the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets. They're initially expressed in neural crest cells, and the question is about their developmental fate.

They've created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two coding sequences in one construct. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus.

Wait, the vector details: ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. Upstream of the receptor is the IRES element. IRES allows internal ribosome entry, so it can drive expression of the downstream gene, especially useful when the upstream gene is translated. So, the ligand and receptor are both being expressed from the same construct.

There's a stop cassette between ligand and mCherry using loxP, and another with lox2272 between receptor and eGFP. Oh right, these are different loxP sites; loxP is the standard, and lox2272 is a variant that doesn't recombine unless a certain Cre is used. So, the idea is that without Cre, the stop cassettes are in place, preventing expression. But with Cre, recombination can happen.

Wait, so the construct is set up so that when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed together. Because the mCherry and eGFP are fusion proteins. So, ligand is fused to mCherry, receptor to eGFP.

They've transfected this into primary astrocytes and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. The Western blot shows signals proportional to actin, so the loading is correct. So, they're looking for the proteins.

Then, they made a mouse model homozygous for this construct in a wild-type background. Then crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is involved in neural crest development, so the Cre would be active in neural crest cells. The Cre would excise the stop cassettes, allowing expression.

After the offspring are born, they visualize them under a confocal. But they don't see a green signal, which is the eGFP. Why?

Looking at the options:

A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But if the receptors are expressed, you should see eGFP. Also, this doesn't explain why no eGFP is observed.

B) Receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. That would mean it's not on the cell surface. So, maybe the eGFP isn't visible. But why would the Western blot show it? The Western uses total proteins, so even if stuck in Golgi, it would show up in the blot. Unless it's not being expressed in the first place.

C) Enhancer for expression is missing. The construct uses the CBA promoter for ligand, and IRES for receptor. If the enhancer was missing, perhaps the promoters aren't active. But the Western blot showed signals, so the proteins are being made. Unless the antibodies are not working, but the question says they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins, so the blot works.

D) Receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Oh, that's a crucial point. The receptor is at the 3' end, and eGFP is fused. If the stop cassette wasn't properly removed, or if the construct didn't allow proper fusion, or if the frame is wrong, the eGFP might not be expressed.

Wait, the construct has a stop cassette between the receptor and eGFP. Without Cre, the stop is present, so the receptor is not expressed. But the question says that the offspring are from a homozygous construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre. So, Cre would be present in the offspring, right? Because SOX10-Cre is hemizygous, so their offspring would have one copy of Cre.

So, in the presence of Cre, the loxP and lox2272 sites would recombine, removing the stop cassettes. So, the ligand and mCherry would be expressed, and receptor and eGFP would be expressed
