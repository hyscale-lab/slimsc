Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here. Hmm, let's try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.

The question is about identifying compound D based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. Let's break down each part.

First, compound A shows two signals in the proton NMR. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I remember that in NMR, the number of peaks (splitting) tells us about the neighboring protons. A triplet means two neighboring protons, right? And a quartet would mean three neighboring protons.

So the triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H. That sounds like two equivalent sets of three protons each. Maybe something like two CH3 groups attached to a CH2, because each CH3 would see the adjacent CH2 protons. Wait, but wait, 6H in a triplet. Let me think. If each CH3 group has three H, and there are two such groups, that adds up to 6H. And each CH3 is next to a CH2. Oh wait, but the CH2 would split into a quartet, because each of its two H is next to three H on each adjacent CH3. Wait, no, maybe the other way around.

Wait, the triplet has 6H, so maybe two CH3 groups. And the quartet has 4H, perhaps a CH2CH2 group? Or maybe a CH2 attached to something else.

Wait, perhaps A is 2,2-dimethylbutane? Let me think. If it's 2,2-dimethylbutane, the structure would be CH(CH3)2CH2CH3. Wait, no, that's 2,2-dimethylbutane? Or maybe it's 2,2-dimethylpropane? Wait, no, 2,2-dimethylpropane is neopentane, which is 2-methylpropane
