Okay, so I'm trying to solve this cosmology problem about quasars and comoving distance. Hmm, let me think through what I know.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum. At shorter wavelengths (less than 790 nm), the flux drops a lot. I remember that quasars, being active galactic nuclei, can have broad emission lines, but I'm not sure how that relates here. Oh wait, maybe it's about redshift? The peak wavelength could be due to some emission line, like the Lyman-alpha line which is normally around 121 nm. If it's shifted to 790 nm, that would mean a significant redshift.

Wait, let me calculate that. The Lyman-alpha line is at about 121.6 nm rest wavelength. If that's observed at 790 nm, then the redshift z is (observed - rest)/rest. So z = (790 - 121.6)/121.6 ≈ 668.4/121.6 ≈ 5.5. Wow, that's a high redshift. So the quasar is at z ≈5.5.

Now the question is about the comoving distance for a=1 (which I think is the current scale factor) from Earth, given the universe parameters: Hubble constant H0=70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ωm=0.3, dark energy Ωv=0.7 (assuming that's dark energy), and the universe is flat (so Ωr + Ωm + Ωv =1).

Comoving distance D_C is the integral from 0 to z of c/(H(a)) * da/a, but since a is 1/(1+z'), where z' is the redshift variable, da/a = -dz'/((1+z')^2) or something. Wait, maybe it's easier to remember that comoving distance can be calculated using the integral from 0 to z of dz' / H(z'), where H(z') includes the contributions from matter, dark energy, etc.

But I'm not sure about the exact formula. I think the comoving distance is calculated using the integral from 0 to z of c dz' / [H0 * E(z')], where E(z) is the function sqrt(Ωm*(1+z)^3 + Ωv*(1+z)^{3w}), but wait, dark energy is usually modeled as a cosmological constant, so w=-1, and dark energy density scales as (1+z)^3(1+w) = (1+z)^0, so it's constant. So E(z) = sqrt(Ωm*(1+z)^3 + Ωv).

So the integral becomes D_C = (c / H0) * ∫0^z [1 / sqrt(Ωm*(1+z')^3 + Ωv)] dz'

But calculating this integral for z=5.5 might be tricky. I remember that for high redshifts, when z is large, the matter density dominates, but dark energy starts to play a role too. 

Alternatively, I remember some approximate expressions or look-up tables for comoving distances based on cosmological parameters. Let me think: I've heard that for a flat universe with Ωm=0.3 and Ωv=0.7, the comoving distance at high redshifts is around (c/H0) times some factor. Wait, H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc. Let's compute c/H0 in Mpc. c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So c/H0 = (3e5 km/s) / (70 km/s/Mpc) ) = approx 4285.7 Mpc. Wait, that's about 4.285 Gpc (since 1 Gpc is 1e3 Mpc). So c/H0 ≈4.285 Gpc.

But that's the value for z→infinite. For z=
