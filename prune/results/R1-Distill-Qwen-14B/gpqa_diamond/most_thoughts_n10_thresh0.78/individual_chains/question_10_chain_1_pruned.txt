Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is asking which exoplanet has the highest density. There are four options, a to d, each describing a planet with different mass and radius or composition. The options given are A to D, each corresponding to one of a to d.

Wait, the options list A to D as the choices, each pointing to a, b, c, d. So the letters A-D are the answers, each option corresponds to the exoplanet a-d.

Let me list out the exoplanet descriptions:

a) Earth-mass and Earth-radius. So same as Earth. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, I think.

b) 2 Earth masses, density around 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but density is mass over volume. Volume depends on radius. If the mass is 2 Earths but density is same, that would mean volume is twice that of Earth's. So radius would be larger. Because volume scales with radius cubed. So let me think: Earth's volume is (4/3)πR³. If density is same, mass is 2M_earth, so volume is 2*(volume of Earth). So (R_new / R_earth)^3 = 2 → R_new ≈ cube root of 2 times Earth's radius. So bigger than Earth but same density. So its density is same as Earth.

c) Same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Since same composition, density is same as Earth. Wait, but Earth's density is about 5.5. So this planet has same density. But it's more massive, so radius would be larger. Because mass scales as radius cubed times density. So M = (4/3)π R³ ρ. So if M is 5 times Earth's, then R³ is 5 times, so R is cube root of 5 times Earth's radius. So density same as Earth, so 5.5.

d) Same composition as Earth, but half the mass. So again, same density. Mass is half, so radius would be smaller. Because M is (R³) times (density factor). So if M is half, R is cube root of (0.5) times Earth's radius. So smaller planet, same density.

Wait, but the question is about which has the highest density. Let me think about each option:

a) Earth's density is 5.5.

b) Same density as Earth, so 5.5.

c) Same composition, same density as Earth. So 5.5.

d) Same composition, same density. 5.5.

Wait, that can't be right. All options a, b, c, d have the same density as Earth except maybe option b. Wait, no. Let me look again.

Option b: a planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5. Oh, wait, option b's density is given as 5.5, same as Earth.

Wait, but in that case, all four options have the same density? That can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me read them again.

Option a: Earth-mass and
