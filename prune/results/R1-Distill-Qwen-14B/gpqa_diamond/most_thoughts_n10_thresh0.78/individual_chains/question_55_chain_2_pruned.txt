Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is an organic one, and the options are between propenyl acetates and butenyl acetates, either cis or trans. So the structure must be something like an ester, since acetates are esters. The NMR data given is:

1H NMR: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz), 5.5 ppm (1H, dq), 2.1 ppm (3H, s), 1.6 ppm (3H, d).

Hmm, let's break this down piece by piece.

First, I remember that in esters like acetates, the carbonyl is usually around 170 ppm in the carbonyl carbon region, but that's for carbon NMR. For hydrogen NMR, the ester groups typically show up as a triplet or something else based on the adjacent groups. Wait, but in this case, the protons are in the 7 ppm region, which is more aromatic. Oh, wait a secondâ€”maybe the compound has a double bond or some conjugated system that leads to deshielded protons.

Looking at the options: propenyl and butenyl groups. Both have double bonds. Acetate esters would have an acetoxy group (OAc), so the structure would be something like R-O-CO-R', where R is the propenyl or butenyl group.

Wait, the options are:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate
B) Trans-propenyl acetate
C) Cis-propenyl acetate
D) Trans-butenyl acetate

So the structures would be:

For propenyl acetate: the propenyl group is CH2CHCH2 or CH2=CHCH2OAc? Wait, no, I think the structure is more like CH2=CH-CH2-OAc? Or perhaps the double bond is adjacent to the oxygen. Wait, I might be getting confused. Let me think about the structure.

Wait, no, propenyl acetate would be CH2CH2OAc, but more accurately, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2- attached to the oxygen. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2OAc. Similarly for butenyl, it's a four-carbon chain with a double bond.

But wait, if the group is propenyl, it's a three-carbon group with a double bond. So propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but wait, is the double bond between C1 and C2 or C2 and C3? Oh, but in propenyl, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, so it's CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

Now, for the NMR, the protons on the double bond would split into certain patterns. The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with a coupling constant J=16 Hz. That's a relatively large coupling, which suggests a trans coupling. Wait, no, wait. The coupling between protons on adjacent carbons in a double bond. If the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, then the protons on C1 (if any) and C2 would be vicinal and have coupling. Alternatively, maybe it's the protons adjacent to the oxygen that are causing this.

Wait, looking at the options: propenyl acetate has a structure where the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Let me draw the structure: the double bond is between the first and second carbons of the propenyl group. So the two CH2 groups are attached to the oxygen. Wait, no, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the group attached to the oxygen is CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the first and second.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the
