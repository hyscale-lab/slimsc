Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this. Let's see what I can figure out.

The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound based on its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are four different acetates: Cis-propenyl, Trans-propenyl, Cis-butenyl, and Trans-butenyl. Hmm, acetates usually have an ester group, so I should think about the structure of each option.

The NMR data given is:
- 7.0 ppm: 1H, doublet, J = 16.0 Hz
- 5.5 ppm: 1H, doublet of quadruplets (dq)
- 2.1 ppm: 3H, singlet
- 1.6 ppm: 3H, doublet

Let me break this down. First, the singlet at 2.1 ppm for 3H. That's probably the methyl group attached to an oxygen, like in an acetate. Because acetates are OAc groups, so the OAc would have a CH3CO-O- structure. The singlet suggests no neighboring protons, so that fits.

Next, the doublet at 7.0 ppm, J=16.0 Hz. That's a large coupling constant. I remember that coupling around 16 Hz is usually for double bonds. So maybe this is a trans coupling in an alkene. But wait, in a trans configuration, the coupling between two vinyl protons would be higher. Alternatively, maybe it's a trans double bond elsewhere.

Then, the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets. That's a bit more complex. Maybe this is a proton that's coupled to two different sets of protons. Or perhaps it's part of a vinyl group adjacent to another group.

The 1.6 ppm is a doublet for 3H. That's likely a methyl group adjacent to something, maybe a CH2 or another CH. So if it's a doublet, maybe it's attached to a CH2 group that's next to another CH2 or something else.

Wait, let's think about the structure of these compounds. Propenyl and butenyl are different in length. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, and butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- or similar, but with the double bond in different positions.

The options are either propenyl or butenyl. Let's consider each.

Looking at the options:

1. Cis- and Trans-propenyl acetate: Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Wait, no, the structure of propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2OAc? Or is it CH2=CH-OAc? No, wait, acetate is OAc, so for propenyl, it's CH2CH2CH2-OAc? No, wait. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. So the acetate would be CH2=CHCH2OAc. But wait, acetate ester is where the R is attached to OAc. So propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

Wait, no, maybe I have that wrong. Acetate is OAc, so the ester would be R-O-CO-O-R? No, wait, no. Wait,
