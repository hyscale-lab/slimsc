Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about scattering amplitudes and phase shifts. Hmm, I remember that phase shifts are important in quantum mechanics when dealing with scattering processes. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, the problem says the measured phase shifts are δ0=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, and δ4=13°. But it says to ignore the rest, so I guess we only consider these five. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, but I think the scattering amplitude f(θ) is related to the phase shifts.

Oh right! For elastic scattering, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be written as a sum over all angular momentum states. The formula is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ [ (δ_l e^{iδ_l} sin(lθ)) / sin(δ_l) ) ] multiplied by some factors. Wait, but when considering the imaginary part, maybe we can simplify this.

Wait, the question is specifically asking for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction, which is θ=0°. So θ is zero. Hmm, so let's think about each term in the sum for θ=0.

The general formula for f(θ) is: (1/(2ik)) * sum over l [ ( (e^{iδ_l} -1 ) / (δ_l) ) * ( sin(lθ) / (sin δ_l) ) ) ]

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up something. Another approach: The scattering amplitude can be written as f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l} ( (e^{iδ_l} - 1 ) * ( sin(lθ) ) / ( l sin δ_l ) ) )

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, each term is ( (e^{iδ_l} - 1) ) / ( l (e^{iδ_l} + 1) ) ) * ( sin(lθ) ) * (1/(k r_0^2)) or something else. I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me think again. The scattering amplitude f is given by f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ [ ( (e^{iδ_l} - 1 ) / ( δ_l ) ) * ( sin(lθ) ) / ( sin δ_l ) ) ] ?? Not sure.

Alternatively, I remember that the real and imaginary parts of f can be expressed in terms of the phase shifts. Let me think about the specific case when θ=0.

For θ=0, sin(lθ) = sin(0) = 0 for all l except l=0. So when
