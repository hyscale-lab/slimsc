Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. Di-substituted means it has two substituents attached to the benzene ring. The FTIR shows ester groups, which makes me think there's an ester functional group present. Ester groups typically have absorption around 1740 cm⁻¹ for the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that's one clue.

Looking at the ¹H NMR spectrum, there are six signals. Let's break them down:

1. Two signals for aromatic H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents could be in positions that lead to different aromatic protons. If the substituents are para to each other, for example, the aromatic protons would be equivalent in pairs, maybe giving two distinct signals. Or maybe if they're ortho or meta, but wait, di-substituted usually refers to two substituents on the ring, but in this case, it's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, so perhaps a benzene ring with two substituent groups.

2. Two signals for vinyl H. One is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically on double bonds, so maybe there's an ester group attached, which could have a double bond. Wait, esters don't have double bonds in the same way alkenes do. Oh wait, the ester group is O-C-O connected to an R group. Alternatively, maybe the substituents on the benzene are something else. If the substituent is an ester, like OCOOR, but that's a single group. Wait, if the substituent is an ester group, perhaps as part of a side chain.

Wait, no, the ester group itself is O-CO-O, but that's in the carbonyl and ether parts. Hmm, maybe the substituent is an ester, such as an alkoxy carbonyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH₂COOOR, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the NMR shows two vinyl H signals. Vinyl protons are adjacent to double bonds. So perhaps one of the substituents is an ethenyl group (like CH₂=CH–) attached to the benzene. Or maybe part of the ester group. Wait, esters are R-O-CO-O-R, but that's not a double bond. Wait, perhaps one of the substituents is a vinyl ester, like a group with a double bond adjacent to the ester. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an acetyl group or something else.

Wait, let me think again. The substituents on the benzene could be groups that have vinyl protons. For example, if one substituent is a CH₂CH₂ group, but that's a single bond, so no vinyl H. Alternatively, perhaps it's a propenyl group (CH₂CH₂CH₂?), no, that's not right. Or maybe
