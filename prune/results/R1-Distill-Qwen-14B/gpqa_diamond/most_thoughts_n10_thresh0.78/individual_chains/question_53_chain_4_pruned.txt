Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. Wait, di-substituted means there are two substituents on the benzene ring, right? So it's like a benzene ring with two groups attached to two of its carbons.

The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for an ester group. Ester groups have a carbonyl (C=O) stretch around 1700 cm^-1, and the ester oxygen usually has absorption around 1250-1050 cm^-1. So the compound has an ester functional group.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: there are six signals. Let's break them down.

First, two signals for aromatic H. Since it's di-substituted, the positions of the substituents will determine the number of unique aromatic protons. For example, para substitution would give two equivalent H on each ring position, but if the substituents are different, it could be more complex. Wait, but the problem says it's di-substituted, and the aromatic H has two signals. So maybe the substituents are in a position that leads to two sets of aromatic protons. Like if the substituents are in the para positions, but then each substituent would have equivalent H. Hmm, but if the substituents are in the ortho positions, that might lead to more signals... Or perhaps it's a meta substitution? Wait, meta would give three different sets, but we have only two signals. Hmm, maybe the substituents are in such a way that the ring symmetry leads to two types of H. Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is itself a group that doesn't split the H in a way that adds more signals. Hmm, not sure yet.

Next, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically on double bonds, like in an ester group perhaps. Wait, the ester group is usually part of a carbonyl, but in an ester, the carbonyl is adjacent to an O-linked R group. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester group attached via a double bond. Wait, maybe the substituent is an ester that's part of
