Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. The question is about calculating the net potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I've studied a bit about electrostatics, so let me think about what I know.

Alright, the setup is this: There's a charge q placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the potential energy of this system. The options are given, so maybe I can work through the concepts step by step.

First, I remember that when a charge is placed near a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, since the sphere is grounded, that means it's in contact with the earth, which is a large conductor at zero potential. So any induced charges on the sphere can flow into the ground, right?

Wait, no, that's not exactly correct. Let me think again. When a charge is outside a conducting sphere, the sphere's free charges will redistribute. If the sphere is grounded, any excess charge would be neutralized by the ground. But in this case, the charge q is external, so the sphere is induced with a charge opposite to q on its outer surface, and maybe no net charge because it's grounded. Hmm, no, wait. Wait, the sphere is neutral initially, I think. So when charge q is placed near it, the sphere gets an induced charge. But since it's grounded, the induced charges would flow away. Or maybe not.

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think: a conducting sphere, when isolated, would have induced charges +q and -q on its inner and outer surfaces if a charge q is placed nearby. But if it's grounded, the -q (or +q?) would leave the sphere, leaving the inner surface with the induced charge. Hmm, wait, no. Let me think again about the method of images.

Oh wait, the method of images is a technique used in electrostatics to solve problems with conductors. For a point charge outside a conducting sphere, the induced charges can be modeled using image charges. But since the sphere is grounded, the potential on the surface of the sphere must be zero.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to approach this systematically.

The system consists of a point charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a conducting sphere of
