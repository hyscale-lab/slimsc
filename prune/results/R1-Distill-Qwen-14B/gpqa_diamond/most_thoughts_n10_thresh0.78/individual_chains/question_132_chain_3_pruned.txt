Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and think through it step by step.

The question says that there's a solution with a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds, each with the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are four different tetramethylbenzenes and one diethylbenzene.

Hmm, I remember that in aromatic compounds, the protons that are equivalent will show up as singlets. Also, substituents on the ring affect the chemical shifts. For example, electron-donating groups like methyl groups cause upfield shifts, while electron-withdrawing groups cause downfield shifts. Wait, but aromatic protons are usually downfield, around 6.5-8.5 ppm, so 6.7 ppm seems in that range.

Wait, the two aromatic signals are both singlets. That suggests that each compound has all equivalent aromatic protons. How does that happen? Oh right, if all the aromatic protons are equivalent due to symmetry. So each compound must have a highly symmetric structure, like a para-substituted pattern or something.

Looking at the options, all are tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which includes 1,4-diethylbenzene. Let me think about each option.

First, the aromatic signals. Each compound contributes a singlet. So each compound must have only one type of aromatic proton. Let's evaluate each possible compound:

1. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: That's like two para-substituted methyl groups on adjacent carbons. Wait, let's draw it. Positions 1,2,4,5 are all methyl. So the structure would be a benzene ring with methyl groups at 1,2,4,5. That leaves positions 3 and 6. Wait, but if the ring is symmetric, how are the protons arranged? Maybe the ring has some symmetry.

Wait, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: The substituents are at 1,2,4,5. So the ring is substituted with methyl groups at positions 1,2,4,5. The remaining positions (3 and 6) are hydrogen. But wait, if the compound is 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl, then the methyl groups are at 1,2,4,5. So the benzene ring has four methyl groups. The structure would have two methyl groups at 1 and 2, and another two at 4 and 5. So looking at the structure, it's like 1,2,4,5 are all methyl. So the ring would have symmetry such that the remaining positions (3 and 6) are equivalent? Wait, but wait, in this structure, the positions 3 and 6 may have equivalent aromatic protons, but the substituents are all in the 1,2,4,5 positions.

Wait, is there symmetry in this structure? Let me imagine the benzene ring positions. 1,2,4,5 are all methyl. So the molecule is symmetric along the 3-6 axis. So positions 3 and 6 would have equivalent H's. But wait, isn't that only if the substituents are symmetrically placed? Let me think. If methyl groups are at 1,2,4,5, then the ring is symmetric across the line between 3 and 6. So the H at 3 and 6 would be equivalent. But wait, in a benzene ring with substituents at 1,2,4,5, the H at position 3
