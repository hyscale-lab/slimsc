Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. I need to choose the correct sequence of reactions from the given options A to D.

First, I should draw the target molecule to visualize it better. The molecule is a ketone with a phenyl group. The substituents on the phenyl ring are bromine and nitro groups. Let's see: ethan-1-one means the ketone is at the 1-position, so the phenyl is attached to the carbonyl carbon. The substituents on the benzene ring are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the point of attachment. So, the substituents are in the meta positions relative to each other.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ethan-1-one is (CH3CO) connected to the benzene ring. The benzene has substituents at the 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone. So, the ketone is attached at position 1, and then bromo is at position 3, nitro at position 5. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of numbering the benzene ring. Let's imagine the ketone is attached at position 1 of the benzene ring. Then, the bromine is at position 3, and nitro at position 5. So, this makes the substituents meta to each other since 3 and 5 are two positions away from each other on the ring.

So, the benzene ring has three substituents: the acetyl group (from ethan-1-one), bromine, and nitro. Wait no, wait. Wait, the formula is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the "phenyl" is the benzene ring. So the substituents on the benzene are 3-bromo and 5-nitro. So,
