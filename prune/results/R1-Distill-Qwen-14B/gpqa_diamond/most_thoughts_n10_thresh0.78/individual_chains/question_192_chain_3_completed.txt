Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I get all the details.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. So the cavity isn't touching the outer conductor because r < R. Got it.

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Both L and l are greater than R, so P is definitely outside. The angle between l and s is theta. 

The options are A, B, C, D, each with different expressions involving q, l, s, theta, and constants. 

Okay, so what do I remember about conductors and charges? Well, conductors have charges on their surfaces. For electrostatics, the charges reside on the outer surface if it's a conductor. But wait, the conductor is initially uncharged. So what happens when we place a charge inside the cavity?

Right, when a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. But since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge equal to the charge inside. Wait, no, wait. The conductor is initially neutral. So when the charge +q is placed in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) will have -q induced. But because the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance it. So the total charge on the conductor is +q. 

Wait, no, wait again. The conductor was uncharged before. So when you put +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's inner wall) has -q. The conductor as a whole must remain neutral, so the outer surface must have +q. So the conductor's net charge is zero, but the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q.

But the point P is outside the conductor. So the electric field at P due to charges inside the conductor? Hmm. The conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So from outside, the electric field should be as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. But wait, wait. The point P is outside, but what about the charge distribution?

Wait, the conductor is a sphere, so the charges on the outer surface would distribute themselves spherically symmetrically. So regardless of where the inner charge is placed, the outer surface's charge would spread uniformly because the conductor is spherical. So the electric field outside the conductor would be the same as if all the charge were at the center. 

But wait, the charge in the cavity is +q, which induces -q on the inner surface. So the outer surface must have +q to make the conductor's net charge zero? Or wait, the conductor is neutral, so the inner surface has -q, the outer surface must have +q. So yes, the total charge on the conductor is +q. 

Wait, no. The conductor was neutral, no charge before. So when the +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface induces -q, so the conductor's total charge becomes +q (because the outer surface must have +q to balance the net charge). Hmm, I think that's correct.

So, when considering the electric field outside the conductor, it's as if all the charge on the conductor is concentrated at the center. So the field would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q_total) / r², where r is the distance from the center. But in this case, the conductor's charge is +q, so the field outside would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L², since point P is at a distance L from the center. 

Wait, but the options have different forms. Let me look. Option B is exactly that: (1/(4πε₀)) q/L². So that would be the answer. 

But wait, wait a second. The point P is not necessarily along the axis s. So the geometry is more complex. The problem says the distance of P from the cavity's center is l, and the centers are separated by s. So the point P is located at some position relative to both the conductor's and the cavity's centers. 

Hmm, but when we have a spherical conductor with a charge on the outside, the field outside depends only on the total charge and the distance from the center, regardless of where the charge is placed inside, right? So even though the inner charge is off-center, the outer charge distribution makes the field outside symmetric. 

Wait, but in this case, the outer surface's charge is +q, so the field outside is just as if it's a point charge at the center. So the answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me think again. Let's imagine the conductor as a shell. The charge inside the cavity induces a -q on the inner shell, and since the conductor is neutral, the outer shell has +q. So from the outside, regardless of where the +q is in the cavity, the outer shell's charge distribution is uniform. So the field outside is as if the charge is at the center. 

So the electric field at point P is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². So the correct option is B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ (where $r < R$) inside it. The center of the cavity is separated from the center of the conductor by a distance $s$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor and $l$ from the center of the cavity. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

When a charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) induces a charge of $-q$ due to electrostatic induction. Since the conductor is initially neutral, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$ to maintain overall charge neutrality. 

The electric field outside a spherical conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor and the distance from the center. This is due to the spherical symmetry of the charge distribution on the outer surface of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at point $P$ outside the conductor is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor. 

The distance of point $P$ from the center of the conductor is $L$, so the magnitude of the electric field is given by:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
\]

This matches option **B**. The other options are incorrect because they involve unnecessary geometric factors or distances (e.g., $l$, $s$, or $\theta$), which do not affect the electric field outside the conductor due to its spherical symmetry.

Answer: B
