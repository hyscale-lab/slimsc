Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the mouse model. Let me think through this step by step. 

The setup is that the researcher made a transgenic mouse model to overexpress GADD45G. They introduced a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of the protein. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed as expected.

Looking at the problem, the provided DNA sequence is the plus (coding) strand of the construct. I need to see if there's an obvious issue in the sequence that would prevent proper expression.

First, I should check if the reading frame is correct. The HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the start codon should be right after the HA sequence. The forward sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. So the ATG is correct.

Let me look for any in-frame stop codons. Stop codons in DNA are TAA, TAG, or TGA. I need to scan the sequence for these triplets.

Looking at the sequence:

Starting from the beginning:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC A... and so on.

Wait a minute, I see a TAA here. Let's see: the first few codons are ATG, TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GGT, TCC, AGA, TTA, CGC, CAA, ATG, etc.

Wait, the 9th and 10th codons: TAC and GAT? Wait, let me count the nucleotides:

Triplets:

1-3: ATG (start)
4-6: TAC (tyrosine)
7-9: CCA (proline)
10-12: TAC (tyrosine)
13-15: GAT (aspartic acid)
16-18: GGT (glycine)
19-21: TCC (serine)
22-24: AGA (arginine)
25-27: TTA (leucine)
28-30: CGC (arg)
31-33: CAA (glu)
34-36: ATG (start again)

Wait, wait. Oh no, after the initial ATG, there's another ATG. Let me see. The 34-36 is ATG. But the sequence before that is CGC CAA ATG, so codon 34 is ATG. So, the 34-36 is ATG, which is a start codon again. But that's in the middle of the coding sequence. That's a problem.

Wait, wait. Let me think. So the initial sequence is the coding (plus) strand. So when transcribed into mRNA, it's the same as the plus strand (since mRNA is complementary to the template). So mRNA would have the same sequence as the coding strand, except T replaced by U.

So the mRNA sequence would start with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC A.

But wait, when looking for stop codons in the mRNA, it's UAA, UAG, UGA. So in the DNA coding strand, the stop codons are TAA, TAG, TGA.

Looking for these in the DNA sequence:

Looking through the DNA, let's see:

Looking for TAA, TAG, TGA.

At position 25-27: TTA (in DNA), which is UUU in mRNA. Not a stop.

Looking further:

After ATG (position 34-36), let's see next codons:

ACT (codon 37-39), CTG (40-42, Leu), GAA (43-45, Glu), GAA (46-48, Glu), TCC (49-51, Ser), etc.

Wait, I'm seeing a TAA in codons 25-27 (DNA), which is TTA in the plus strand. Wait, no—TTA is DNA, so it's TTA, which is UUA in mRNA, which is a leucine. No problem.

Wait, looking again: The first part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC A...

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me count the codons correctly.

Wait, I'm getting lost here. Let me approach this differently. Let me search for TAA, TAG, TGA in the DNA sequence.

Looking through the sequence:

Positions:

The entire sequence is:

5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Looking for TAA: Let me scan.

Looking for T A A in the DNA.

Looking at the start:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC A...

Wait, at position 25-27: TTA. Wait, in DNA, that would be TTA, which is a leucine codon.

Wait, but in mRNA, TTA is UUA, which is also leucine. So that's not a stop.

Looking further down: Let's go through the sequence.

Looking for the triplet TAA, TAG, TGA.

Looking through the sequence:

I notice that in the middle, there's a part: ...ACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA...

Looking for TAA, TAG, TGA.

Wait, looking at the end: ...TGA.

Wait, yes! The last triplet is TGA. Because the sequence ends with TGA.

Wait, the last part is ...CGAGTGA3'. So the last three nucleotides are TGA. So in the coding strand, DNA has TGA as the last triplet.

So in the mRNA, that would be UGA, which is a stop codon.

Oh! So the sequence ends with TGA, which is a stop codon. So the construct would produce a protein that stops at that point. But wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so perhaps the HA is followed by the GADD45G sequence, which includes the stop codon.

Wait, but the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the construct is HA-GADD45G. But if there's a TGA in the middle, that would cause the ribosome to stop early, leading to a truncated protein, or perhaps no protein if the stop codon is in the middle.

Wait, the construct has another ATG after the initial ATG. Oh, wait, maybe that's a problem. Let me see: The initial ATG is at the start, followed by TAC, CCA, etc., then comes another ATG. So the second ATG is in the middle of the coding sequence.

Wait, let's see: The first 3 nucleotides are ATG, which is a start codon. Then the next 3 are TAC, which is tyrosine.

Then CCA, TAC, GAT, GGT, TCC, AGA, TTA, CGC, CAA, ATG, ACT.

So the second ATG is at position 34-36. So in the middle of the mRNA, another ATG. That is a start codon, but in the middle of the coding sequence, that's a problem because it introduces a new start site. But wait, would that cause the ribosome to re-initiate translation?

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of another start codon could cause issues with proper initiation. Or perhaps the second ATG leads to a different reading frame.

Wait, let me think about the implications. The initial start codon is at the beginning, so the ribosome starts translating from there. Then, in the middle, there's another ATG. But since the ribosome is already in the process of translating, would it recognize this as a new start? I'm not entirely sure. But the main issue I noticed is the presence of a TGA at the end, which is a stop codon.

Wait, but the TGA is the last triplet, so it's at the end of the coding sequence. That would terminate translation normally, right? So the HA tag is at the beginning, followed by GADD45G, and then a stop codon. So that shouldn't be a problem.

Wait, but wait: The GADD45G coding sequence is supposed to be under an inducible promoter, but in the construct, perhaps the stop codon is in the wrong place.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that after the HA tag, the GADD45G sequence includes an in-frame stop codon earlier than expected, which would cause the protein to be truncated, leading to no expression because the stop is encountered early.

Wait, looking again, I found a TGA in the DNA sequence. Let's look at the exact location. The sequence ends with ...CGAGTGA. So the last three nucleotides are TGA.

So in the mRNA, that's UGA, which is a stop codon. So the construct's coding sequence ends with a stop codon, which is correct. So the protein would be HA-tag followed by GADD45G, ending at the stop codon. That seems normal.

Wait, but why isn't the protein being expressed? Let me think of other possibilities.

Option A: The HA sequence has a missense mutation. So the HA tag might not be expressed correctly, but the GADD45G is still expressed. But the question is about inability to overexpress the protein, so maybe the HA tag isn't present. But the researcher is using the HA tag to affinity-purify. If the HA is not present, purification would fail, but the protein might still be expressed. However, I don't see any mutations in the HA sequence. Alternatively, maybe the HA was inserted incorrectly.

Wait, the construct includes the HA tag at the N-terminus. Looking at the start: ATG TAC... So the HA tag's sequence would be after the ATG. But HA is a peptide, so the coding sequence for HA would be at the beginning. But looking at the sequence, the first codon after ATG is TAC, which is tyrosine. The HA peptide is a specific sequence, so perhaps the HA wasn't inserted correctly.

Wait, the HA tag is the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant. The HA tag is usually a short peptide, such as YPYDVPDYA. So the DNA would code for that. If the HA wasn't correctly inserted, perhaps it's causing a problem.

But the initial ATG is present, and the first codon is TAC (tyrosine), which would correspond to the Y in HA. So perhaps the HA is correctly inserted. But perhaps there's a mutation in the HA sequence. The plus strand's first few codons are ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG... So the HA sequence is TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), etc. Wait, but the HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. Let's see the DNA sequence:

YPYDVPDYA in amino acids would be:

Y (TAC), P (CCA), Y (TAC), D (GAT), V (GTT), P (CC A?), but let me check the actual DNA for the HA tag.

Wait, the HA tag is the sequence for the HA determinant. Let's think about it. The HA tag is a short peptide, so the DNA should encode that before the GADD45G sequence. The initial part of the plus strand is ATG followed by TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG...

Wait, the HA peptide is YPYDVPDYA. The corresponding DNA would be TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG...

Wait, let me break that down:

YPYDVPDYA → Y P Y D V P D Y A

Each amino acid is represented by three nucleotides in the codon.

So Y is TAC, P is CCA, Y is TAC, D is GAT, V is GTT, P is CCC (or CCA, depending on codon usage), D is GAT, Y is TAC, A is GCT or GCA or GCT.

Looking at the initial part of the DNA after the ATG:

TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GGT (G). Wait, that's a problem. Because the HA sequence should be Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A. But in the DNA, after TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GGT (G). The next codon is TCC (S), then AGA (R). Hmm. Wait, that doesn't match the HA sequence.

Wait, the HA tag's DNA would be the coding sequence for YPYDVPDYA. Let me write out the expected DNA sequence:

Y → TAC
P → CCA
Y → TAC
D → GAT
V → GTT
P → CCA (or other P codons)
D → GAT
Y → TAC
A → GCT (or GCA, etc.)

So the DNA for HA should be TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCT.

But the construct's DNA starts as ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG...

Wait, so the first codon after ATG is TAC (Y), which is correct. Second codon is CCA (P), correct. Third is TAC (Y), correct. Next is GAT (D), correct. Then comes GGT (G), which should be GTT (V) for the HA sequence. Oh, so the fourth amino acid should be V (GTT), but in the construct, it's G (GGT). So this is a problem. That's a missense mutation in the HA sequence. So the HA tag is supposed to have YPYDVPDYA, but in the construct, the V is changed to G. That's a mutation in the HA sequence, leading to a different amino acid. So the HA tag isn't correctly synthesized, which might cause it not to be recognized during purification, making it hard to detect the protein. But why would that cause the protein not to be expressed?

Wait, the researcher is using the HA tag to affinity-purify the protein. If the HA tag is not present correctly, the purification might fail. But the construct's GADD45G coding sequence is intact, so the protein would be expressed but not tagged. So the problem is that the HA tag is not expressed correctly, leading to inability to purify. But the question is why the protein isn't overexpressed. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is incorrectly inserted, causing a frameshift or early stop.

Wait, in the construct, after the HA tag, the GADD45G coding sequence starts. But if the HA tag has a mutation, perhaps the reading frame is shifted, leading to a premature stop codon.

Wait, let me check the reading frame. The HA tag is supposed to be in frame, so the first codon is ATG (start), then TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GTT, CCA, GAT, TAC, GCT. But in the construct, after GAT (position 13-15), the next codon is GGT (16-18), which is glycine, but should be GTT (Val). So the fourth codon is wrong. That's a missense mutation in the HA tag.

But this doesn't change the reading frame. The mutation is a point mutation, not a frameshift. So the rest of the coding sequence remains in frame. However, the HA tag is crucial for purification. If the HA tag is not correctly formed, the purification might fail, making it appear as if the protein isn't expressed when in fact it is. But the problem states that the researcher is unable to overexpress the protein. So maybe the HA tag's mutation is causing the construct to be faulty, leading to no expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation in the HA tag introduces a stop codon upstream, but that's not the case here. The HA sequence in the construct continues beyond the mutation. So why isn't the protein expressed?

Wait, perhaps the problem is with the presence of another ATG in the coding sequence. Let me look. The first ATG is the start. Then, after a few codons, another ATG appears at position 34-36. So the construct has an internal ATG, which is another start codon. This could cause the ribosome to start translating from that point, leading to a truncated protein or no proper expression.

Wait, in the coding sequence, after the initial ATG, the ribosome translates until it hits the next ATG. No, wait, the ribosome continues until it hits a stop codon. The presence of another ATG in the middle might not necessarily cause a problem unless it's in the same frame and creates a new open reading frame that leads to a stop. But in this case, the second ATG is in the same frame as the initial one. So the ribosome would continue translating beyond it, but an internal ATG might not cause a problem unless it leads to a frame shift or an early stop.

Wait, but in this case, the sequence after the second ATG continues without a stop until the end. So the protein would be correctly expressed, but with an extra methionine in the middle. That shouldn't prevent expression entirely.

So perhaps the main issue is the presence of an in-frame stop codon. Earlier, I thought the end of the sequence has a TGA. So the protein would be correctly expressed, but perhaps the stop codon is in the wrong place, leading to a shorter protein. But the researcher is seeing no overexpression. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is not correctly inserted, leading to the construct not being properly processed.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag is not followed by the correct start codon for GADD45G. Let me think. The HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the construct should be HA followed by GADD45G. But if the HA tag's coding sequence isn't followed correctly, perhaps the GADD45G isn't being expressed.

Wait, looking at the construct: The first ATG is followed by the HA coding sequence, then the GADD45G coding sequence. But perhaps the HA tag's coding sequence was inserted incorrectly, causing the GADD45G to be in the wrong reading frame.

Wait, the HA tag is a short peptide, so the construct starts with ATG (start), then the HA coding, followed by GADD45G. If the HA tag's coding sequence isn't in frame, the GADD45G would be out of frame. But in this construct, the HA coding seems to be in frame, as the initial codons are TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, etc., which align with the HA sequence.

Wait, but earlier I noticed that the fourth codon in the HA should be GTT (Val), but it's GGT (Gly) in the construct. So that's a mutation in the HA sequence, leading to a wrong amino acid. But that's a missense mutation, not a frameshift. So the rest of the sequence remains in frame.

So the HA is expressed with a mutation, but the GADD45G is correctly expressed. However, the HA tag is necessary for purification. If the HA is not correctly expressed, the protein won't be pulled down, making it seem like it's not expressed. But if the HA is expressed with a mutation, the protein is still there but not detectable via HA affinity.

But the question is why the protein isn't overexpressed. Maybe the HA mutation isn't the issue. Let me think of other options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. So the HA tag is mutated, leading to incorrect peptide. But this wouldn't prevent expression; just purification.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would happen if there's an in-frame stop codon upstream. But the only stop codon I see is at the end, which is correct. Unless there's another stop codon earlier.

Wait, let me search again for TAA, TAG, TGA in the DNA.

Looking through the sequence again:

Looking for TAA, TAG, TGA.

Earlier, I thought the last triplet was TGA. Let me confirm:

The sequence ends with ...CGAGTGA3'. So the last three are TGA. So that's a stop codon. So the mRNA would end with UGA, which is a stop.

But that's the correct termination. So the construct ends with a stop codon, which is fine.

Option B says the ribosome terminated early. If there's a stop codon in the middle, the protein would be truncated. But I don't see any other stop codons except the last one.

Wait, look again:

Looking for TAA, TAG, TGA in the DNA:

The first part: no. Midway through, let's see:

...CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACG CAG GAT GCA GGG TGC C G GAA AGC GCT GCA TGA G T TGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA...

Looking for TAA: anywhere?

Looking for T A A:

At position 16-18: GGT (Gly), no.

Wait, position 25-27: TTA (Leu), not TAA.

Looking in the middle, at position ...TCG GCG CAG CGT CAG GGC TGC C... No.

Wait, perhaps I should just scan for the triplets. Let me go through the sequence in triplets.

After ATG, the next codons are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GGT (G), TCC (S), AGA (R), TTA (L), CGC (R), CAA (Q), ATG (start), ACT (T), CTG (L), GAA (E), GAA (E), TCC (S), GGC (G), CAG (Q), GAC (D), ACA (T), GTT (V), CCG (P), GAA (E), AGC (S), AAG (K), TCT (S), TGT (C), GGC (G), GCT (A), GGC (G), GCG (A), CGG (R), etc.

Wait, I don't see any other TAA, TAG, or TGA except the last one.

So the only stop codon is at the end. So the ribosome shouldn't terminate early. So option B is unlikely.

Option C: The lack of a linker sequence is triggering proteolysis. So if the HA tag is directly fused to GADD45G without a linker, perhaps the proteases are cutting the protein. But that would lead to a truncated protein, not no expression. Also, the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so proteolysis might occur, but the construct is supposed to be overexpressed, so the researcher would detect it unless it's completely degraded.

Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse. Wait, the stop codon is UAA in mRNA, which is TAA in DNA. But all stop codons are read by release factors, not tRNAs. So the presence of a stop codon doesn't require a tRNA. So option D is incorrect.

Wait, but the stop codon is in the construct, which is in the mouse cells. All stop codons are recognized by the termination machinery regardless of the organism. So option D is not the issue.

So, going back, the only possible issue is option A: the HA sequence has a missense mutation. But why would that prevent overexpression? It would make the HA tag non-functional, making purification difficult, but the protein would still be expressed. However, the question states that the protein isn't overexpressed at all. So perhaps the HA tag is necessary for the induction of expression. Wait, the model is inducible overexpression. Maybe the HA tag is part of the regulation, but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag insertion caused a frameshift. Let me check the length of the HA coding sequence. The HA tag is about 11 amino acids, so 33 nucleotides. The initial part of the DNA is:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACG CAG GAT GCA GGG TGC C...

Wait, the HA coding should be 33 nucleotides (11 codons). Let me count:

ATG (1-3)
TAC (4-6)
CCA (7-9)
TAC (10-12)
GAT (13-15)
GGT (16-18)
TCC (19-21)
AGA (22-24)
TTA (25-27)
CGC (28-30)
CAA (31-33)
ATG (34-36)
ACT (37-39)
...

Wait, that's 12 codons (36 nucleotides) after the initial ATG. But the HA tag is 11 codons, so the HA coding should end at position 33. But in the construct, after CAA (31-33), there's another ATG (34-36). So the HA coding isn't properly terminated; it continues beyond. That suggests that the HA coding wasn't correctly inserted, leading to an extra ATG and possibly a frameshift or incorrect reading.

Wait, no, because the HA coding is correctly in frame. The initial ATG is the start, followed by the HA sequence, then the GADD45G. But in the construct, the HA sequence is longer than it should be, leading to an extra ATG in the middle.

Wait, perhaps the HA coding is longer than it should be, leading to an internal stop codon. But I don't see any other stop codons except the last one.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct has an ATG in the middle, leading the ribosome to translate from there, but that's unlikely because the ribosome would have already started at the initial ATG.

Wait, another possibility: the presence of the HA tag and the GADD45G coding sequence in the same construct without a proper terminator or Kozak sequence might be causing issues. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag insertion caused the reading frame to shift, leading to a frameshift mutation and a premature stop codon. But looking at the sequence, the HA is in frame.

Wait, but in the HA sequence, the fourth codon is GGT instead of GTT. So that's a mutation, but it's a point mutation, not a frameshift. So the rest of the sequence remains in frame.

So the only problem is that the HA tag is not correctly formed. But that doesn't prevent the GADD45G from being expressed. It just makes the HA tag non-functional.

Wait, but the question says that the researcher modified the gene's coding sequence by introducing the HA sequence at the N-terminus. So perhaps the HA tag wasn't inserted correctly, causing the GADD45G to be expressed in a different frame, leading to a frameshift and a premature stop.

But in this case, the HA is in the same frame as the GADD45G. Because the HA is at the beginning, followed by GADD45G. So the entire sequence is in the same reading frame.

Wait, unless the HA tag insertion caused an extra nucleotide, leading to a frameshift. Let me check the length.

The HA tag is 11 amino acids, which is 33 nucleotides. The initial part of the DNA is:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACG CAG GAT GCA GGG TGC C...

Wait, the HA coding is 12 codons (36 nucleotides), but it should be 11. So perhaps there's an extra codon, causing a frameshift. But in the construct, the next codon after HA is ATG (34-36), which is the start of GADD45G. So the HA is 12 codons (including the initial ATG?), no, wait, the initial ATG is the start, then the HA coding. So the HA is 11 amino acids, so 33 nucleotides after the ATG. But in the construct, the HA coding is longer, leading to an extra codon.

Wait, perhaps the HA coding wasn't correctly designed, leading to an extra nucleotide and a frameshift. So after the HA, the GADD45G is in a different reading frame, leading to a stop codon. Let me see.

If the HA is 11 codons (33 nucleotides), the next nucleotide should be the start of GADD45G. But in the construct, after the HA, there's another ATG. That suggests that the HA coding is longer than it should be, leading to an extra codon, which may cause a frameshift.

Wait, let me count the nucleotides after the initial ATG.

The HA should be 33 nucleotides (11 codons) after the ATG. So from position 1-3 (ATG), then 4-36 should be the HA. But in the construct, after position 33-35 (CAA), there's another ATG at 34-36. Wait, that can't be. Because 34-36 would be the next codon after CAA (31-33). So if the HA is supposed to end at 33, the next codon (34-36) is part of the HA, which should not be there. So that's an insertion of an extra codon, leading to a frameshift.

Ah, that's the problem! The HA coding sequence is supposed to be 11 codons, but in the construct, it's 12 codons. So the extra codon (ATG) causes the reading frame to shift, leading to a frameshift mutation. This would change all subsequent amino acids and could introduce a stop codon earlier than expected.

So the HA coding is longer than it should be, causing a frameshift. This would make the GADD45G sequence out of frame, leading to a truncated or nonfunctional protein, or even a premature stop codon, preventing proper expression.

But wait, the options don't directly mention a frameshift. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: HA has a missense mutation. That's a point mutation, not a frameshift.

Option C: No linker causing proteolysis. Unlikely to prevent expression.

So perhaps the issue is that the HA insertion caused an extra codon, leading to a frameshift and a premature stop codon.

But the options don't have an option about a frameshift. So perhaps the issue is that the HA sequence has an extra codon, leading to an additional ATG. Or perhaps the HA sequence has an incorrect reading frame.

Wait, considering that the HA coding is longer than it should be, leading to an extra ATG. But in this case, the HA is followed by another ATG, which is in frame. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA sequence wasn't correctly inserted, leading to the GADD45G being in a different reading frame, which introduces a stop codon.

Wait, but I don't see any stop codons before the last one. So perhaps the frameshift doesn't introduce a stop codon, but the protein is just not expressed because the mRNA is not properly processed.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag includes a stop codon. Let me check the HA sequence's DNA.

The HA sequence in the construct is TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACG CAG GAT GCA GGG TGC C...

Wait, in the HA coding, the 10th codon is TTA (Leu), which is correct. The 11th codon is CGC (Arg), which should be CCA (Pro) if following the HA sequence. So the HA coding is incorrect, leading to an extra codon beyond the intended 11.

So the HA coding is longer, leading to an extra codon, which is the ATG at position 34-36. So the HA is 12 codons long, which is one codon longer than it should be. This extra codon introduces an ATG, which is a start codon, but it's in the middle of the coding sequence, leading to a possible frameshift or a new ORF.

Wait, if the HA is 12 codons, that's 36 nucleotides. The next codon (37-39) is ACT. So the GADD45G coding starts at position 34-36 (ATG), but that's actually part of the HA coding. So the GADD45G would start at the correct position, but the HA coding is longer, leading to an extra codon.

Wait, no. The HA coding should end at position 33, but in the construct, it's continuing into the GADD45G sequence. So the HA coding is longer, causing the GADD45G to be in a different reading frame.

But how does that affect the overall construct?

If the HA is longer by one codon, the GADD45G would be in a different reading frame, leading to a frameshift. This frameshift would change all subsequent amino acids and could introduce a stop codon earlier than expected, leading to a truncated or nonfunctional protein. Alternatively, the frameshift could prevent the ribosome from reading the GADD45G sequence correctly, leading to no expression.

So the problem is that the HA coding is one codon too long, leading to a frameshift and preventing proper expression of GADD45G.

But looking at the options, the only option that mentions a problem with the HA sequence is option A. But option A says there's a missense mutation, which is a point mutation, not a frameshift.

So perhaps the issue is that the HA coding has an extra codon, leading to a frameshift. But the options don't have this as an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Another possibility: the ATG for the HA is followed by a stop codon. Let me see.

Wait, the HA coding in the construct is longer than it should be, leading to an extra ATG. But that's in the middle, not causing a stop.

Wait, perhaps the HA coding includes an internal stop codon. Let me see: in the HA coding part, is there a TAA, TAG, or TGA?

Looking at the HA coding in the construct:

TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACG CAG GAT GCA GGG TGC C...

Looking for TAA, TAG, TGA:

- TTA is at position 25-27: UUA in mRNA, which is leucine, not a stop.
- CGC is R, CAA is Q, ATG is start.
- No TAA, TAG, or TGA in the HA coding.

So the HA coding doesn't introduce a stop codon.

So the problem must be that the HA coding is longer than it should be, causing a frameshift. But this isn't one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the HA coding is followed by a stop codon in the wrong frame. Let me think.

If the HA is longer, the GADD45G starts in a different frame. Then, perhaps in that frame, there's a stop codon earlier.

But without knowing the exact sequence, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the HA coding has an extra nucleotide, causing a frameshift and introducing a stop codon in the new frame.

But this is getting complicated. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A) HA has a missense mutation.

B) Ribosome terminated early.

C) Lack of linker causing proteolysis.

D) tRNA for UAA doesn't exist.

The only possible options are A and B. Since the HA coding is longer, leading to a frameshift, but that's not an option. So perhaps the issue is that the HA has a missense mutation, making it nonfunctional, but the protein is expressed. But the question states that the protein isn't overexpressed, implying that it's not being made.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag insertion caused the reading frame to shift, leading to a premature stop codon in the GADD45G sequence.

If the HA is longer by one codon, the GADD45G starts in a different frame. Let's see:

Suppose the HA should be 11 codons, but is 12. So the GADD45G starts at codon 13, which is in a different frame. Let's see if any stop codons appear in that frame.

But without the exact sequence, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the HA insertion includes an in-frame stop codon.

Wait, perhaps the HA coding includes a stop codon in the correct frame. Let me check.

In the HA coding part:

Looking for TAA, TAG, TGA in the HA coding.

The HA coding is:

1-3: ATG (start)
4-6: TAC (Y)
7-9: CCA (P)
10-12: TAC (Y)
13-15: GAT (D)
16-18: GGT (G)
19-21: TCC (S)
22-24: AGA (R)
25-27: TTA (L)
28-30: CGC (R)
31-33: CAA (Q)
34-36: ATG (start)
37-39: ACT (T)
...

Wait, in the HA coding, there's no stop codon until the end of the construct, which is the correct termination. So the HA coding doesn't introduce a stop codon.

So the only possible conclusion is that the HA tag has a missense mutation, making the tag nonfunctional, but the GADD45G is expressed. However, the researcher is unable to detect the protein via HA affinity purification, thinking it's not expressed. But the question states that the protein isn't overexpressed, implying it's not being made.

Wait, perhaps the HA insertion caused the construct to be non-functional in terms of expression. For example, the HA might have introduced a cryptic promoter or another issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's mutation caused the ribosome to terminate early. But I don't see a stop codon in the HA coding.

Wait, another thought: the HA coding may have a nonsense mutation, introducing a stop codon. But earlier, I don't see any stop codons in the HA coding except the intended one at the end.

Wait, unless the HA coding is in a different reading frame. Let me think: the HA coding is supposed to be in the same frame as GADD45G. If the HA coding is longer by one codon, the GADD45G starts in a different frame, leading to a frameshift. Then, in that new frame, perhaps a stop codon appears earlier.

But without knowing the exact sequence, it's hard to confirm. However, given the options, the most likely answer is A: the HA has a missense mutation. But that doesn't fully explain the lack of expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA insertion caused the construct to be out of frame, leading to a premature stop codon in the GADD45G coding sequence. But again, the options don't address this.

Wait, perhaps the HA insertion introduced a stop codon in the original reading frame. Let me think: the HA coding is in the same frame as GADD45G. So if the HA coding includes a stop codon, the protein would be truncated. But earlier, I don't see any stop codons in the HA coding except the intended one.

Wait, looking again, in the HA coding part, codon 25-27 is TTA, which is UUA in mRNA, which is leucine. No stop. The next codon is CGC (R), then CAA (Q), then ATG (start), etc.

So the only stop is at the end. So the only possible conclusion is that the HA tag has a missense mutation (option A), making the tag nonfunctional, but the GADD45G is expressed. But the researcher can't detect it via HA purification, thinking it's not expressed. But the question says the protein isn't overexpressed, implying it's not being made.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Another angle: the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so if the HA has a mutation that causes the protein to misfold or be targeted for degradation, perhaps the protein isn't detected. But that's more about stability than expression levels.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA insertion caused a frameshift leading to a premature stop codon in the GADD45G sequence. For example, in the new reading frame, there's a TGA earlier.

But again, without the exact sequence, it's hard to tell. However, the given options don't include a frameshift option.

Given the options, the most plausible answer is A: the HA has a missense mutation. But I'm not entirely confident.


The question revolves around identifying why the GADD45G protein is not being overexpressed in a transgenic mouse model. The researcher introduced a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of GADD45G, but subsequent experiments revealed no overexpression. The provided DNA sequence of the coding strand and the options must be analyzed to determine the cause.

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Construct**:  
   The construct starts with the ATG start codon, followed by the HA tag coding sequence, and then the GADD45G coding sequence. The sequence ends with a TGA stop codon, which is correct for termination.

2. **HA Tag Sequence**:  
   The HA tag is a short peptide (YPYDVPDYA), and its corresponding DNA sequence should encode this sequence in frame. However, upon inspection, the fourth codon in the HA sequence (expected to code for valine, GTT) is mutated to GGT, coding for glycine instead. This is a **missense mutation** in the HA tag.

3. **Impact of the Missense Mutation**:  
   While this mutation does not cause a frameshift or introduce a premature stop codon, it alters the HA tag sequence. The HA tag is critical for affinity purification, as the researcher plans to use it to pull down the protein. If the HA tag is mutated, it may not be recognized by the purification system, leading to the appearance of no protein expression. However, the GADD45G coding sequence appears intact, so the protein should still be expressed but not detectable via HA affinity purification.

4. **Other Options**:  
   - **Option B (Ribosome terminated early)**: There are no in-frame stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA) in the HA tag or GADD45G coding sequence, except the final TGA at the end. Thus, the ribosome would not terminate early.  
   - **Option C (Lack of linker causing proteolysis)**: While proteolysis could truncate the protein, it would not completely prevent its expression. The construct does not mention a lack of a linker, and this is unlikely to be the primary issue.  
   - **Option D (tRNA for UAA does not exist in the mouse)**: Stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs, so this is irrelevant.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the HA tag has a **missense mutation**, altering its sequence and preventing its recognition during purification. This would make the protein appear as if it is not overexpressed, even though it is produced. The GADD45G coding sequence itself appears intact, so the issue is specific to the HA tag.
