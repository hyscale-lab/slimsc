Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom and transition between states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about the |3,0,0> state decaying to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by selection rules.

Wait, selection rules... Right! For electric dipole transitions, certain changes in quantum numbers are allowed. The selection rules are: delta l = ±1, and delta m can be 0, ±1. Also, n can change by any integer, but l must change by one step.

So the initial state is |3,0,0>. The final state is |1,0,0>. So n changes from 3 to 1, which is a delta n of -2. Since we're doing two dipole transitions, the electron must change n by -1 each time. Because each transition can only change n by one step, right? Because each transition is a dipole, and l must change by ±1 each time.

Wait, no, wait. Each transition can change n by any amount, but for each transition, the change in l must be ±1. Oh, but wait, the problem says it's via two dipole transitions. So the electron goes from 3 to some state, then to 1.

What are the possible intermediate states?

The initial state is |3,0,0>. So l=0, m=0. After the first transition, l must go to l=1, because delta l = ±1. So the first transition could go from n=3, l=0 to n=2, l=1, because delta l is +1. Or, wait, could it go to l= something else? No, because starting from l=0, the only allowed l change is to l=1.

So first transition is |3,0,0> → |2,1, m>, where m can be 0, ±1.

Wait, but for the first transition, m must change by 0, ±1 as well. So from m=0, next m can be 0, +1, or -1.

So possible intermediate states after first transition are |2,1,
