Okay, so I've got this question about nucleophilicity, which is a measure of how well a nucleophile can attack a positive or electron-deficient atom in a molecule. The question is asking me to arrange some nucleophiles from the most reactive to the least reactive in aqueous solution.

The nucleophiles given are:
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. Hydroxide (OH⁻)
3. Propionate (CH₂CH₂COO⁻)
4. Methanol (CH3OH)
5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻)

Hmm, I remember that nucleophilicity can depend on a few factors like the solvent, the basicity of the nucleophile, and the structure of the molecule. Since the question specifies aqueous solution, which is a polar protic solvent, I should consider how each nucleophile behaves in such a solvent.

I recall that in polar protic solvents, the nucleophilicity is inversely related to the basicity because strong bases are more stabilized (i.e., solvated more) in such solvents, which makes them less reactive as nucleophiles. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that point. No, wait, in polar aprotic solvents, nucleophilicity tends to increase with basicity because there's no strong solvation; but in polar protic, the more polarizable and less solvated the nucleophile is, the better it can act.

Wait, another thought: in polar protic solvents, the strength of the base affects how well the nucleophile is solvated. Stronger bases are more stabilized by solvation, which slows them down as nucleophiles. So in such solvents, weaker bases might be better nucleophiles.

Wait, but wait again. No, that's not entirely correct. Because in polar aprotic solvents, nucleophilicity follows basicity: stronger bases are better nucleophiles. In polar protic, the same trend doesn't hold because the more basic a nucleophile is, the more it's solvated, making it less available to attack.

So first, let's list each nucleophile and assess their basicity and nucleophilicity in aqueous solution.

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: That's a cyclohexoxide ion. It's a conjugate base of a tertiary alcohol. Its basicity is lower than
