Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about a spin-half particle in a linear superposition. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2|↓⟩. Oh wait, I remember that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of the σz operator. The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. Oh right, the expectation value... I think that's the average value you'd measure if you measured this operator many times on the same state.

So I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to break it down. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So I'll need to compute this for each part of the given operator.

The operator is 10σz +5σx. So the expectation value will be the sum of the expectation values of each term. That is, 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩. So I can compute these two expectation values separately and then combine them.

First, let's compute ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be easier. The expectation value of σz in each state is just the eigenvalue. Oh right, σz has eigenvalues +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. So for the state ψ, which is a linear combination of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ would be |a|² * (+1) + |b|² * (-1), where a is the coefficient of |↑⟩ and b is the coefficient of |↓⟩.

Wait, looking at the given state, ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. So the coefficients are a=0.5 and b=√3/2. Let me compute |a|² and |b|².

|a|² is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. |b|² is (√3/2)^2. Hmm, √3 is about 1.732, but squared is 3, so 3/4 is 0.75. So |a|² is 0.25, |b|² is 0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(+1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So the first term is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now onto the second part, ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix. Its eigenstates are not the same as |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, so I can't directly use the eigenvalues here. I'll need to compute it using the expectation value formula.

The Pauli matrices: σx is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is ψ† σx ψ. Let's write ψ as a column vector. Since |↑⟩ is (1; 0) and |↓⟩ is (0; 1), ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

So ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. Let me compute σx ψ first. σx is a 2x2 matrix with 0s on the diagonal and 1s off-diagonal. So when I multiply σx by ψ, I swap the components. So [0,1;1,0] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

Then, ψ† multiplied by this gives (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5). Let me compute that.

0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 is (sqrt(3))/4. Similarly, the second term is the same. So adding them gives (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So ⟨σx⟩ is approximately 0.8660.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check that calculation. Because I might have made a mistake with the matrix multiplication.

Wait, σx is applied to ψ: [0 1; 1 0] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] would be [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]. Correct. Then the inner product with ψ is 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5. So 0.5*sqrt(3)/2 is (sqrt(3))/4 each, sum to sqrt(3)/2.

Yes, that looks right. So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2. Let me compute the numerical value. sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so 1.7

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz. I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. The options are A to D, and I have to pick the right one.

Hmm, expectation value. Right, the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on identically prepared systems. For a given state, the expectation value ⟨O⟩ is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩.

So the operator here is 10σz +5σx. Oh wait, and I remember that expectation values are linear, so I can split this into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

So I need to compute ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ for this state, then multiply each by 10 and 5 respectively, and add them up.

First, let's write down the state ψ. It's (0.5)|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Wait, let me check the normalization. The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Let me square them and add: (0.5)^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4)=0.75. So 0.25 + 0.75 is 1, so it's normalized. Good.

Now, σz is the Pauli z matrix. Its eigenstates are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively. So for σz, when you measure in that basis, the expectation is just the probability of each state times their eigenvalue.

The state ψ is a superposition. Let me write ψ as a column vector. |↑⟩ is [1; 0], |↓⟩ is [0; 1]. So ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

Wait, but for expectation value of σz, since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates, the expectation value is simply the sum of |c_up|^2 * (+1) + |c_down|^2 * (-1), where c_up is the coefficient of |↑⟩ and c_down is the coefficient of |↓⟩.

So c_up is 0.5, so |c_up|^2 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. c_down is sqrt(3)/2, |c_down|^2
