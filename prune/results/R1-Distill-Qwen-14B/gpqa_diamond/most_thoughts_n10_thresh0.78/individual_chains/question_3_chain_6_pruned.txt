Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz. I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. The options are A to D, and I have to pick the right one.

Hmm, expectation value. Right, the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on identically prepared systems. For a given state, the expectation value ⟨O⟩ is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩.

So the operator here is 10σz +5σx. Oh wait, and I remember that expectation values are linear, so I can split this into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

So I need to compute ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ for this state, then multiply each by 10 and 5 respectively, and add them up.

First, let's write down the state ψ. It's (0.5)|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Wait, let me check the normalization. The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Let me square them and add: (0.5)^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4)=0.75. So 0.25 + 0.75 is 1, so it's normalized. Good.

Now, σz is the Pauli z matrix. Its eigenstates are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively. So for σz, when you measure in that basis, the expectation is just the probability of each state times their eigenvalue.

The state ψ is a superposition. Let me write ψ as a column vector. |↑⟩ is [1; 0], |↓⟩ is [0; 1]. So ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

Wait, but for expectation value of σz, since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates, the expectation value is simply the sum of |c_up|^2 * (+1) + |c_down|^2 * (-1), where c_up is the coefficient of |↑⟩ and c_down is the coefficient of |↓⟩.

So c_up is 0.5, so |c_up|^2 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. c_down is sqrt(3)/2, |c_down|^2
