Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about a spin-half particle in a linear superposition. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2|↓⟩. Oh wait, I remember that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of the σz operator. The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. Oh right, the expectation value... I think that's the average value you'd measure if you measured this operator many times on the same state.

So I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to break it down. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So I'll need to compute this for each part of the given operator.

The operator is 10σz +5σx. So the expectation value will be the sum of the expectation values of each term. That is, 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩. So I can compute these two expectation values separately and then combine them.

First, let's compute ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be easier. The expectation value of σz in each state is just the eigenvalue. Oh right, σz has eigenvalues +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. So for the state ψ, which is a linear combination of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ would be |a|² * (+1) + |b|² * (-1), where a is the coefficient of |↑⟩ and b is the coefficient of |↓⟩.

Wait, looking at the given state, ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. So the coefficients are a=0.5 and b=√3/2. Let me compute |a|² and |b|².

|a|² is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. |b|² is (√3/2)^2. Hmm, √3 is about 1.732, but squared is 3, so 3/4 is 0.75. So |a|² is 0.25, |b|² is 0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(+1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So the first term is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now onto the second part, ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix. Its eigenstates are not the same as |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, so I can't directly use the eigenvalues here. I'll need to compute it using the expectation value formula.

The Pauli matrices: σx is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is ψ† σx ψ. Let's write ψ as a column vector. Since |↑⟩ is (1; 0) and |↓⟩ is (0; 1), ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

So ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. Let me compute σx ψ first. σx is a 2x2 matrix with 0s on the diagonal and 1s off-diagonal. So when I multiply σx by ψ, I swap the components. So [0,1;1,0] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

Then, ψ† multiplied by this gives (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5). Let me compute that.

0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 is (sqrt(3))/4. Similarly, the second term is the same. So adding them gives (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So ⟨σx⟩ is approximately 0.8660.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check that calculation. Because I might have made a mistake with the matrix multiplication.

Wait, σx is applied to ψ: [0 1; 1 0] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] would be [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]. Correct. Then the inner product with ψ is 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5. So 0.5*sqrt(3)/2 is (sqrt(3))/4 each, sum to sqrt(3)/2.

Yes, that looks right. So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2. Let me compute the numerical value. sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so 1.7
