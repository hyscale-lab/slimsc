Okay, so I've got this NMR problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question involves a mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two signals as singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three signals at 2.2 ppm (singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are four different tetramethylbenzenes and one diethylbenzene.

Wait, I remember that the molecular formula C10H14 suggests each compound has a benzene ring with four substituents because benzene is C6H6. Adding four methyl groups would be C6H5(CH3)4, which is C10H14. Oh wait, but wait—no, because each methyl is CH3, so four would be 4*3=12 H, but benzene has 6 H. Wait, but benzene with four methyl groups would have 6-4=2 H in some cases, but actually, when substituents are present, the hydrogen count changes. Wait, no, let me think again. The formula is C10H14. Benzene is C6H6, so four methyl groups (each CH3) would add 4*3=12 H. 6 + 12 is 18, but that's way over. Wait, no—that's for all H. Wait, no. Wait, the formula for benzene plus four CH3 groups would be C6H5(CH3)4, which is C10H14. Oh, right! Because each CH3 contributes one C and three Hs. So the molecular formula is correct.

Wait, but the options also include 1,4-diethylbenzene. Let's check its formula. Benzene (C6H6) plus two ethyl groups (each C2H5). So C6 + 2*2 = C10, and H: 6 + (2*5) = 16. So the formula is C10H16. But the problem says the molecular formula is C10H1
