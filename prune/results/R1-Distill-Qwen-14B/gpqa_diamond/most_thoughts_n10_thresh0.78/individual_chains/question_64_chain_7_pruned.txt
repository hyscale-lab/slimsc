Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to break it down step by step. So, the problem is about heating a mixture of two salts, A and B, in an equimolar ratio. The total mass is 7.20 grams. When heated to 200°C without air, they produce a mixture of gases. These gases are then passed through some tubes, and we have some weight gains and a remaining gas volume. The goal is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm, let me read the problem again to make sure I get all the details. The gases pass through three tubes. Tube 1 is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, and it gains 3.60 grams. Tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution, but it doesn't change weight. Tube 3 is red-hot copper, which gains 0.80 grams as CuO is formed. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure.

Wait, okay, Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent, so it probably absorbs water. So tube 1 gaining 3.60g suggests that the gases passed through it released water, which was absorbed by Mg(ClO4)2. So the gases after tube 1 would be dried.

Tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. If the weight didn't change, that implies that no CO2 was present because CO2 would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water, thus increasing the weight. So, if tube 2 didn't change, the gas mixture doesn't contain CO2, or at least, any CO2 must have already been removed. Or perhaps, the gas passed through didn't have CO2 because it was removed by tube 1? Not sure yet.

Then, tube 3 is red-hot copper. So, any gases that are oxidizing would react with copper. The weight gain is 0.80g as CuO. So, the reaction here is probably the gas reacting with copper, like SO3 maybe? Or maybe it's something else. Let's think. When SO3 is passed over hot copper, it can react to form CuSO4 and water? Or perhaps, if it's another gas like O2 or something else.

Wait, but wait. The gases after tube 1 are dried, so water is removed. So, in tube 3, the gases that could be present are like SO3 or perhaps O2 or something else. Or maybe the gas is HCl or something else.

Wait, but the gas after tube 1 is dry, so any acidic gases like HCl would still be present. But if the gas passes through a solution of Ca(OH)2, which would react with HCl, producing Cl- and water. So if the solution didn't change weight, that suggests that the HCl wasn't present because it would have been absorbed. Because if HCl was present, the Ca(OH)2 solution would react, producing a precipitate, perhaps, which would increase the tube's weight.

Wait, but in this case, the weight didn't change. So maybe HCl wasn't in the gas mixture after tube 1. Alternatively, perhaps the HCl was already removed or wasn't present in the initial gases.

Wait, but let me think about the initial heating of the salts. When salts are heated without air, it's often a decomposition reaction. So salts A and B are decomposing into gases.

Looking at tube 3, the weight gain is 0.80g. Let's calculate how much CuO that corresponds to. The formula for copper oxide is CuO. The molar mass of CuO is about 63.55 (Cu) + 16 (O) = 79.55 g/mol. So 0.80g is 0.80 / 79.55 ≈ 0.01005 mol. So, 0.01005 moles of O2? Because when Cu reacts with O2, it forms CuO. The reaction would be 2Cu + O2 → 2CuO. So, each mole of O2 gives 2 moles of CuO. So, 0.01005 mol CuO corresponds to 0.005025 mol O2. So that's about 0.005 moles of O2.

Wait, but if the gas that passed through tube 3 was O2, then it would react with hot Cu. But wait, O2 would actually not react with Cu unless there's a catalyst or unless it's a high temperature. Wait, but when O2 is passed over red-hot Cu, does it react? Well, normally, O2 is needed for combustion. Wait, but maybe it's not O2 but another gas. Alternatively,
