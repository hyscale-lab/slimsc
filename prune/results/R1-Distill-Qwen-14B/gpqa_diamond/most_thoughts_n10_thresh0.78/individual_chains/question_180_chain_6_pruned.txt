Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it says. There's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, so maybe I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that for their movement.

The setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, point P is where the 13th charge is located, and the other 12 are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. I'm guessing they're arranged in some symmetric fashion around P, maybe like a sphere or something since they're all at the same distance.

The question is about the minimum energy of this system. I remember that the potential energy in an electrostatic system is related to the work done to assemble the charges. Since the system is isolated, I think we're considering the electrostatic potential energy between the charges.

Wait, so the 13th charge is fixed at P. So that's our central charge. The other 12 are each 2e and placed at 2 meters away. So each of the 12 charges must interact with the 13th charge, and also with each other.

But wait, the problem says the system is isolated, so maybe the potential energy includes all pairwise interactions. So I need to calculate the potential energy between each pair of charges.

Let me think. The formula for electric potential energy between two point charges is U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, which is approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². The charges are 2e each, so each has a charge of 2 * 1.602 x 10^-19 C. So 2e is about 3.204 x 10^-19 C.

So the system's total potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. But wait, since the system is isolated, and the charges are fixed in their positions, the potential energy is calculated as the work done to bring each charge from infinity to its position, considering the existing charges.

Alternatively, another approach is to consider that each charge contributes to the potential at the location where another charge is placed.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to calculate the potential energy in two parts. First, the energy due to the 13th charge and each of the 12 charges around it. Second, the energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

Let me break it down.

First, the potential energy between the central charge (q13) and each of the other 12 charges (q1 to q12). Since each of the 12 charges is at 2 meters from P, which is where q13 is located.

So the potential energy between q13 and, say, q1 is
