Okay, so I've got this electromagnetism problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a certain point in space and time, given a moving point charge. The setup involves the charge moving with some trajectory, and we're considering the fields at a later time. The options are various expressions for V and A, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm. Right, I remember that when charges are moving, they produce both electric and magnetic fields. The scalar potential is related to the electric field, and the vector potential is tied to the magnetic field. But wait, in the context of potentials, I think the scalar potential can be written as V = (q/(4πε₀ r)), where r is the distance from the charge to the point where the potential is being measured. But wait, that's only if the charge is stationary, right? Or is that for static fields?

Wait, no, actually, the scalar potential for a moving charge might involve some time delays because the fields propagate at the speed of light. Because the fields are not instantaneous, but there's a retarded time involved. Oh right, that's the retarded potential concept. So the potentials depend on the position and velocity of the charge at an earlier time tr, which is when the field was generated.

So the scalar potential V would involve the charge's position at tr, and the vector potential A would involve the velocity at that time. Also, the expressions for V and A when charges are moving are a bit more complicated because of the retarded time and the velocity terms.

Let me try to recall the exact formulas. The scalar potential for a moving charge is given by something like V(r, t) = q/(4πε₀) * (1/|r' - d|), but wait, I might be mixing up the terms. Alternatively, perhaps it's (q/(4πε₀)) divided by (r - (v/c) * t), but that's not exactly right.

Wait, another approach: the general expression for the scalar potential from a moving charge involves the Lorentz contraction or perhaps the time it takes for the field to reach the observation point. So the charge's position at the retarded time tr is such that light takes (t - tr) time to travel from there to the observation point r.

Right, the retarded time tr is given by tr = t - |r - r'|/c, where r' is the position of the charge at time tr. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's exactly how it's used here.

Alternatively, perhaps the potentials are given by expressions involving terms like (d c - d·v), where d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r.

Wait, let me think about the general form of the potentials. The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(|d| - (v·d)/c² )], or something similar. And the vector potential A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * [1/(|d| - (v·d)/c² ) ] or something along those lines.

Looking at the options, option C and D have terms like (d c - d·v) in the denominator. So, in option C, V is qc/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)), and A is (μ₀ qc v)/(4π (d c - d·v)). Wait, but I think the denominator should be (|d| c - d·v), which is the same as (c |d| - d · v) because d is a vector pointing from the charge's position to the field point at time tr.

Wait, the denominator for moving charges involves (c |d| - (v · d)). So d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to the field point r. So |d| is the distance
