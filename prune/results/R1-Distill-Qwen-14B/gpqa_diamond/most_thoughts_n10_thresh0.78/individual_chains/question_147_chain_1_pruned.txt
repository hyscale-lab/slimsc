Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an annihilation process. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The reaction is p + bar p → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So, a proton and an antiproton annihilate into two particles each with charge + and -.

Wait, wait. The problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Oh right, that probably means its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy, so maybe we can approximate the momentum as non-relativistic. Or perhaps not? I'm not sure yet.

The mass of particle A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. So each A particle has rest energy of 300 MeV. But wait, the proton and antiproton each have their own rest masses. Since a proton's rest mass is about 938 MeV/c². So the proton and antiproton have a combined rest energy of around 1876 MeV (since 938 + 938 is 1876), but wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. The antiproton has the same mass as the proton, right? So each is about 938 MeV/c². So the total rest energy is 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV.

But the products are four particles: two A⁺ and two A⁻. So each pair (A⁺ and A⁻) must have a combined rest mass. Wait, but each A is 300 MeV, so each pair would be 600 MeV. Since there are two such pairs, total rest mass would be 2*600 = 1200 MeV. Wait, but the initial rest energy is 1876 MeV. That's more than the 1200 MeV of the products. So there's a lot of energy to go into kinetic energy, which makes sense because the annihilation process would release a lot of energy.

But wait, the question is about the
