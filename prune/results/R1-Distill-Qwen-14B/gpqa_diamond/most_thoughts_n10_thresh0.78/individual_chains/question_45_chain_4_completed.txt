Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, I remember that in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels of a single particle are quantized. The formula for the energy levels is E_n = (n²) * E, where E is the base energy given by E = π²ħ²/(2mL²). So each particle's energy depends on the quantum number n.

But wait, these are four identical spin-1/2 particles. Oh right, because they're fermions, they have to obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. So each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers, including spin.

In a 1D well, each particle's state is determined by its n value and its spin. Since spin-1/2 particles have two possible spin states (up and down), each n level can hold two particles—each with opposite spins.

So for four particles, I need to figure out the lowest energy configuration (ground state), then the next possible (first excited), and then the second excited.

Let me list the possible states in order of increasing energy.

The ground state will have the lowest possible n's. Since each n can hold two particles, let's see:

n=1: can hold 2 particles (spin up and down)
n=2: next two particles (so now all four are filled)

Wait, that's four particles total. So in the ground state, two particles are in n=1 (each with opposite spins), and the other two are in n=2 (opposite spins each). So the total energy would be the sum of each particle's energy.

Each particle in n=1 contributes E*(1²)=E, so two of them would be 2E. Each in n=2 contributes E*(2²)=4E, so two of them would be 8E. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, no. Each particle's energy is (n²)E. So for each particle in n=2, it's 4E each. So two particles in n=2 contribute 4E * 2 = 8E. Then, the n=1 particles contribute E * 2 = 2E. So total energy is 8E + 2E = 10E. Wait, but wait that can't be right because the options don't have 10E as the ground state. Oh wait, let me think again.

Wait, no, wait. Perhaps I made a mistake. The ground state is the lowest possible energy configuration with four particles. Since each n can hold two particles, the four particles would fill n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). So each n=1 gives E each, so 2*E. Each n=2 gives 4E each, so 2*4E=8E. So total is 2E +8E = 10E? But looking at the options, option B says ground state is 4E, but that would be if only one particle is in n=2. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing something.

Wait, no, let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I got the filling wrong. Wait, no, in the ground state, the particles fill up the lowest possible energy levels, each with maximum two. So n=1 with 2 particles (sum 2E), n=2 with 2 particles (sum 8E), so total 10E. So the ground state is 10E. But wait, looking at the options, option C has 4E as ground state. Hmm, wait, no, option B starts with 4E, but that would be if only one particle is in n=2 and others elsewhere. Wait, perhaps I'm forgetting that spin is part of the quantum state.

Wait, no, the spin is accounted for. Each n can have two particles with opposite spins. So let's think about the four particles. They must be filled in the lowest possible n's.

So n=1 holds two particles (each with spin up and down). Then n=2 holds the next two, each with spin up and down. So the energy is 2*(1²E) + 2*(2²E) = 2E + 8E =10E. So ground state is 10E.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C has ground state as 4E. So that suggests maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe the particles are treated as distinguishable? No, no, they're identical fermions, so Pauli applies.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I'm confusing the concept of the system's energy compared to individual particles. Oh wait, no; the total energy is the sum of each particle's energy.

But wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the filling. Maybe the four particles are in n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles)—so the total energy is 2E + 8E =10E. So ground state is 10E.

Then the first excited state would have the highest possible energy level that's next. But wait, no. The first excited state would be the next possible configuration after the ground state. So perhaps one particle is promoted from a higher n to an even higher n, but making sure that the Pauli exclusion is satisfied.

Wait, but in ground state, the four particles are in n=1 and n=2. So the next possible state would be moving one particle from n=2 to n=3. Because in the ground state, all lower n states are filled. So to get the first excited state, we can promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. Let's see: the energies would be:

n=1: 2 particles → 2E
n=2: 1 particle → 4E
n=3: 1 particle → 9E
Total energy: 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Wait, that's 15E. So the first excited state is 15E.

The second excited state would be the next possible. So perhaps either:

1. Move another particle from n=2 to n=3. But wait, n=2 has one particle left (since we had two in n=2 and one was promoted to n=3). So if we move another from n=2 to n=3, then n=3 will have two particles (each with opposite spins), and n=2 has zero. But that would require another promotion. Let's calculate that.

n=1: 2E
n=2: 0 (since both particles have been promoted)
n=3: 2 particles → 2*(9E)=18E
Total energy: 2E + 18E =20E.

Wait, but maybe that's not the next step. Alternatively, perhaps the next excited state is to promote one particle from n=1 to a higher n, but that's higher energy. Wait, but n=1 is the lowest, so moving a particle from n=1 to n=3 would be a bigger jump than moving from n=2 to n=3.

Wait, but in the ground state, n=1 is filled with two particles, n=2 filled with two. To get the first excited state, perhaps it's better to promote from n=2 to n=3, making the energy 15E as calculated earlier. Then the next excited state would be promoting another from n=2 to n=3, making that 18E as above.

But wait, let's think about the possible quantum numbers. Since each n can take two spins, when you have four particles, in ground state, n=1 (2) and n=2 (2). Then, in the first excited state, you can't have more than two in n=3 because each n can hold two. So moving one from n=2 to n=3: maybe that's the first excited.

Wait, but promoting one from n=2 to n=3: total energy is 2E (n=1) + 4E (n=2 has one left) +9E (n=3 has one) =15E.

Then, for the second excited, maybe moving another from n=2 to n=3. Now, n=2 has zero, n=3 has two. So energy is 2E + 0 + 18E =20E. But wait, 20E isn't one of the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, making n=3 have two particles (since each n can hold two). But wait, no, because in ground state, n=2 has two particles. So moving one to n=3 would leave n=2 with one, and n=3 with one. Then, to get the next state, perhaps moving the last n=2 to n=3, making both in n=3. That gives 2E + 0 + 18E =20E.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: 30E,39E,50E. These are way higher.

Option B: 4E,10E,50E. So ground state is 4E, which would be if two particles are in n=1 (2E) and one in n=2 (4E), but that can't be right because two can be in n=2. So maybe this option is incorrect.

Option C: 4E,10E,15E. Hmm, same issue.

Option D: 10E, 15E, 18E. So ground state 10E, first excited 15E, second 18E.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, the ground state is 10E. Then the first excited is 15E, and the second excited is 20E. But in the options, no option has 20E.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in considering the filling. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the four particles can't all be in n=1 and n=2 because of spin. Wait, no, because each n can hold two particles (each with opposite spins), so four in total with n=1 and n=2. So ground state is 10E.

Wait, but what's the next possible state? Maybe the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, so n=3 has one particle (spin up, say), n=2 has one (spin down), and n=1 has two. So the energy is 2E (n=1) +4E (n=2) +9E (n=3) =15E.

Then, the next state would be when another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3. So now n=2 has none, n=3 has two. So the energy is 2E +0 +18E =20E. But again, 20E isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4. Let me see: if we have n=1 (2E), n=2 (4E), n=3 (9E), and n=4 (16E). But wait, that would require four particles in different n's, but that's not possible because n=1 can have two particles.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the particles are arranged with as low as possible n's, but with some in higher states. So the ground state is 10E as before.

Now, the first excited state would have the next possible configuration. Perhaps promote one particle from n=2 to n=3, so the energies are 2E (n=1) +4E (n=2, one particle) +9E (n=3, one particle) = 15E.

Then, the second excited state would be when another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, making n=3 have two particles and n=2 empty. So 2E (n=1) + 0 (n=2) +18E (n=3) =20E.

But none of the options have 20E. Hmm. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering how the states are filled.

Alternatively, maybe the ground state is when all four are in the lowest possible n's, but that's not possible because each n can hold two. So four particles would require n=1 (2) and n=2 (2). So 2E +8E=10E.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, making the energy 2E +4E +9E =15E.

The second excited state could be when another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, making n=3 have two, and n=2 empty. So 2E +0 +18E=20E.

But since none of the options have 20E, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the particles can be arranged in higher n's without promoting all from n=2. For example, maybe the ground state is 10E, then the first excited is when one goes to n=3, and another goes to n=4. But that would be higher energy.

Let me calculate: n=1 (2E), n=2 (4E), n=3 (9E), n=4 (16E). But wait, each n can have two. So if four particles are in n=1 (2), n=2 (2), that's 10E.

If in the first excited state, one from n=2 goes to n=3 (so n=2 has 1, n=3 has 1), energy becomes 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Second excited: move another from n=2 to n=3. Now, n=3 has two, n=2 has none. So energy is 2E + 0 + 18E =20E.

Alternatively, perhaps in the second excited state, one particle goes to n=4. So n=3 would have one, n=4 one.

Energy would be 2E (n=1) + 0 (n=2) +9E (n=3) +16E (n=4) =2E +9E +16E =27E.

But that's not matching any options either.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the particles are being considered as distinguishable or something. But no, they're identical fermions, so I have to consider their spin and n.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the total energy as the sum of the individual energies, considering the possible filled states.

Wait, let's try another approach. For four spin-1/2 particles, the possible states are such that each can be filled with up to two in each n.

The ground state would have the lowest possible energies: two in n=1, two in n=2. So sum 2*(1²E) + 2*(2²E) =2E +8E=10E.

First excited state: promote one from n=2 to n=3. Now, n=2 has one, n=3 has one. So sum: 2E (n=1) +4E (n=2) +9E (n=3) =15E.

Second excited state: promote another from n=2 to n=3. Now, n=3 has two, n=2 has none. So sum:2E + 0 + 18E=20E.

But none of the options have 20E.

Wait, looking at the options again.

Option C: 4E,10E,15E. So the ground state is 4E, which would be impossible, since that would mean two particles in n=1 (2E) and one in n=2 (4E), but that doesn't make sense because each n can hold two.

Wait, perhaps the particles are in different spin states but same n? No, because Pauli allows each n to have two spins, so two particles per n.

So option C's ground state is 4E, which would imply that all four are in n=1, but that's impossible because each n can hold two. So four can't be in n=1.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, the question says four identical spin-1/2 particles. So each can have spin up or down. So each n can hold two, so four would require n=1 and n=2 filled.

So ground state must be 10E.

Looking at the options, option D's ground state is 10E. So that's a possible candidate.

Then, option D says first excited is 15E, second is 18E.

Wait, but according to our earlier calculation, the first excited state is 15E, and the second is 20E. But option D's second is 18E. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=4. Let's see.

n=1:2E, n=2:4E, n=4:16E. But wait, that would require moving a particle from n=2 to n=4. So in that case, the sum would be 2E +4E +16E=22E. Not matching 18E.

Alternatively, perhaps promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=1 to n=3.

Wait, but that's not possible because n=1 is filled with two, and you can't have another particle in n=1.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is 15E, and the second excited state is when another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, giving 20E. But option D's second is 18E, which is 2*(9E)=18E. So that would be when both n=3 are filled, but that's only possible if two particles are in n=3.

Wait, but in that case, the total energy would be 2E (n=1) + 0 (n=2) + 18E=20E, not 18E. So that doesn't match.

Alternative approach: perhaps the ground state is not 10E. Maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me think: Each particle has energy (n²)E. So for four particles, the ground state is to have the lowest n's filled, each with two particles.

So n=1: two particles → 2E.

n=2: two particles → 8E.

Total:10E. So that's correct.

First excited state: The first possible way to increase the energy is to promote one of the n=2 particles to n=3. So n=3 has one particle (4E?), wait no. Wait, no, n=3’s energy is (3²)E=9E per particle.

So in the first excited state, n=1 has two, n=2 has one, n=3 has one. So energies: 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Then the second excited state would be when another particle is promoted to n=3, making n=3 have two, and n=2 empty. So energies:2E +0 +18E=20E.

But option D says the second excited state is 18E. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=4.

So in that case, n=1 has two, n=2 has one, n=3 has none, n=4 has one.

So energies: 2E +4E + 0 +16E =22E. Not matching any option.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3. So 2E (n=1) + 0 (n=2) +18E (n=3) =20E.

But again, no option matches that.

Wait, what if the first excited state is when one particle is moved to n=3, and another to n=4?

So n=1:2E, n=2:4E, n=3:9E, n=4:16E. So sum:2E +4E +9E +16E=31E. Not matching any option.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's look at the options again.

Option D: ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second 18E.

Wait, 18E would be the case if two particles are in n=3, so 2*9E=18E.

But then, the sum would be 2E (n=1) + 18E (n=3) =20E. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the energy levels. Wait, perhaps the energy is calculated per particle, and the total is the sum of individual energies.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the sum of the squares of the quantum numbers multiplied by E.

So for the ground state: two in n=1 (sum 1² +1²) and two in n=2 (2² +2²). So (1+1+4+4) * E =10E.

First excited state: let's say one particle from n=2 moves to n=3. So the sum is (1+1 +4 +9) =15. So 15E.

Second excited state: another particle from n=2 moves to n=3. Now, the sum is (1+1 +9 +9)=20E.

But the options don't have 20E. So perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4. So sum would be 1+1 +9 +16 =27. 27E, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle goes from n=2 to n=3 and another from n=2 to n=4.

Sum would be 1+1 +4 +9 +16 → wait, no, four particles. So sum is 1+1 +9 +16 =27. Again, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3, and another is promoted to n=4. So sum: 1+1 +9 +16=27. Not matching any option.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the options again.

Only option D has ground state 10E, which fits our calculation. Then first excited 15E, second 18E.

Wait, 18E would be when two particles are in n=3, so their sum is 2*(3^2)E=18E. Plus the two in n=1, which is 2E. So total 20E. But that's not 18E. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the sum is not considering the 2E (n=1) in the second excited state. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is 15E, and the second is when another particle is promoted to n=4, making sum 15E +16E =31E, but that's not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4, but that's for four particles, which would be 1+1 +9 +16=27E, which is not an option.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=1. But that's the same as the first excited state.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the filling. Maybe the four particles can be arranged in the first three n's, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the ground state is 10E, first excited is 15E, and the second excited is 18E. So option D.

But how does that happen? Let me think again.

If in the ground state, two in n=1 and two in n=2: sum 10E.

First excited: move one from n=2 to n=3 → sum 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Second excited: move another from n=2 to n=3 → sum 2E +0 +18E=20E. But option D says 18E for the second excited state.

Hmm. Unless the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3 and another to n=4. So the sum would be 2E +4E +9E +16E =31E. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 (sum 18E) and none in n=2. So total energy is 2E (n=1) +18E=20E.

But option D says 18E, which doesn't include the 2E from n=1.

Wait, that can't be right. The total energy must include all particles.

So perhaps the correct option isn't among the choices, but that can't be. I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the sum of the squares without considering the number of particles.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. The total energy is the sum of each particle's energy.

Wait, another approach. Let's list all possible energy configurations for four particles and their corresponding energies.

Ground State:
n=1: 2 particles → 2E.
n=2: 2 particles → 8E.
Total:10E.

First Excited State:
n=1:2 →2E, n=2:1 →4E, n=3:1 →9E.
Total: 15E.

Second Excited State:
n=1:2 →2E, n=3:2 →18E.
Total:20E.

But 20E isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4.

So: n=1:2 →2E, n=3:1 →9E, n=4:1 →16E.
Total:2E +9E +16E=27E.

Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and n=2 has zero. So sum is 2E +18E=20E.

Hmm.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option D: 10E,15E,18E.

Hmm, 18E is 2*(9E). Which would be if two particles are in n=3. So their sum would be 18E, plus the n=1 two particles? No, because the two in n=1 would contribute 2E, but in option D, the second excited state is 18E, which doesn't include that.

So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the way the energies are being presented. Maybe the problem is asking for the energy levels as per the highest energy particle in the state, not the total energy.

Wait, that can't be right. The question says 'energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy E'. So it's the total system energy.

Wait, perhaps the system's energy is the sum of the individual energies, so for ground state, 10E.

First excited:15E.

Second excited:18E.

Ah, wait, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=1. So sum is 2E +18E=20E. But that's not 18E.

Alternatively, perhaps in the second excited state, the particles are in n=2, n=3, and n=4, but that would require more than four particles.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let's think differently.

Looking at option D, which says the energies are 10E, 15E,18E.

So the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second 18E.

But according to our calculation, the second excited state would be 20E. So perhaps option D is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the configuration. Maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4, making the sum 2E +9E +16E=27E. Which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=2, but that's the same as the first excited state.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another is in n=4. So the sum would be 2E (n=1) +4E (n=2) +9E (n=3) +16E (n=4) = 31E. No option has that.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=4. But that's not possible with four particles.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energies are not the sum of all particles but the individual particles' n²E and then the states are ordered by the sum. Let's think about the possible combinations.

For four particles, possible n configurations:

Ground state: (1,1,2,2) → sum 1+1+4+4=10 →10E.

First excited: One 2 moves to 3. So (1,1,2,3) → sum 1+1+4+9=15 →15E.

Second excited: another 2 moves to 3. So (1,1,3,3) → sum 1+1+9+9=20 →20E.

But 20E isn't an option, so perhaps another scenario.

Wait, another possibility: maybe in the second excited state, one particle is promoted to n=4. So (1,1,2,4) → sum 1+1+4+16=22E.

But again, not matching.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Looking at the options, option D has 10,15,18. So 18E would imply that two particles are in n=3 and zero in n=2 and none in n=1. But that's impossible because n=1 can hold two.

Wait, no. Wait, if the system's energy is 18E, that would require the sum of the squares to be 18.

But four particles: how?

Wait, 18= 1+1+16+0 → no, because four particles.

Alternatively, 18= 9+9+0+0 → only two particles.

So that's not possible. So perhaps the options are incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Maybe the particles are bosons, but no, the question says spin-1/2, which are fermions.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ground state isn't the lowest possible. Maybe for four particles, the ground state isn't just filling n=1 and n=2.

No, that doesn't make sense. The ground state must be the lowest possible, which is n=1 (2) and n=2 (2), sum 10E.

So the options that match this are options D and C.

Option C's ground state is 4E, which is impossible. So only option D has ground state 10E.

Then, according to option D, the first excited is 15E and second is 18E.

Hmm. Since I can't find a configuration that gives 18E, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the highest occupied energy level, not the sum.

But that doesn't make sense because the question asks for the system's energy.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me just look for the option where the ground state is 10E, first is 15E, second is 18E. That's option D.

But earlier calculations suggest that the second excited state should be 20E, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=2. Wait, no, because in that case, n=2 is filled, and two in n=3 would make sum 2E (n=1) + 8E (n=2) + 18E (n=3) →38E. Which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4, making sum 2E +4E +9E +16E=31E. Not an option.

I'm stuck. Based on the options, the only one that matches the ground state 10E is option D. So perhaps the correct answer is D: 10E,15E,18E.


In a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels for a single particle are quantized as \( E_n = n^2 E \), where \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \). For four identical spin-\(\frac{1}{2}\) fermions, the Pauli exclusion principle requires that no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. Each energy level \( n \) can hold up to two particles (one for each spin state).

### Ground State:
The lowest energy configuration is achieved by filling the lowest available energy levels. Since each \( n \) can hold two particles:
- Two particles occupy \( n = 1 \), contributing \( 2E \),
- The other two particles occupy \( n = 2 \), contributing \( 2 \times 4E = 8E \).

Thus, the total energy of the ground state is:
\[
E_{\text{ground}} = 2E + 8E = 10E.
\]

### First Excited State:
To reach the first excited state, one particle is promoted from \( n = 2 \) to \( n = 3 \):
- Two particles remain in \( n = 1 \), contributing \( 2E \),
- One particle remains in \( n = 2 \), contributing \( 4E \),
- One particle moves to \( n = 3 \), contributing \( 9E \).

The total energy is:
\[
E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
\]

### Second Excited State:
For the second excited state, another particle is promoted from \( n = 2 \) to \( n = 3 \):
- Two particles remain in \( n = 1 \), contributing \( 2E \),
- No particles remain in \( n = 2 \),
- Two particles occupy \( n = 3 \), contributing \( 2 \times 9E = 18E \).

The total energy is:
\[
E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E + 0 + 18E = 20E.
\]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (30E, 39E, 50E):** These values are too high and do not match the calculated energies.
- **Option B (4E, 10E, 50E):** The ground state energy of \( 4E \) is incorrect, as it would imply only one particle in \( n = 2 \), violating the Pauli exclusion principle.
- **Option C (4E, 10E, 15E):** The ground state energy of \( 4E \) is incorrect.
- **Option D (10E, 15E, 18E):** Matches the calculated ground state (\( 10E \)) and first excited state (\( 15E \)), but the second excited state is listed as \( 18E \), which does not match the calculated \( 20E \). However, this is the closest match among the options.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option D**, as it aligns with the calculated ground and first excited states, even though the second excited state does not perfectly match.
