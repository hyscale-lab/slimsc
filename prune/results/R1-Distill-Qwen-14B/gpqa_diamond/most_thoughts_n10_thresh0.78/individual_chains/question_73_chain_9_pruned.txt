Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about relativity, which I'm still trying to wrap my head around. Let me read it again.

The problem says that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds: 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. We need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm, I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up like in classical mechanics. So for the relative speed, I can't just subtract 0.6c and 0.5c. I need to use the velocity addition formula. What's that formula again?

Oh right, the formula is (u - v) / (1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Wait, but wait. Let me think about the direction. If both are moving in the same direction, and I want the speed of astronaut A as seen from astronaut B, I should subtract their velocities appropriately.

Wait, actually, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c relative to the lab frame, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So from B's frame, what is A's speed? Or is it the other way around?

Wait the question is about the "relative speed" of the system, which I think refers to how fast each astronaut is moving relative to the other. So if A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c, then from B's perspective, A is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by some factor. But wait, no, the actual formula is more involved.

Let me think again. The formula for relative velocity in relativity is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). So if u is 0.6c and v is 0.5c, then u' = (0.6
