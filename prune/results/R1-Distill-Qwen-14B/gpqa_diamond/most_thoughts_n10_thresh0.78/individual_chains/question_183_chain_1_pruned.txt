Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency for a product formed from a specific reaction. Hmm, the index of hydrogen deficiency is the count of rings plus double bonds in the molecule, right? So each ring or double bond contributes one to the index.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Wait, let me draw that structure. So it's a cyclohexene ring. The substituents are at positions 2 and 5. Position 2 has a formyl group (CHO), and position 5 has a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂ but as a substituent, so actually it's CH₂CH₂ attached to the ring, but wait, vinyl is CH₂=CH-, so that's a double bond. Oh right, the vinyl group is an ethylene group attached via the carbon adjacent to the double bond. So the structure would have a cyclohexene ring, with a double bond at position 3, which is between carbons 3 and 4 (assuming cyclo numbering).

So, the molecule is cyclohexene with substituents: at 2, a formyl (CHO), and at 5, a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂, but with a double bond, so I think it's CH₂CH₂- where the double bond is between the two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Vinyl is CH₂=CH-, so the substituent is CH₂CH₂- but the double bond is internal. So the 5-vinyl group is attached to the cyclohexene ring at position 5, and the vinyl itself has a double bond. So the molecule's structure has two double bonds: one in the cyclohexene ring (cyclohex-3-ene) and another in the vinyl group attached at position 5. Also, the formyl is at position 2.

Wait, the starting material's structure is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the cyclohexene has a double bond at position 3 (between C3 and C4). Then, the substituents: at C2, a formyl (CHO), and at C5, a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-). Additionally, there's a carboxylic acid group attached somewhere. Wait, wait, the name is 5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the main chain is the cyclohexene, and the substituents are at C5 (vinyl) and C2 (formyl). The carboxylic acid group is at the same position as the cyclohexene? No, wait, the name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the cyclohexene ring has a carboxylic acid group as a substituent. So the parent is cyclohex-3-ene, and the substituents are at 2 (CHO), 5 (vinyl), and the carboxylic acid is at the same position as the cyclohexene's substitution? Wait, the name is cyclohex-3-ene
