Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, but wait, the question is about luminosity, right? So mass might not be directly relevant unless it affects something else like temperature.

Then, the problem mentions that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength of a star's emission is related to its temperature by Wien's Law. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, then both stars have the same temperature. Because Wien's Law says lambda_max is proportional to 1/T, so same lambda implies same T.

Wait, but what about their velocities? Oh, the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. So Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, but Star_1 is not moving radially. I wonder how that affects the observed wavelength. Oh! Because of the Doppler effect. So the actual emitted light from Star_2 is redshifted because it's moving away. But since the observed peak wavelengths are the same, that would imply that the intrinsic temperatures are the same. Hmm, maybe I should think about this.

Wait, no. Because if Star_2 is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted) than the emitted. So if the observed peak is the same as Star_1, which isn't moving, that would mean that the emitted wavelength of Star_2 is shorter than what's observed. So the temperature of Star_2 would be higher than what we observe? Wait, no, let me think again.

Wien's law is about the peak wavelength in the star's rest frame. So if Star_2 is moving, the observed wavelength is different. But the problem states that the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So the observed lambda_max for both is the same. But for Star_2, because of the Doppler shift, its actual emitted lambda_max is shorter (since it's moving away, so observed is longer, but to have same observed as Star_1 which is at rest, Star_2 must emit at a shorter wavelength).

Wait, maybe I should model this. Doppler shift equation: observed wavelength = emitted wavelength * sqrt[(1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c)] approximately when v is small compared to c. But since v is 700 km/s, which is 0.7 million meters per second. The speed of light is about 3e5 km/s, so 700 is about 0.7% of c. So maybe using the approximation (1 + z) â‰ˆ 1 + v/c. So the observed wavelength is (1 + v/c) times the emitted wavelength. But v is positive for recession (Star_2 is moving away), so observed lambda is longer.

Wait, but the observed peak for Star_2 is the same as Star_1. So let's denote
