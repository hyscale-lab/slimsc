Okay, so I have this NMR question here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says that the 1H NMR spectrum of a solution with a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds (C10H14) shows two signals (singlets) around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Also, there are three signals at 2.2 ppm (singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. I need to figure out which two compounds are present from the given options.

Hmm, the molecular formula is C10H14. Let me think about the possible structures. All options are tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which has diethyl groups. But wait, the molecular formula for tetramethylbenzenes would be C10H14? Let's check: Benzene is C6H6. Four methyl groups add 4*(CH3) which is 4C and 12H. So total would be C10H18. Oh wait, wait. Wait, the molecular formula given is C10H14. Hmm, that can't be right for benzene derivatives with four methyl groups. Because benzene plus four methyl groups is C10H14? Wait, no. Benzene is C6H6. Each methyl group is CH3. So four methyl groups add 4 C and 12 H, making the total C10H18. But the question says C10H14. Oh, wait, that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me double-check. Benzene (C6H6) plus four methyl groups (each is CH3, so four would be 4C, 12H). So total is C6+4= C10, H6 +12 = H18. So the formula would be C10H18, not C10H14. Wait, but the given formula is C10H14. Hmm, that suggests that maybe it's not four methyl groups but maybe two ethyl groups? Or maybe
