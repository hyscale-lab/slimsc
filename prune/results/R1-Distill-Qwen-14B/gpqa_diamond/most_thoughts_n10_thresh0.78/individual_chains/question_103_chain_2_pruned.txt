Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is asking for the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options, A through D, each with a series of reactions.

Hmm, the target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let me break that down. The main chain is ethan-1-one, which is a ketone group (C=O) attached to a CH2 group. So, the structure is a phenyl ring with substituents at positions 3 and 5: a bromine and a nitro group, respectively. Wait no, wait. Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)C=O? No, wait, ethan-1-one would be CH2(CO)CH3? No, wait, that's not right. Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO? No, ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, ethan-1-one is acetone, right? Which is (propan-2-one, but maybe the numbering is different). Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure.

The target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the main structure is a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Wait, wait, for benzene, the positions are numbered such that substituents are in the order given. So the substituents are at 3 and 5 positions. Wait, let me visualize: if the ring is numbered with the ketone group at position 1, then the substituents would be at positions 3 and 5 relative to that. Wait, no, wait. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. The substituents are at 3 and 5 relative to the ketone? Or perhaps the ketone is at position 1, and then the substituents are at 3
