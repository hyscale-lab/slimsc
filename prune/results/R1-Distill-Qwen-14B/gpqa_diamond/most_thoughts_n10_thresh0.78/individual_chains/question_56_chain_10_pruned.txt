Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me about the hydrogen atom. The question is about the decay of a specific state via dipole transitions. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies.

The state in question is |3,0,0⟩, which is an n=3, l=0, m=0 state. It's decaying to |1,0,0⟩, which is n=1, l=0, m=0. The process involves two dipole transitions. I remember that in dipole transitions, certain selection rules apply. Oh right, the selection rules for the hydrogen atom in the non-relativistic theory are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. But wait, for an electric dipole transition, I think that Δl must be ±1, and Δm can be 0, ±1. Oh, but wait, the initial state is l=0. So, when it transitions, the next state must have l=1 because Δl can only be +1 or -1, but since l can't be negative (it's zero here), the first transition must go to l=1.

So the first transition must take |3,0,0⟩ to a state with l=1. So the possible states after the first transition would be |n, l=1, m⟩, where n can be less than 3 but higher than or equal to 2 (since l=1 requires n≥2). Wait, no, because the initial state is n=3, so the next state could be n=2 or n=1. But since the decay is happening via two steps, I think the first transition would go from 3 to 2, because if it went directly from 3 to 1, that would require two changes in l, which isn't allowed in a single dipole transition. Because each transition can only change l by ±1. So first transition would be to l=1, n=2.

So from |3,0,0⟩, first transition to |2,1, m⟩. What possible m values can it have? The selection rule says Δm can be 0, ±1. So from m=0, possible m values after transition are -1, 0, +1. So the first step could be to |2,1,1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩.

Then, the second transition must take that state to |1,0,0⟩. So from l=1, the next transition must go to l=0 (since l can only change by ±1). Let's see what m values are allowed. The initial state after first transition is, for example, |2,1,1⟩. Then, in the second transition, m can change by 0, ±1. So from m=1, possible m's in the next state are 0,1,2. But wait, in the target state, m must be 0. So let's see: If first transition is |2,1,1⟩, then in the second transition, m can go to 0,1,2. But the target is m=0, so from m=1, can we go to m=0? Yes, that’s Δm=-1, which is allowed.

Similarly, for the first transition to |2,1,0⟩, then in the second transition, m can be -1, 0, +1. So to reach m=0, that's possible from m=0 (Δm=0) or m=1 (Δm=-1) or m=-1 (Δm=+1). Wait, no, wait: the second state's m is 0. So if the first state is |2,1,0⟩, then in the second transition, the m can go to m=0, +1, or -1. So to reach |1,0,0⟩, the m must be 0. So from |2,1,0⟩, the second transition can only have m=0 if Δm=0.

Alternatively, if the first transition is |2,1,1⟩, the second transition's m can go to 0 (Δm=-1) or 1 (Δm=0) or 2 (Δm=+1). So only m=0 is acceptable for the target. So the second transition must have Δm=-1 in that case.

But wait, the target is |1,0,0⟩. So in the second transition, n must go from 2 to 1, which is a Δn of -1. So the second transition must be from n=2 to n=1.

Now, what's the possible transition from |2,1, m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩. So for each possible m in |2,1,m⟩, what are the possible m in |1,0,0⟩.

Wait, in the second transition, l goes from 1 to 0, so that's allowed because Δl = -1. Also, n goes from 2 to 1, which is allowed as Δn = -1. So for each initial m in |2,1,m⟩, the possible m' in |1,0,0⟩ must be such that m' = m + Δm, where Δm is 0, ±1.

So for the first transition to |2,1,1⟩:

In second transition, m' must be 0. So m =1. So:

m' = m + Δm → 0 = 1 + Δm → Δm = -1. Which is allowed.

Similarly, for |2,1,0⟩:

m' =
