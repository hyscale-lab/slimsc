Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry reactions, specifically the Michael addition. Hmm, I need to figure out the reactants and products for each of the three given reactions and then match them to the options provided.

Let me start by recalling what the Michael addition is. As I remember, the Michael reaction is a nucleophilic addition where a nucleophile (like an enolate) attacks the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. This leads to the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond and an enolate intermediate, which is resonance-stabilized.

The question has three parts: A, B, and C. I'll tackle each one step by step.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH. 

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diethyl ester of malonic acid. It can enolize easily, especially under basic conditions like NaOEt. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate means it's an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. The structure should be something like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, the substitution here is 3-(p-tolyl), so the structure is probably O=C-CH2-CH2-p-tolyl, but wait, no. Wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the substituents would be on the second carbon. Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Wait, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be: the acrylate part is CH2=CHCO-OCH3, but where's the p-tolyl group attached? Oh, wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate implies that the substituent is on the third carbon. But wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-, so numbering is from the COO- end. So the carbonyl is position 1, then the double bond is between 1 and 2, so the substituent on position 3 would be on the next carbon, but that doesn't make sense because the acrylate is only three carbons. Maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(C6H4-4Me)-COOCH3. So the double bond is between the first and second carbons, and the third carbon (from the COO-) has a p-tolyl group attached.

Wait, wait, the correct structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the double bond between C1 and C2, and a substituent at C3. So, it's CH2=CH-CH2-CO-OCH3? No, that can't be right because that would make it a four-carbon chain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution on the second carbon. Hmm, maybe I should think about it as CH2=CH-(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, that doesn't fit either. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of it as an alpha-beta unsaturated ester, with the substituent on the beta carbon. So the structure would be CH2=CH- (with the p-tolyl group attached to the CH2 part). Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the double bond is between the COO- and the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2=C(C6H4-4Me)-COOCH3. So the double bond is between the first and second carbons
