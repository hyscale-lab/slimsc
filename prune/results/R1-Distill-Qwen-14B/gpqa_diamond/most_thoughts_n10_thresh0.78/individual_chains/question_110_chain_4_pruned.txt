Okay, so I have this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let's think this through step by step.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations, including measuring stellar velocities and chemical compositions. But the key here is their brightness limits. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, while HIRES can handle stars brighter than 16 mag. Wait, wait—actually, I should clarify: the question says that ESPRESSO can detect stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. That means the apparent V magnitude (m_v) must be less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO to detect them, right? Because brightness in astronomy is such that lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that's m_v <17. Similarly, HIRES can detect stars brighter than 16 mag, so m_v <16.

Wait, no, I think I have it backwards. Because higher magnitude means dimmer. So a star with m_v=16 is brighter than one with m_v=17. So if a telescope can observe stars brighter than 17, that's m_v ≤17, because anything brighter (lower magnitude) can be seen. Similarly, HIRES can see stars down to 16, so m_v ≤16.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So a star that's brighter than 17 would be m_v <17. Because magnitude is a scale where lower numbers mean brighter. So if a star is brighter (lower m_v) than 17, it's detectable. So both ESPRESSO and HIRES are looking for stars where m_v is less than or equal to their respective thresholds.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The question says: with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be
