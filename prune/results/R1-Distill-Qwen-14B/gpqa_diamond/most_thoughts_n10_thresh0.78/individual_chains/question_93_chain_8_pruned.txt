Okay, so I have this question about qPCR and calibration curves. Hmm, let me think. I remember that qPCR is used to quantify the amount of DNA or RNA in a sample. The scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control that's been diluted in a series. He has technical replicates for each concentration.

The efficiency is 100%, which is perfect—meaning each cycle doubles the DNA. The R² is 1, so the curve fits perfectly, no scatter. The slope is -3.3. Wait, I think the slope in the qPCR equation is related to efficiency. The formula is usually something like Ct = a + (b)log(concentration). Oh right, because higher concentration leads to lower Ct.

Wait, the slope is negative because higher starting amounts reach the threshold faster. The standard formula is Ct = -3.32 * log(Q), where Q is the quantity. But wait, the slope here is -3.3, which is close to that. So that makes sense.

Now looking at the data points. For each concentration, there are three technical replicates. Let's look at them:

At 100000 copies/μl, Ct values are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The average is about 34.2. The standard deviation here is probably small, maybe around 0.3 or so.

Similarly, the next concentration down is 10000 copies/μl, and Ct values are 30.6, 30.9, 31.2. Again, consistent within 0.3. Same for the lower concentrations. So the Ct values are varying by about 0.3 between the replicates. 

Wait, but the question is about the discrepancies in his results. So what's the issue? The options are A to D.

Option A says qPCR can't quantify nucleic acids—no, because his efficiency is good, R² is 1, so the curve is perfect. So A is incorrect.

Option B says Ct values don't reflect the target amount. But the data seems consistent. Each tenfold dilution leads to a decrease of about 3.3 in Ct. Because 10x dilution should change Ct by about 3.32 cycles, as 10^(-3.32) is about 0.05, so each tenfold reduces by about 3.32. His slope is -3.3, so that fits. So the Ct values are in agreement. So B is incorrect.

Option C says ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, wait. Wait, no, the ten-fold dilution leads to a change in Ct of about 3.3. So the change is exactly 3.3. So why is the option saying it's more? Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait, ten-fold dilution would cause a change in Ct of about 3.32 cycles because of
