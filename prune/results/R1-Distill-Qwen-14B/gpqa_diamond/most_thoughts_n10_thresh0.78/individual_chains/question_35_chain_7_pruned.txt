Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator Ay is given by c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second as (i, 0). So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Wait, let me think about the structure. Angular momentum operators usually relate to spin matrices, right? For spin-½ particles like electrons or muons, the Pauli matrices are used. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Oh wait, but here S is given, which is similar to σy perhaps?

Wait, the matrix S is:
Row 1: 0   -i
Row 2: i    0
So that's the same as the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by -i, I think. Because the standard Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Oh wait no, wait. The standard Pauli matrices:

σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So S is exactly σy. So S = σy.

Wait, no, because S is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the same as σy. So S is σy.

But wait, the operator Ay is c times S, so Ay = c * σy.

Wait, no. Wait, c is h/(4π). So Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

Now, the eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue. So we can write this as σy φ = (a/(h/4π)) φ. Let me see.

Wait, so the eigenvalues of σy are known. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So for σy, the eigenvalues are ±1. Then for Ay, which is c * σy, the eigenvalues would be c * (±1), so ±c.

So the eigenvalues a would be ±(h/(4π)).

Wait, but wait: Let me confirm. The eigenvalues of a matrix M are determined by solving det(M - λI) =0. So for σy, the matrix is [[0,-i],[i,0]]. The eigenvalues λ satisfy (0 - λ)(0 - λ) - (-i)(i) = λ² - (-i)(i) = λ² - ( (-i)(i) ) = λ² - (1) because (-i)(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So equation is λ² -1=0 → λ=±1. So yes, eigenvalues are ±1. So for Ay = c σy, the eigenvalues are c*(±1) → ±c.
