Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with enthalpy calculations. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing three different solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. The options are given in kcal and kJ, so I need to make sure I'm consistent with the units.

First, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually about -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases. But here, the situation is more complicated because there are three solutions involved, and some might be polyprotic.

Let me list out what each solution is:

1. 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl.
2. 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4.
3. 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2.

I think I need to find out how much H+ and OH- ions each is contributing and see which one is the limiting reactant because the neutralization will depend on that.

HCl is a strong acid, so it will completely dissociate into H+ and Cl- ions. The molarity of H+ from HCl is 0.2 M. The volume is 0.5 L, so moles of H+ from HCl would be 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol.

H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but it's diprotic, meaning it can donate two H+ ions per molecule. So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+. The concentration is 0.3 M, volume is 0.3 L. Moles of H2SO4 is 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole gives 2 OH- ions because Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH-. So the concentration is 0.5 M, volume 0.2 L. Moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol. So OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol.

Wait, but wait, neutralization is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the total H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4, and OH- comes from Ba(OH)2.

So the total H+ is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 mol.

The total OH- is 0.2 mol.

So which is the limiting reactant? Let's see: the H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2.

The OH- is less, so it will be the limiting reagent. That means all OH- will react, and some H+ will be left over.

So the amount of neutralization reaction is determined by the OH-: 0.2 moles.

But wait, each OH- neutralizes one H+. So 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- will react.

Wait, but wait again. Also, the H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. So if it's being neutralized by a base, each H+ from H2SO4 requires an OH-.

So the neutralization reaction for H2SO4 would be: H2SO4 + 2 Ba(OH)2 → Ba2(SO4) + 2 H2O. But perhaps more accurately, each H+ from H2SO4 needs an OH-.

But perhaps a better approach is to calculate the moles of H+ and OH- contributed by each solution, then find out which is the limiting.

Total H+ = HCl + 2 * H2SO4 = 0.2 *0.5 + 2*(0.3 *0.3) → Wait wait, no, I think I confused the steps earlier. Let me recalculate:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4. Each H2SO4 gives 2 H+, so 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH^-.

So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The limiting reagent is OH^- because 0.2 < 0.28. So all 0.2 mol OH- will react with 0.2 mol H+.

So the total amount of H+ consumed is 0.2 mol.

Now, the enthalpy of neutralization. Each mole of H+ neutralized releases about 57 kJ (since the standard enthalpy is about -57 kJ per mole of H+). But wait, wait. Wait, I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of acid-base reaction, but sometimes it's given per mole of H+.

Wait, that's an important point. So, for example, when an acid donates one H+, like HCl, the neutralization is per H+. But when H2SO4 donates two H+, each H+ contributes to the neutralization.

So, the total H+ neutralized is 0.2 mol. Each H+ gives a -57 kJ enthalpy change, so total would be 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ. But wait, the options are given in kcal and kJ. Let me check.

Wait, the options are A) -2.72 kcal, B) -11.42 kcal, C) -3.80 kcal, D) -16.0 kJ.

Wait, 57 kJ per mole is about 13.64 kcal (since 1 cal ≈4.184 J, so 1 kJ=239 cal approx). Wait, 57,000 J is 57,000 / 4.184 ≈13,600 cal, which is 13.6 kcal. So 57 kJ = ~13.6 kcal. So if I have 0.2 mol H+ neutralized, it's 0.2 * 13.6 = 2.72 kcal. But wait, the question is about the enthalpy of neutralization. So the reaction is exothermic, so the value should be negative. So the enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal. Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal.

But wait, wait again. Because the H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. So when Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, does it affect the neutralization?

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should think about the total equivalents of H+ and OH-.

HCl: 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So, the H+ is 0.28 and OH- is 0.2.

The neutralization can only use 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

So 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized, each releasing 57 kJ, so 0.2 *57 = 11.4 kJ. Wait, that's 11.4 kJ, which is approximately 2.72 kcal (since 1 kJ is about 0.239 kcal), 11.4 kJ * 0.239 ≈ 2.72 kcal.

But the options have both kJ and kcal. The options are B) -11.42 kcal, which would be around 11.42 kcal, which is about 480 kJ (since 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the calculation should be done in kJ.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units earlier. Let me recalculate.

Each mole of H+ contributes to a neutralization enthalpy of -57 kJ.

So 0.2 moles H+ → 0.2 * (-57) kJ = -11.4 kJ.

So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher, not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -11.4 kcal, which would be about 48.5 kJ (since 1 kcal=4.184 kJ). Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I confused kcal and kJ. Let me check the options again.

Option B is -11.42 kcal.

Wait, 11.42 kcal is about 48.5 kJ (since 11.42 * 4.184 ≈48.5 kJ). That doesn't align with the -11.4 kJ I calculated.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the moles of H+ neutralized correctly. Let me see:

Wait, another approach. The reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would produce BaSO4 and water. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the neutralization isn't just based on H+ and OH- because some of the H+ comes from a diprotic acid, and the base can provide multiple OH-.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the equivalents of H+ and OH-.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 eq (since each HCl gives one H+).

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles, which is 0.18 eq (because each H2SO4 gives 2 H+).

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M *0.2 L = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2, which gives 0.2 eq of OH- (since each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-).

So the total H+ equivalents are 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 eq.

The OH- equivalents are 0.2 eq.

So the H+ is in excess by 0.08 eq. So only 0.2 eq of H+ and OH- will react, releasing heat.

Each equivalent of H+ neutralization releases 57 kJ. So 0.2 *57 = 11.4 kJ.

So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. So am I missing something?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in solution, perhaps only the first H+ is strong, and the second is weak? No, H2SO4 is considered a strong acid in the first dissociation, but the second (HSO4- → SO4^2- + H+) is weaker. Oh wait, wait, but in the case of strong bases like Ba(OH)2, perhaps the reaction would involve both H+ from H2SO4. Hmm, but for enthalpy of neutralization, it's usually considered that each H+ contributes. So my initial approach should be correct.

Wait, but the options have a value of -11.42 kcal, which is about 48.5 kJ (since 11.42 *4.184 ≈48.5 kJ). But I calculated 11.4 kJ. So something's wrong here.

Alternatively, perhaps I have to calculate the total heat from each acid and base.

Wait, another approach: calculate the moles of H+ and OH- contributed by each solution, sum them, and find the limiting reagent.

HCl gives 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4 gives 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2 gives 0.1 mol → 0.2 OH-.

Total H+ = 0.28, OH- =0.2.

So, the OH- is the limiting. So 0.2 H+ will react.

Each H+ contributes 57 kJ (or 13.6 kcal) of enthalpy change.

So 0.2 *57 = 11.4 kJ → which is about 2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which would align with this.

But then why is there an option B of -11.42 kcal? Because 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal, but option B is about 11.4 kcal, which is about 48.5 kJ. That would be if I had 0.485 mol H+ neutralized.

Alternatively, perhaps the way I'm considering the H+ is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, and each of its two H+ would contribute to the neutralization, but the base Ba(OH)2 can only provide so many OH-.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the equivalents:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 eq.

H2SO4: 0.3 M *0.3 L *2 = 0.18 eq.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M *0.2 L *2 =0.2 eq. Wait no, no, wait: in terms of equivalents, H+ is n × normality. For H2SO4, normality is 0.3 * 2 =0.6 N. So 0.3 L *0.6 N = 0.18 eq.

Ba(OH)2 has a normality of 0.5 *2=1 N. So 0.2 L *1 =0.2 eq.

So total H+ equivalents: 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 eq.

OH- equivalents: 0.2 eq.

So the limiting is OH-; 0.2 eq will react.

Each equivalent releases 57 kJ. So 0.2 ×57=11.4 kJ.

So the enthalpy is -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal (since 1 kJ ≈ 0.239 kcal, 11.4 * 0.239 ≈ 2.72).

But in the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is more than 11.4. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 48.5 kJ, which doesn't match.

Wait a second, perhaps I should use the exact value of 57.3 kJ per mole of H+.

So 0.2 ×57.3 =11.46 kJ → which is approximately 11.5 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is a bit higher. But option B is -11.42 kcal. Converting 11.42 kcal to kJ: 11.42 ×4.184 ≈47.8 kJ. That doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to recalculate using exact numbers.

Wait, let me compute: 57 kJ per mole H+.

Moles of H+ neutralized: 0.2.

So 0.2 ×57 = 11.4 kJ → which is 11.4 kJ. So the answer would be -11.4 kJ, which is option D is -16.0, so that's not matching. Hmm.

But wait, the options don't have -11.4 kJ. The options are A) -2.72 kcal, B) -11.42 kcal, C) -3.80 kcal, D) -16.0 kJ.

So -2.72 kcal is about 11.4 kJ (because 2.72 ×4.184 ≈11.4 kJ). So if the answer is -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal, then option A would be correct.

But wait, why the discrepancy in units? Because the question uses a mix of kJ and kcal in the options. So perhaps the correct approach is to compute the value in kJ but see which option matches.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, which is -11.42 kcal, but that would only make sense if the enthalpy is about 48.5 kJ, which I don't think is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moles of H+.

Wait, let's recheck:

HCl: 0.2 M ×0.5 L =0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M ×0.3 L =0.09 mol H2SO4 → each gives 2 H+ → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M ×0.2 L =0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2.

So neutralization is 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH- → 0.2 mol H2O.

Enthalpy change is 0.2 ×57 kJ =11.4 kJ, which is -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. That doesn't match. So perhaps none of the options are correct, which can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each mole of H2SO4 contributes two H+ ions, and when neutralized by OH-, each H+ contributes 57 kJ. But maybe the question expects a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the stoichiometry differently. For example, maybe I should calculate the moles of H+ and OH- and sum all the neutralizations, but perhaps some reactions have different enthalpy values.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants the total heat from all possible neutralizations, including any excess.

Wait, but I think I've gone through that already.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the way to approach this is to find the total moles of H+ and OH- and see which is in excess.

H+ total: 0.28 mol.

OH- total:0.2 mol.

So neutralization of 0.2 mol H+ and OH- occurs.

Each H+ contributes 57 kJ, so 0.2 ×57 =11.4 kJ.

So the answer is -11.4 kJ, which is option D: -16.0 kJ? No, the closest option would be none of the options, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error in the moles.

Wait: HCl is 500 mL = 0.5 L. 0.2 M ×0.5 L =0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL =0.3 L. 0.3 M ×0.3 L =0.09 mol H2SO4 → each contributes 2 H+ → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL =0.2 L. 0.5 M ×0.2 L =0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So, total H+ is 0.28, OH- 0.2.

Neutralization: 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH- → 0.2 H2O.

Enthalpy: 0.2 ×57=11.4 kJ → which is 11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, D is -16.0 kJ. Not matching.

Hmm, but why is option B -11.42 kcal? Let me compute 11.42 kcal to kJ: 11.42 ×4.184 ≈48.0 kJ. That's way higher than 11.4 kJ. So perhaps the correct answer is not in the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem considers that the enthalpy is per mole of H2O, but for each mole of H+ + OH- → H2O, the enthalpy is -57.3 kJ per mole of H2O, which is the same as per mole of H+.

Wait, that shouldn't change the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the mixing of all three solutions and the heat released from all possible reactions.

Wait, but HCl and H2SO4 are both acids, and when mixed with a base, the neutralization occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total H+ and OH- and see if any of them are in excess, which I think I did.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Maybe I should write out the reactions.

HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H2O. But in this case, the base is Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but when HCl reacts with Ba(OH)2, the reaction is:

2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

Each mole of Ba(OH)2 neutralizes 2 HCl, which provides 2 H+.

So for each mole of Ba(OH)2, 2 H+ are neutralized.

Similarly, H2SO4 will react with Ba(OH)2. The reaction is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

In this case, each mole of H2SO4 provides 2 H+, and each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH-.

So for each mole of H2SO4, 2 H+ are neutralized by 2 OH-, so each H2SO4 reacts with 1 mole of Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but perhaps this approach is complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the amount of each acid and base and see which is the limiting reagent.

Let me think of it as a titration problem.

The total H+ from HCl: 0.1 mol.

H+ from H2SO4: 0.18 mol.

Total H+: 0.28.

The OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.2 mol.

So, the OH- is the limiting reagent.

So, the OH- will react with 0.2 mol H+.

Now, each mole of H+ contributes -57 kJ of enthalpy.

So, the total enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

So the answer is -11.4 kJ, which is option D is -16.0 kJ. That's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the given options have a typo, but I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating moles.

Wait, maybe I should compute the total moles correctly again.

HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 mol.

H2SO4: 0.3 M ×0.3 L =0.09 mol.

Ba(OH)2:0.5 M ×0.2 L=0.1 mol.

Total H+ is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.09 ×2 (from H2SO4) = 0.1+0.18=0.28.

OH- is 0.1 ×2=0.2.

So yes, 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

So, the OH- is limiting, 0.2 H+ will react.

Thus, the enthalpy is 0.2×57 =11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, the only one close in kJ is option D: -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer in kcal. So 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72).

So the enthalpy change would be -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But wait, why is option B -11.42 kcal? Because 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal, but that's not matching option B.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Oh wait, I think I see a mistake. The H2SO4 is 300 mL, which is 0.3 L. 0.3 M ×0.3 L =0.09 mol H2SO4. Each H2SO4 gives 2 H+ → 0.18 mol H+.

Wait, that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering that the H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but only the first H+ is strong, and the second is weak. So perhaps only 1 mole of H+ per H2SO4 is considered, but that's not correct because in solution, H2SO4 is a strong acid and fully dissociates for the first H+, but the second H+ (HSO4^- → SO4^2- + H+) is weak. But in the presence of a strong base, perhaps the second H+ would also dissociate. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but in the context of enthalpy of neutralization, the second H+ would still contribute. So perhaps the initial approach is correct.

Hmm. Given that, the only option that fits -11.4 kJ is not present. But option A is -2.72 kcal, which is about 11.4 kJ. So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But the options don't have -11.4 kJ as an option. So perhaps I should look again.

Wait, the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So, the correct answer in kJ is -11.4 kJ, which is not an option. So in kcal, it would be approximately -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But why is option B -11.42 kcal? That would be 48.4 kJ, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm mistaken about the enthalpy per mole. Some sources say that the enthalpy of neutralization is about 57 kJ per mole, but perhaps it's per mole of H+.

Wait, yes, each mole of H+ contributes 57 kJ. So I think my calculation is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer should be -11.4 kJ, but since that's not an option, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem uses the formula for heat released as q = n × ΔH, where ΔH is per mole of reaction.

But maybe the reaction is considering the neutralization of H2SO4 as a diprotic acid, so each mole releases 2 ×57 kJ.

Wait, that would change things.

Wait, for HCl, each mole releases 57 kJ.

For H2SO4, since it has two H+ ions, each mole would release 2 ×57 =114 kJ.

But in this problem, the neutralization is only partial because OH- is the limiting.

So let's recalculate:

HCl: 0.1 mol → 0.1 ×57 =5.7 kJ.

H2SO4: 0.09 mol →0.09 ×114 =10.26 kJ.

But wait, the OH- is 0.2 mol, which can neutralize 0.2 H+. So how much comes from each acid?

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the heat from each acid separately.

HCl contributes 0.1 H+, but the neutralization is only 0.2 H+.

So, HCl can provide all 0.1 H+, and the remaining 0.1 H+ comes from H2SO4.

So, HCl: 0.1 ×57 =5.7 kJ.

H2SO4: 0.1 ×57 =5.7 kJ (because only 0.1 H+ from H2SO4 are neutralized).

Total:5.7 +5.7=11.4 kJ.

So same result as before.

Thus, the enthalpy is -11.4 kJ, which would be approximately -2.72 kcal, so option A.

But the options don't have -11.4 kJ. So the correct answer must be option A.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing the given solutions, we first determine the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions contributed by each solution:

1. **HCl (500 mL, 0.2 M):**  
   HCl is a strong acid and dissociates completely into H⁺ and Cl⁻.  
   Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **H₂SO₄ (300 mL, 0.3 M):**  
   H₂SO₄ is a diprotic acid and dissociates completely into 2 H⁺ and SO₄²⁻.  
   Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.09 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Ba(OH)₂ (200 mL, 0.5 M):**  
   Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base and dissociates completely into Ba²⁺ and 2 OH⁻.  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

### Neutralization Reaction
The neutralization reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{H₂O} \).  
- Total moles of H⁺ = \( 0.1 \, \text{(from HCl)} + 0.18 \, \text{(from H₂SO₄)} = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).  
- Total moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  

The limiting reactant is OH⁻, as it is present in fewer moles. Therefore, 0.2 moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ will react to form water.

### Enthalpy of Neutralization
The standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) per mole of H⁺.  
Total enthalpy change = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).  

### Unit Conversion
To convert kJ to kcal:  
\( 1 \, \text{kJ} \approx 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \).  
\( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \approx -11.4 \times 0.239 = -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

### Matching with Options
- **Option A (-2.72 kcal):** Matches the calculated value of \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).  
- **Option B (-11.42 kcal):** This corresponds to approximately \( 48.5 \, \text{kJ} \), which is much larger than the calculated value.  
- **Option C (-3.80 kcal):** Does not match the calculated value.  
- **Option D (-16.0 kJ):** Does not match the calculated value of \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

### Final Answer
The correct answer is **Option A (-2.72 kcal)**, as it aligns with the calculated enthalpy change.  

Answer: A
