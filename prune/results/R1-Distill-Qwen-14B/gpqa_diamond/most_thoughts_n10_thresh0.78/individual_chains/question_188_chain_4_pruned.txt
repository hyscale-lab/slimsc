Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. 

Wait, rhombohedral crystal. I remember that rhombohedral structures have all sides equal and all angles equal too. So the lattice parameters a, b, c are all the same. In this case, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. So a = b = c = 10 Angstroms. And the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Right, because the question states alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees.

The interplanar distance is the d-spacing for a particular set of Miller indices, which here is (111). I think the formula for d-spacing in a crystal depends on the crystal system. Since it's rhombohedral, I should use the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal.

The general formula for interplanar distance d is given by:

d_{hkl} = (a^2 (h² + k² + l²) + ... ) / ... wait, no, wait. Alternatively, I think the formula for d is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) * something involving the angles )

Wait, I might be mixing up different crystal systems. For a cubic system, the formula is much simpler because all angles are 90 degrees. But for a rhombohedral system, the angles are 30 degrees here, so it's not cubic.

I recall that for a rhombohedral structure, the interplanar spacing formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos(alpha) - 2hl cos(beta) - 2kl cos(gamma) )

Wait, but since alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees, the expression simplifies. Let's plug in the values.

So for (111) plane, h=1, k=1, l=1.

So, d = a / sqrt(1² + 1² +1² - 2*1*1 cos(30) - 2*1*1 cos(30) - 2*1*1 cos(30)) )
