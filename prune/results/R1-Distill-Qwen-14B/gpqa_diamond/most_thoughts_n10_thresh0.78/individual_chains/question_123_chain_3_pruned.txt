Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and its ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, let me try to understand what's being asked. 

Alright, the problem says that the supernova's ejecta is moving directly towards the galaxy's center. Both the ejecta and the galaxy are in inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, that's really fast. Like, a significant fraction of the speed of light, right? Because the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is 20% of that. That means we can't ignore relativistic effects here. Oh, but wait, the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame over 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. Hmm, tricky.

So the question is, how much distance does the ejecta cover in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. I remember something about time dilation and length contraction in relativity. But wait, how do these concepts apply here?

Wait, the problem says both frames are inertial, so perhaps I can use the Lorentz transformation or the velocity addition formula. Alternatively, maybe using the time dilation formula would work.

Let me think. From the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at some velocity v. From the ejecta's frame, it's stationary, and the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So v is the same as the galaxy's speed in the ejecta's frame, but wait, in relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly because of the way reference frames work.

Wait no, actually, the velocity measured in one frame is different from what's seen in another. So if the galaxy is moving at u = 60,000 km/s in the ejecta's frame, then in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v, which might not be the same.

Wait, but the problem states that the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at 60,000 km/s from the galaxy's frame, perhaps? Or is it the other way around. Wait, no, the problem says "From
