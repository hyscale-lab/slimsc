Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because pH calculations can get tricky, especially when mixing different acids and bases. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says we have a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (which is acetic acid, a weak acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid), and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (a strong base). I need to find the pH of the resulting solution.

First, I remember that when mixing acids and bases, the strong ones will completely dissociate, while weak acids will only partially dissociate. So, I should calculate the moles of H+ from the strong acids and the moles of OH- from the strong base. The acetic acid will contribute some H+ ions, but not completely.

Wait, but another thing I remember is that when you mix solutions, the total volume changes. So I'll first find the total volume, which is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 liters.

Let me calculate the moles for each component.

Starting with CH3COOH: Molarity is 0.1 M, volume is 0.5 L. Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't fully donate H+; but I'll keep that in mind for later.

Next, HCl: 0.2 M and 0.4 L. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, it will dissociate completely, so 0.08 moles of H+.

Then, Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M and 0.3 L. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Therefore, moles of OH- = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, let's see what happens when these are mixed. The H+ from HCl and the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, how much H+ and OH- do we have?

Total H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles. Acetic acid will contribute some H+, but since it's a weak acid, I can't just add its moles directly yet. I'll have to account for that.

Wait, maybe I should first find the net moles of H+ and OH- after the strong acid and base have reacted. Because the OH- from the base will neutralize some of the H+ from the strong acid.

So, let's subtract the moles of OH- from H+.

H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

OH-: 0.18 moles.

So, 0.08 - 0.18 = -0.10 moles. Negative, which means more OH- than H+.

So, the excess OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles. But wait, no, because the neutralization would leave some OH-.

Wait, that's perhaps better phrased as: when you mix the strong acid and strong base, the H+ from HCl will react with the OH- from Ba(OH)2. The total H+ is 0.08, OH- is 0.18.

So, the acid has 0.08 H+ to neutralize the 0.18 OH-. So, the remaining OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

But wait, because the OH- is in excess, this will determine the pH as basic. But also, the acetic acid (CH3COOH) will contribute more H+ into the solution, so I need to consider that.

Wait, no. Because the solution has excess OH- from the strong base, which can react with the weak acid (CH3COOH). Because the OH- is a strong base, it will deprotonate the weak acid if possible.

Wait, but CH3COOH is an acid, so it can donate H+. OH- is a strong base; it will take H+ from any available source, including the CH3COOH.

So, the OH- (0.10 moles) can react with the CH3COOH. Let me think about the moles here.

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.05 moles. Moles of OH- available to react: 0.10.

Each mole of OH- can react with a mole of CH3COOH by taking a proton, turning it into CH3COO^-.

So, the OH- will neutralize some of the CH3COOH.

The reaction would be: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, how much OH- is consumed in this reaction? All 0.10 moles of OH- will react, but how much CH3COOH is available?

CH3COOH is 0.05 moles. So, OH- is 0.10, which is twice as much. So all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will react, consuming 0.05 moles of OH-, leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.

Wait, let me check: initial OH- after neutralizing HCl is 0.10 moles. Then, it reacts with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, so 0.05 moles of OH- are used, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH-.

Wait, but wait. The initial H+ from HCl is 0.08, and OH- is 0.18. So after neutralization, the OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10. So the OH- is 0.10 moles.

Then, this OH- will react with the CH3COOH. CH3COOH has 0.05 moles. Each mole of CH3COOH can provide one H+. So the OH- will take 0.05 moles of H+ from CH3COOH, neutralizing it and producing 0.05 moles of acetate.

So, after this reaction, the remaining OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

Wait, but wait. The initial OH- is 0.18. HCl provides 0.08 H+. So the OH- after neutralizing H+ is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10.

Then, the OH- (0.10) will react with CH3COOH (0.05). Since CH3COOH has 0.05 moles, the OH- will take all of it, leaving OH- of 0.05 moles.

So, now, the remaining OH- is 0.05 moles, and the solution also has some acetate ions (CH3COO^-) and possibly any remaining CH3COOH.

Wait, but after reacting, the CH3COOH is all converted to acetate? Because the OH- is in excess? Wait, no. Because the mole ratio is 1:1 between OH- and CH3COOH, and there's 0.05 moles each. So, all CH3COOH is neutralized, producing 0.05 moles of acetate.

So now, the OH- remaining is 0.05 moles.

Wait, but wait again. Let me recount.

HCl: 0.08 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles OH-.

So, H+ and OH- react: 0.08 + 0.18 = 0.26 total, but they neutralize each other. So, the result is 0.18-0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- left.

Then, these 0.10 moles of OH- will react with CH3COOH. CH3COOH is 0.05 moles.

Each mole of OH- reacts with a mole of CH3COOH, producing a mole of acetate and water.

So, after reaction, all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH are converted into acetate. The OH- used is 0.05 moles, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH-.

So, the solution now contains:

- 0.05 moles of OH- from the excess.

- 0.05 moles of acetate (CH3COO^-), which is the conjugate base of acetic acid.

Wait, but what about the other products? The H+ from the HCl and OH- have been neutralized, and the remaining OH- is 0.05 moles.

So, the total volume is 1.2 L. So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 = approximately 0.04167 M.

Wait, but wait a second. If there's excess OH- in solution, the pH would be determined by that. But also, the acetate ions could hydrolyze in water to produce some OH-.

Wait, no. Because the solution already has excess OH- from the strong base. So, the acetate ions might not hydrolyze much, because the solution is already basic. But I'm not entirely sure about that. Let me think.

Wait, in a basic solution, the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) is the conjugate base of a weak acid (CH3COOH). So, in a solution with high pH, the acetate might not hydrolyze much because the solution is already high in OH-.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of acetate doesn't contribute much to the pH in this case because the solution is already strongly basic due to excess OH- from Ba(OH)2.

So, perhaps the pH can be calculated just based on the excess OH-.

But let me make sure. Let me outline the steps again.

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08.

2. Calculate moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18.

3. Subtract to find excess OH-: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10.

4. Now, this OH- will react with CH3COOH (0.05 moles), neutralizing it and producing acetate.

5. After reaction, remaining OH-: 0.05 moles.

6. Total volume: 1.2 L.

So, concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0416667 M.

Then, pOH is log(1/[OH-])
