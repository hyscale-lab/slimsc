Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, the question is about finding the entropy of a supermassive black hole given its angular size. Hmm, I remember that black holes have something called entropy, which is related to their area, thanks to the holographic principle or something like that.

Wait, right, the entropy (S) of a black hole is given by the formula S = (A c³)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. But I think there's another way when you know the radius. Oh right, the Schwarzschild radius R is proportional to mass, R = 2 G M / c². So if I can find the radius or the mass, I can find A.

But wait, the problem gives the angular size theta. Oh, right, angular size θ is related to the actual size and the distance. The formula for angular size is θ ≈ d / R, where d is the distance and R is the radius. Since theta is small, we can use the small angle approximation, where θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the size divided by the distance.

So θ (in radians) = R / d. I can rearrange that to find R = θ * d. But theta is given in degrees, so I need to convert it to radians first. Oh right, to convert degrees to radians, I multiply by pi/180.

Let me jot down the given values:

Distance d = 1e10 parsecs.

Wait, I should convert parsecs into meters because the standard units for these formulas are in SI units. I remember that 1 parsec is approximately 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m. Let me calculate that: 3.086e26 meters.

Theta is 1e-17 degrees. So in radians, that's 1e-17 * (pi/180). Let me compute that: pi is about 3.1416, so 3.1416 / 180 is about 0.01745. So 1e-17 * 0.01745 is roughly 1.745e-19 radians.

Now, R = theta * d = 1.745e-19 rad * 3.086e26 m. Let me multiply those. 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 is approximately (1.745 *3.086) is about 5.37, and 1e-19 *1e26 is 1e7. So R ≈ 5.37e7 meters? Hmm, wait, that seems a bit small for a supermassive black hole. Wait, no, wait, wait, wait. Wait, 1e10 parsecs is 10 billion parsecs, which is a really large distance. So the event horizon's angular size is very small, but the actual size R would be (theta * d). So that calculation seems right.

Wait, 5.37e7 meters is 5.37e4 kilometers, which is about 5 light-seconds, but supermassive black holes are millions to billions of solar masses. Wait, the Schwarzschild radius for a solar mass is about 3 km. So a million solar masses would be 3e6 km, which is 3e9 meters. Hmm, wait, 5e7 m is about 5e4 km, which is 50,000 km. Wait, that's 5e4 km, which would be about 500,000 km for a million solar masses. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, let me recompute R. theta in radians is 1e-17 degrees * (
