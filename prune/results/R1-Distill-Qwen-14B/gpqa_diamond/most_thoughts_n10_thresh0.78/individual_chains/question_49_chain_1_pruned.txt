Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem about sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a pi bond along with adjacent sigma bonds. The Cope and Claisen rearrangements are classic examples, which are [3,3] sigmatropic shifts, right? But the question here involves three different reactions, each giving a product, and I need to match them to the options.

Let's break down each reaction one by one.

First reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol in the presence of H+ and heat. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is an allylic alcohol, and the other reagent is a methoxyamine. Hmm, I'm trying to recall the type of reaction here. Oh wait, maybe it's a Claisen-like rearrangement? Or perhaps a similar pericyclic reaction.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine has two methoxy groups on the same carbon as the amine. So the structure is (CH3O)2CH-NH2? No, wait, ethan-1-amine is CH2NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxy would be OCH3 attached to the same carbon as NH2. So structure: H2N-C(OCH3)2. Hmm, but how does that react with but-3-en-2-ol under acidic conditions?

Alternatively, maybe it's an example of a Stork enamine reaction. Oh wait, no, Stork is for forming rings with alpha elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Cope or Claisen rearrangement. Wait, but Claisen is for esters or ethers. Wait, wait, maybe it's an example of a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement where an enamine is formed.

Wait, but the starting material is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. Maybe under acidic conditions, the amine could form an iminium ion? Or perhaps the methoxy groups are leaving groups. Alternatively, maybe the structure is arranging to form an enamine with the but-3-en-2-ol.

Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2. Wait, but the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OH, but that would be allyl alcohol. Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? No, no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol has double bond between carbons 3 and 4? No, because but has four carbons. So but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait,
