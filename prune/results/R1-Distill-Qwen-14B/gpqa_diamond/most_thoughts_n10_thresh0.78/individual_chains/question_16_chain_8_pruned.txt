Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when there's a chiral center, a molecule that isn't symmetrical and can't be superimposed on its mirror image.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to determine how many are optically active. Let's go through each one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: Wait, the structure here is a double bond. Let me draw it. The molecule is Cl attached to carbon 1, which is double-bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group and another substituent. Oh wait, the configuration is Z, meaning the higher priority groups are on the same side. But does that create a chiral center? The central carbon is C2? No, because carbon 1 is connected to Cl, C2 (double bond), and two more carbons perhaps? Wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, butene is four carbons. So, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is Cl attached to C1, which is double-bonded to C2. So C1 has Cl, C2 (double bond), and two more substituents. Oh wait, but for a double bond, each carbon is attached to two other atoms. So C1 has Cl and the double bond to C2. C2 has CH2, a methyl, and the double bond. Wait, but the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-? Hmm, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Alternatively, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-C(CH2CH2CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So substituting Cl on C1 and methyl on C2 would make it Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, maybe it's Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2â€“CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2
