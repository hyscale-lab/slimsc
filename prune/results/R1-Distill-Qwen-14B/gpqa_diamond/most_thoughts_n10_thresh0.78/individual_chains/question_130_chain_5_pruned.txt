Okay, so I've got this science question in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space. These clouds absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is approximately 1216 Angstroms. The task is to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.

Hmm, I remember that redshift is a key concept in cosmology. When a galaxy or object is moving away from us, its light is redshifted. The redshift (z) is calculated based on how much the wavelength of the light has stretched due to the expansion of the universe.

Lyman alpha emission is a specific spectral line in hydrogen. The Lyman alpha wavelength is about 121.6 nanometers, which is 1216 Angstroms. So, when we observe this line, if the object emitting it is at a certain redshift, the observed wavelength will be longer, right?

Wait, but in this case, it's not emission but absorption. The hydrogen clouds are absorbing light from background quasars. So, the quasar's light is being absorbed at the Lyman alpha wavelength for the hydrogen. So, the quasar's light has to have a wavelength that, when redshifted by the hydrogen cloud's motion, matches the Lyman alpha wavelength. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. The absorption line occurs at the rest wavelength of the Lyman alpha. If the cloud is moving away from us, the wavelength of the absorbed light (from the quasar) would be longer than the rest wavelength. So, the observed wavelength would be (1 + z) times the rest wavelength.

But wait, the quasar emits a broad spectrum, and if the hydrogen cloud is at a certain redshift, it will absorb the quasar's light at the wavelength corresponding to Lyman alpha in the cloud's frame. So, for us to see that absorption line in the optical range, the wavelength after redshift must be within the range observable by ground-based telescopes.

Ground-based optical telescopes typically observe in the range of about 350 nm to around 1000 nm (visible light). So, if the Lyman alpha absorption line is shifted into this range, we can detect it.

The rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm. So, when this is redshifted, the observed wavelength lambda_obs is lambda_rest * (1 + z).

We want lambda_obs to be less than or equal to about 1000 nm (1 micron) because beyond that, it's infrared, which isn't typically captured by optical ground-based telescopes. Wait, but some telescopes can go a bit into the near-infrared, but I think the question is considering optical as up to about 1 micron.

Wait, some more details. The Lyman alpha line is at 1216 Angstrom
