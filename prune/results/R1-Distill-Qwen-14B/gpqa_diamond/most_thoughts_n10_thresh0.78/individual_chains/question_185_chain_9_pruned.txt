Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian is given as H equals epsilon times the dot product of sigma and n. Sigma is the Pauli vector, right? So sigma is made up of the Pauli spin matrices.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z, each being 2x2 matrices. So when they write H = ε σ·n, that must mean the dot product, which is summing each component multiplied by the corresponding component of n. So H = ε (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z).

Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1. That might come into play later.

I remember that the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix are ±1. Wait no, each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, but when they're multiplied by a scalar or combined, the eigenvalues change. Wait, maybe I should think about the general case for a spin operator.

The Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so their linear combination with real coefficients (which n has, because it's a unit vector) is also Hermitian. So H is Hermitian, which means it has real eigenvalues.

Now, to find the eigenvalues, I can think about the structure of H. Another approach: The spin operator in the direction of n is σ·n. So σ·n is like the spin component along n. The eigenvalues of σ·n would then be ±1, because each Pauli matrix's eigenvalues are ±1, and the dot product just scales each component.

But wait, wait. Let me think about the operator σ·n more carefully. The eigenvalues of σ·n should be the same as those of any of the Pauli matrices because it's just a rotated version. Because n is an arbitrary direction, but the eigenvalues should be the same. So the eigenvalues would be +1 and -1.

But wait, the Hamiltonian H is ε times that. So H = ε (σ·n). So the eigenvalues would be ε times the eigenvalues of σ·n. So that would be ε * 1 and ε * (-1), so eigenvalues are ε and -ε.

Wait, but wait another thought
