Alright, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, okay, let's start breaking it down. I remember from my studies that observables in quantum mechanics are represented by matrices, and the probabilities of measuring certain outcomes involve eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

The problem says the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, no, actually, waitâ€”column matrices are vectors, right? So the state is a vector with components [-1, 2, 1]. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized. Let me check if this vector is normalized. The norm would be the square root of the sum of the squares of the components. So (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, and 1^2 is 1. Adding those gives 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). But for a quantum state, it should have a norm of 1. So does that mean the given state isn't normalized? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, the question states it's the state, so perhaps it's implicitly normalized? Or do I need to normalize it first before proceeding?

Wait, no, wait. Let me read the question again. It says the state is the column matrix with elements (-1,2,1). So that's the vector. So the first thing to do is perhaps normalize it because in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized to 1. So I'll calculate the
