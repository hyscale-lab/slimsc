Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these two reactions. Let me take it step by step. 

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with a reagent A, and it produces 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction starts with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (H2O), which gives 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. I need to choose the correct options for A and B from the given choices.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one is reacting with NaCN and A. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, it's typically a nucleophilic addition. Wait, but under what conditions? Oh right, the formation of a cyanohydrin. The cyanide ion adds to the carbonyl, and then the oxygen picks up a proton. But wait, how does that happen? 

In the case of ketones, adding NaCN would typically require an acid catalyst. So, perhaps A is an acid like H3O+ (which is option A and B) or something else. But wait, I also remember that sometimes H2SO4 is used, but in the options, I see other possibilities. 

In the first reaction, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write that structure. The carbon chain is four carbons, with a hydroxyl and a nitrile group on the same carbon. So, the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. That makes sense because the cyanide added to the carbonyl, and the oxygen became an -OH after protonation.

So for the cyanohydrin formation, the reagent A is the acid. Because the reaction typically proceeds under acidic conditions. So A should be something like H3O+. Looking at the options, option A and B have A as H3O+. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3, which is sodium bisulfate, a source of H+ and SO3^2-.

Wait, but why would NaHSO3 be used? NaHSO3 can act as an acid because HSO3^- is a weak acid. Alternatively, maybe it's
