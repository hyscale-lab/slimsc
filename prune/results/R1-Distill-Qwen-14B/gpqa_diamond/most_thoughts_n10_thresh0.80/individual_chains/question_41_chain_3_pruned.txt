Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. Hmm, a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking about the speed of the light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is in the glass. I remember that when a medium is moving, the speed of light within it can be affected.

Wait, but speed of light in a medium is generally c/n, right? So the speed inside the glass is v_light = c/n. But wait, the glass itself is moving. Does that affect how fast the light is moving relative to the lab frame?

Hmm. Oh, right, in classical mechanics, velocities add up. Like, if you have an object moving at velocity u in a medium that's moving at velocity v, then the object's velocity relative to the lab is u + v. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when you're adding velocities, it's not just a simple addition. Oh, but wait, that's in relativity. Wait, but light speed is a constant in vacuum, but this isn't a vacuum. So maybe we can ignore relativity here because the velocities are probably much smaller than c.

Wait, the problem says to take c=1, so units might be in terms of c
