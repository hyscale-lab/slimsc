Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. Oh right, the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that's 0.02 M in a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also gave me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. And the pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about that complicating things. 

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The problem gives the concentration of the complex, which is Ca-EDTA, so I think the formula would be something like CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA part. 

The formation constant, Kf, is usually given for the formation of the complex from its ions. So the reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA⁴− ↔ CaEDTA²−, right? And the Kf is [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴−]). 

But wait, in this problem, they've given K_Ca-EDTA as 5x10^10. I think that's the same as the formation constant Kf. So Kf is 5e10. 

The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So that's [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M. We need to find [Ca²+]. 

Wait, but wait. EDTA is a polydentate ligand, and when it forms a complex like Ca-EDTA, it's in the Y^4- form. But I remember that the free EDTA in solution is in different protonated forms depending on pH, but the problem says the pH is ideal, so maybe the pH is such that EDTA is fully deprotonated. So the assumption is that EDTA is in the Y^4- form, so the solution can treat it as [EDTA^4-] being approximately equal to the concentration of the free EDTA. 

Hmm, but wait, in reality, EDTA exists in different protonation states, but since the pH is ideal, maybe all the EDTA is in the Y^4- form. So, the problem might be simplifying it, so we don't have to consider the different forms of EDTA. Thus, the concentration of free EDTA is [Y^4-], and we're assuming that's the same as the concentration of the uncomplexed EDTA.

So, the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and Y^4- with Kf = 5e10. 

So, the equation from Kf would be:

Kf = [CaEDTA²−] / ( [Ca²+][Y⁴−] )

We know [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 M. Let me let [Ca²+] = x, and [Y⁴−] = y. Then:

5e10 = 0.02 / (x * y)

But wait, what's the relationship between x and y? Since each mole of CaEDTA²− releases one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of Y⁴−, assuming that the solution is in equilibrium, and that the initial concentrations are only from the complex dissociating.
