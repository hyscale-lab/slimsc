Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit confused, but let's break it down step by step. I remember that when stars have spots, it affects their overall temperature and how we observe certain elements in their spectrum.

The problem says that the star has a Teff of 6000 K when there are no spots, but when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, wait. Hmm, but wait, starspots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere, right? So if 40% is covered, the average temperature of the entire photosphere goes down. 

The question is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. The ratio is n1/n2, I think. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So without spots, it's higher, and with spots, it's lower. 

I remember that the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. 

Wait, but in this case, the ratio is n1/n2. So if the ratio is n1/n2, then it's 1/(n2/n1) which is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). 

So the problem is, we need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So factor = (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Since the ratio decreases when spots are present, that means (n1/n2)_with_spots is lower. So the factor would be greater than 1.

But wait, let's think about the temperatures. The effective temperature of the entire star is 5500 K when 40% is spotted. But wait, what's the temperature of the spotted regions? Are we assuming that the spots are at a lower temperature, and the rest is at 6000 K?

Wait, the problem says when the star's surface is not covered by
