Okay, so I've got this question about stars and parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think through this step by step.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Wait, uniform distribution usually means that they are spread out evenly. So, I guess that means the number density of stars is the same everywhere. But how does that relate to parallax?

Parallax is a measure of distance. I remember that parallax (denoted as 'plx') is inversely proportional to distance. Oh right, the formula is distance d = 1 / plx, but in parsecs. So a star with a larger parallax is closer to us.

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, like, how does the number of stars change as we look at different ranges of parallax. Do more stars fall into a small range of parallax at lower or higher values?

Wait, since parallax is inversely related to distance, a larger plx means closer stars, and a smaller plx means more distant stars. So, if stars are uniformly distributed in space, then the number of stars at a certain distance depends on the volume of space at that distance.

But wait, the volume element in spherical coordinates involves r squared. I think that the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r would be proportional to r² dr, because the surface area is 4πr² and thickness dr. So, if the number density is uniform, say n stars per unit volume, then the number in a shell would be n * 4πr² dr.

But how does this
