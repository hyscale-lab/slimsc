Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question has two parts, each involving a reaction. I need to find the right reagents (A and B) from the options given.

First reaction: butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? It's a ketone. NaCN is sodium cyanide, which is a nucleophile. So maybe this is some kind of nucleophilic addition.

Wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone, and in the presence of a base, the alpha carbon (the one adjacent to the carbonyl) can deprotonate. Oh wait, but NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So perhaps the reaction is a Michael addition or just a nucleophilic attack.

Wait, but butan-2-one is CH3-CO-CH2-CH3? No wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, butan-2-one is (CH₂)₂CO, that is, CH3-C(O)-CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let me get the structure right. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so the carbonyl is in the middle. Structure: CH3-C(O)-CH2CH3? No, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)₂CO, so it's (CH3)₂C=O. So the carbonyl is at position 2, with two methyl groups attached.

So, when NaCN is added, perhaps the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon. But wait, in a ketone, the carbonyl is not as reactive as in an aldehyde. But in the presence of a base, maybe it's more reactive.

Wait, so the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write the structure. So the nitrile group (CN) is attached to the same carbon as the hydroxyl (OH) and a methyl group. Wait, the product structure is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So butanen
