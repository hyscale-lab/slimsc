Okay, so I have this question about astronomy, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars ~ 1/plx^5. Hmm, right. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh yeah, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if plx is small, the object is far away, and if plx is large, it's nearby.

Wait, the formula I remember is that distance (r) is approximately 1 over plx, but I think it's more precise to say r ≈ 1 / plx, where plx is in parsecs. Because 1 parsec is the distance at which 1 AU subtends 1 arcsecond. So yeah, distance r is inversely proportional to parallax plx. So r = 1 / plx. Or maybe plx = 1/r, since plx in arcseconds.

So the number of stars N is proportional to 1 / plx^5. Let me write that down. N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

But I want to express N in terms of r, because the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So since plx = 1/r, I can substitute that in.

Wait, wait. Let me make this substitution correctly. If plx = 1/r, then plx^5 = (1/r)^5 = 1/r^5. So 1/(plx^5) is 1/ (1/r^5) ) which is r^5. So N ∝ r^5. Oh, that's a big increase.

Wait, but wait. The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. So it's the rate of change of N with respect to r. Or perhaps it's the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r + dr. Because the number in a volume element depends on the cube of the radius (since volume is r^3), but this is different.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The number of stars in a region as a function of distance. So if we have a region at distance r, how does the number of stars change with r? Like, if you move a little bit in distance, how does N change?

Alternatively, maybe it's the differential. So if N ∝
