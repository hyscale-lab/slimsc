Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about spin states and measuring the probability of an electron being in certain eigenstates of an operator. Also, finding the average value of that operator. Alright, let's unpack this step by step.

The problem states that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1 + i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So, I think the first thing I need to do is normalize this state because probabilities depend on the state being a unit vector. Oh wait, the question just says it's proportional, so normalization is the first step. Right.

First, let me write down the state. The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. But since it's proportional, the actual coefficients might not be normalized yet. So, I'll compute the norm of this vector to find the normalization constant.

The norm squared is (1+i)(1-i) + (2 - i)(2 + i) because for spin-½ systems, |up> and |down> are orthonormal, so the inner product of different states is zero. So each coefficient squared magnitude adds up.

Calculating each term:

(1+i)(1-i) = 1^2 + (i)(-i) + i*1 + (-i)*1? Wait, no, actually, (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b². So (1+i)(1-i) = 1² - (i)² = 1 - (-1) = 2.

Similarly, (2 - i)(2 + i) = 2² - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) = 5. So the total norm squared is 2 +5=7. Therefore, the norm is sqrt(7). So to normalize, the state becomes |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Next, the problem talks about an operator whose matrix representation is A_ij. The elements are A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, this would look like:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0] ]

Wait, because when i≠j, A_ij is ħ/2. So the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. So this is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. Hmm, interesting.

Wait, but what operator has this matrix representation? It looks like it's proportional to the Pauli X operator, but with different elements. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this A matrix is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So the operator is A = (ħ/2) σ_x.

So the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of σ_x. Because σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, so A will have eigenvalues (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1), that is, ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Wait, but wait: The eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>. Let me recall the exact forms. The |+x> state is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Or wait, maybe it's (|up> + i|down>)/sqrt(2) and similar? No, no, wait: σ_x is the Pauli X matrix. Its eigenstates are |+x> = (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|0> - |1>)/sqrt(2), but in our case, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of σ_z. So yeah, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So the operator A's eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, with eigenvalues ħ/2 and -ħ/2 respectively.

But wait, the question is asking for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of this operator, so we need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x> and find the probabilities.

Alternatively, since A is a Hermitian operator (as it's given by a matrix representation with real elements, I think), the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes for each eigenstate.

So, the plan is:

1. Express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |-x>.
2. The coefficients will give the square of their magnitudes as the probabilities.
3. Then, compute the expectation value of A, which is the sum of eigenvalues multiplied by their respective probabilities.

But wait, another approach: since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, and the expectation value of σ_x in the state |alpha> is ⟨alpha| σ_x |alpha⟩. Then, the expectation value of A would be (ħ/2) times that.

But maybe it's easier to proceed step by step.

First, normalize |alpha>.

As we did earlier, |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, we need to express |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>. Let me write that:

|alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>

Our goal is to find c_+ and c_-.

Expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, substituting:

|alpha> = c_+ (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + c_- (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Grouping terms:

|alpha> = [ (c_+ + c_-)/sqrt(2) ) ] |up> + [ (c_+ - c_-)/sqrt(2) ) ] |down>

But we know |alpha> is expressed as:

[ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>

So, equating the coefficients:

( c_+ + c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (1 + i)/sqrt(7)
( c_+ - c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

So, let me write these as two equations:

1. (c_+ + c_-) = (1 + i) / sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)
2. (c_+ - c_-) = (2 - i) / sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)

Wait, no. Let's clarify.

Wait, let me think. Let's denote equation 1 as:

(c_+ + c_-) / sqrt(2) = (1 + i)/sqrt(7) → equation (1)

Equation (2): (c_+ - c_-) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7) → equation (2)

We can write this as:

Equation (1): c_+ + c_- = (1 + i) sqrt(7/2 )
Equation (2): c_+ - c_- = (2 - i) sqrt(7/2 )

Now, we can add and subtract these equations to solve for c_+ and c_-.

Adding equations (1) and (2):

2 c_+ = [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ] sqrt(7/2 )
→ 2 c_+ = (3) sqrt(7/2 )
→ c_+ = (3/2) sqrt(7/2 ) = 3/(2) * sqrt(7)/sqrt(2) ) → sqrt(7)*3/(2 sqrt(2)) )

Wait, let me compute that:

sqrt(7/2) is sqrt(7)/sqrt(2). So,

c_+ = (3/2) * sqrt(7)/sqrt(2) = 3 sqrt(7) / (2 sqrt(2)) 

Similarly, subtract equation (2) from equation (1):

2 c_- = [ (1 + i) - (2 - i) ] sqrt(7/2 )
→ 2 c_- = [ (1-2) + (i + i) ) ] sqrt(7/2 )
→ 2 c_- = [ (-1) + 2i ] sqrt(7/2 )
→ c_- = [ (-1 + 2i)/2 ] sqrt(7/2 )

Wait, let me compute each step again.

In equation (1) and (2):

Equation (1): c_+ + c_- = (1+i) sqrt(7/2 )

Equation (2): c_+ - c_- = (2 - i) sqrt(7/2 )

Adding (1) + (2): 2 c_+ = (1 + i + 2 - i ) sqrt(7/2 )

→ 2 c_+ = (3) sqrt(7/2 )

So, c_+ = (3/2) * sqrt(7/2 )

Similarly, subtracting (2) from (1):

(c_+ + c_- ) - (c_+ - c_- ) = 2 c_- = (1 + i - 2 + i ) sqrt(7/2 )

→ 2 c
