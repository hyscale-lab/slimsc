Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled. The question is about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in qubit space.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I think I've seen something like this before. Let me think about what this represents. Oh right! The identity matrix divided by two, because |0><0| and |1><1| are the basis states, and adding them gives the identity matrix when you have a two-level system.

So, the identity matrix for a 2x2 system is [[1,0],[0,1]]. When you multiply by 1/2, it becomes [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. I remember that the density matrix for a completely mixed state is (I/2), which is exactly what this is. So ρ is a maximally mixed state for a qubit.

Now, the question is about its geometrical position in the qubits space. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think the space of qubit states can be visualized using the Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector represents the state, where pure states are on the surface and mixed states are inside. For a maximally mixed state, where is it located?

Wait, the Bloch sphere has a radius of 1. Pure states are on the surface with vectors of length 1. Mixed states are inside, with vectors shorter than 1. But for the completely mixed state, what's the Bloch vector? I think that the maximally mixed state corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere. Because it's the maximally uncertain state, so its vector has zero length. So the coordinates would be (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). Another option is B, which is (0,0,1). Oh wait, (0,0,1) is along the z-axis, which would be the state |0> or |1> depending on direction. But since our state is mixed, it's more like the center.

Wait a second, another thought: The density matrix can also be represented in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2
