Alright, let me try to figure out this chemistry problem. Okay, so the question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. Let's break down each step and see what each reaction tells us.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

And there are some hints given. Let's look at them.

Hint a: When compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. So, the product from the Wittig reaction is an alkene. The structure given is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me draw that.

The propan-2-ylidene group is a substituent on the cyclopentane. So, the cyclopentane ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4. The substituent at position 4 is the propenylidene group, which is like a CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 or something similar? Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH3)=, right? Because the ylidene group is a double bond attached to a methyl group.

Wait, the structure is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So positions 1 and 2 have methyl groups, and position 4 has the propenylidene group. So the cyclopentane ring has a double bond from the ylidene group. That suggests that the Wittig reaction was applied to compound A, which must have a carbonyl group (either aldehyde or ketone) because that's what the Wittig reacts with.

So, compound A is a cyclopentane derivative with a carbonyl group. Let me think. If the product after Wittig is a cyclopentane with a substituent that's a propenylidene group, then the starting carbonyl in A is probably a ketone.

Wait, but the product is an alkene. So compound A must have a carbonyl group (like a ketone) which, upon treatment with the Wittig reagent, forms an alkene.

So, the structure of compound A must be a cyclopentanone with substituents. Let me imagine: the product after Wittig is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. That suggests that the Wittig was added to the cyclopentanone, replacing the carbonyl with an alkene.

Wait, but cyclopentanone has a carbonyl at a specific position. Let's say if the ketone is at position 1, then the Wittig would add an
