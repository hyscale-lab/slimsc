Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, so the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^5. I need to find out how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit distance range. The options are A to D, with different exponents on r.

Wait, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance (d) in parsecs, right? So plx = 1/d. Or wait, is it the other way around? Oh wait, yeah, because the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs.

So the number of stars (N) is proportional to 1/plx^5. Let me substitute plx with 1/d. So, 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that. (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so 1 divided by that is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. Wait, but wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Hmm, because the number doesn't just depend on distance, but on how it's distributed.

Wait, maybe I should think about differential number density. The number of stars per unit volume, or per unit distance
