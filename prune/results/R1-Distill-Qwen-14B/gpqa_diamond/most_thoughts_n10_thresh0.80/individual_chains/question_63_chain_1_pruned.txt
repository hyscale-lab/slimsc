Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and its quantum states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is made of atoms X and Y. The problem gives me their masses: Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would switch it to the next lowest energy state. So, I think this is about energy transitions in the molecule, probably involving both rotational and vibrational energies.

Wait, the fundamental state... I think that refers to the lowest energy vibrational state. Because in the quantum harmonic oscillator model, the ground state is the fundamental vibrational state. So maybe the molecule is in the ground vibrational state, and we're looking at a transition involving rotation or maybe vibration.

Wait, but the question mentions the non-rigid rotor model, which I'm a bit confused about. The rigid rotor model treats the bond length as fixed, but the non-rigid (or vibrationally accurate) model allows the bond to stretch and bend, so the rotational energy and vibrational energy are coupled. Hmm, or maybe it's considering both rotational and vibrational energies in some way.

But wait, the question is about the photon momentum needed to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps the molecule is absorbing a photon that causes a transition between energy levels, and I need to find the energy of that photon, then convert it to momentum.

Wait, photons have energy E = hÎ½, and momentum p = E/c. But wait, photons also carry momentum, yes. So the momentum of the absorbed photon would relate to the energy difference between two states.

So the main idea is to calculate the energy difference between the current state and the next possible state, and then determine the photon's momentum from that.

But what's the current state and what's the next state? The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I believe is the lowest energy state. So the next state would be the first excited state.

Wait, but in the rotation-vibration model, each state is a combination of rotational and vibrational levels. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (n=0), and
