Okay, so I need to find the energy of the RHIC when the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So lithium has 3 protons usually. With 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion, which is basically a helium-3 nucleus? Wait, no, wait. No, Li-6 has 3 protons, 3 neutrons, so it's a charged particle with charge +3e, since Li has atomic number 3.

So, the problem is about relativistic energy. The speed is given as 0.96c, which is pretty high, so we can't use classical mechanics; we need to use special relativity.

The question is asking for the energy of the nucleus. I think the energy here refers to the total relativistic energy, which includes both kinetic and rest mass energy. But wait, sometimes in particle physics, the energy given is the kinetic energy. Wait, but the question says "the energy of the RHIC". RHIC accelerates heavy ions, so I think the energy they refer to is the kinetic energy per ion, or the total energy?

Wait, the RHIC typically refers to the collision energy. But the question says "so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". So perhaps it's asking for the kinetic energy, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps
