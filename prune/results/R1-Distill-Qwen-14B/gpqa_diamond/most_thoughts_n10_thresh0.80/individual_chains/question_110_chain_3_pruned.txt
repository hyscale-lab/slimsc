Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll take it step by step.

The question is asking which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Both are high-resolution spectrographs, but their brightness limits are different. From the question, I remember that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. Wait, but wait, I think I might be mixing it up. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a telescope can observe stars brighter than 17, that's easier because brighter stars (lower mag) are more detectable. But wait, the way it's phrased, "brighter than 17 mag"â€”so apparent V magnitude less than 17? Because higher magnitude means dimmer. So if a star has apparent magnitude 16, it's brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So any star with apparent magnitude less than or equal to 16 can be detected by HIRES. But wait, no, because if a star is brighter, its magnitude is lower. So, for example
