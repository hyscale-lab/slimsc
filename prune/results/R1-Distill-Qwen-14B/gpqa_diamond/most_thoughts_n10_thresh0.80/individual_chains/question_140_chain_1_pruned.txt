Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, there's a chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it step by step. Hmm, the question involves several substances reacting and gives some clues about their properties. I'll start by breaking down each part.

The first part says substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W has molecules with the same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, same number of neutrons and protons? So for a molecule, each atom contributes to that. Let me think. If a molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons, like maybe H2O or something else. Wait, but wait. Or perhaps W is a single atom with equal protons and neutrons. Wait, but gas W's molecule has same neutrons and protons. So, for example, if it's a diatomic molecule like O2, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons? No, because the atomic mass of O is about 16, but that's usually 8 protons and 8 neutrons for the most common isotope, but that's the same for each atom in O2. But wait, the molecule as a whole would have 16 protons (2 atoms × 8 each) and same neutrons. So, protons in molecule: 16, neutrons: 16. So, same number. That fits. So W could be O2. But wait, another possibility: maybe it's another molecule.

Wait, but another possibility is that each molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. So like, for example, NH3 has 14 protons (1+3×1=4? Wait no, wait. Let me think. Wait, the molecule as a whole. Let's see, for CO2: C has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (if it's 12C), O has 8 each. So CO2 has 6+16=22 protons, and 6×1 + 16×2= 6 +32=38 neutrons. Hmm, no, not same. Another idea: perhaps W is a noble gas, like Ar. But Ar is monoatomic. But then, for Ar, the number of protons is 18, neutrons would be 22 if it's the most common isotope (Ar-
