Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, stability constants, right? Those are the formation constants, which tell us how stable a complex is.

The problem asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. I remember that the blue color is associated with the [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ complexes, specifically the one with two SCN- ligands, maybe? Or wait, I think the blue is the [Co(SCN)_2]^+ complex. Oh wait, but which n gives that color? I'm not certain, but the question says "dithiocyanato", which implies two SCN- per Co.

Wait, the options are about the percentage of the blue complexes. So I need to find the fraction of Co species present as [Co(SCN)_2]^+.

I think the general approach here is to calculate the distribution of Co among different complexation states using the stability constants. The stability constants are for each step of complex formation.

So, the complexes would be: Co^2+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^+, [Co(SCN)_3]^something, and [Co(SCN)_4]^something. But the stability constants are given as β1 to β4, which probably represent the stepwise formation constants. So β1 is for the first SCN adding, β2 for the second, β3 for the third, and β4 for the fourth.

Wait, the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β is the formation constant for adding another SCN-.

The formation of the complexes occurs stepwise, so the overall stability constant for the n-th complex would be the product of β1 to βn. Oh wait, no, it's stepwise. So the overall constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^m
