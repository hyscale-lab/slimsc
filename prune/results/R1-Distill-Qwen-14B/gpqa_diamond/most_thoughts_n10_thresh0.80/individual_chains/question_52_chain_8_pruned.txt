Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's think it through.

The question is about a star's properties when it has spots and when it doesn't. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Then, when looking at the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2), the ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star isn't spotted compared to when it is.

Hmm, okay, so first, I remember that the number of atoms in different energy levels in a star's photosphere can be described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So without spots, the ratio is higher. Let me think: when the temperature is lower (because spots make it cooler), the exponential term becomes more significant. Since the spots lower the temperature, the ratio of n1/n2 would change.

The transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. That's in the ultraviolet, I think. But wait, maybe that's just the emission line or something. Not sure if that's directly relevant here. Oh wait, wait, wait. The wavelength relates to the energy difference between the two levels. Because E = hc/λ. So the energy difference (E2 - E1) is hc/(λ). So we can compute that.

Let me jot down the variables:

- Without spots: T1 = 6000 K
- With spots: T2 = 5500 K
- The ratio (n1/n2) when no spots is R1, and when with spots is R2. We need R1/R2.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So R1 > R2. So the factor is R1/R2.

Wait, since (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1.

But wait, the ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), because it's (n1)/(n2) = (g1/g2) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). So n1/n2 = C * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where C is (g1/g2). So if temperature T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp becomes smaller. So the ratio n1/n2 would decrease when T decreases.

But wait, in the problem, when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio decreases. So that aligns with what I just thought. So R1 is the ratio at T1, R2 at T2.

We need to find R1/R2 = [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ].

Because (g1/g2) would cancel out if it's the same in both situations. So:

R1/R2 = exp[ (ΔE/(k) ) (1/T1 - 1/T2) * (1) ) ]

Wait, because:

R1/R2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] ) = exp( [ΔE/(k)] (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, because when you divide
