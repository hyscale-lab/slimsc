Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass oscillates around an equilibrium point due to a restoring force, usually F = -kx. But wait, this one is relativistic, so I have to consider relativistic effects. The question is about finding the maximum speed v_max of the mass.

Let me think. In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy at maximum speed is (1/2)mv_max². So setting them equal, v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). Oh wait, that's option C. But since this is a relativistic problem, I guess that approach isn't directly applicable. Relativistic effects probably come into play because when velocities become significant compared to the speed of light, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore.

Wait, in relativity, the total energy is gamma times mc². The oscillator's potential energy is (1/2)kx², but when considering relativistic speeds, the kinetic energy isn't just the non-relativistic term. So maybe I need to equate the total mechanical energy at maximum displacement.

In the harmonic oscillator, the total energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential. At maximum displacement x = A, the velocity is zero, so E = (1/2)kA². But in the relativistic case, when the mass reaches maximum speed, all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But wait, in relativity, the total energy is gamma mc², which includes rest mass energy.

So at the equilibrium position (x=0), the potential energy is zero. All the energy is kinetic, so E = gamma mc². But wait, E should be the same everywhere in the system. So at x=A, E is (1/2)kA². So, at x=A, E = (1/2)kA² = gamma mc²? Or wait, no. Because in the relativistic case, the potential energy might be different. Or maybe the system's total energy includes the rest mass energy plus the potential energy.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. In a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is still (1/2)
