Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method detects planets by looking for shifts in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The more massive the planet and the closer it is to the star, the bigger the shift, I think.

The question says there are two stars with exactly the same masses, both similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with masses similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So the key here is that the stars are identical, which probably means their masses are the same, so when calculating, those factors can be treated equally.

Now, the main point is about the spectral line shifts. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, I need to figure out how the shift relates to the planet's orbital period. Because the question is asking about the ratio of the orbital periods of planet #2 to planet #1.

I think the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us. The formula involved here probably relates the velocity amplitude (K) of the star to the planet's orbit. I remember that the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by some formula involving the planet's mass, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the distance of the planet from the star.

The formula I'm trying to recall is K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ] * (1 / (P^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5))) ) )^(1/3) )? Wait, maybe that's not exactly right. Oh wait, another approach: since the star and planet orbit their mutual center of mass, the star's velocity is inversely proportional to the planet's velocity. But because the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's (Neptune is way less than the Sun), maybe M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So the formula might simplify.

Wait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (2πG) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p << M_*, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (2πG) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_*^(2/3) )

But in this problem, both planets have the same mass (similar to Neptune) and their host stars have the same mass (like the Sun), so M_p and M_* are the same for both. Also, the inclination i is probably the same since the orbits are circular and the shifts are detected, so sin i is 1, I think.

So K is proportional to (1 / P^(1/3) ), because K ≈ (something) * (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Wait, no, wait. Let me get it right. Let me write the formula again. The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 day) ))^(1/3)

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the relation between K and the orbital period P.

Alternatively, I remember that the velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the orbital period P and the mass of the planet. But I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the RV method's measured velocity shift K is related to the star's velocity in its orbit around the barycenter. The star's velocity is lower when the planet is more massive, but in this case, both planets have the same mass, so that's the same for both.

Wait, another approach: since the two stars are identical and the planets have the same mass, the semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. Because from Kepler's third law, the orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis a and the masses.

Wait, Kepler's third law in the context of the radial velocity method. The formula for the period is P² = (4π² a³) / (G(M_* + M_p)). But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, it's approx P² = (4π² a³) / (G M_* )

But the RV semi-amplitude K is given by another formula. Let me find the correct relation between K and P.

The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ]^(1/3) / (c * sqrt(1 - e²)) ) * (2π / P )^(1/3)

Wait, perhaps it's easier to consider that K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) * (1 / (a (1 - e²)^(0.5)) ) )

But since e is zero (circular orbits), that term becomes 1. So K = (G * M_p) / (a * (M_* + M_p) * c ) )^(1/3) * (2π / P )^(1/3)

Wait, maybe it's getting too complicated. Let me think about the relationship between K and P for the same star and same planet mass.

Since both stars are identical and both planets have the same mass, the other variables (M_p, M_*, e, i) are the same for both. So the only variable is the orbital period P.

But how does K relate to P?

Wait, let me think. The RV semi-amplitude K is related to the star's velocity. The star's velocity is higher if the planet is closer (smaller a), because the star has to orbit the center of mass more quickly. A planet with a smaller orbital radius (a) would cause a larger K.

But from Kepler's third law, the orbital period P is related to a by P² ∝ a³ (since M_* is same for both stars). So a ∝ P^(2/3).

So, a is proportional to P^(2/3).

And since K is inversely proportional to a (because K is proportional to 1/a), substituting a in terms of P: K ∝ 1/(P^(2/3)).

So K is proportional to P^(-2/3).

Wait, but the question gives the shifts for the two planets, which correspond to K1 and K2.

So, K1 = 5 milliangstrom, K2=7 milliangstrom.

But wait, are the shifts directly the K values? Because the shift in the spectral line is proportional to the velocity, right? So the measured shift s is proportional to K. So s = K * (some factor), but the factor would be the same for both stars, so their ratio would just be K1/K2 = s1/s2.

Thus, K1/K2 = 5/7.

But from earlier, K ∝ P^(-2/3). So,

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(2/3)

Because:

K = C * P^(-2/3), where C is a constant (since M_p and M_* are same).

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(2/3)

We have K1/K2 = 5/7 → (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(2/3)

We are to find P2/P1.

Let me denote (P2/P1) as x.

So (5/7) = x^(2/3)

Take both sides to the power of 3/2:

(5/7)^(3/2) = x.

So x = (5/7)^(3/2)

Calculate that:

First, 5/7 ≈ 0.7143.

(0.7143)^(3/2) = ?

Compute sqrt(0.7143) ≈ 0.845.

Then cube that: (0.845)^3 ≈ 0.845 * 0.845 = ~0.714; then *0.845 → ~0.606.

Wait, but wait: (5/7)^(3/2) = [(5/7)^(1/2)]^3 = [sqrt(5)/sqrt(7)]^3 = (sqrt(5)^3) / (sqrt(7)^3) )= (5 * sqrt(5)) / (7 * sqrt(7)) )

Alternatively, compute using exponents.

Alternatively, take natural logs.

ln(x) = (3/2) * ln(5/7)

Compute ln(5)=1.6094, ln(7)=1.9459. So ln(5/7)= ln(5) - ln(7) = -0.3365.

So ln(x) = (3/2)(-0.3365) ≈ -0.5048.

So x ≈ e^(-0.5048) ≈ 0.604.

So P2/P1 ≈ 0.604. But wait, the options don't have 0.6, but option A is 0.36, D is 0.85, etc.

Wait, maybe I got the relationships reversed.

Wait, because K is proportional to 1/a, and a is proportional to P^(2/3). So:

K = C * (1/a) = C * (1/(P^(2/3))) → K ∝ P^(-2/3)

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(2/3) → (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(2/3)

Wait, that's correct.

So (P2/P1) = (5/7)^(3/2) ≈ 0.604.

Wait, but that's about 0.6, which isn't exactly an option. Let's look at the options again.

Options are:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

Hmm, none of these are around 0.6. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the periods. The question asks, "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?"

So P2 / P1 = x.

In the calculation, x ≈ 0.604. So P2 is about 0.6 times the period of P1, meaning planet #2's period is shorter.

So 0.6 is approximately 0.6, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the relation.

Wait, perhaps I should think again about the relation between K and P.

Wait, the formula for K is:

K = [ (27 * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * c ) ) ]^(1/3) * (G / (2π))^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Ah, another approach: from the formula, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), not P^(2/3). Did I get that wrong earlier?

Wait, let me get the correct formula for K.

The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 - e^2)^(1/2)) )^(1/3)

But wait, perhaps a more precise way is to use the formula:

K = ( (G * M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / P )^(1/3) ) * (2π / (c)) )^(1/3)

Wait, maybe I should check an alternative approach. Let's think about the mass function.

The mass function relates the planet's mass to the observed velocity semi-amplitude K. The formula is:

f(M) = (M_p^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^2 ) = (K^3 P^2) / (2π G)^3 )

But since M_* >> M_p, f(M) ≈ (M_p^3 sin^3 i) / (M_*^2 ) = (K^3 P^2) / (2π G)^3 )

But perhaps that's complicating things. Alternatively, let's think about the proportionality.

Assuming that both stars are the same (M_*, same), and both planets have the same mass (M_p same), and same inclination (sin i same, assuming i is same for both), and e=0.

So, from the formula for K, K is proportional to (M_p / (M_*^2/3)) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )

Wait, because the formula for K is:

K = [ (G * M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ] * ( (2π) / (P c) )^(1/3 )

Simplifying, since M_* >> M_p, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, and sin i ≈ 1, and (1-e²)^0.5≈1. So,

K ≈ (G M_p )^(1/3) * (2π / (P c ))^(1/3) / M_*^(1/3)

Which can be written as:

K ≈ ( (G M_p ) * (2π)/(c P) )^(1/3) ) / M_*^(1/3 )

Thus, K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)).

So, K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3))

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Because K1 ∝ 1/P1^(1/3), K2 ∝ 1/P2^(1/3)

So, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Given K1=5, K2=7 → K1/K2=5/7.

So,

5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Cubing both sides:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1

5^3=125, 7^3=343.

125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2/P1 ≈ 0.364.

Which is approximately 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but this contradicts my earlier approach. So what's the issue here?

Ah, I think I messed up the exponents earlier. Initially, I thought K ∝ P^(-2/3), but the correct proportionality is K ∝ P^(-1/3). Because in the formula, K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)).

So, the correct relation is K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So, (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Hence, P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So approximately 0.36 times. That's option A.


To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity method detects planets by measuring shifts in the star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of the planet. The semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), i.e., \( K \propto P^{-1/3} \).

Given that both stars have the same mass and both planets have the same mass, the relationship simplifies to:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstrom} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstrom} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

To solve for \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \), we raise both sides to the power of 3:

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}
\]

Calculating \( \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 \):

\[
\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \approx 0.36 \), meaning the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This corresponds to option A.

Answer: A
