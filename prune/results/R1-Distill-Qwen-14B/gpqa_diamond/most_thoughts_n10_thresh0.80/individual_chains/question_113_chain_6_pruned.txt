Okay, I have this chemistry problem about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try my best.

So the question gives me several pieces of data: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. My goal is to figure out the molecular formula among the four options provided.

First, let's break down each analysis technique.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The question says there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but waitâ€”carboxylic acids have a very broad peak due to the O-H stretch because they can form hydrogen bonds more easily. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol. Also, in the IR, strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm. Let me recall what these regions mean.

The 1700 region is usually a carbonyl group (C=O). For aldehydes, ketones, esters, carboxylic acids, etc., their C=O stretch is around there. The 1650 cm^-1 peak might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds. Wait, but another possibility is an amide, but I don't see any N in the options, so maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's conjugated carbonyl groups, like in a ketone with some conjugation or perhaps an aromatic ring adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, wait, but another thought: the 1650 peak could be an aromatic ring with C=C stretching, but the peak is in the carbonyl region. Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl? Because that would have a conjugated system, which could lower the frequency. Let me think: The carbonyl group in an alpha-beta unsaturated system (like an enone) would have a C=O stretch around 1680-1700 cm^-1, but sometimes the conjugation can lower it a bit. Not sure about that.

Wait, but the problem says two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650. That suggests two different types of carbonyl groups or something else. Alternatively, maybe one is a
