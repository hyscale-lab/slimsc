Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (not a pure state). 

Wait, what's a density matrix look like in terms of qubits? I think a qubit is a two-level system, so the density matrix for a qubit is a 2x2 matrix. For a pure state |ψ⟩, the density matrix is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. But this ρ is a mixed state because it's an average of two projectors.

Let me write down the given matrix. So, |0⟩ is the vector [1, 0]^T and |1⟩ is [0, 1]^T. So, |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then multiplying by 1/2 gives (1/2)I, where I is the 2x2 identity.

So ρ is (1/2) * [[1,0],[0,1]], which simplifies to [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. 

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I'm a bit confused about what this means. I think it refers to the Bloch sphere representation. Oh right, for a single qubit, the state can be represented on the Bloch sphere. But wait, that's for pure states. How does it work for mixed states?

Hmm, the Bloch sphere is for pure states. For mixed states, the density matrix doesn't correspond to a point on the sphere. Instead, I remember that the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. Let me think.

The general form of a single-qubit density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (the Bloch vector) with components (x, y, z). The length of r is constrained by |r| ≤ 1, because the trace is 1 for density matrices, and the eigenvalues must be between 0 and 1.

So, if ρ is (I + r·σ)/2, then our given ρ is (I)/2. Let's compare:

Given ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) = (I)/2.

Which matches the expression (I + r·σ)/2 only if r·σ = 0. So each component of r must be zero. So r = (0, 0, 0). 

Wait, but what does that mean? Because in the Bloch sphere, the completely mixed state (like this one) is at the center of the sphere, which corresponds to r=(0,0,0). Because any state in the Bloch sphere is a vector pointing from the origin to a point on the sphere (radius 1), but for a completely mixed state, the Bloch vector is zero. 

So looking back at the options, option C is (0,0,0). That's the answer. 

Wait, but why? Let me double-check. The density matrix here is I/2. The diagonal entries are 0.5 each, and the off-diagonal are zero. So in terms of Bloch vector parameters, the x, y, z components come from the terms in the density matrix. 

The general form is:

ρ = (1/2) [ [1 + z, x - iy],
             [x + iy, 1 - z] ]

Comparing this with our ρ, which is:

[[0.5, 0],
 [0, 0.5]]

So, 1 + z = 1 - z = 1 (since 0.5*2 is 1). Wait, no. Wait, the given ρ has (1/2) * I, so each diagonal entry is 0.5. So 1 + z = 1 (since 1 + z = 0.5 * 2? Wait no, wait the general form is:

Wait, no. The general form is (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ) /2.

Each Pauli matrix σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So the expression when expanded becomes:

( I + r_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + r_y [[0,-i],[i,0]] + r_z [[1,0],[0,-1]] ) / 2.

So when you expand that:

The (1,1) element is (1 + r_z)/2.

The (2,2) element is (1 - r_z)/2.

The (1,2) element is (r_x - i r_y)/2.

Similarly, (2,1) is (r_x + i r_y)/2.

Comparing with our ρ:

(1,1) is 0.5 → (1 + r_z)/2 = 0.5 → 1 + r_z =1 → r_z=0.

(2,2) is 0.5 → (1 - r_z)/2 =0.5 → same result, r_z=0.

The (1,2) element is 0 → (r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0 → r_x =0, r_y=0.

So all components of r are zero, so r=(0,0,0). So the correct option is C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
= \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the \(2 \times 2\) identity matrix. This represents a completely mixed state for a single qubit.

For a single qubit, the density matrix can generally be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector. The components of \(\mathbf{r}\) are related to the elements of \(\rho\) as follows:

- \(r_z = \rho_{11} - \rho_{22}\),
- \(r_x = \rho_{12} + \rho_{21}\),
- \(r_y = -i(\rho_{12} - \rho_{21})\).

For the given \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\), the diagonal elements are \(\rho_{11} = \rho_{22} = 0.5\), and the off-diagonal elements are \(\rho_{12} = \rho_{21} = 0\). Substituting these into the expressions for \(r_x\), \(r_y\), and \(r_z\), we find:

- \(r_z = \rho_{11} - \rho_{22} = 0.5 - 0.5 = 0\),
- \(r_x = \rho_{12} + \rho_{21} = 0 + 0 = 0\),
- \(r_y = -i(\rho_{12} - \rho_{21}) = -i(0 - 0) = 0\).

Thus, the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), meaning the density matrix corresponds to the completely mixed state at the center of the Bloch sphere.

From the given options:

- **A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state on the Bloch sphere.
- **B) \(r = (0, 0, 1):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to the pure state \(|0\rangle\).
- **C) \(r = (0, 0, 0):** Correct, as this corresponds to the completely mixed state.
- **D) \(r = (1, 1, 1):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to a valid quantum state.

Answer: C
