Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again and try to figure it out step by step. 

The problem says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (the x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, where i is the square root of -1. When they measured the particles, none were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. 

Hmm, I remember that wave functions must satisfy certain conditions, like being normalizable. Oh wait, right! The total probability of finding the particle somewhere must equal 1. So the integral of the square of the absolute value of the wave function over all space should be 1. 

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. So it's a complex function. The absolute square would be the square of the real part plus the square of the imaginary part. 

So the wave function ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That's like ψ(x) = A(x) + B(x)i, where A is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and B is -0.5. 

The absolute value squared is |ψ|² = [A(x)]² + [B(x)]². But wait, in this case, B is a constant, right? Because B is -0.5, which doesn't depend on x. So [B]^2 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. 

So, the probability density is [a² / (1+x)] + 0.25. 

Wait, but the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3. So the probability integral must be taken from x=1 to x=3. 

The total probability is the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx. That integral must equal 1. 

So let's write that mathematically: ∫ from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Wait, but wait a second. Oh wait, no, because the wave function is ψ = real part + imaginary part. So the absolute square is (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2. 

Wait, let me double-check. The absolute value squared of a complex number a + ib is a² + b². But in this case, the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when we square them, it's [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. Because (-0.5i) squared is (0.25)(i²) which is -0.25, but wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the absolute square is (Re)^2 + (Im)^2, regardless of the sign. Because when you take the square, the i's cancel. 

So, the probability density is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. 

So, the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

We can split this integral into two parts:

Integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3, plus integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3, equals 1.

Let me compute each part.

First part: a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3.

Integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). Evaluated from 1 to 3, which is ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the first part is a² * ln(2).

Second part: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 *2 = 0.5.

So putting it together:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's ln(2) approximately? I think it's about 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.720.

Wait, 0.5 divided by 0.6931. Let's calculate that. 0.5 /0.6931 is approximately 0.720.

So a is the square root of 0.720. What's sqrt(0.72)? Let me think. 0.8^2 = 0.64, 0.85^2=0.7225. Oh, wait, 0.85 squared is 0.7225, which is just a bit higher than 0.72. So a is approximately 0.85.

Wait, but let me do the exact calculation. Let me compute 0.5 / ln(2):

ln(2) is approximately 0.69314718056.

So 0.5 / 0.69314718056 ≈ 0.5 / 0.693147 ≈ 0.72097.

So a² is 0.72097, so a is sqrt(0.72097) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options:
