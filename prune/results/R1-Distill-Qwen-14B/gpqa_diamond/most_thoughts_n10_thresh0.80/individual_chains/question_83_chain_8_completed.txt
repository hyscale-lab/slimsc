Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember all the titration concepts perfectly. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with sodium hydroxide. Let's see what the problem says. We have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, so I have to compute both values.

First, I think I need to figure out the concentration of the acetic acid solution after dilution. Oh right, dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. So initial volume is 20 cm³, concentration 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³ water, the total volume is 40 cm³.

So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40. Let me calculate that. 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The reaction is between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (a strong base) to form acetate (CH3COO^-) and water. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will be equal to the moles of acetic acid. So let's find out how much NaOH is needed for equivalence.

Moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution: Molarity × Volume = 0.025 M × 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L). 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles. So moles of NaOH needed is also 0.001.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume V = moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is reached when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Now, the question asks about the pH at 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence volume would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So I need to calculate the pH when 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

At this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. Let me calculate the moles of each.

Moles of NaOH added = 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since the reaction is 1:1, this converts 0.00025 moles of CH3COOH to CH3COO^-.

So initial moles of CH3COOH were 0.001. Now, moles of CH3COOH left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 moles.

Now, the total volume of the solution is the initial volume (40 cm³) plus the NaOH added (2.5 cm³) → 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ ?

Let me compute that: 0.00075 ÷ 0.0425 → let's see, 0.00075 is 7.5e-4. 7.5e-4 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Since this is a buffer solution (mix of weak acid and its conjugate base), I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

Wait, what's pKa? Given Ka is 1.85e-5. pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So plug into Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647).

Wait, 0.005882 is the concentration of acetate (A^-) and 0.017647 is acetic acid (HA).

So the ratio is approximately 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333. Log(1/3) is about -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. Rounding to about 4.26. That's one of the options. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm. Wait, but maybe I should be more precise with the calculations.

Wait, let me recalculate the ratio. 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M. 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M. So ratio is 0.005882 /0.017647 = 0.333333... exactly 1/3.

So log(1/3) is exactly -0.4771. So pH is 4.733 - 0.4771 = 4.2559, which rounds to 4.26. So the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.

Now, what about the equivalence point? At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution will consist of sodium acetate in water, which is a basic solution because acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid (acetic acid).

At equivalence, the concentration of acetate ions will determine the pH. Let's find the concentration.

Moles of acetate: 0.001 moles. The total volume is initial solution (40 cm³) plus the NaOH added (10 cm³) → 50 cm³ or 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate can be found using Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The Kb is small, so the hydrolysis will produce a small amount of OH^- ions. Let's set up the expression.

Let me denote the concentration of OH^- as x. The initial concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. At equilibrium, [CH3COO^-] is approximately 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. [OH^-] = x, [CH3COOH] = x.

So Kb = x² / (0.02) ≈ 5.405e-10 → x² = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] is ~1.04e-5 M. pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH is 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

Wait, but none of the options have pH 9.02 at equivalence. Hmm, that's confusing. Let me check my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation of the Kb or the acetate concentration.

Wait, let me double-check Kb. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10. That's correct.

At equivalence, the concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Right.

So Kb = 5.405e-10. Setting up the equation:

x^2 / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x^2 = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) → sqrt(1.081) is about 1.04, so x ≈ 1.04e-5. That's correct.

pOH is log(1.04e-5) → log(1.04) is ~0.017, so log(1.04e-5) is -4.983. So pOH is 4.983, pH is 14 - 4.983 = 9.017. So about 9.02.

But looking at the options, none have 9.02 for equivalence. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17; 6.73

C)4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

Hmm. So none have a pH near 9.02. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculations. Let me try using a more accurate approach for the equivalence point.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the solution is 0.02 M sodium acetate. Let me compute the pH more accurately.

The acetate ion (A^-) will react with water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb is Kw/Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The initial concentration of A^- is 0.02 M. Let x be the concentration of OH^- produced.

So Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) → 5.405e-10 = x² / (0.02 - x)

Since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So x² ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5 → pOH is 4.98, so pH is 9.02.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the volume at equivalence isn't 50 cm³? Let me recheck.

Initial solution after dilution: 40 cm³. Equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added. So total volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³, which is 0.05 L. So [CH3COO^-] is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M. That's correct.

Wait, maybe I should compute the pH using the exact expression without approximation.

x² = Kb * (0.02) → x = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 → same as before.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the solution. Wait, sodium acetate is a salt of a strong base and weak acid, so the solution should be basic, so pH >7. But all the options for equivalence pH are around 6.7 to 9.

Wait, looking at option A: equivalence pH 8.52. That's lower than my calculation. Hmm. Maybe I messed up the Kb?

Wait, let me recompute Kb.

Ka =1.85e-5 → Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) → 1e-14 is 1e-14 → 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5 is 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the solution at equivalence isn't just the acetate? No, because all the acetic acid has been neutralized. So acetate is in solution.

Wait, maybe I should compute the pH without approximation. Let me do that.

The expression is x²/(0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small, 0.02 >>x, so it's okay. So the initial approach is correct. So pH is ~9.02.

But the options don't have that. Hmm. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial diluted acetic acid concentration?

Wait, the initial solution was 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. After adding 20 cm³ of water, total volume 40 cm³. So the concentration is (0.05 M * 0.02 L ) / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Correct.

Moles of acetic acid: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Correct.

So at equivalence, 0.001 mol of NaOH needed. Volume needed is 10 cm³. So yes, all correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that when we dilute, the solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which is 1 mmol. Then adding 20 cm³ of water makes it 0.025 M in 40 cm³. Then titrated with 0.1 M NaOH.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the initial dilution is correct, but the equivalence point pH is not what I thought.

Wait, let's try another approach for equivalence point. The solution is 0.02 M CH3COO^-.

The pH can be calculated using the formula:

pH = ½ (pKa + pKw - pKb)

Wait, no, perhaps pH = (pKa + pKw - pKa') / 2. Not sure.

Wait, another formula: For a salt of weak acid and strong base, the pH can be calculated using:

pH = pKa' + log([A^-]/[HA])

Wait, no, at equivalence, [HA] is zero. Wait, perhaps I should consider the hydrolysis again.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for a solution of a weak base. The formula is:

[OH^-] = sqrt( Kb * C )

Where C is concentration.

So [OH^-] = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5, as before.

So pOH is 4.98 → pH 9.02. So why none of the options match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the volume. Let me think again.

Wait, equivalence is when 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added. So moles of NaOH: 0.1 * 0.01 = 0.001 mol. Which neutralizes 0.001 mol of acetic acid. So moles of acetate is 0.001, and the total volume is 50 cm³.

So [acetate] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. So correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution is not 0.02 M, but I'm mixing up the solution volumes. Let me recheck.

Wait, original solution: 20 cm³ 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles: 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. After adding 20 cm³ water, the volume is 40 cm³, so 0.025 M. Correct.

Then, adding 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH: 0.1 * 0.01 = 0.001 mol. So all the acetic acid is neutralized, and acetate is 0.001 mol. Total volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³. So [acetate] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

So my calculation seems correct, but the options don't have pH 9.02. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb. Let me recompute Kb.

Ka =1.85e-5 → Kb for acetate = 1e-14 /1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH using the exact quadratic equation.

x²/(0.02 - x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, so x² =5.405e-10 *0.02 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11) =1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] =1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98→ pH=9.02.

Hmm. But looking at the options, the closest is option A, which says 4.26 and 8.52. So equivalence pH is 8.52, which is lower than my calculation.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point. Let me think—maybe when the solution is at equivalence, some other factor comes into play, like activity coefficients or something else. But for this problem, probably not. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the dilution isn't just adding 20 cm³ of water. Wait, the problem says we dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40 cm³. So the diluted concentration is 0.025 M. So that's correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think about the possible answers. The 25% titration pH is about 4.26, which matches option A, which also has 8.52 for equivalence. But my calculation says 9.02.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point. Let me think: perhaps the acetate is not the only component. Wait, sodium acetate dissociates completely into Na+ and CH3COO^-.

Wait, perhaps the solution is affected by the sodium ions, but sodium is a spectator ion and doesn't affect pH. So that's not the issue.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb. Let me recalculate it.

Ka =1.85e-5 → Kb =1e-14 /1.85e-5 = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 = approx 0.5405 *1e-9 =5.405e-10. Correct.

Hmm. So the problem must be elsewhere.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about the pH at 25% of the equivalence volume. No, the question says 25% titration, which is 25% of the equivalence volume.

Wait, another thought: Maybe during the titration, the solution isn't just a buffer, but maybe some other factor comes into play.

Wait, when I did the 25% titration, I considered 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. Let me recheck that calculation.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M, volume 2.5 cm³ → 0.0025 L → moles NaOH =0.1 * 0.0025 =0.00025 mol. Correct.

Moles of CH3COOH initially 0.001 mol. So after reaction, moles CH3COOH: 0.001 - 0.00025 =0.00075. Moles acetate:0.00025. Correct.

So [CH3COOH] is 0.00075 / 0.0425 L = 0.017647 M.

[acetate] is 0.00025 /0.0425 =0.005882 M.

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 0.005882 /0.017647 ≈ 0.333, so pH = pKa + log(0.333) =4.733 - 0.477=4.256. So about 4.26. So the first part of the answer is 4.26, which is in option A and D.

Wait, option D's first value is 4.57. So how?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the dilution steps. Let me think.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the initial dilution is not 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid but 20 cm³ of acetic acid, which is 0.05 M. So the initial moles are 0.05 M * 0.02 L =0.001 mol. Diluted to 0.04 L gives 0.025 M. Correct.

Hmm. So the 25% point calculation is correct, giving pH 4.26. But equivalence pH is not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the equivalence point but the midpoint, but no, the question is explicit about equivalence.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the equivalence point.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution is not 0.02 M acetate, but I should consider the sodium hydroxide's effect on the solution's volume.

Wait, another way: perhaps the volume of the solution at equivalence isn't 50 cm³. Let me recheck.

Original solution volume:20 +20 =40 cm³. Added 10 cm³ of NaOH. So total 50 cm³. Correct.

Hmm. Let me think if I made a mistake in the Kb. Wait, Kb is 5.405e-10.

So, the concentration is 0.02 M, Kb is 5.405e-10. So x²=0.02 *5.405e-10 → 1.081e-11. x=1.04e-5.

pOH=4.98, pH=9.02.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option D says equivalence pH is 6.92. That's in the acidic range, which can't be. Option A says 8.52, which is lower than my calculated 9.02.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether the solution has any other components. Oh, wait, sodium ions are present, but they don't affect pH. So that's not the issue.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I'm supposed to use the half-equivalence point for the first part, but no, the question says 25% titration.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that the solution is a buffer is incorrect. But at 25% titration, it's definitely a buffer.

Hmm. Maybe I'll proceed to check the options. Let's see:

Option A: 4.26;8.52. So 25% is 4.26, which matches my calculation. But equivalence is 8.52, which is lower than my 9.02.

Option D: 4.57; 6.92. pH at 25% is higher than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Let me recheck.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should have used the exact concentrations without assuming the buffer. No, because at 25% titration, it's still a buffer.

Wait, perhaps I should use exact values without approximating the ratio. Let me think.

The ratio is [A^-]/[HA] = (0.00025) / (0.00075) = 1/3. So log(1/3)=-0.4771. So pH=4.733 -0.4771=4.256. So 4.26.

Hmm. Option A has 4.26 for the first pH. So if the equivalence point is 8.52, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me think again about the equivalence point. Could the pH be 8.52?

If pH is 8.52, then pOH is 5.48. So [OH^-] is 2.63e-6 M.

Then, Kb = [OH^-]^2 / C → (2.63e-6)^2 / 0.02 → (6.9169e-12) / 0.02 → 3.458e-10.

But Kb should be 5.405e-10. So 3.458e-10 is less than our calculated Kb. So that would suggest that [OH^-] is lower than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations of Kb. Let me compute again.

Ka =1.85e-5 → Kb =1e-14/(1.85e-5)= (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) → let me compute 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5.

1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 /1.85) * 1e-9 → 1/1.85 ≈ 0.5405. So 0.5405e-9 =5.405e-10. Correct.

So, if the pH at equivalence is 8.52, then pOH is 5.48 → [OH^-]= 2.63e-6 M. Then Kb would be (2.63e-6)^2 /0.02 → (6.916e-12)/0.02=3.458e-10. Which is lower than correct Kb of 5.405e-10. So this suggests that the solution would have a higher pH than 8.52 to get a higher [OH^-].

So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But that can't be, since the options are provided.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says "25% titration" — does that mean 25% of the initial volume, or 25% of the equivalence point volume? No, it's 25% of the equivalence point.

In my calculation, 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³, which is correct.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the initial solution after dilution was 40 cm³, but when the NaOH is added, the volume increases. But I think my calculation included the added NaOH volume, so that shouldn't be the issue.

Another possibility: perhaps I made a mistake in considering the moles of NaOH added at 25% titration. Let me recheck.

25% of equivalence volume is 2.5 cm³. Moles of NaOH = 0.1 M * 0.0025 L =0.00025 mol. Correct.

So, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the wrong pKa. Wait, the problem says Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa is 4.733, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Maybe I should use exact values.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log (n_A /n_HA) → because the volumes are same, the ratio is same as moles ratio.

So log(0.00025 / 0.00075) = log(1/3) =-0.4771. So yes, pH=4.733 - 0.4771=4.256.

So that's correct.

So the first part is 4.26, which matches option A and D.

But equivalence point in option A is 8.52, which I can't get. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the solution isn't 0.02 M acetate. Let me think again: 0.001 mol in 0.05 L is 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, maybe I should compute the pH using the exact formula without approximation. So:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

Initial concentrations: [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M, [CH3COOH]=0, [OH^-]=0.

Change: -x, +x, +x.

Equilibrium: (0.02 -x), x, x.

So Kb = x^2 / (0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, we can approximate 0.02 -x ≈0.02 → x^2= 5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11 →x=1.04e-5.

So [OH^-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

But none of the options have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not provided, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles. Let me think again.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid is 20 cm³ ×0.05 M=1 mmol.

After diluting with 20 cm³, it's 1 mmol in 40 cm³, 0.025 M.

Then, at equivalence, 1 mmol of NaOH is added, which neutralizes all 1 mmol of acetic acid, producing 1 mmol of acetate.

Volume is 40 +10=50 cm³ → 0.05 L.

So [acetate]=1 mmol /50 cm³=0.02 M. Correct.

Hmm. So I think my calculations are correct, but the options don't match. Maybe I should re-examine the options.

Looking at option D: 4.57 and 6.92. How?

Wait, perhaps the pH at equivalence is not 9.02 but 6.92, which is acidic. That can't be right because acetate is a base.

Wait, no, acetate is a weak base, so the solution should be basic, pH>7. So option D's equivalence pH is 6.92, which is acidic; that can't be correct.

Option A's equivalence pH is 8.52, which is basic but lower than my calculation. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about weak base titration, but no, it's acetic acid.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the initial solution was not 0.025 M. Let me think.

Wait, 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is 1 mmol. Diluted with 20 cm³, so 0.04 L. So 1 mmol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the possible answers.

Option D: 4.57 and 6.92. How could pH at equivalence be 6.92?

Another thought: perhaps the solution at equivalence involves a strong acid and weak base, but no, we have a weak acid and strong base.

Wait, perhaps the solution isn't sodium acetate but something else. No, because NaOH is a strong base, so it reacts completely with acetic acid, producing acetate.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the solution is a buffer at equivalence, but no, because all the acetic acid is neutralized. So the solution is acetate in water.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact formula without approximating.

x² = Kb * (0.02) → x²=5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5.

So pH=9.02. But that's not in options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is with the initial dilution. Let me recheck.

20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid → 20 *0.05 =1 mmol.

Diluted to 40 cm³ → 0.025 M.

So that is correct.

Hmm. I'm not sure why the equivalence pH isn't matching. Perhaps the options are incorrect, but since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps I have to reconsider.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles of NaOH. Let me think again.

Wait, volume of NaOH at equivalence is 10 cm³. 0.1 M *0.01 L =0.001 mol. Correct.

So, I think the initial calculation is correct, but none of the options match. But the options are given, so perhaps I made a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch calculation for the 25% point.

Wait, let me recheck the 25% titration part.

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added.

Moles NaOH:0.1 *0.0025=0.00025 mol.

Moles of CH3COOH:0.001 -0.00025=0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^-:0.00025 mol.

Total volume:40 +2.5=42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

[CH3COOH] =0.00075 /0.0425=0.017647 M.

[acetate]=0.00025 /0.0425=0.005882 M.

Ratio =0.005882 /0.017647 =0.3333.

So pH=4.733 + log(0.3333)=4.733-0.4771=4.256.

Rounded to two decimal places, 4.26. So this part is correct.

So the only possible conclusion is that the equivalence pH is 9.02, but it's not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the initial solution was 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and then we add 20 cm³ of NaOH. No, the question says we add 20 cm³ of water, not NaOH.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the pH at 25% of the initial volume, but that's not what it says. No, the question says 25% titration, which refers to the titration volume.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on my calculations, the only matching option is A (4.26, 8.52), but I can't get the equivalence point to match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation, and the correct answer is D.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH at equivalence point using another approach.

Wait, another way: The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. The Kb is 5.405e-10.

Using the formula pH = ½ (pKa + pKw + pKb) ?

No, wait, that's not a standard formula. Wait, perhaps when the solution is a weak base, the pH can be found using:

pOH = ½ (pKb - log C )

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for weak bases:

pH = pKa' + sqrt( (Ka' * Kw) / C )

Wait, perhaps that's a way to compute it.

Wait, the hydrolysis reaction:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

Ka for this reaction is Kw / Ka_acetic =1e-14 /1.85e-5 =5.405e-10.

So, using the formula for a weak base:

pH = pKa' + sqrt( (Ka' * C) )

Wait, no, perhaps:

The expression for [OH^-] is sqrt( K_b * C ), so:

[OH^-] = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) =1.04e-5 → same as before.

So pH is 9.02.

Hmm. I think the only possible conclusion is that none of the options match, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps when we dilute acetic acid with water, we have to consider activity coefficients or that the solution isn't ideal, but that's beyond the scope of this problem.

I'm stuck. Based on my calculations, the first part is 4.26, which only appears in options A and D. The equivalence point in option A is 8.52, which is lower than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb.

Wait, let me calculate Kb again: Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) =5.405e-10.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D, with pH at 25% titration as 4.57 and equivalence as 6.92.

But how? Let me think: if the pH at equivalence is 6.92, which is acidic, that would imply that the solution is of a weak acid, not its conjugate base. Which can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about a strong acid. But no, it's acetic acid, a weak acid.

Hmm. I'm not sure where I went wrong. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess.

The correct pH at 25% titration is 4.26, which is option A and D. The equivalence point in option A is 8.52, which is lower than my calculation, but perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution. Let me think again.

Wait, 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid has 1 mmol. Adding 20 cm³ of water makes 40 cm³, so 0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is that when you add NaOH, the volume isn't simply additive. But that's a negligible effect, and for the sake of this problem, we assume volumes are additive.

Given the time I've spent, I think the correct answer is option D. Wait, but why? Because I'm getting stuck, perhaps the correct answer is option D: 4.57 and 6.92.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I should have used the initial concentration before dilution for the equivalence point.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the equivalence point based on the initial concentration.

Wait, initial acetic acid concentration: 0.05 M, 20 cm³ → 0.001 mol.

Equivalence requires 0.001 mol of NaOH.

Volume of NaOH:0.001 /0.1 =0.01 L=10 cm³. Correct.

But the solution volume is 40+10=50 cm³.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH at equivalence is calculated using the concentration of sodium hydroxide. No, that can't be because NaOH is a strong base and is neutralized.

I think I'm stuck, but based on the 25% pH, only options A and D are possible. Since option A's equivalence pH is 8.52, which is close to my calculation of 9.02, maybe I made a mistake in the Kb calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using exact Kb.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution's pH is determined using the formula for a weak base:

pH = (pKa' + pC + 0.5 log Kw ) / 2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, accepting that the equivalence pH is 8.52, perhaps due to a miscalculation on my part.

Given that, I'll proceed to conclude.


To solve the problem, we first determine the concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution. Initially, 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20 cm³ of water, resulting in a total volume of 40 cm³. Using the dilution formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \), the concentration of the diluted solution is:

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1 \cdot V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 20}{40} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

The moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.025 \cdot 0.04 = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### At 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \cdot 0.0025 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Since the reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is 1:1, 0.00025 mol of acetic acid is neutralized, leaving:

\[
\text{Remaining moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \), the ratio \( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} = \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \approx 0.333 \). Substituting:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \, \text{(rounded to 4.26)}.
\]

### At Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized, forming 0.001 mol of acetate ion. The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \( K_b \) for acetate is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the expression for \( K_b \):

\[
K_b = \frac{[OH^-]^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} \implies [OH^-]^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-],
\]

\[
[OH^-]^2 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11},
\]
\[
[OH^-] = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98,
\]

and the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: pH at 25% titration is 4.26 (matches calculation), and pH at equivalence is 8.52 (does not match calculation).
- **Option B**: pH at 25% titration is 3.17 (too low), and pH at equivalence is 6.73 (too low).
- **Option C**: pH at 25% titration is 4.73 (too high), and pH at equivalence is 7.00 (too low).
- **Option D**: pH at 25% titration is 4.57 (too high), and pH at equivalence is 6.92 (too low).

The calculated pH at 25% titration matches **Option A** (4.26), but the equivalence point pH does not match any option. Given the provided options, **Option A** is the most consistent with the calculations.
