Okay, so I need to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through each part.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let's go through each step.

First reaction: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. The product is a light yellow solid, product 1. The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, and the 1H NMR has specific signals. 

Hmm, 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe an epoxide isn't right because epoxides don't have carbonyls. Wait, if we have two bromines on adamantane, and KOH is used, perhaps it's an elimination reaction. Oh wait, KOH could lead to an E2 mechanism, removing HBr and forming a double bond. But wait, if there are two Br atoms, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so the two Brs are on adjacent carbons? Wait, no, 1 and 3 could be positions on a cyclohexane-like structure, but adamantane is a diamondoid structure. When KOH is used in such a structure, maybe it's a Dieckmann-type elimination if it's an ester, but wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double elimination. Wait, but more likely, when two vicinal bromides are heated with a strong base like KOH, they undergo dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. So the product might be 1,3-adamantadiene? Or wait, perhaps 1,2-elimination? Wait, no, the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, so if the Brs are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond. Wait, but in adamantane, each carbon is connected to three others, so maybe the structure is such that each Br is on a bridgehead carbon. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH might lead to the formation of an epoxide. But wait, no, epoxide formation usually involves two adjacent bromides, but in this case, the positions are 1 and 3 on the adamantane. Alternatively, since KOH is a strong base, perhaps it's an elimination to form an alkene. But wait, the product has a carbonyl group since the IR is at 1720. So perhaps it's not an alkene. Maybe it's an ester or ketone. Wait, another possibility: If KOH is used with a dihalide, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution, but that would form a diol if both OH groups are added. But the IR doesn't show O-H stretches, and the NMR has 4.79 ppm (2H), which could be an -OH group, but wait, in D2O it would exchange. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide. Wait, epoxide formation: if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps the base causes elimination to form an epoxide? No, wait, forming an epoxide usually involves a cyclic ether, which would require elimination of two HBr molecules. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the product is a ketone. How? Well, if KOH abstracts a β hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr, forming a carbonyl. Wait, but that would require a β hydrogen adjacent to each Br. But the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and when KOH abstracts a hydrogen from a neighboring carbon, elimination occurs, leading to a carbonyl group. Oh wait, no, elimination usually forms a double bond, not a carbonyl. Wait, perhaps it's a double elimination, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me think: The IR shows a strong peak at 1720, which is typical for a ketone (C=O stretch). So maybe the product is a ketone. Then, perhaps the starting dihalide, when treated with a strong base, undergoes elimination twice to form a ketone. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation followed by another elimination, but that seems less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane being treated with KOH could form a ketone if each Br is on a CH2 group. Wait, but that might not align. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe it's better to focus on the NMR data. The 1H NMR of product 1 has peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.
