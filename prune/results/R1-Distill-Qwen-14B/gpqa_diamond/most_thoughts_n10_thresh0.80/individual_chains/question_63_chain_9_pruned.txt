Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a diatomic molecule made of atoms X and Y. They're using the quantum rotation-vibration model or the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed. The question is asking what momentum the photon should have so that the molecule transitions to the next lowest energy state.

The given data includes the masses of X and Y (20 amu and 2 amu respectively), the bond length R (2 angstroms), and the angular frequency w (4e14 rad/s). The options are four different momenta values.

Hmm, okay. So I think the fundamental state would be the lowest energy state, which is when both the vibrational and rotational energies are at their lowest (n=0 for vibration and J=0 for rotation, maybe? Or wait, no—J starts at 0, that's the ground state for rotation. But wait, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which in molecular spectroscopy often refers to the lowest vibrational state, n=0. But when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next state. I need to clarify whether this transition is due to vibration or rotation.

Wait, the problem mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model, which combines both rotational and vibrational energy levels. So the molecule's energy is a combination of both. But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps it's the next possible energy level, which could be either a vibrational or rotational transition.

Wait, the next state with the lowest possible energy—so the smallest possible increase in energy. That would probably be the first excited state, which could be either a change in vibrational or rotational quantum numbers.

But the fundamental state for vibration is n=0. The next vibrational state would be n=1. For rotation, the ground state is J=0; the next is J=1. Now, which transition requires less energy? Because the photon's momentum is related to its energy (since p = E/c), the photon with lower energy would correspond to a lower momentum.

So I need to compare the energy differences between the ground state and the next state for both vibration and rotation.

Let me compute the vibrational energy difference first. The energy levels for vibration are given by E_vib = (n + 1
