Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with electrostatics, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the setup: there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and since r is less than R, the cavity is entirely inside the conductor. Now, some positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. 

The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, which makes sense because P is outside. The angle between l and s is theta.

So, the options are four different expressions for E. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, I remember something about conductors and charges. Since the conductor is initially uncharged, but there's a charge inside the cavity, how does that affect the conductor itself? Oh right, when a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, the conductor was initially neutral. So, the charge inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, wait. The conductor is neutral, so the total charge on it is zero. But when the +q charge is placed inside the cavity, it induces a -q charge on the inner surface of the conductor. Because conductors conduct, the charges move to the surfaces. So, the inner surface of the conductor (the part facing the cavity) will have a charge of -q. Then, since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge of +q. Because the total conductor is neutral: inner surface has -q, outer surface has +q, so overall zero.

Okay, now the point P is outside the conductor, so the electric field at P would be due to the charges on the outer surface of the conductor. Because the inner charges (like the -q on the inner surface) are inside the conductor, their fields don't contribute outside. So, the electric field outside the conductor is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So, the conductor behaves as if it has a point charge +q at its center.

Wait, but wait. The point P is outside the conductor, so when considering the conductor's own charges, the electric field would be as if the charge +q is at the center. So, the conductor's outer surface has +q, so the field outside is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²), because L is the distance from the center.

But wait, what about the charge inside the cavity? The point P is outside the conductor, so the charge inside the cavity (the +q) would be enclosed by the conductor. Hmm, no, because the conductor is a conductor. The induced charges are such that the fields inside the conductor are zero. So, the field inside the conductor is zero, but the fields outside are due to the outer charges.

Wait, but the conductor is uncharged, but the cavity has +q. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q, right? So the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So, any external point would feel the field as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor.

So, at point P, which is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, the electric field should be (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²). But wait, wait. Let me think again. Because the field due to a spherical charge distribution is the same as if the charge were a point charge at the center.

So, the conductor's outer surface has +q, so the field outside is E = kq/(L²), where k is 1/(4πε₀).

Looking at the options, option B is (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²), which matches this. But wait, I'm seeing other options too. So why are the other options considering l, s, and theta? Because point P is at a certain position relative to the cavity's center.

Wait, but I thought that the conductor's outer surface acts as a point charge at the center. So regardless of where P is outside, the field depends only on L, the distance from the center of the conductor. Because the conductor's charges are on the surface, and the field outside is as if the charge were a point at the center.

But wait, sometimes when there's an off-center charge, like if the +q inside the cavity isn't at the center, things can get more complicated. Because then the induced charges on the inner surface might not be symmetric. Oh right! Because in this problem, the +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity, and the center of the cavity is at a distance s from the conductor's center. So, the charge isn't at the center of the conductor.

Hmm, that complicates things. Because in the usual case when the charge is at the center, the conductor's outer surface has a uniform charge distribution, and the field outside is radial and depends only on L. But if the charge is off-center, the conductor's inner surface would have a non-uniform charge distribution, but perhaps the outer surface would still be symmetric?

Wait, maybe not. Because the conductor is neutral, the inner surface must have an induced charge of -q, but if the charge is off-center, the inner surface's charge distribution would be asymmetric, perhaps. But the outer surface would then have a symmetric +q, because the conductor is neutral. Or wait, maybe not. Because the field inside the conductor must be zero. Let me think.

The conductor's interior (the material) has no net electric field. So, any induced charges must arrange themselves such that the sum of the fields from all charges inside the conductor cancels out.

So, if the charge in the cavity is +q off-center, the inner surface of the conductor would have an induced charge distribution that's asymmetric. But the conductor's outer surface would have a symmetric charge distribution, because any asymmetry would cause electric fields inside the conductor, which isn't allowed.

Wait, no. The conductor's outer surface needs to have a charge distribution such that the field inside the conductor (the material) is zero, but how does that affect the outer surface?

Alternatively, the outer surface's charge distribution depends on the inner surface's charge. Because the conductor's material is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q, but its distribution would depend on the inner surface.

Wait, but wait. The cavity is inside the conductor. The inner surface has a charge of -q. The conductor is neutral, so the outer surface must have +q. So whether the charge is off-center or not, the outer surface charge is +q. But because the inner surface is asymmetric, would the outer surface charge be symmetric or not?

Ah, I think the outer surface charge remains symmetric. Because the inner surface's induced charge is due to the +q in the cavity. As long as the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q, but its distribution is uniform because the field inside the conductor must be zero. So, the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed. Therefore, the electric field outside the conductor is as if all the charge is at the center. So, the electric field at point P would depend only on the distance L from the center of the conductor.

Wait, but wait a second. The conductor's outer surface charge is uniform because it's a conductor. So regardless of the inner charge's position, the outer surface would have a uniform charge. Therefore, the field outside would be the same as if you had a point charge at the center. So, the field at P would be E = (1/(4πε_o)) * q / L².

Looking at the options, that's option B.

Wait, but what about the position of the point P relative to the cavity's center? The problem gives l, the distance from P to the cavity's center, and an angle theta. So perhaps the charge inside the cavity creates an electric field that might affect point P, but since P is outside the conductor, the conductor's outer surface's field would dominate. Hmm, but I thought the conductor's outer surface's field is the same as a point charge. So, the presence of the cavity's charge would only affect the inner surface of the conductor, not the outer.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm missing something. The charge +q is inside the cavity, which is inside the conductor. So, the field due to +q alone at point P would be as if it's a point charge, but since P is outside the conductor, the conductor's charges would shield the external field from the +q. Wait, but the conductor is neutral. So, the conductor's own charges (the outer surface's +q) are what contribute to the external field. The internal charge +q is shielded, so its field doesn't reach outside.

So, the electric field at P is due to the conductor's outer charges, which is +q at the center. So, E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²), which is option B.

Wait, but why are there options involving l, s, and theta? Maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the cavity's charge creates an image charge situation. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the electric field inside the conductor is zero, but the outer surface is a sphere with charge +q uniformly distributed. So, the field outside is as if all the charge is at the center.

So, for point P outside, the field depends only on L, the distance from the center of the conductor. So, the correct answer would be option B.

Wait, but another approach: using Gauss's Law. Let's consider a Gaussian surface outside the conductor. The total charge enclosed by this surface is the charge on the outer surface of the conductor, which is +q.

So, the electric flux through the Gaussian surface is E * 4πL² = (q)/(ε₀). Therefore, E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²). That's the same as option B.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be option B.


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Setup and Induced Charges**:  
   The spherical conductor is initially neutral but contains a small cavity with a charge $+q$ placed inside. This induces a charge of $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor (due to electrostatic induction) and a charge of $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain overall neutrality.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   For points outside the conductor, the electric field depends only on the total charge enclosed by the conductor. Since the conductor's outer surface has a uniform charge distribution of $+q$, the field outside the conductor behaves as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. This is a consequence of the spherical symmetry of the conductor.

3. **Application of Gauss's Law**:  
   Consider a Gaussian surface outside the conductor at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The total charge enclosed by this surface is $+q$, and by Gauss's Law:
   \[
   E \cdot 4\pi L^2 = \frac{q}{\epsilon_0}.
   \]
   Solving for $E$, we find:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

4. **Relevance of Other Parameters**:  
   The problem provides additional details about the position of the cavity and the point $P$, such as $l$ (distance from $P$ to the cavity's center), $s$ (distance between the centers of the conductor and cavity), and $\theta$ (angle between $l$ and $s$). However, these parameters do not affect the electric field at $P$ because the conductor's outer surface ensures shielding of the internal charges. The field outside depends only on the total charge on the outer surface and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.

5. **Correct Option**:  
   The electric field at $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]
   This matches option **B**.
