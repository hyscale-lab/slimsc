Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these types of questions. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question involves Compound X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus is often used in the formation of the ylide, which is then used in the Wittig reaction. Wait, but wait, actually, when you have red phosphorus and HI, another reaction comes to mind. Oh right! It's the hydroboration reaction or maybe the use of HI in some elimination or alkylation. Wait, no, more accurately, when an alkyl halide reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it's a possible dehydrohalogenation or maybe a substitution. Or wait, I think that's for the preparation of alkyl phosphonates. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the problem says Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Oh wait, wait a second. Oh, I think I remember. When an alkyne reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes a hydrolysis to form a diol. But wait, in this case, maybe the reaction is different. Alternatively, red phosphorus is often used in the preparation of ylides for the Wittig reaction, but that's with an alkyl halide. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but let's think about what the IR and NMR data are telling us about Compound X. Because the structure of Compound X will determine what product forms after the reaction.

Looking at the IR data: the peaks are 3400–2500 cm^-1, which suggests O-H or N-H stretching. But the 1720 cm^-1 peak is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, so that suggests maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm^-1 peaks are likely aromatic C=C stretches. So the compound might be an aromatic ketone or an ester.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a strong singlet. Could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, but sometimes they can be more downfield. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid proton. But wait, a carboxylic acid proton is usually around 10-12 ppm and is a broad signal. But wait, the integration is 1H. So it's either an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid proton. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the IR would show a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3000 cm^-1, which the IR data has. So the IR shows a broad peak in 3400–2500, which is consistent with an O-H stretch. So that would support a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but the IR also has 1720 cm^-1, which is a carbonyl. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is
