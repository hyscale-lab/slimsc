Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reactions. I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it. 

The question has three parts: A, B, and C. Each involves a Michael addition reaction, and I need to figure out the products. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different product structures. 

First, let's recap what the Michael addition is. From what I remember, the Michael addition is a conjugate addition where a nucleophile (like an enolate) attacks the β-carbon of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. This is a 1,4-addition. 

Let's tackle each part one by one.

**Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) → A**

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diethylamine salt, but wait, NaOEt is present, so maybe it deprotonates something. Dimethyl malonate has two ester groups, so its enolate is a strong nucleophile. 

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, the (E) configuration would mean the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite. Wait, the acrylate is 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so structure is CH2-C(O)OCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the double bond. Wait, maybe it's CH2-CH-CO-OCH3 with the CH2 connected to the p-tolyl group. Wait, no, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be: the acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but the substituent is on the third carbon? Hmm, perhaps it's more accurate to think of it as the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the p-tolyl is attached to the CH2 part. So the structure is CH2(p-tolyl)=CH-CO-OCH3? Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C1 and C2, and the p-tolyl is on C1. Hmm, maybe I should think this through.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with the substituents being the p-tolyl on one end and the COOCH3 on the other. Wait, no, maybe it's CH2-C(O)OCH3 with a double bond to CH2-p-tolyl. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2CH(p-tolyl)COOCH3, but that doesn't fit the acrylate description. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to think that the acrylate has a double bond between C1 and C2, with substituents on C2 (the carbonyl) and on
