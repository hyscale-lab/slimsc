Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm... I'm a bit rusty on my parallax and distance relationships, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of the distance, right? So, plx = 1/distance. Oh wait, more accurately, distance (d) is approximately 1 parsec divided by the parallax in arcseconds. So d = 1/plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

The problem states that the number of stars (let's call it N) varies as 1/(plx)^5. So N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is some constant. But I need to find how N changes with distance. So I should express N in terms of d instead of plx.

Since d = 1/plx, then plx = 1/d. So substituting that into the equation, N = k * (1/(1/d))^5. Let's simplify that exponent. 1/(1/d) is d, so (d)^5. So N = k * d^5. 

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So for a small change in distance dr, how does the number of stars change? That's like finding the derivative of N with respect to d.

Taking the derivative of N with respect to d, dN/dd = 5k d^4. But wait, the question asks how the number changes with distance per unit range, so for each additional distance r, the change would be proportional to d^4. Because the derivative is the rate of change, which here is proportional to d^4.

Looking at the options, option B is r^5, which is d^5. But wait, the rate of change (the derivative) is 5k d^4, which is proportional to r^4. So that would suggest the number of stars increases with r^5, but the change per unit range is r^4.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because the number of stars in a region might depend on the volume, which goes as r^3. But this seems different because of the given relation.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I
