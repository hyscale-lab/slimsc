Okay, so I've got this question about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectral data. Hmm, let's see what I can figure out here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through each clue step by step.

First, the question gives me several characterization techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are all different chemical formulas, so I need to match the spectral data to one of them.

Let's break down each piece of data.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The broad peak at 3000 cm-1 probably indicates OH groups or maybe some kind of N-H stretch. But looking at the options, I don't see any N, so it's likely an OH group. The broadness suggests it's an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid, but the other strong peaks might give more clues. The peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. Those are important because they're in the range of carbonyl groups. 1700 is typically a strong carbonyl, like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. The 1650 might be an conjugated carbonyl, maybe an ester or a conjugated ketone, or perhaps an amide. But wait, the options don't have nitrogen, so amide is out. If both 1700 and 1650 are present, maybe it's an ester with another carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated system like a carbonyl and another group. Wait, another possibility is that the 1650 could be a C=C stretch. Oh, right, but the NMR mentions vinyl hydrogens, which are CH2=CH groups. So there's a double bond, so the 1650 could be the C=C stretch. But wait, the 1700 is a carbonyl. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl and a double bond. So maybe it's an ester with a double bond nearby, or perhaps a ketone and a double bond. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester or ketone. That would explain both peaks.

So the FTIR suggests the presence of an OH group (broad at 3000), a carbonyl (1700), and possibly a C=C (1650). Alternatively, the 1650 might be an aromatic ring, but the options don't have benzene rings because all the formulas are C6H something O. Wait, C6H10O2 would be something like an ester, maybe. Or could it be a cyclic ester, like a lactone? But then the NMR would have different features.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. That means there are CH2=CH groups in the structure. So the compound has at least one double bond. That fits with the 1650 cm-1 peak possibly being the C=C stretch.

Now, the Mass Spec: a fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm, what's a common fragment at 45? Well, 45 could be (CH3)2O (if it's 45, but wait, (CH3)2O is 45? Let me calculate: Carbon is 12, H is 1, O is 16. So (CH3)2O would be 2*(12 + 3*1) + 16 = 2*(15) +16=30+16=46. Oh, no, that's 46. So maybe not. Alternatively, CH3CHO (acetaldehyde) has a molecular ion at 44, but maybe a fragment. Wait. Another possibility: the fragment could be a methyl group attached to something else. Or perhaps a ketene ion or something else. Alternatively, the 45 could correspond to a CH2O group or something. Wait, 45 - 12 (for a CH2 group?) Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a carbonyl group. Wait, 45 is also the molecular weight for a CH3CO group. Wait, CH3CO is 45? CH3 is 15, CO is 28 (12+16), that's 43. Hmm, close but not 45. Alternatively, another possibility: the fragment might be from a ketone. Or maybe it's the loss of a larger group, like the molecule breaking into two parts. 

Putting it all together, I think the compound has an ester group because the IR has a strong peak at 1700 (which is typical for esters). Ester groups have a carbonyl (C=O) around 1700-1750. The 1650 could be from the C-O stretch in the ester, but wait, no, C-O in esters is usually lower
