Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and it's a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand all the details.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K, which is pretty close to 4 degrees Celsius (since 273 K is 0°C). So B is probably ice, but wait, the melting point being 277 K would be around 4°C. Hmm, ice melts at 273 K (0°C). Wait, maybe B is something else that melts near that temperature. Or maybe I'm thinking wrong. Alternatively, B could be something like water (H2O) since that's a common substance. But let me think more about the other clues.

The product of a certain keto acid reacting with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it has a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Also, X's analog is very close, so perhaps X is a common reagent.

Let me break this down.

First, let's think about Substance X. It's reacting with Y, which is a liquid. The reaction is violent, so perhaps it's a strong reaction, like an acid-base reaction or something explosive. The product is a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. So G could be some kind of carbonate or a sulfide, etc., but I'm not sure yet.

Gas W: its molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So each molecule of W has equal numbers of protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. For example, CO2 has a molecule with 22 protons (C=6, O=8 each, so 6 + 8*2=22). Neutrons: C has 6 neutrons (if it's C-12), each O has 8, so 6 + 8*2 = 22. So 22 neutrons. So 22 protons and 22 neutrons? Wait, that would make each molecule of W have 22 each. But wait, that's per molecule. Wait, no, each molecule has a certain number of atoms. Wait, for example, if the molecule is of H2O, each molecule has 2 H and 1 O. So total protons would be 2 (from H) + 8 (from O) = 10. Neutrons would be (each H has 0 neutrons) + 8 (O^16 has 8 neutrons). So 8 neutrons. So 10 protons and 8 neutrons. Not equal. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps W is CO2. Let me check. CO2 has one C atom and two O atoms. C has 6 protons, each O has 8. So total protons: 6 + 8*2 = 22. Now, neutrons: C (assuming C-12) has 6, each O (O-16) has 8. So total neutrons: 6 + 8*2 = 22. So W's molecule has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So that fits.

So W is CO2. So the reaction between X and Y produces CO2 gas. So Y could be something that when reacted with X, produces CO2. Let's think about possible reactions. For example, if X is a carbonate and Y is an acid, but that wouldn't produce CO2. Wait, if X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid, you could get CO2, but that's not a violent reaction. Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal carbonate reacting with an acid, but the reaction isn't usually that violent. Alternatively, maybe X is something like sodium bicarbonate reacting with an acid. Hmm, but that's not a violent reaction either.

Wait, another possibility. If X is a metal, and Y is something like liquid nitrogen or another liquid that reacts with metals. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Y is water. Wait, if X is a metal, when it reacts with water, especially violently, perhaps a metal like potassium or sodium. But then, the reaction might produce H2 gas, not CO2. Hmm.

Wait, going back, if W is CO2, then perhaps the reaction between X and Y produces CO2. So what else produces CO2? Maybe X is a carbonate, and Y is a strong acid. But then the reaction would be: carbonate + acid → CO2 + H2O. But again, that's not very violent. Alternatively, maybe Y is a strong base, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe Y is a strong oxidizing agent. Alternatively, think of X as a metal carbonate and Y as a strong acid. But perhaps that's not the right path. Let me think about the precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. 277 K is about 4°C. So B is probably a solid that melts around there. What's a common substance that melts near 4°C? Well, water (ice) melts at 273 K, which is 0°C. But 277 K is 4°C, so maybe it's another compound. Alternatively, maybe B is something else. Alternatively, perhaps B is solid carbon dioxide? No, that sublimates. Hmm.

Alternatively, thinking about the precipitate G: when heated, it releases B. So perhaps G is a carbonate. For example, if G is calcium carbonate, heating it might produce something else. But calcium carbonate doesn't release much upon heating except possibly decomposing into CaO and CO2. But then, B would be CO2, but CO2 doesn't have a melting point near 277 K. Alternatively, maybe G is a bicarbonate. For instance, sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) decomposes when heated to form Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. But again, the melting point of B would be the product. Let me think, but perhaps that's not the right direction.

Wait, another angle: the product of X reacting with a keto acid has a product with two oxygen atoms. So when a keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Let's think about what X could be. Keto acids have a ketone functional group and a carboxylic acid group. For example, acetoacetic acid or something similar. Suppose X is a base, like something that can deprotonate the keto acid. Or perhaps X is a reagent that adds to the keto group.

Wait, another thought: if X is a strong base like NaOH or KOH, and the keto acid is reacting with it in a nucleophilic addition or elimination reaction. But the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Alternatively, if X is a metal, perhaps it's a Grignard reagent, but that's more about adding to carbonyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate. Wait, wait, when X reacts with a keto acid, maybe the product is a carboxylate salt. For example, suppose the keto acid is something like CH3COCH2COOH (acetoacetic acid). Reacting with a base like KOH would deprotonate the acid to form the conjugate base. But the product would have more oxygen, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, maybe X is a metal such
