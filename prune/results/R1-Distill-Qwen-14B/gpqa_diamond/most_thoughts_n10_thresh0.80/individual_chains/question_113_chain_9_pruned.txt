Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectral data. The techniques used are FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are different chemical formulas, so I need to figure out which one fits the spectral data.

First, let's list out the given information:

1. **FTIR Spectrum:**
   - Very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks around this region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. A very broad peak might suggest a strong hydrogen bonding, which is more typical of something like a carboxylic acid.
   - Peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 cm⁻¹ is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 could be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring. Wait, aromatic rings with conjugated double bonds (like in ketones or esters) can have peaks around that area.

2. **1H NMR:**
   - Several peaks, including vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are those attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has an alkene group.

3. **Mass Spectrum:**
   - Fragment peak at m/z = 45. Hmm, m/z 45 is a common fragment. Let me think—what fragments give 45? A common one is the CH3CO+ ion (acetone fragment?), but wait, CH3CO has a molecular weight of 58? No, wait, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, a fragment like OCH2CH2O or wait, another possibility is that 45 could be a (CH2)2O group or maybe a ketene ion. Alternatively, considering the carbonyl groups from the IR, a fragment that includes a carbonyl. Wait, what about an ester group? The ester group can break down into smaller fragments. Alternatively, the fragment could be a CH2=CH-O- group, but I'm not sure. Another thought: the 45 could be the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's more around 91. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl ester or something. Wait, another approach: think of common molecular formulas and possible fragments. Let's see the options.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So each option has a different formula, which will affect the possible structures and spectral data.

Now, let's analyze each option.

**Option D: C6H12O**
Degrees of unsaturation calculation: For C6H12O, the formula is C6H12O. The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming X and N are 0 here.

So DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one ring or one double bond. But the NMR says there are vinyl hydrogens, so there must be a double bond. So maybe a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group? But the IR has a broad peak at 3000, which would be -OH. So structure could be something like cyclohexene with an -OH, but then the 1700 cm⁻¹ in IR would suggest a carbonyl. Wait, but cyclohexene with an -OH wouldn't have a carbonyl. So maybe this option doesn't fit with the IR data. Because the IR shows two carbonyl peaks, 1700 and 1650. So option D is probably not correct.

**Option B: C6H10O**
DoU: (2*6+2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees of unsaturation. That could be one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds, or two rings. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so at least one double bond. Maybe an aromatic ring? But benzene would have three double bonds, but the formula here is C6H10O. Benzene is C6H6, so if it's a substituted benzene, maybe with an alcohol group. Wait, but the IR has a carbonyl. So perhaps not. Or maybe a cyclic ether with a double bond? Not sure. But the IR has strong peaks at 1700 and 1650, which are more indicative of carbonyl groups, such as ketones or esters. So perhaps this option doesn't fit either.

**Option C: C6H10O2**
DoU: (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. Could be a ring plus a carbonyl. The IR has two carbonyl peaks, which might suggest two carbonyl groups, but more likely conjugated or different types. Alternatively, an ester group (which has a carbonyl) and a conjugated double bond. Let me think, for example, perhaps a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. Or an ester with a conjugated double bond. Let's see.

Alternatively, if the compound is a diester, but that would require more oxygens. Wait, the formula is O2, so maybe an ester and an alcohol, but that's less likely. Or perhaps an ester group and another carbonyl group, but that would need more O's. Alternatively, maybe a ketone and an ester, but I'm not sure. Wait, the IR has 1700 and 1650, which could be an ester (around 1740 usually, but it can vary) and maybe a conjugated double bond or another carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is an aromatic ring, but I'm not certain.

**Option A: C6H12O2**
DoU: (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation. That could be a ring or a double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond. So maybe a ring plus an alkene, but the IR shows two carbonyls. Hmm, but if the compound is a cyclic ester (like a lactone) with a double bond. For example, a gamma or delta lactone. Let's think about that. Gamma-butyrolactone is a 5-membered ring, but that's C4H6O2. So a six-membered lactone would be a delta-lactone, which is C5H8O2. Wait, but the option here is C6H12O2. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe a substituted ester, like methyl vinyl ester or something.

Wait, let me think about the NMR part again. The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so the compound has a double bond. So, for example, if it's an ester with a double bond nearby.

Alternatively, considering the IR peaks at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is a carbonyl, like an ester or ketone. The 1650 could be an conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ring. But if the compound is an ester, then the O2 makes sense. Let's think about a structure with an ester group and a double bond.

Wait, another thought about the mass spectrum. The fragment at m/z 45. Let's think about possible fragments. 45 could be (CH2)2O (which would be 45, since 12*2 + 1*4 +16 = 24+4+16=44? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, thinking of the acetate ion, which is CH3COO⁻, but that would have a molecular weight of 59 (12*2 + 3*1 +16 +16). Hmm, maybe not. Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be the CH2CO group, which would be 43 (12 + 2*1 +12 +16 = 43?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2=CH-O- group. Wait, the fragment could be a tropylium ion, but that's more 91. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula. Let's think about possible structures that fit the options.

Looking at the options, option C is C6H10O2. That means the formula is C6H10O2. So, for example, something like methyl vinyl ether maleate or something else. Alternatively, perhaps an ester with a double bond.

Wait, the FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000, which I thought was an O-H. So the compound has an -OH group. But wait, in an ester, there's no -OH; the ester is O-CO-O. So if the compound has an -OH, then it's either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But the IR has a peak at 1700, which would be more like an ester or ketone. Wait, but if the compound is a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad, but the carbonyl would be around 1700. So maybe the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond.

Wait, but the options are C6H12O2, C6H10O2, etc.
