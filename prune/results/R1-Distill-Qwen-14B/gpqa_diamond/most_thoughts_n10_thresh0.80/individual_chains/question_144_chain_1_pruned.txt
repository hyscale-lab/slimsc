Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but let me think it through.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data is E_X = 8 GeV, m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters, so it's a really tiny distance.

Wait, what's the general approach here? I remember that particles like mesons decay, and their mean lifetime can be found using their width. Oh right, the uncertainty principle! The mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ by τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, does that apply when the particle is at rest? Or maybe when you have a specific energy?

Wait, but the problem gives the production energy, which is higher than the rest mass. Oh, because E_X is 8 GeV and m_X is 1.2 GeV. So the meson is moving, not at rest. That means I can't just use the simple Γ = ħ/τ relation directly. Because the lifetime is the proper time, I think I need to account for the particle's velocity and Lorentz factor.

So, particles moving at high speeds will have their decay lengths affected by their velocity and lifetime. The mean decay distance, or proper decay length, is c multiplied by the mean lifetime τ. But because the particle is moving, the observed decay length is longer due to time dilation.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The mean decay length L is c multiplied by the lifetime, but considering the particle's speed. Alternatively, it's the product of the speed, lifetime, and the speed of light. Hmm, perhaps another approach.

I think the formula I need is the mean decay length, which is given by (c * γ * τ), where γ is the Lorentz factor. Or wait, maybe it's (γ * β * c * τ), where β is v/c. Because the lifetime τ is the proper time, the lab frame observes a longer lifetime due to time dilation, and the particle is moving, so it travels further.

Alternatively, I've heard of the formula L = (c * τ) * γ * β. Because τ is the proper time, the lab frame sees the lifetime as longer (γ τ) and the particle is moving at speed βc, so the distance would be
