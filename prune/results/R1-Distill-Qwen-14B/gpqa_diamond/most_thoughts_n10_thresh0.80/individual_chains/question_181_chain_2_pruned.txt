Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and their flux ratios. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but I'll think through what I remember.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stops in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So, if the pp-III reactions stopped 8.5 minutes ago, we should see the effects now because the neutrinos would have reached us, right?

Hmm, but what's the pp-III branch? I remember that the proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun. The pp-I branch has protons fusing into deuterons, then into helium-3, and so on. The pp-II and pp-III are other branches, maybe involving higher energy reactions.

Wait, the pp-III branch is one of the later steps in the proton-proton cycle. Specifically, I think it involves the fusion of helium-3 into carbon-12. Oh wait, no, that's the CNO cycle. No, wait, the pp-chain has different branches. Let me think: the pp-I branch produces helium-4 from two helium-3 nuclei. The pp-II might involve a helium-3 and a helium-4, and the pp-III could be a different pathway.

Alternatively, maybe pp-III is the last step where carbon-12 is formed from three helium-4 nuclei. No, no, that's the triple-alpha process which happens in later stages of stars, not the main pp chain. So maybe the pp-III branch is a specific part of the proton-proton cycle where helium-3 combines with another helium-3 to make carbon-12 and two protons. Oh wait, I'm getting confused. Let me get this right. The main proton-proton chain steps: two protons fuse into deuterium, then another proton to form helium-3, then two helium-3 can either combine to make helium-4 (pp-I branch), or one can combine with a helium-4 to make carbon-12 (pp-II and pp-III? Or is that the CNO cycle?)

Wait, no. The CNO cycle is a different fusion process, involving carbon, nitrogen, oxygen. The proton-proton chain is the dominant process in the Sun. So in the pp chain
