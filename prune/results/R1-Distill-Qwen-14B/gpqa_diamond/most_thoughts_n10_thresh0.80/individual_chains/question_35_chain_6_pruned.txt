Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. I remember that angular momentum operators are related to spin matrices, especially for particles like electrons or muons which have spin-1/2.

The problem says the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix Ay, which is equal to c multiplied by S. The constant c is given as h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. Oh wait, the matrix S has its first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So I should write that down.

So first, let me write down S. It looks like:
S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

Then, the operator Ay is c multiplied by S. So Ay = (h/(4π)) * S. That would make Ay look like:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Which is:

[ 0, -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π)), 0 ]

Wait, but when I multiply by a scalar, each element gets multiplied. So the top right becomes (-i h)/(4π), and the bottom left is (i h)/(4π).

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this Ay matrix. Eigenvalues are found by solving det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

So let's set up the equation:

Ay - a I = [ [ -a, (-i h)/(4π) ] , [ (i h)/(4π), -a ] ]

The determinant of this matrix should be zero.

Calculating the determinant: (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ] = 0

So that's a^2 - [ ( (-i)(i) (h^2)/(4π)^2 ) ]

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i^2) because i*(-i) is -i^2. Wait, no, wait. Let me compute (-i)*(i) = -i^2. And i^2 is -1, so -i^2 is 1.

So the term inside the square brackets is (1)*(h^2)/(16 π²). So determinant equation becomes:

a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0

So a² = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4π)

Wait, that's interesting. So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers. But wait, the options mention imaginary parts. Hmm, that's confusing. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I should double-check the matrix S. Oh wait, S as given is [[0, -i],[i,0]], which is actually the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i, isn't it? Because the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i],[i,0]]. Wait, no, wait
