Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question is about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state rather than a pure state.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, that's a diagonal matrix. Let me think about the structure of this. Each term is a projector: |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1|. Since it's multiplied by 1/2, each of these projectors contributes 1/2 to the diagonal.

So, if I were to write this matrix out, it would be a 2x2 matrix. The diagonal elements would be 1/2 and 1/2, right? Because |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]] and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]], so adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], multiplied by 1/2 gives [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]].

Now, the question is about its geometrical position in qubit space. I'm a bit confused about what that means. I think this refers to the Bloch sphere representation. Oh wait, the Bloch sphere is used for pure states, but density matrices can also be represented in a similar space, maybe with some constraints.

Wait, the density matrix for a single qubit can be written as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector in 3D space (the Bloch vector) and σ are the Pauli matrices. So in this case, since ρ is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]], that would correspond to r·σ being zero, because (I +0)/2 = I/2, which matches ρ.

So the Bloch vector r would be (0,0,0), because if the off-diagonal terms are zero and the diagonal is equal, then r is zero. That makes sense because that's the completely mixed state. It's like the classical state, maximally mixed.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which would be the origin in the Bloch sphere. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, let me double-check. The Bloch representation is for mixed states as well. For a pure state, the density matrix would have trace 1 and be a pure projector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. But this is a maximally mixed state. So the Bloch vector's length would be zero, meaning it's at the origin.

So yeah, the position is (0,0,0) in the qubit space, which is the center of the Bloch sphere. So the answer is option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This is a diagonal matrix with equal diagonal elements \( \frac{1}{2} \) and zero off-diagonal elements. In the Bloch sphere representation, a single-qubit density matrix can generally be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \( \mathbf{r} = (x, y, z) \) is the Bloch vector, and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli matrices. For the given \( \rho \), the off-diagonal terms are zero, and the diagonal terms are equal, which implies that the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} \) is zero. This corresponds to the maximally mixed state, which is located at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \( r = (0, 0, 0) \), corresponding to option C.

Answer: C
