Okay, so I have this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through.

First, I need to figure out the criteria. Both spectrographs have magnitude limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag in V. HIRES can handle up to 16 mag. So, the star's apparent magnitude has to be less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO, and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES. Wait, actually, wait—since the question is which stars can be detected by both, the apparent V magnitude of the star must be within the overlapping range of both instruments. Because if a star is too faint for one, it can't be detected by both. So the apparent V magnitude must be ≤17 (since ESPRESSO's limit is brighter than 17, which means V ≤17), and also ≤16 (since HIRES can't go beyond 16). So the star's V mag must be ≤16, because that's the stricter limit. Because any star brighter than 16 mag would be detected by both. Wait, no. Wait, no—ESPRESSO can observe up to V=17, HIRES up to V=16. So for a star to be detectable by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤16, because that's the lower limit of the two. So if a star is brighter (lower number) than 16, both can see it. But if it's between 16 and 17, only ESPRESSO can see it, but not HIRES. So the stars we're looking for must have apparent V mag ≤16.

Wait, but wait. Let's read the question again: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. Brighter than 17, so V <17. So ESPRESSO can observe up to V=17, but not beyond. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so V <16. So for a star to be observable by both, its apparent V must be ≤16. Because if it's 16.5, for example, it's not visible to HI
