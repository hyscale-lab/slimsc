Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. So the star moves towards and away from us, causing the spectral lines to shift. 

The question says that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. 

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, but the question is about the ratio of their orbital periods, specifically how many times longer Planet #2's period is than Planet #1's.

I think the key here is the relationship between the Doppler shift and the orbital period. The radial velocity semi-amplitude (which is what the shift measures) is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Oh right, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) ) / ( (P * (1 day in seconds)) )^(1/3) ) )

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up some terms. Alternatively, another approach: the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ), assuming circular orbit (e=0) and face-on (i=90 degrees, so sin i = 1).

Since both planets have the same mass as Neptune, and the stars have the same mass, the only varying factors are the orbital periods. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because if you rearrange, K = (constant) * M_p / (M_s^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Wait, but in the problem, both stars have the same mass, and both planets have the same mass. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4. But wait, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so P is proportional to (1/K)^(3). 

Let me think: 

K ∝ 1/(P)^(1/3) → P ∝ 1/(K)^(3).

So the ratio of periods P2/P1 is equal to (K1/K2)^3. Because:

P2/P1 = (K1^3)/(K2^3) → since P ∝ 1/K^3.

Wait, no. Let's think again. 

K ∝ 1 / (P^{1/3}) → so P ∝ 1 / K^{3}.

So if K1 is the semi-amplitude for planet 1, and K2 for planet 2, then P1 is proportional to 1/(K1^3), and P2 to 1/(K2^3).

So the ratio P2/P1 would be (1/K2^3) / (1/K1^3) ) = (K1/K2)^3.

So if K2 is larger than K1, P2 would be smaller than P1. Because a larger K implies a shorter period.

Wait, so in the problem, K2 is 7, K1 is 5. So K2 > K1.

So P2 is (5/7)^3 times P1. So P2 = (5^3)/(7^3) * P1 → P2 = (125)/(343) * P1 ≈ 0.364 times P1.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is than planet #1. So if P2 is 0.364 * P1, that means P2 is shorter than P1. So it's about 0.36 times as long. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter.

But the options have choices. Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me recheck. Because the semi-amplitude K is the velocity of the star, which depends on the planet's mass, the orbital period, and the distance (which relates to the semi-major axis). 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct relation is that a higher K (larger velocity) implies a shorter period, because the star is moving back and forth more rapidly. So a larger K leads to a shorter period. So if K2 is larger than K1, P2 is shorter than P1. So the period of planet #2 is shorter than planet #1.

But wait, the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then it's 0.36 times as long, so it's shorter. So the answer would be 0.36 times as long. So the ratio is 0.36.

Looking at the options:

A) ~0.36

So the answer is A.


The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The semi-amplitude of this shift, \( K \), is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), assuming the planet's mass and the star's mass are constant. Mathematically, \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \), or equivalently, \( P \propto 1/K^3 \).

In this problem, Planet #1 causes a spectral line shift of 5 milliangstroms (\( K_1 = 5 \)), while Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms (\( K_2 = 7 \)). Since \( P \propto 1/K^3 \), the ratio of the orbital periods \( P_2/P_1 \) is given by:

\[
P_2/P_1 = (K_1/K_2)^3
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \):

\[
P_2/P_1 = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times as long as that of Planet #1. This means Planet #2 has a shorter orbital period than Planet #1. Among the given options, the closest match is:

**A) ~0.36**

Answer: A
