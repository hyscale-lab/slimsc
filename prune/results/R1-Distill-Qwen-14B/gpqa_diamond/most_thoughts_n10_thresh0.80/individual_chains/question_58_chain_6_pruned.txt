Okay, so I have this physics question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is asking which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences—those are infinities that pop up in calculations, right? So regularization is a way to make these infinities manageable so you can calculate things without everything blowing up.

Let me think about each option. 

Starting with option D, Classical Electrodynamics. That's the theory of electricity and magnetism as described by Maxwell's equations. Wait, but Maxwell's equations are classical, meaning they don't involve quantum mechanics. So in the classical realm, do you get these divergences? Like, when you have point charges, you get issues with the electric field at the origin being infinite. But in classical theory, you don't quantize things, so you don't have the same problems as in quantum field theories. So do you need regularization in classical electrodynamics? I don't think so because regularization is a quantum field theory tool. So maybe D is the correct answer because it never requires regularization because it's not a quantum theory.

Wait, but I should check the other options too. 

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is a quantum field theory where electrons and photons interact. I remember that QED does have issues with divergences—like loop diagrams leading to infinities. So they must use techniques like regularization and renormalization to handle these. So QED does require regularization, so option C is not the answer.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), which deals with the strong force and quarks. QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to QED but with more complexities. It does involve divergent loop integrals, so regularization is definitely used here. So B is not the right answer.

Option A is Superstring Theory. String theory is an attempt to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity. I think string theories require dealing with high energies and possibly higher dimensions. Do they have divergent issues? Well, string theories often require dealing with infinities, but I'm not entirely sure about regularization. Wait, in string theory, the concept of regularization might be different because they don't use the same perturb
