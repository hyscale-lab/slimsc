Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right reagents for these reactions. Let's see what each part is about.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? And the product looks like it's a nitrile with a hydroxyl and methyl group on the same carbon. So when a ketone reacts with NaCN, what usually happens?

I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. In the presence of a hydrogen source, like in the case of the Stephen reduction or maybe something else. Oh wait, maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh yeah, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, like NaCN, under certain conditions, it forms a cyanohydrin. The cyanide acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon, and then maybe some acid work-up is done.

But wait, for the formation of the cyanohydrin, you usually need an acid catalyst, right? So perhaps reagent A is an acid, like H3O+ (which is option A and B), or maybe NaHSO3, which is a source of H+ and SO3^2-.

Wait, but NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. Does that act as an acid here? Or is it more for something else, like maybe in the second reaction?

So the first reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So adding NaCN and a proton source. That would make sense because the formation of the cyanohydrin typically uses an acid to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, so the CN- can attack.

So A is probably H3O+ because that's a strong acid. Or maybe another source of H+ like H2SO4, but the options given have H3O+ or NaHSO3 for A.

Wait, but in the options, for A, the options are either H3O+ or NaHSO3. So if the first reaction uses A as H3O+, which is option A and B. But then what about the second reaction?

The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Hmm, so the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid. Oh right, that's the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. But under what conditions?

Wait, hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids usually requires strong acid and heat, or sometimes a base. But the product is a carboxylic acid, so it's probably under acidic conditions. The typical reagents I remember for this conversion are HCl (concentrated) and heat. Or sometimes using H2O with acid catalyst.

In the options, B could be HCl or CH3COOH (acetic acid). Wait, the options for B are HCl (options A and C) or CH3COOH (options B and D).

Wait, looking at the options, option A says B is HCl, option B says B is CH3COOH. So if the second reaction uses HCl, that makes sense for the hydrolysis. But wait, sometimes nitriles are hydrolyzed in acidic conditions to produce carboxylic acids. So perhaps B is HCl, but sometimes other acids might work.

But in the second reaction, the starting material is a cyanohydrin (since it has a -OH and -CN on the same carbon), and then it's being hydrolyzed. Wait, no, the starting material is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which is the product of the first reaction. So the second step is the nitrile group being converted to a carboxylic
