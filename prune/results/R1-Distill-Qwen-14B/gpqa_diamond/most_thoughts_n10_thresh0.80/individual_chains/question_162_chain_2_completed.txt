Okay, so I've got this problem here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, first, what do I know about metrics and pseudospheres? I remember that in general relativity, the metric describes the geometry of spacetime. But here, the problem seems to be about a metric in two dimensions, maybe?

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So that looks like a line element in two-dimensional space, probably with some sort of curvature because of the denominator. The denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), which makes me think of a sphere because the equation x² + y² = a is a circle of radius sqrt(a) in 2D. So when x² + y² equals 4, the denominator becomes zero. That probably means the metric blows up there, so the radius of this circle is 2, since sqrt(4) is 2.

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, what's a pseudosphere? Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. It's like a hyperbola rotated around an axis, creating a shape with a cusp. But I'm not sure how that relates to the metric here.

Alternatively, maybe the metric describes a space with a certain curvature. Let me think about the form of the metric. The general form for a 2D metric in isometric coordinates (like polar coordinates) is ds² = f(r)² (dr² + r² dθ²), where f(r) is some function. But here, the metric is given as [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²), so it's already in a form similar to that.

Wait, maybe it's better to switch to polar coordinates because x and y are appearing as x² + y², which is r² in polar. Let me try that. So let x = r cosθ and y = r sinθ. Then, dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ². Substituting into the metric, we get:

ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²)

Hmm, so in polar coordinates, the metric is:

ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] dr² + [32 r²/(4 - r²)] dθ²

Now, the function f(r) in this case would be sqrt(32/(4 - r²)) for the dr component and sqrt(32 r²/(4 - r²)) for the r dθ component. Wait, wait, actually, the general metric in polar coordinates is ds² = g_rr dr² + g_θθ dθ², where g_rr is the coefficient for dr² and g_θθ is for dθ². So here, g_rr is 32/(4 - r²), and g_θθ is 32 r²/(4 - r²).

To find the area, perhaps we need to compute the area element, which in 2D is sqrt(g) dr dθ, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric tensor in 2D is diagonal, so determinant is (g_rr)(g_θθ) - (off-diagonal terms, which are zero) so determinant is g_rr * g_θθ.

Wait, no, in 2D, the area element is sqrt(det g) dr dθ. For a metric in diagonal form, det g is (g_rr)(g_θθ) - 0, so sqrt(g_rr * g_θθ).

So let's compute that. g_rr is 32/(4 - r²), and g_θθ is 32 r²/(4 - r²). So the determinant is (32/(4 - r²)) * (32 r²/(4 - r²)) ) = (32 * 32 r²) / (4 - r²)^2.

So sqrt(det g) is sqrt( (32^2 r²)/(4 - r²)^2 ) ) = (32 r)/(4 - r²).

Wait, but 32 is 32. Let me compute 32^2: 32*32=1024. So sqrt(1024 r²/(4 - r²)^2) )= (32 r)/(4 - r²). So the area element becomes (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ.

So to find the area of the whole space (assuming it's a surface), we'd integrate this from some r limits and θ from 0 to 2π. But wait, what are the limits of r here? The denominator is 4 - r², so it's positive when r² <4, i.e., r <2. So the range of r is from 0 to 2. Because when r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, which makes the area element blow up. So the area would be the integral from r=0 to r=2, and θ=0 to 2π.

So the area A is the integral ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Let me compute the inner integral first: ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make a substitution u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr. So the integral becomes ∫ [32/(u)] * (-du/2) ).

Wait, the limits: when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So substituting, the integral becomes:

From u=4 to u=0, ∫ [32/u] * (-du/2) ) = (32/2) ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) (1/u) (-du) )

But the negative sign flips the limits: (16) ∫ (from u=0 to u=4) (1/u) du.

Wait, but ∫ (1/u) du is ln|u| + C. So evaluating from 0 to 4.

Wait, but integrating from 0 to 4 would cause a problem because at u=0, ln(0) is negative infinity. So this integral would diverge. Wait, but wait our substitution is leading us to a problem?

Wait, let me double-check the substitution. The integral is from r=0 to 2. So when r approaches 2, u approaches 0. So when r approaches 2, the integrand becomes very large because denominator approaches zero. So the integral from 0 to 2 of [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr is the same as ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me compute without substitution:

∫ (32r)/(4 - r²) dr = -32 ∫ [ r dr/(4 - r²) ) ]

Let me see, let me set u = 4 - r². Then du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So the integral becomes ∫ (32 r dr)/(4 - r²) ) = 32 ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) )

Which is 32 * ∫ [ (-du/2) ) / u ]

= 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (du/u )

= -16 ∫ (du/u )

So from r=0 (u=4) to r=2 (u=0), it's -16 ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of (1/u) du.

Which is -16 [ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0.

= -16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ]

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so this becomes -16 [ (-infty) - ln(4) ] → which is positive infinity. So the integral diverges, meaning the area is infinite.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Because a pseudosphere is a finite area? Or not? Or I'm getting confused between the two.

Wait, the question is, what is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2? So perhaps I'm thinking of the wrong thing. Maybe the given metric describes a pseudosphere?

Wait, another thought: the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let me think about the form of the metric for a pseudosphere. I think the pseudosphere has a metric that's similar to the hyperbolic space. Hyperbolic space in 2D can be represented in various coordinate systems, like Poincaré coordinates or the like.

But in this case, the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), which suggests that the curvature is positive because as r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, making the metric components blow up, which might indicate a singularity. Wait, but a pseudosphere has negative curvature, so perhaps this is a sphere with positive curvature?

Wait, let me think about the Gaussian curvature. For a metric in 2D, the Gaussian curvature K is given by (1/(2g)) [ (g_rr'' + g_θθ'' ) ... ] Well, perhaps it's easier to compute the Gaussian curvature from the metric.

Alternatively, the area element is (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ. The area would be the integral of this from r=0 to 2 and θ=0 to 2π. But as I found earlier, the integral diverges because when r approaches 2, the denominator becomes very small, leading to the integral tending to infinity. So the area is infinite.

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere of radius 2. Wait, pseudospheres have finite area? Or is it that in the metric given, the area is infinite?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the area element. Let me recheck the calculation.

The metric in polar coordinates is:

g_rr = 32/(4 - r²)
g_θθ = 32 r²/(4 - r²)

The determinant g is g_rr * g_θθ = [32/(4 - r²)] * [32 r²/(4 - r²)] = (32 *32 r²)/(4 - r²)^2 → (1024 r²)/(4 - r²)^2.

So the square root of the determinant is sqrt(1024 r²)/(4 - r²) ) = (32 r)/(4 - r²).

So the area element is (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ.

Integrating over r from 0 to 2 and θ from 0 to 2π:

A = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) [ ∫ (r=0 to 2) (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr ] dθ

The inner integral is:

∫ (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr from 0 to 2.

Let u=4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So, the integral becomes:

32 ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) → 32 ∫ (-du/2)/u → -16 ∫ du/u.

Limits: when r=0, u=4. r=2 → u=0.

So the integral becomes:

-16 ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) (1/u) du = 16 ∫ (from u=0 to u=4) (1/u) du.

Which is 16 [ ln(u) ] from 0 to 4 → 16 (ln(4) - ln(0)).

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so this becomes 16 (ln4 + infinity) → infinity.

So the area is infinite, so the answer would be option D, which is +infty.

Wait, but what about the radius being 2. Oh, wait, the metric has 4 in the denominator, which is (2)^2. So the radius of the circle where the metric blows up is 2, which is the same as the pseudosphere radius given. But a pseudosphere has finite area, but perhaps in this case, the metric represents a space that's infinite in area.

Wait, but I thought a pseudosphere (like the tractricoid) is a finite area surface. So why is this metric leading to an infinite area?

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric isn't a model of hyperbolic space but a spherical metric. Because the denominator is 4 - r², which suggests that as r approaches 2, the metric blows up. That's more like a spherical geometry, where the area beyond a certain radius is inaccessible. But in that case, the area up to r=2 would be finite? Or no, because the integral up to r=2 diverges.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting mixed up between different models of space. Let me think again. Let's consider the metric in the form ds² = [32/(4 - (x² + y²))] (dx² + dy²). Alternatively, if I factor the 32, maybe it's:

32/(4 - r²) = 32/(4(1 - r²/4)) )= 8/(1 - (r²)/4) = 8/(1 - (r/(2))^2 )

So the metric becomes ds² = (8/(1 - (r²/4))) (dr² + r² dθ²). Hmm, that looks a bit like the metric for the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic space, but the denominator is 1 - r²/(a²), which is usually used for hyperbolic space when a is the radius. Wait, no, the Poincaré disk model has ds² = [4 a²/(a² - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²), where a is the radius of the disk. But in our case, a would be 2, because 4 is (2)^2. So comparing, a=2, then 4 a² = 4*(4)=16. But our numerator is 32, which is 2*16. So perhaps it's scaled differently.

Wait, but the Poincaré disk model for hyperbolic space of radius a has a metric with 4 a²/(a² - r²). So 4 a² is 16 in our case if a=2. But our metric has 32/(4 - r²) = 8/(1 - r²/4). So maybe it's scaled differently. But regardless, the area element would be [8/(1 - r²/4)] * r dr dθ.

Wait, but the area in hyperbolic space is finite for a disk of radius less than a. No, wait no—hmm, hyperbolic space has infinite area even within a finite radius. Because as you approach the edge of the Poincaré disk (r approaching a), the area element increases without bound. So integrating the area element from r=0 to r approaches a would give an infinite area, which is why hyperbolic space is non-compact and has infinite volume.

But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh, wait, a pseudosphere is a finite surface with infinite volume? Or is it a finite area? No, I think the tractricoid (pseudosphere) has finite surface area. So this seems contradictory.

Hmm, perhaps the given metric isn't a pseudosphere. Maybe it's a model of hyperbolic space, which indeed has infinite area. So in this case, the area would be infinite, which would correspond to option D.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The calculation I did earlier shows that the area integral diverges, leading to an infinite area. So regardless of what the surface is called, the metric given leads to an infinite area, so the answer is D.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

To compute the area, we switch to polar coordinates where \(x = r \cos\theta\) and \(y = r \sin\theta\), so \(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\). Substituting into the metric, we get:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right).
\]

The area element in 2D is given by \(\sqrt{\det g} \, dr \, d\theta\), where \(g\) is the metric tensor. The metric tensor components are:

\[
g_{rr} = \frac{32}{4 - r^2}, \quad g_{\theta\theta} = \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2}.
\]

The determinant of the metric tensor is:

\[
\det g = g_{rr} \cdot g_{\theta\theta} = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2} = \frac{1024 r^2}{(4 - r^2)^2}.
\]

The square root of the determinant is:

\[
\sqrt{\det g} = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2}.
\]

Thus, the area element is:

\[
dA = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is obtained by integrating over the entire space. The limits of integration are \(r = 0\) to \(r = 2\) (since the denominator \(4 - r^2\) becomes zero at \(r = 2\)) and \(\theta = 0\) to \(\theta = 2\pi\). The area is:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

First, compute the inner integral over \(r\):

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Let \(u = 4 - r^2\), so \(du = -2r \, dr\), or \(r \, dr = -\frac{du}{2}\). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
32 \int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{-\frac{du}{2}}{u} = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{du}{u}.
\]

Flipping the limits:

\[
-16 \int_0^4 \frac{du}{u} = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{du}{u}.
\]

The integral \(\int \frac{du}{u}\) is \(\ln|u|\), so:

\[
16 \left[\ln(u)\right]_0^4 = 16 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(0)\right].
\]

Since \(\ln(0) \to -\infty\), the integral diverges, indicating that the area is infinite.

Finally, the total area is:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \cdot \text{(divergent integral)} = \infty.
\]

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere described by this metric is infinite.
