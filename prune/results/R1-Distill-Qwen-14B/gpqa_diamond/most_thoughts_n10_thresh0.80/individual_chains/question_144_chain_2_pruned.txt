Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonances and their mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through. 

The question gives me X as a meson resonance. The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are A through D, each with different values in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance (also known as the decay length) is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula I think is something like c * τ * β, where c is the speed of light, τ is the lifetime, and β is the velocity relative to the speed of light. But wait, how do I find τ?

Oh right, the width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty in energy ΔE is the width Γ, and the uncertainty in time Δt is the lifetime τ. So Γ * τ ≈ ħ. Wait, no, the exact relation is Γ ≈ ħ / τ. Because Γ is the decay width, which is the energy uncertainty, and the time uncertainty is τ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, I also need to consider relativistic effects. The energy E of the particle is given as 8 GeV, but its mass is 1.2 GeV. So the particle is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light. I'll need to calculate its velocity β = v/c.

So the steps are:

1. Calculate the particle's velocity β using its energy E and mass m.
2. Find the lifetime τ using the width Γ.
3. Compute the mean decay distance as c * τ * β.

Let me break this down.

First, calculating the velocity. The energy E is the total energy, which is γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. So γ = E / (m c²). Wait, but I'm working in units where c is 1, but in SI units, I have to be careful. Let me think: E = gamma m c². So gamma is E / (m c²). But here, E is given in GeV, mass is in GeV/c². Hmm, perhaps it's easier to work in natural units where c=1 and so on, but I'll
