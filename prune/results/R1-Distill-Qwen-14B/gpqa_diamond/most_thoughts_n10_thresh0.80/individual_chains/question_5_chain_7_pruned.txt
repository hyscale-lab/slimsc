Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. They've given the components of the operator P in terms of 2x2 matrices, multiplied by ħ/2. 

Wait, so the operator P is a vector operator, so it has components P_x, P_y, P_z. Each of these is (ħ/2) multiplied by a specific matrix. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators are often represented like this. Oh wait, because these matrices look familiar as the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2.

Let me write down the given matrices:

- P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
- P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
- P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So each of these is (ħ/2) times a Pauli matrix. Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So P = (ħ/2)(σ_x, σ_y, σ_z), which makes P a spin-½ operator, which makes sense for a muon, which is a spin-½ particle.

The operator we're looking at is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, which means its y-component is zero. So n could be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), maybe? Or wait, sometimes people parametrize it as (cosθ, 0, sinθ) when θ is the angle from the z-axis. Hmm, I think it's the latter. So θ would be the angle between the direction n and the z-axis.

The operator P is being applied along n, so the operator in question is the component P_n = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z). So P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Wait, but since n is in the
