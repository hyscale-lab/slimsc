Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Hmm, let's see. The question says that astronomers observed the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. I need to figure out how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. The options are A to D, each with different exponents.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. So plx = 1/distance, or distance = 1/plx. But wait, I think it's actually in parsecs, so if a star has a parallax of 1 arcsecond, it's 1 parsec away. So the formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs.

The number of stars, let's call it N, varies as 1/plx^5. So N = k / (plx)^5, where k is some constant. But I need to express N in terms of distance, not parallax.

Since plx = 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So substituting that into the equation, N = k * (d)^5. Wait, wait. Let me double-check. If N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, and plx is 1/d, then 1/( (1/d) )^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question isn't asking how N depends on d; it's asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of
