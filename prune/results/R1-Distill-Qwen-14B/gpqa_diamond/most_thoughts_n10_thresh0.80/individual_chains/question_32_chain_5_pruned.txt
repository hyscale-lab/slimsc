Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy of a nucleus moving at a certain speed. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking for the energy when the speed v is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Oh wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li-6 maybe? Because lithium usually has 3 protons, and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6. So the mass number A is 6 (3 protons + 3 neutrons).

I remember that in particle physics, when dealing with relativistic speeds, we use the gamma factor. Gamma is equal to 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)). 

But wait, I'm looking for the energy, which for a relativistic particle is gamma times the rest mass energy. Oh right, so the total energy E is gamma multiplied by m_0 c squared. But wait, the options are given in GeV, which is a unit of energy. So I need to calculate gamma and multiply it by the rest mass of the nucleus.

First, let me find gamma. Let's plug in v = 0.96c. So v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. 

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me double-check that calculation. Because 0.28 is about 2/7, since 2 divided by 7 is approximately 0.2857. Hmm, but 0.28 is a bit less than 2/7, which is about 0.2857. So 1/0.28 is roughly 3.5714. Let me compute it more accurately.

Calculating sqrt(0.0784): sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly? Because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. Oh yes, right. Because 28^2 is 784. So yeah, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

Now, the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6, so its mass is the mass number times the mass of a nucleon. Wait, but wait—the mass of a nucleus isn't exactly A times the mass of a proton or neutron because of binding energy. But in such physics problems, I think we usually approximate the rest mass of the nucleus as A times the mass of a proton (or maybe the mass of a neutron, but considering that Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, perhaps we can use the average or just the u (
