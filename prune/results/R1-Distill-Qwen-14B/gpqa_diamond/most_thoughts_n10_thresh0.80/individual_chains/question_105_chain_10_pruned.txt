Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and try to understand what's being asked.

So, the setup is about a star similar to the Sun. The star has dark spots covering one hemisphere, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because the spots are on one hemisphere, when the star rotates, the brightness we observe changes over time—this is what photometric time-series observations detect. The interesting part is that this brightness variation could be mistaken for an exoplanet transiting in front of the star, causing a dip in brightness.

The question is asking: what should the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet be, relative to the star's radius, to produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve if there were no spots? So, in other words, if instead of spots, a planet was causing the brightness change, what size would it need to be to give the same signal strength.

Hmm. So the key here is to compare the brightness variation caused by the star's spots to the variation caused by a planet transit. Since the problem states that the spots' situation can resemble an exoplanet, their signals must have the same amplitude. So we need to find the planet radius Rpl such that the amplitude of the light curve (the dip in brightness) is the same as that caused by the spots.

Wait, but the problem says that the star's light curve is being modulated by the spots. So when the spots come into view, the star appears dimmer. As the star rotates, the spots move into and out of our line of sight. So the brightness variation is due to this rotation.

But if we were to model this as a planet transiting, the dip would be when the planet moves in front of the star, blocking some of the light. The key is that the depth of the dip depends on the ratio of the areas: (Rp/Rstar)^2, because the area is proportional to the square of the radius.

Wait, but in the case of the spots, the variation is a bit different. Because the spots are cooler than the rest of the star. So when the spots are facing us (on the near side), the star appears slightly dimmer than when the non-spotty regions are facing us.

So, the effective brightness variation is due to the spots being cooler. Let's model this.

First, the star's total luminosity without any spots is L0 = 4πRstar²σTeff^4. But with spots covering a certain area, the observed luminosity changes.

The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So, the spots cover 0.2 of the surface area. Each spot has a temperature of Teff - 1000 K, which is 5000 K.

Wait, but the effective temperature is the star's overall temperature. The spots are cooler, but the rest of the star is at 6000 K.

So, the star's luminosity when the spots are facing us will be lower than its maximum luminosity, and when the spots are not facing us (like when the other hemisphere is visible), the luminosity is higher.

Wait, but the star is rotating, so the spots come into view and out of view. But the problem mentions that only one hemisphere is spotty. So perhaps the star has spots on one side, and when it rotates, that side comes into view. Wait, but for a star, each hemisphere is the same as the other in terms of what we see. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding, but the star is observed as having spots covering one hemisphere. So, when it rotates, the spots come into the field of view and then go out.

But the star is a sphere, so when we look at it, the hemisphere that's facing us is the near side. So if the spots cover, say, the front hemisphere, then as the star rotates, the spots come and go from the visible hemisphere.

Wait, no, wait. The star's surface is a sphere. So when the star is
