Okay, let's tackle this physics problem. So, the question is about the allowed decay modes of a boson X given its interaction Lagrangian and mass. Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, the decay of a boson depends on the particles it can couple to, which are determined by the Lagrangian, and also the energy available (mass of the boson) compared to the masses of the possible decay products.

The Lagrangian given is L = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, wait, I think I should parse this correctly. Oh right, the interaction term involves X(y) coupling to fermions. So, X is a boson field, and it's interacting with fermions via a term that looks like X ψ̄ ψ. So the interaction is Yukawa-like, which usually implies that the coupling is between a scalar (or boson) and fermions.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. I need to find which fermion pairs it can decay into. For fermions, each decay would produce a pair like f f̄, right? But the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion to allow the decay kinematically. So, I have to consider the masses of all possible fermions.

Wait, what are the masses of the known fermions? Let me think. The up and down quarks are the lightest, but their masses are about a few MeV. Then, strange quark is around 100 MeV, charm around 1.5 GeV, bottom around 4.5 GeV, top is about 173 GeV, and the tau lepton is around 1.78 GeV. The charged leptons' masses are: electron is negligible, muon about 0.1 GeV, tau around 1.78 GeV.

So, the X boson is 6 GeV. So, for any fermion f, 2m_f must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. Let's go through each possible fermion.

Electron: m_e ~ 0.0005 GeV. So 2m_e is negligible. So X can decay into e+ e-.

Muon: m_mu ~ 0.1 GeV. 2m_mu is 0.2 GeV. So that's allowed.

Tau: m_tau ~1.78 GeV. 2*1.78 is about 3.56 GeV. So 6 GeV is way more than that. So tau+ tau- decay is allowed.

Now, for quarks. The up quark is super light, so 2m_u is negligible. Same for down. So X can decay into u ū and d d̄.

Strange quark: m_s ~ 100 MeV (0.1 GeV). 2m_s is 0.2 GeV. So allowed.

Charm quark: m_c ~1.5 GeV. 2m_c is 3 GeV. 3 GeV is less than 6 GeV, so c c̄ decay is allowed.

Bottom quark: m_b ~4.5 GeV. 2m_b is 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄ because 9 GeV is larger than 6 GeV. So that decay is not allowed.

Top quark is way too heavy, but mass is 173 GeV, so even more so.

So what fermion pairs are possible? Let's list them:

e+ e-

mu+ mu-

tau+ tau-

u ū

d d̄

s s̄

c c̄

Wait, but what about other particles? The Lagrangian shows that X couples to fermions f. But from the given Lagrangian, which fermions are included? The Lagrangian is written as L = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So the fermion fields ψ_f could be any of the known fermions, unless specified otherwise. So assuming that X can interact with any fermion, unless there's a reason it can't.

But wait, in the Lagrangian, the interaction term is X ψ̄ ψ, so X couples to any fermion that is part of the ψ_f. So all fermions are possible decay products, provided the mass condition is met.

Looking back at the allowed decays, the possible ones are:

e+ e-

mu+ mu-

tau+ tau-

u ū

d d̄

s s̄

c c̄

Wait, but what about the bottom quark? No, because 2m_b is 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So b b̄ is not allowed.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A) X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+, tau-, e+ e-

But wait, 2m_b is 9 GeV, which is more than X's mass (6 GeV), so b b̄ decay is not allowed. So option A includes b b̄, which is kinematically forbidden. So A is incorrect.

Option B) X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

This includes all the allowed fermions except for b and t. So yes, this seems correct. Because 2m_c is 3 GeV, which is allowed.

Option C) Includes c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, t t̄, tau, etc. But t is 173 GeV, so 2m_t is 346 GeV, way more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into t t̄. So option C is incorrect.

Option D) Includes b b̄, which is not allowed. So D is incorrect.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check option B. B includes c c̄, which is allowed (3 GeV), s s̄ (allowed), u ū (allowed), d d̄ (allowed), tau (allowed), mu (allowed), e (allowed). So B includes all possible fermion pairs that X can decay into. So B is the correct option.

But wait the problem says "lowest order" decays. Do higher mass fermions decay less likely? No, kinematically allowed just depends on mass. So if the mass is met, it's allowed regardless of coupling strength. But the decay is also determined by phase space, coupling, etc., but the question is about allowed decays kinematically, which just depends on mass.

So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian indicates that \( X \) couples to fermions, and the allowed decays depend on whether the mass of \( X \) is sufficient to produce the fermion-antifermion pair, i.e., \( 2m_f \leq m_X \). 

### Key Analysis:
1. **Electron (\( e^+e^- \)):** The electron mass is negligible (\( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)), so \( 2m_e \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This decay is allowed.
2. **Muon (\( \mu^+\mu^- \)):** The muon mass is \( m_\mu \approx 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_\mu = 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \). This decay is allowed.
3. **Tau (\( \tau^+\tau^- \)):** The tau mass is \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_\tau = 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \). This decay is allowed.
4. **Up Quark (\( u\bar{u} \)):** The up quark mass is negligible (\( m_u \approx 2 \, \text{MeV} \)), so \( 2m_u \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This decay is allowed.
5. **Down Quark (\( d\bar{d} \)):** The down quark mass is also negligible (\( m_d \approx 5 \, \text{MeV} \)), so \( 2m_d \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This decay is allowed.
6. **Strange Quark (\( s\bar{s} \)):** The strange quark mass is \( m_s \approx 100 \, \text{MeV} \), so \( 2m_s = 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \). This decay is allowed.
7. **Charm Quark (\( c\bar{c} \)):** The charm quark mass is \( m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_c = 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This decay is allowed.
8. **Bottom Quark (\( b\bar{b} \)):** The bottom quark mass is \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} \). Since \( 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \), this decay is not allowed.
9. **Top Quark (\( t\bar{t} \)):** The top quark mass is \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} \). This decay is not allowed.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A:** Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B:** Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C:** Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_t > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option D:** Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order are \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \).
