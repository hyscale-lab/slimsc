Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. It's about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions, forming complexes.

The problem states that the concentration of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Wait, stochiometric means the molar ratio is 1:1, so each Ca binds one EDTA. The pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is fully deprotonated and can form the complex efficiently. The temperature is 25 degrees Celsius, which I think is standard, so maybe activity coefficients are around 1, so we can ignore them.

The formation constant, K_{Ca-EDTA}, is given as 5x10^10. Oh, right, the formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2−, and K would be [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the problem gives me the concentration of the complex as 0.02 M. So, initially, I might think that the concentration of Ca²+ would be much lower because the formation constant is so large. Because a large K means the reaction favors products, so most of the Ca and EDTA would form the complex.

So let's think about this. Let's denote the concentration of the complex as [CaEDTA] = 0.02 M. Since the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, we can set up an equation using the formation constant.

The formation constant K is [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). But wait, in solution, the EDTA and Ca might not all form the complex, but given that K is so large, the amount uncomplexed would be very small. But wait, wait a second. The initial solution: if I start with the complex, then in solution, it will dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

But let me think: the complex is at 0.02 M, and it's in equilibrium. So the dissociation of the complex would be the reverse reaction. But since K is given for the formation, the dissociation constant would be
