Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read through it again and see what I can figure out.

The question talks about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. Also, a reaction involving a keto acid with X produces a product with 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options are A to D.

Hmm. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's think about gas W. Its molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So each molecule's total protons (which is the atomic number) equals the total neutrons. So the molecule must be an isotope where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons in each atom. Wait, no, the molecule's total neutrons equal total protons. So for example, if the molecule is H2O, that's not it. Wait, perhaps it's something like CO2? No, wait, let me think.

Wait, another approach: if each molecule has an equal number of neutrons and protons, then the molecule must be something like H2 (protons 2, neutrons 0 each, but that doesn't work. Or maybe O2? O has 8 protons. Each atom of O has 8 neutrons in the common isotope. But O2 would have protons 16 (each O has 8), and neutrons 16 (each O has 8). So 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So that's a possible candidate.

Alternatively, maybe NH3? No, because nitrogen has 7 protons, hydrogen 1. Let's see. Wait, what about CH4? No, that's 6 protons and 4*1=4 neutrons? No, that wouldn't match.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the gas is CO. Carbon has 6 protons, oxygen 8. CO would be C (6) + O (8) so protons total 14. Neutrons: carbon usually has 6 (so 12C is 6), oxygen 8 (16O is 8). So 6+8=14. So 14 protons and 14 neutrons. That fits. So gas W would be CO. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's CH4? No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the gas is CO2. CO2 has C (6 protons) and two O's (8 each). So total protons: 6 + 2*8=22. Neutrons: C is 6, O is 8 each. So 6 + 2*8=22. So 22 protons and 22 neutrons. That matches. So CO2 could be W.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If the molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons, then the sum of protons in the molecule equals the sum of neutrons. So for CO2, total protons = 6 + 2*8 =22. Neutrons: for each carbon, 6 (since 12C has 6), and each O, 8 (16O). So same, 6 + 2*8=22. So yes, that matches. So the gas W is CO2.

But wait, CO2 is a gas released during reactions, but under what conditions? Maybe it's a carbonate reacting with acid? Or something else.

Alternatively, if W is CO, then protons are 6+8=14, and neutrons are 6 (C) + 8 (O) =14. So CO would also fit. But CO is a gas, though it's less common to be released in such reactions compared to CO2.

Alternatively, maybe gas W is
