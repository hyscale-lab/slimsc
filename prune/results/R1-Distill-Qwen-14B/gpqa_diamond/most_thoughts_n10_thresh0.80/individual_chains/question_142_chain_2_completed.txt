Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about the density matrix of a qubit. The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). And the question is asking about its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are A to D, each with different coordinates.

Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. For a pure state, the density matrix is a projector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. But this ρ looks like a mixture because it's a sum of two projectors each multiplied by 1/2. So this must be a mixed state, right?

Wait, I think that for a qubit, the density matrix is a 2x2 matrix. The general form is ρ = [[a, b], [c, d]], where a, b, c, d are elements. And for a qubit, these are related to the Bloch vector components. Oh right, the Bloch sphere representation. The density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector r and the identity matrix.

The standard parametrization for a qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ represents the Pauli matrices. So that would be (I + (r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z )) / 2.

Given that ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2, let me compute that. Let's expand each term. |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So ρ = (I)/2.

So ρ is (I + 0·σ)/2. That means the Bloch vector r is zero. Because r·σ would be zero, so ρ is just (I + 0)/2 = I/2. So the Bloch vector components (r_x, r_y, r_z) are all zero. So the point is at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Wait, but the options given don't have (0,0,0) as the only possibility. Let me check the options again. Option C is (0,0,0), which would correspond to the completely mixed state, which makes sense because in this case, the density matrix is I/2, the maximally mixed state. So the point should be at the center of the Bloch sphere.

So the geometrical position is (0,0,0). Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

Expanding the terms, \(\left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right|\) is the matrix \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\), and \(\left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right|\) is the matrix \(\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\). Adding these gives the identity matrix \(I = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\). Thus, \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\), which corresponds to the maximally mixed state.

For a qubit, the density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\), it is clear that the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) must be zero, i.e., \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere, representing the maximally mixed state.

From the given options, the correct geometrical position is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\)**  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\)**  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\)**  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\)**  

The correct answer is **C**, as the density matrix corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Answer: C
