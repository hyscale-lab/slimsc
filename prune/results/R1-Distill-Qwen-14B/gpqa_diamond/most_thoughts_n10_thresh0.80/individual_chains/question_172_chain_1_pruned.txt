Okay, so I've got this question about stars and iron atoms. Hmm, let me try to think it through. The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And since the photospheres are in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), I guess I need to use some sort of thermal equilibrium formula here.

Wait, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is something like N_2/N_1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

In this case, star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So let me think, the excited state is higher than the ground state, right? So N_high for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Or wait, wait. Wait, the question says the energy difference is the same for both stars, right? Because it's the same specific energy level difference. So the energy difference ΔE is the same for both stars.

So for star_1, let's denote N1 as the number of excited atoms, and for star_2, N2. The ratio N1/N2 is 2, because star_1's atoms are twice as excited. Or wait, wait a second. The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2. So that would mean that the population in that higher energy level is higher in star_1. So N_high1 = 2 * N_high2. Because star_1's atoms are more excited, so more in the higher state.

But wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me rephrase. The population in a specific energy level is higher for star_1. So the ratio N1_high / N2_high = 2? Or is it that the excitation is twice as much, meaning something else? Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the ratio of the populations.

So according to the Boltzmann factor, the ratio of populations between two energy levels is given by:

N_high / N_low = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

But wait, wait, no. The Boltzmann factor for the ratio of higher to lower energy states is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference, E_high - E_low.

Wait, no, I think I have the formula backwards. Hmm. Oh right, the formula is N2/N1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T)), where N2 is the population of the higher energy level, and N1 is the lower. So if the higher level is less populated, that ratio is less than 1, which makes sense because exp of a negative number is less than 1.

Wait, but in our case, the ratio is N1_high / N2_high = 2. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says, the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So, the number of atoms in that higher energy level is twice as much as in star_2. So for star_1, N_high_1 = 2 * N_high_2.

So, the ratio (N_high_1)/(N_high_2) = 2.

But wait, the ratio of the excited levels would depend on their respective temperatures. Because each star's photosphere has its own temperature. So for each star, the ratio of the excited level to the ground level (assuming that's what's being compared) would be:

For star_1: N_high1 / N_low1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2: N_high2 / N_low2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But wait, the question doesn't mention the low level. Oh wait, perhaps the problem is considering the ratio N_high / N_low
