Okay, so I have this question about Michael addition reactions, and I need to figure out the products for each of the three reactions given. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down.

First, I remember that the Michael addition is a 1,4-addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile is usually enolate, which attacks the beta carbon of the enone or similar compound.

There are three parts to this problem: reactions A, B, and C. Let's tackle them one by one.

Starting with Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt and EtOH. So, NaOEt is a base, probably deprotonating something to form an enolate.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it can form an enolate. The structure of dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH-. When deprotonated, it becomes a strong nucleophile, the enolate. The other reagent is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester. Its structure would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, the substituent is at the 3-position, so maybe it's CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? Hmm, actually, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituent at carbon 2. So it's CH2=CH-(p-tolyl)CO-OCH3? No, wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-O-. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon. Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? No, that wouldnâ€™t make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: the acrylate group is CH2=CHCO-O-. The "3" position would be the third carbon from the ester. So numbering from the ester: O-CO-OCH3, then CH2-CH2-... Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try drawing it.

The acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the ester is on C3. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be a substituent on C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)O-OCH3? No, that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=C(CO-OCH3)-p-tolyl? No, that seems off. Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe it's (E)-m
