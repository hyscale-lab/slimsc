Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which theory never needs regularization when looking at high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and Classical Electrodynamics (CED).

I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like infinite terms that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math manageable and give finite, physical results. So, theories that are "renormalizable" can handle these issues, but some might require regularization to begin with.

Starting with option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity and is finite, meaning it doesn't have the same kind of divergences that other quantum field theories do. Because strings are extended objects, maybe their interactions are better behaved. So I'm guessing superstring theory doesn't require regularization as much because it's free from certain divergences.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics. QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I remember that QCD has something called asymptotic freedom, where quarks behave as almost free particles at high energies. But wait, does that mean it's free from needing regularization? Or does it still have issues? I think QCD is a renormalizable theory, which means it doesn't require non-perturbative methods like regularization as much as other theories might. But wait, wait—I thought that in practice, QCD calculations do need renormalization, but maybe they don't require the same kind of severe regularization as non-renormalizable theories. Hmm, not entirely sure here.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics. QED is a well-known renormalizable theory. But wait, even though it's renormalizable, isn't regularization a step used in calculating its processes? Like, you have to regularize (maybe using a cutoff or dimensional regularization) to handle the infinities before renormalizing. So QED does require regularization steps during calculations. So if the question is about whether it ever needs regularization, then yes, QED does, so probably not the answer.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. CED is the classical theory, dealing with Maxwell's equations. Since it's a classical theory, it doesn't involve quantum effects. So divergences like infinite charges or fields at points are an issue, but regularization is a quantum field concept. So in CED, you don't use regularization because it's a classical theory — you might instead deal with things like the principle of superposition or other classical methods. So CED doesn't require regularization because it doesn't use the same quantum techniques. But wait, the question is about high energies. Wait, classical theories don't have the same issues as quantum ones. So perhaps CED doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory at all.

Wait, but the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So which one never needs it, even at high energies.

So thinking again: QED requires regularization as part of the renormalization process. QCD, being renormalizable, I think still needs regularization in calculations, perhaps. Superstring theory is supposed to be free from divergences,
