Okay, so I have this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

So the question gives two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, regular Newtonian mechanics don't apply; I need to use special relativity formulas.

First part is the relative speed. Wait, how do you find the relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds? I think it's not just subtracting their velocities because that would give something like 0.1c, but relativistic addition is more involved. Oh right, the formula for adding velocities in special relativity is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me make sure I get the signs right. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Calculating the numerator: 0.6c -0.5c = 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is roughly 0.14c. Oh, so the relative speed is approximately 0.14c.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c as their relative speed. So I'll have to check the energy part to see which one is correct.

The second part is the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has their own relativistic energy, so I need to calculate the rest mass energy plus their kinetic energy, but wait, in relativity, the total energy is given by gamma multiplied by m c squared.

So for each astronaut, their energy is gamma * m c². So I'll compute each one's gamma factor.

For the first astronaut: mass is 2m, speed is 0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c²)) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E1 = gamma1 * (2m) c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.25)) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * (3m) c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². Hmm, that's approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking back at the options, option C says v_rel = 0.14c and E=5.96 mc². That matches. Option D has E=5 mc², which seems a bit low. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, let me double-check the relative speed calculation. Using the formula, v_rel = (0.6c -0.5c)/(1 - (0.6*0.5 c²)/ c² ) = (0.1c) / (1 -0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So that's correct.

So the options are C and B have 0.14c and 0.1c. B's energy is 4.96, which doesn't match our calculation. So yeah, C is the right choice.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by the formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\).

#### For the first astronaut:
- Mass = \(2m\), speed = \(0.6c\)
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut:
- Mass = \(3m\), speed = \(0.5c\)
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
