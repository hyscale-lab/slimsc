Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with infinities that come up in calculations, like loop integrals. These infinities are a problem because they make the theories non-renormalizable, meaning we can't just calculate finite results without some kind of cutoff or regularization method.

Wait, but not all theories need this. Let me think about each option.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a candidate for a theory that doesn't require regularization. Because in string theory, particles are not point-like but rather extended as strings. This might change how divergences appear. I've heard that string theory might be finite, meaning it doesn't have the same kinds of divergences as other quantum field theories. So regularization isn't needed because the theory is already finite.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I remember that QCD does require renormalization because of the presence of Landau poles and other divergences. Also, the running of the coupling constant, which is handled via renormalization group equations, suggests that the theory needs to deal with these infinities.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED definitely requires regularization and renormalization. The famous example is the calculation of the electron's mass and charge, where the theory predicts that without renormalization, the charge would be infinite. So they have to subtract these infinities to get meaningful results.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Classical theories don't have the same issues as quantum ones because they don't involve the same kind of divergences. In classical electromagnetism, you can have things like point charges which lead to problems with self-energy, but these are more conceptual and not part of the mathematical framework needing regularization. So classical theories don't require regularization because they don't deal with the same divergent integrals that quantum theories do. Wait, but the question is about high energies. Oh, right, classical theories don't have quantum effects, so they don't require regularization techniques. Because regularization is a quantum field theory thing.

Wait, but the question is about which theory never requires regularization at high energies. So we're looking for a theory that doesn't have divergences even when energy scales are high.

Wait, but wait. Quantum theories often have issues at high energies because higher energies correspond to shorter distance scales (since E ~ 1/Î»), so you're probing the theory at scales where divergences are more severe. So a theory that is finite (like string theory) wouldn't need regularization because it doesn't have those divergences.

So let's think: which of these options doesn't require regularization. So the answer is either A or D.

Because QED and QCD require renormalization, they need regularization as part of that process. So options A and D are the candidates.

Wait, but can classical theories have high-energy issues? Well, classical electrodynamics can have problems like the radiation reaction, leading to issues with self-energy, but those are handled differently, not via regularization. So in the
