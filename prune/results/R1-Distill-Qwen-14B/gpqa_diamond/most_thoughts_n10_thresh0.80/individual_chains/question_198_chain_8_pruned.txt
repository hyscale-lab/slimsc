Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says we have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution.

Hmm. So I think this involves calculating the distribution of different Co-SCN complexes and then finding the percentage of the one that's blue, which I believe is the one with two SCN- ions, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ or something similar. Wait, wait, the question mentions "dithiocyanato" which implies two SCN ligands. So I think the complex in question is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

Stability constants, β, are given for each complex. The stability constant (formation constant) indicates how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So for each complex, βn is the equilibrium constant for the formation of [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n), I suppose.

Wait, let me think about that. For Co(II), which is Co^2+. Each SCN^- is -1 charge. So for [Co(SCN)_n]^(charge), the charge would be 2+ - n*(1−) because each SCN^- is contributing -1. Wait no, wait: Co^2+ has a charge of +2. Each SCN^- is -1. So if you have n SCN- ligands, the total charge from them is -n. So the overall charge of the complex would be +2 - (n * -1) = +2 +n? Wait no, that can't be right because that would mean the complex would have a positive charge, but SCN- is a ligand, so the complex would have a charge based on Co^2+ plus the sum of the ligand charges.

Wait, no. Let's think again. Each SCN^- is -1. So if a Co^2+ is surrounded by n SCN^- ions, the formula would be [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n}, right? Because Co^2+ is +2, and each SCN- is -1. So n SCN^- contribute -n. So total charge is 2 - n × 1 = 2−n. So for n=1, it would be [Co(SCN)]^+, n=2 would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (neutral?), n=3 would be [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and n=4 would be [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Wait, but stability constants are for the formation of the complexes. So the formation of [Co(SCN)]^+ (n=1) would have β1 as 9. [Co(SCN)_2]^0
