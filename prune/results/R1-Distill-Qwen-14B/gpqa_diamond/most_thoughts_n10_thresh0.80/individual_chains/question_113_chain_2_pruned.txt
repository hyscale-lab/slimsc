Okay, so I've got this problem to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Hmm, let me start by breaking down each piece of information given.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in FTIR usually indicate O-H stretching. So, this makes me think the compound has either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid group. But wait, I also see strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 peak is typical for a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester), and 1650 might be an aromatic ring or conjugated carbonyl. Maybe it's an ester since esters have both a carbonyl and an ether linkage, which might relate to the 1650 peak.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum has peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has an alkene group, maybe part of a ring or a substituent.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. I need to think about what that could be. Common fragments at 45 include things like (CH3)2CHO- or maybe something else. Wait, 45 is a common mass for a fragment from a ketone or an ester. Let me think: 45 could be a CH3CO group (like acetate) because CH3CO is 45 (12*2 + 1*3 + 16= 24+3+16=43? Wait, no, acetate is (CH3COO-) which is 60. Hmm, maybe I'm confused here. Oh wait, maybe it's a CH2CH3 group? No, that's 29. Alternatively, maybe a COOCH2CH3 fragment? No, that's more than 45. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a smaller part, like a methyl ester. Wait, let me think again. The molecular formula is one of the options, which are all C6H something O. So maybe the molecule is an ester, like methyl something.

Wait, what's the possible molecular formula. Let's look at the options: the options are C6H12O2
