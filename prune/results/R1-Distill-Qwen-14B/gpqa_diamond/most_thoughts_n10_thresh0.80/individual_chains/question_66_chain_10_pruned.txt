Okay, so I've got this physics question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, so I remember that SMEFT is a framework where we write down all possible operators allowed by the symmetries of the Standard Model. But wait, what symmetries are those? Oh right, the Standard Model has certain gauge symmetries, like SU(2) and U(1), but also some global symmetries.

Wait, and when we talk about effective field theories, operators are classified by their dimension and the symmetries they respect. So all the operators in SMEFT must be compatible with the symmetries that the Standard Model has, otherwise they would have been forbidden.

Wait, but wait. Let's go through each symmetry one by one.

1. Lorentz Symmetry: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, right? Because the Standard Model is Lorentz symmetric, so the effective theory must also respect Lorentz symmetry. So any operator in SMEFT has to transform correctly under Lorentz transformations. So yes, this is a symmetry that must be respected.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So if a theory is Lorentz invariant and translation invariant, it has Poincare symmetry. The Standard Model is Poincare symmetric
