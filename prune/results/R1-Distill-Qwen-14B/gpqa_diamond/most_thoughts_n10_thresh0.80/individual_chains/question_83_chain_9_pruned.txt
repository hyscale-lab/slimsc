Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question involves diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, so when it's titrated with a strong base like NaOH, the reaction should form acetate ions and water.

Alright, the problem says we have 20.00 cm³ (which is 20 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So, the first thing I should do is find the new concentration after dilution.

Dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 mL. V2 is 20 + 20 =40 mL. So M2 = (0.05 M *20 mL)/40 mL. Let me calculate that: 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, we're titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. The first part of the question is the pH at 25% titration. Wait, 25% of what? I think it refers to 25% of the equivalence point volume. So I need to find the equivalence point first.

The equivalence point in a titration is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let's find the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. The volume is 40 mL, which is 0.040 L. Moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Wait, wait. Wait, 0.025 * 0.04 is 0.001 mol? Let me check: 0.04 *0.025 is 0.001, yes.

NaOH is 0.1 M. So to find the volume needed at equivalence: moles NaOH = 0.001 mol. Volume = moles / concentration. So 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL. So the equivalence point is when 10 mL of NaOH has been added.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of 10 mL is 2.5 mL. So at 2.5 mL of NaOH added, what's the pH?

Let me think about the reaction. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacts with NaOH (OH-) to form acetate (CH3COO^-) and water. The reaction is: CH3COOH + OH^- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, before any NaOH is added, the solution is 0.025 M acetic acid. But when we add 2.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH, it will neutralize some of the acetic acid.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.0025 L * 0.1 M = 0.00025 mol.

So, since acetic acid is 0.001 mol, after reaction, the moles of CH3COOH will be 0.001 -0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. The moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed will be 0.00025 mol.

Wait, but when we mix the solutions, the total volume increases. The initial volume is 40 mL (acetic acid + water), and we're adding 2.5 mL of NaOH. So total volume is 42.5 mL.

So the concentrations will be:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Since this is a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

First, I need the pKa. Given Ka = 1.85e-5. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. Log(1.85)=0.267, so 1.85e-5 is 5.267 → so pKa is 4.737, approximately 4.74.

Now, [A^-] is 0.005882 M, [HA] is 0.017647 M.

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is about -0.477.

So pH = 4.74 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.263. So around 4.26.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26; 8.52. Option D is 4.57; 6.92. Hmm, but maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I should compute more accurately.

Let me recalculate the concentrations:

Total volume is 40 +2.5=42.5 mL=0.0425 L.

Moles of CH3COOH after reaction: 0.001 -0.00025 =0.00075 mol. So concentration is 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

Moles of acetate: 0.00025, so concentration is 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.3333.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log(1/3) → since log(1/3) = log(0.3333) = -0.4771.

pKa is 4.737, so pH is 4.737 -0.4771 ≈4.2599 ≈4.26. So that's correct.

Now, the second part is the pH at equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so the solution will be basic.

The acetate ions will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

To find the pH, I need to calculate the concentration of acetate ions at equivalence.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid (0.001 mol) has been converted to acetate. The total volume is 40 mL (original solution) +10 mL (NaOH) =50 mL=0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 =0.02 M.

Now, the hydrolysis equation for acetate:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb can be found from Kw/Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈5.405e-10.

The expression for Kb is [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

Assuming x is the [OH^-], and initial concentration is 0.02 M.

So Kb ≈ x² / (0.02 -x). Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈0.02.

So x² = Kb *0.02 → x² ≈5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11.

So x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

[OH^-] ≈1.04e-5 → pOH = -log(1.04e-5) → log(1.04)=0.017, so 5 -0.017=4.983 → pOH≈4.983.

pH =14 -4.983≈9.017.

Wait, but the answer options don't have anything near 9. Let me check the options:

Option A: 4.26;8.52 → nope, equivalence is higher.

Option B: 3.17;6.73 → no.

Option C:4.73;7.00 → no.

Option D:4.57;
