Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and it's given by c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). Oh right, S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So S looks like this:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Wait, that looks familiar. I think this is the Pauli Y matrix, but let me check. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. The σy matrix is [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ] exactly. So S is the σy matrix.

Ay is c times σy, so let me write that out. c is h/(4π). So Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy. So the matrix form of Ay would be:

[ (h/(4π)) * 0   (h/(4π)) * (-i) ]
[ (h/(4π)) * i    (h/(4π)) * 0 ]

Which simplifies to:

[ 0           -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)     0        ]

Now, the problem asks to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Oh right, eigenvalues are found by solving Ay |φ> = a |φ>, where a is the eigenvalue.

But wait, since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, I can find its eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0. Let's set that up.

The matrix (Ay - a I) looks like:

[ -a       -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)   -a      ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) ].

Calculating each part: (-a)(-a) is a². The other term is (-i*h/(4π))*(i h/(4π)) = (-i)(i) * (h²/(16 π²)). 

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i²) which is -(-1) = 1. So that term becomes 1 * (h²/(16 π²)). So the determinant is a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

So setting that to zero: a² = h²/(16 π²). Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4 π). Wait a minute, wait. Because sqrt( (h²)/(16 π²) ) is h/(4π). And because both plus and minus, so the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check each one. 

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). Hmm, but wait, our eigenvalues are purely real, right? Because the matrix Ay is Hermitian. Wait, is Ay Hermitian?

Wait, σy is Hermitian because its conjugate transpose is itself. Let me check: σy's conjugate transpose swaps the off-diagonal elements and takes the complex conjugate. The (1,2) element is -i, its conjugate is i, and in the (2,1) position. So σy is indeed Hermitian. So Ay is c times Hermitian, so it's Hermitian if c is real. Since c is h/(4π), which is real, Ay is Hermitian. So eigenvalues should be real. So option A talks about imaginary parts, which suggests the eigenvalues are complex, which can't be right. So option A is wrong.

Option B says the imaginary parts are ±1/2 and real parts ±1. But again, since the eigenvalues are real, this can't be right. So B is also wrong.

So probably the correct eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are real. Now, looking at the options, none of the first two options match this. Wait, looking again—Option A has the real part as h/(4π) or -h/(4π), which is correct for the real parts, but it's saying the imaginary parts are ±2πh, which isn't the case. So A is incorrect.

Moving on to the other options. Option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of the Z-component Az. Hmm, wait, for angular momentum operators, [A², A_i] =0 for any i, so eigenfunctions of A_x, A_y, and A_z are generally not the same unless for specific cases. But here, the question is about whether φ is an eigenfunction of A².

Wait, but since A is the intrinsic angular momentum, which is a vector operator. A² would be the square of the magnitude. Since the operator Ay is part of the angular momentum, A² commutes with Ay. So any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². So option C is correct in that sense. But does it also say that it's not an eigenfunction of Az? Well, that's true—eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az because the operators do not commute. So option C's statement is correct.

Wait, but let me think again. If a state is an eigenstate of Ay, can it be an eigenstate of Az? No, because Ay and Az don't commute. So their eigenfunctions are different. So the statement that the eigenfunction of Ay is not an eigenfunction of Az is correct. So option C's statement is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, the basis functions for a 2x2 matrix are typically the standard basis vectors, like |0> and |1>. But for Pauli matrices, the eigenvectors are not the standard basis vectors. For example, for σy, the eigenvectors are |+> and |-> in the y-direction. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are not the same as the standard basis functions of the matrix. So option D is incorrect.

Wait, but wait, the operator Ay is 2x2, so its eigenvectors form a basis for C^2. But the question is whether the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. The basis functions of the matrix operator are probably the standard basis vectors, but eigenvectors might not be aligned with them. So I think option D is incorrect.

So the correct statements would be option C: the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Wait another thing, let me think about option D again. The eigenfunctions are the basis for the operator? Well, any 2x2 matrix's eigenfunctions (if they are 2D) can form a basis. But the statement says "the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." I'm not entirely sure about that wording. Maybe they are referring to the eigenbasis of Ay. So the eigenvectors would form a basis for the space, but they might not be the standard basis. So the statement in D says "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay." Hmm, I think that's correct because the eigenvectors are a basis for the space of the operator. But wait, the matrix is 2x2, so any basis for 2D space is acceptable.

Wait, but the standard basis (e.g., (1,0) and (0,1)) are basis functions for the matrix. But the eigenvectors of Ay are different from the standard basis. So option D would be incorrect because the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are not the same as the standard basis vectors. So D is incorrect.

So putting it all together, the correct option is C. Because the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.


To solve the problem, we analyze the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix:

\[
S = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Thus, the matrix representation of \( A_y \) is:

\[
A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)
The eigenvalues \( a \) of \( A_y \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \). Substituting \( A_y \), the matrix \( A_y - aI \) is:

\[
A_y - aI = 
\begin{bmatrix}
-a & -\frac{i h}{4\pi} \\
\frac{i h}{4\pi} & -a
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The determinant is:

\[
\det(A_y - aI) = a^2 - \left(\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)^2.
\]

Setting this equal to zero gives:

\[
a^2 = \left(\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)^2 \implies a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( a = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( a = -\frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real. This eliminates options A and B, as they incorrectly describe the eigenvalues as having imaginary parts.

### Step 2: Eigenvectors and Basis Functions
The eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) of \( A_y \) are not the same as the standard basis vectors \( (1,0) \) and \( (0,1) \). Instead, they are specific linear combinations that satisfy \( A_y |\phi\rangle = a |\phi\rangle \). Therefore, option D is incorrect because the eigenfunctions are not the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \).

### Step 3: Commutativity with \( A^2 \) and \( A_z \)
The operator \( A_y \) commutes with \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) because \( A^2 \) is the magnitude squared of the angular momentum vector and commutes with all components of angular momentum. However, \( A_y \) does not commute with \( A_z \), meaning that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) cannot simultaneously be eigenfunctions of \( A_z \). This makes option C correct, as it states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \).

### Conclusion
The correct statement is that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \).
