Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

So, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, and the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The question is asking by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. I think I remember that the luminosity of a star relates to its radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

Since both stars are black bodies, we can use this formula. But wait, what about the velocities? Oh, radial velocity might relate to the Doppler effect. Because when a star is moving, it can shift the observed wavelength due to the Doppler shift. But the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, so the observed wavelength maximum is the same for both stars.

Wait, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same observed λ_max, that would imply their temperatures are the same? But wait, no, because if the star is moving, the observed wavelength would be Doppler shifted. So the actual temperature could be different, but the observed maximum is the same.

So for Star_2, which has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, the observed wavelength is shifted. Let me think about that. The Doppler effect formula is λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), but wait, v is a significant fraction of the speed of light, so maybe I should use the relativistic Doppler shift.

Wait, the speed of light is about 3e5 km/s, so 700 km/s is about 0.00233c. Hmm, maybe non-relativistic is okay, but perhaps better to use the exact formula.

Wait, the Doppler shift formula depends on whether the star is moving towards or away. Since the radial velocity is positive 700 for Star_2, it's moving towards us, so the observed wavelength would be blueshifted. But wait, the problem says they have the same observed wavelength maximum. So if Star_1 is at rest (v=0), its λ_max is b/T1. Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, so its observed λ_max would be λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )? Wait, no, wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the Doppler shift for wavelength is λ' = λ * sqrt( (1 + v/c)
