Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it correctly.

The question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. The key point is their apparent V magnitudes, because each instrument has a limit on how bright the stars can be for observation.

From the problem statement, I remember that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V mag. Wait, actually, the wording says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed," which I think means stars with apparent V magnitudes less than 17, because lower magnitudes are brighter. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, meaning less than 16 in apparent V.

Wait, wait. Wait, no, the exact wording is: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh, wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, I think I got that reversed. Because in astronomy, lower magnitude means brighter. So if a telescope can observe stars brighter than 17, that would mean it can see stars with V magnitude less than 17. Because 17 is fainter than, say, 15. So, I need to be careful here.

Wait, let me clarify: The question says, for ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So brighter than 17 mag in apparent V. But wait, brightness and magnitude are inversely related. So a star with a lower V magnitude is brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag in V, that would mean its V magnitude is less than 17. Because, for example, a V magnitude of 16 is brighter than 17. So yes, ESPRESSO can see stars with V less than 17.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So stars with V magnitudes less than 16 can be observed by HIRES.

Wait, but wait again. Because the way it's phrased is: "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So if a star is brighter than 17 (i.e., has a
