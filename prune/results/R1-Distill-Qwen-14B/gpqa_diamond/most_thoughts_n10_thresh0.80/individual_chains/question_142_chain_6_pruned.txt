Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see, the question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. 

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. I think this is a maximally mixed state. Because, for a qubit, the maximally mixed state is the completely depolarized state, which can be written as a diagonal matrix with 0.5 on the diagonal and 0 elsewhere. Oh right, so the density matrix would be [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

Now, the question is about its geometrical position in qubits space. I'm a bit confused about what that exactly means. Wait, I think qubit states are often represented on the Bloch sphere. So each qubit state can be mapped to a point on a unit sphere. But wait, the Bloch sphere is typically for pure states, right? So density matrices for mixed states are represented as points inside the Bloch sphere, with the completely mixed state being at the origin.

Wait, the Bloch vector. Oh yeah, for a single qubit, any state can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector and σ are the Pauli matrices. For a pure state |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, r would have a magnitude of 1, so it's on the Bloch sphere. For a mixed state, |r| would be less than 1, with the maximally mixed state (like this one) having r=0. Because when r is zero, the density matrix is (I)/2, which is exactly the case here.

So the vector r in this case is (0,0,0). Let's look at the options. Option C is (0,0,0), which must be the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check. Another approach: the density matrix for a maximally mixed state is (I)/2, which in terms of the Bloch sphere is the point at the center, so r=(0,0
