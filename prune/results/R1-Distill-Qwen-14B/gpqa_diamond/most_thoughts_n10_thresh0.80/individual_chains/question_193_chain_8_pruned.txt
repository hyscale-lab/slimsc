Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question says.

The question states that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the formula is N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So, I need to find the relationship between the number of stars and the distance r.

Hmm, I think I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in the position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the sun. The formula I remember is that distance (in parsecs) is approximately 1 divided by the parallax (in arcseconds). So, distance r ≈ 1 / plx. But wait, I'm not sure if that's exactly correct, but I think it's a starting point.

Wait, parallax plx is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1 / r. So, r = 1 / plx. So, plx and r are inversely proportional. So, plx = 1/r.

So the given relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Let me substitute plx with 1/r. So replacing plx, I get N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let's compute that.

(1/r)^5 is 1/(r^5), so 1 divided by that is r^5. So, 1/( (1/r)^5 ) = r^5. So, N is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but wait a second. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So, is this the total number of stars, or the number per unit distance?

Hmm, the way the question is phrased: "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)" — so I think it's about the number of stars per unit distance. Or perhaps the density of stars as a function of distance.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the differential. Because if N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars in a thin shell at radius r would be proportional to r^5. But the question is about per unit range of distance, so perhaps it's the differential, like the number of stars per unit volume, or per unit distance.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as a volume. Let me think. The number of stars in a spherical shell of radius r and thickness dr would be the surface area multiplied by the thickness and the number density.

Wait, no, maybe that's complicating things since the question is about a specific region of the sky, which is a thin slice, perhaps a cone or a section of the sky. So, maybe it's more about the number of stars within a certain distance range, like from r to r + dr, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, the number of stars as a function of distance could depend on how many stars are present at each distance. So, the relationship given is N ∝ 1/plx^5, and we need to find how N changes with r.

Wait, perhaps I should express N as a function of r. Since plx is inversely proportional to r, so plx = 1/r. So plx^5 = (1/r)^5 = 1/(r^5). So 1/(plx^5) = r^5. Therefore, N is proportional to r^5. So, as r increases, the number of stars increases as r^5.

But wait, that seems counterintuitive. If you go further away, stars become fainter and sparser. So why would the number of stars increase with distance? Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So, for a given region, as parallax decreases (because you're looking further away), the number of stars increases as 1/plx^5. So, when plx is small (distance is large), 1/plx^5 is large, so N is large. So more stars are observed at larger distances? That doesn't make much sense in the real universe because beyond a certain point, interstellar extinction would make stars less visible, but perhaps in this hypothetical scenario, that's how it behaves.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So, perhaps the number of stars per unit volume increases with r^5? Or maybe it's the number per unit distance, in a radial direction.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars in a given solid angle varies as 1/plx^5. So, for a star at distance r, the number of stars N per unit solid angle is proportional to 1/plx^5.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to approach this more methodically.

Given: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.
