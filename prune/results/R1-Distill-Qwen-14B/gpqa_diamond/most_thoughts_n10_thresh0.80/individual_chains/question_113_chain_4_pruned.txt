Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

So the question is about identifying an unknown compound using its spectroscopic data. The data given includes FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Let me start by breaking down each piece of data and see what I can deduce from it.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but waitâ€”the problem says "very broad," which makes me think of an alcohol's -OH stretch. Alternatively, if it were a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be even broader and maybe around 2500-3300, but I think the very broad part aligns more with -OH. Also, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, those are in the range of carbonyl groups. 1700 is typical for a ketone or aldehyde, but 1650 might suggest something else. Oh wait, maybe conjugated carbonyls or maybe an aromatic carbonyl or ester? Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl like a ketone with double bonds nearby. Wait, another thought: the combination of 1700 and 1650 could suggest a conjugated carbonyl, perhaps an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone. Because the carbonyl (C=O) would be around 1700, and the conjugated double bond (C=C) might have a peak around 1650. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester; esters typically have a carbonyl peak around 1740-1700. But the 1650 could be a conjugated double bond elsewhere in the molecule. Or perhaps a carbonyl and another functional group. I'm not entirely sure, but I'll mark that for now.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, so the compound has a double bond somewhere. That might help. So the structure probably has an alkene.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, 45 is a key mass. Let me think: common fragments. The mass 45 corresponds to, for example, (CH3)2O (which is 45: 2*1 + 12 +16=30? Wait, no, wait. (CH3)2O is 2*(CH3) + O: 2*(15) +16=46. Oh wait, 45. Maybe another fragment. Another possibility is a methyl group attached to something else. Wait, 45 is also the mass for a propyl group or maybe a ketone fragment. Let me think about possible fragments that sum to 45. Oh! Another thought: the methyl group attached to oxygen, like in an ester, like OCH3. Wait, OCH3 has a molecular weight of 31 (12 +16 +1*3=31). Hmm, not 45. What's 45? Let me calculate: 45 is 12*3 + 3*1 + 16*0? No, wait. Alternatively, maybe (CH2)2O is 44 (24 + 4 +16=44), so 45 would be that plus a hydrogen? Not quite. Or perhaps a fragment like CH2CH2O? No, that's same as above. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: common fragment ions. The m/z 45 could be from a ketone group. For example, if there's a (CH3)2CO group, which has a molecular weight of 58 (since (CH3)2CO is C3H6O, 3*12 +6*1 +16=36+6+16=58). But that's not 45. Wait, maybe the fragment is a smaller piece. Like, perhaps CH3CO would have a molecular weight of 43 (12+16+2*12 + 3*1? Maybe not. Wait, another idea: the fragment could be a ketene or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is CH2CH2O, but that's 44. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the 45 is from a CH3 group attached to something else. Wait, 45 could be CH3COOH (molecular weight 60?), but that's not 45. Wait, smaller. Wait, 45 could be a CH2CH2O group plus a methyl? Not sure. Perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH3CO- fragment, but 43 is the m/z for CH3CO (12+16 + 12 +1*2=42? Not quite. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: think of the possible molecular formulas and see what their possible fragments would be. Let me see the options again:

Options are:

A) C6H12O2

B) C6H10O

C) C6H10O2

D) C6H12O

So the molecular formulas are varying in O and H.

The mass spec shows a fragment at m/z=45. Let's think about each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Its molecular weight would be 6*12 +12*1 +2*16=72+12+32=116. So possible fragments would be up to that. A fragment of 45 could be, for example, a CH3CO group (43, but that's close to 45), but not exact. Alternatively, maybe a smaller fragment. Alternatively, perhaps the 45 comes from a CH2CH2O group (which is 44) plus a hydrogen, but that's speculative.

Option B: C6H10O. Molecular weight is 6*12 +10*1 +16=72+10+16=98. So fragment of 45 is possible, but I'm not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2. Molecular weight: 6*12 +10 + 2*16=72+10+32=114. So possible fragments.

Option D: C6H12O. Molecular weight: 6*12 +12 +16=72+12+16=100.

So, what's a common m/z 45 fragment? Wait, another thought: maybe the 45 is from a CH3CH2O group. Wait, CH3CH2O is (12*2 +6 +16) =24+6+16=46, which is close. Hmm, but that's 46, not 45. Alternatively, maybe a CH2O group, which is 30 (12+16 + 2*1=30). Not 45.

Wait, another idea: the mass 45 could be a ketone fragment. For example, acetone is (CH3)2CO, which has a molecular weight of 58, so when it breaks, perhaps a fragment of 45? Not exactly. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a methyl group attached to something else.

Wait, another angle: think about functional groups. The IR shows a broad peak at 3000 cm-1, which I think is an -OH. So the compound has an alcohol group or a carboxylic acid. But the peak is very broad, which is more typical of an alcohol's -OH. So the compound probably has an -OH group.

Then, the IR has peaks at 1700 and 1650. So that's two
