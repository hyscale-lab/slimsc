Okay, so I've got this question about particle physics and boson decay. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question gives a Lagrangian for the interaction between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I remember that in the Standard Model, the Higgs field couples to fermions, and that's what gives them mass. So this looks similar—maybe X is a Higgs-like boson here.

The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. I need to find which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order. Kinematically allowed means that the energy (mass) of X must be at least twice the mass of the particles it's decaying into because each fermion pair would require their rest mass energy.

So first, I should figure out what fermions are involved in the interaction. The Lagrangian has ψ_f, which I think refers to different types of fermions. The index f probably stands for the type of fermion, like up, down, strange, etc.

Wait, but the Lagrangian is written as -λf ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh, wait, maybe λf is a coupling constant for each fermion species. So X couples to all these fermions. So the possible decay products would be any fermion-antifermion pair that X can decay into.

But the mass of X is 6 GeV. So for each possible fermion pair, I need to check if 2 * m_fermion ≤ 6 GeV.

Let me list the masses of the known fermions. I think:

- Up quark: about 2 MeV (so 0.002 GeV)
- Down quark: similar, maybe 3-5 MeV (0.003-0.005 GeV)
- Strange quark: around 95-100 MeV (0.095-0.1 GeV)
- Charm quark: about 1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark: around 4.5-5 GeV
- Top quark: way too heavy, about 173 GeV, way above 6 GeV.
- Tau lepton: around 1.78 GeV
- Muon: 0.105 GeV
- Electron: 0.0005 GeV (so negligible)

So the possible fermion pairs that X can decay into must have each fermion's mass less than 3 GeV each (since 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV). So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be a decay product.

Looking at the fermions:

- Up quark: 0.002 GeV → yes
- Down: 0.005 GeV → yes
- Strange: 0.1 GeV → yes, because 0.1 <3
- Charm: 1.5 GeV → 1.5 <3 → yes
- Bottom: 4.5 GeV → 4.5 >3 → no
- Top: way too heavy, but X is only 6 GeV, so no
- Tau: 1.78 GeV → yes, since 1.78 <3
- Electron: yes (but negligible)
- Muon: 0.105 GeV → yes

But wait, X is a boson, so it can't decay into a single fermion—it needs a pair, like ff̄. So for each fermion f, if 2m_f ≤ m_X, then X can decay into f and f̄.

Wait, no, it's 2m_f ≤ m_X. So for each f, m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So let's go through each possible fermion:

Electron: m=0.0005 GeV. 2m=0.001 GeV <6 GeV → allowed. So e+ e- is possible.

Muon: m≈0.105 GeV. 2m≈0.21 <6 → allowed. So mu+ mu- is allowed.

Tau: m=1.78 GeV. 2m=3.56 GeV >6 GeV? Wait, 1.78 *2 =3.56 GeV. So 3.56 GeV is less than 6 GeV. Oh wait, 1.78 *2 is 3.56, which is less than 6. So yes, tau pair is allowed. Because 3.56 <6. So tau+ tau- is allowed.

Charm quark: m≈1.5 GeV. 2m=3 GeV. 3 <6 → yes. So c c̄ is allowed.

Strange quark: m≈0.1 GeV. 0.2 <6, yes. s s̄.

Up, down: same, way under. So u ū, d d̄ are allowed.

Wait, what about bottom quark? m=4.5 GeV. 2m=9 GeV >6 → not allowed. So no b b̄.

Top quark is too heavy. So no t t̄.

So possible decay channels are:

e+ e-
mu+ mu-
tau+ tau-
c c̄
s s̄
u ū
d d̄

Wait, but what about the charged leptons? Tau is allowed, so tau+ and tau- as a pair would require 2 * 1.78 = ~3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So allowed.

Similarly, mu+ mu- and e+ e- are allowed.

So looking at the options:

Option A: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

But wait, b has a mass of 4.5 GeV. 2m=9 GeV>6 GeV, so b b̄ is not allowed. So option A includes b b̄ which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X→ c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

This includes all the allowed fermions except for b, which isn't allowed. So option B is possible.

Option C: X→ c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, t t̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

But t has m=173 GeV, so 2m is way above 6. So t t̄ is not allowed. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: X→ b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Again, b is too heavy, so D is incorrect.

So the correct option is B, which includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e, but not b or t.

Wait, but looking back, the question says "the lowest order", so maybe some higher-order decays are excluded but the question is about kinematical allowability, not decay rates.

So the only thing is: which options list all the possible allowed decay modes.

So the correct answer should be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the given interaction Lagrangian. The Lagrangian indicates that \( X \) couples to fermions, and the decay channels depend on whether the total mass of the fermion-antifermion pair is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq m_X \).

   - Electron (\( e \)): \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_e = 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).

   - \( X \rightarrow t \bar{t} \): Not allowed (top quark pair, \( 2m_t > m_X \)).

3. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
