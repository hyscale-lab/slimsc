Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, relativistic speeds... that means I can't just use classical mechanics; I have to use special relativity equations.

Alright, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. So, astronaut A is 2m moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is 3m moving at 0.5c. Wait, but when they're moving relative to each other, I think I need to calculate the relative speed using the velocity addition formula from relativity.

Wait, the first part is to find the relative speed between them. So, in the rest frame of one astronaut, what is the speed of the other? Let me think about how the velocity addition formula works. The formula is (u' - v) / (1 - (u'v)/(c²)), where u' is the velocity of the object in the original frame, and v is the velocity of the original frame relative to the rest frame.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. Let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c relative to the lab frame. From A's perspective, the lab is moving at -0.6c. So, what is the velocity of astronaut B as observed from A's frame? Because astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the lab frame.

So, using the velocity addition formula, u = (u' - v) / (1 - (u'v)/(c²)), where u' is the velocity of B in lab frame (0.5c), and v is the velocity of the lab frame relative to A, which is -0.6c? Or wait, no, wait. Wait, from A's frame, the lab is moving at -0.6c. So from A's perspective, the lab is moving at -0.6c, so what's B's velocity in A's frame?

Wait, let me rephrase. The velocity of B as seen from the lab is 0.5c. The lab is moving at -0.6c relative to A. So, to find the velocity of B in A's frame, u, I can plug into the formula: u = (u' - v)
