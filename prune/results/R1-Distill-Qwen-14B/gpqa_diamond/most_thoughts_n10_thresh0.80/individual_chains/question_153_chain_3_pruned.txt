Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about the Michael addition reaction, which I remember is a type of conjugate addition where a nucleophile attacks the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. I need to figure out the products for each and then match them with the options provided.

First, let me take a deep breath and tackle each part one by one. I'll write down the given information and think through each reaction step.

Starting with Reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). I recall that NaOEt is a strong base, so it might deprotonate a compound to form an enolate. 

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diester, and under basic conditions, it can form an enolate. The structure of dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOEt)2. When the base deprotonates it, the enolate would attack the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (the acrylate) in a conjugate addition.

The acrylate here is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of this is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 with the E configuration, but the substituents are on the double bond. Wait, no, wait. The formula is written as methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl) would mean the substituent is on the third carbon? Wait, let me think. The structure of acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. So, the substituent is on the double bond. For methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, wait, maybe I got it wrong. Alternative way: The acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but with a substituent at the alpha position. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. Wait, no, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the third carbon, which is the same as the carbonyl group. Hmm, maybe it's CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3? No, wait, perhaps it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Or maybe it's (E)-CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCOOCH3? Wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, maybe I should draw this.

Wait, the correct structure for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl) would imply that on the third carbon of the acrylate, which is the carbonyl carbon. So that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is on the double bond. Maybe the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. But wait, that would be 2-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the substituent is on the double bond. So methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCOOCH3? No, that's four carbons. Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylic acid methyl ester, which would be CH
