Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR and reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, so let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. Normally, hydrogen degrees are 2n+2. So 2*8 +2 = 18. Subtracting 9 gives 9, but wait, I have to account for the other atoms. Oh right, each double bond or ring is a degree. So subtracting 1 for each N and O doesn't contribute, but wait, actually for the formula, the calculation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, maybe I should do it the other way. So for C8H9NO:

Degrees of Unsaturation = (2*8 +2 -9 -1)/2 = (18 -10)/2 = 8/2 =4. So four degrees. That could be like three rings and a double bond, but more likely a couple rings and double bonds. Or maybe a benzene ring (which is 3 degrees) plus a double bond (1) and a ring (another 0? No, benzene is 3). So maybe one benzene ring (3) and a double bond (1) and maybe an amine or something else.

Wait, the NMR data is given. Let's look at that. The 1H NMR shows:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

So what do these signals indicate? 

9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, and a triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Or wait, noâ€”wait, a triplet for one proton? That would mean it's coupling with two equivalent protons. Like being next to a CH2 group maybe.

Wait, but aldehyde protons are typically deshielded and appear as singlets, but sometimes if they are in a conjugated system, the coupling can split them. Maybe it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde? So the aldehyde is conjugated to a double bond. That would make sense. So the aldehyde proton would be part of a conjugated system, perhaps next to a CH2 group, but in that case, maybe it's a CH2-CHO group. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. The triplet for 1H at 9.72. So for one proton as a triplet. Let's think about possible structures. If it's an aldehyde, and perhaps adjacent to an oxygen. Wait, or maybe it's an enol structure, but I'm not sure.

Looking at the other signals: 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets each integrating 2H. Those are typical for aromatic protons. For example, a para-substituted benzene ring would have two doublets. So 6.98 and 6.51 could be two sets of aromatic protons. Let me think: in a para-substituted benzene, the protons are split into two doublets. So that would fit.

Then 6.27 is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests perhaps exchange with something else, like an -OH proton. But wait, in the molecular formula, there's an O. So maybe it's an -OH group. Alternatively, maybe it's an enol proton. Or perhaps it's a vinylic proton adjacent to an electronegative group.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That's more likely to be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O. For example, a CH2-O or CH2-N group. But looking at the molecular formula, we have an N. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So one N. So maybe a CH2 connected to an amine or an oxygen.

Putting this together: the compound has a benzene ring (from the aromatic signals), perhaps another aromatic group, maybe a substituent with CH2-O, and an aldehyde group.

Wait, considering the molecular formula, C8H9NO: if we have a benzene ring (C6H5), then perhaps an aldehyde (CHO), and a substituent with a CH2-O group, but wait, adding up: C6H5-CHO (which would be C7H6O), but we need C8H9NO. Hmm, perhaps more substituents.

Alternatively, maybe two benzene rings? Wait, the options have diphenyl groups. So perhaps the
