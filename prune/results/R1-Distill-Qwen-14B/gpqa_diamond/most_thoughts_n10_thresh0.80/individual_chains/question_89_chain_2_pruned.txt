Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand everything.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH, producing a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, which gives product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to form product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum. The options are A to D.

Hmm. I think I'll tackle each step one by one, starting from the reaction conditions and what each step might produce.

First step: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH. Wait, KOH is a strong base. In such conditions, dibromides often undergo elimination reactions, especially if they're vicinal dihalides. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in that structure.

When KOH is used, probably an E2 elimination happens. So, the two bromide groups leave, and the base abstracts a proton leading to the formation of a double bond. The product would be 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. But wait, the product is a light yellow solid, product 1. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol? Wait, no, KOH with dihalide might lead to elimination, not substitution. Because substitution would require a good nucleophile, but in this case, the structure is probably not conducive to SN2 reactions because adamantane is a bulky structure, so elimination is more likely.

So, product 1 is probably 1,3-adamantadiene. But wait, how many double bonds would that have? Since it's 1,3-dibromo, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe each Br leaves, but that would require two deprotonations. Wait, no, more likely, each Br is on adjacent carbons, so elimination would form a double bond between those two carbons.

Wait, the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is such that the two bromines are on adjacent carbons of the adamantane structure. So when KOH is used, each Br leaves, but since they're on adjacent carbons, the base could abstract a beta hydrogen leading to a double bond. So elimination would form 1,3-diene? Or perhaps 1,2-diene? Wait, that's a bit unclear.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclohexadiene. Alternatively, maybe the product is a diene. Let me think about the IR spectrum given for product 1. The IR shows a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm^−1. What's that? That's a carbonyl stretch, like a ketone or maybe an ester. But wait, product 1 is formed from elimination of HBr from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So that would produce a diene, but that doesn't have a carbonyl group. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. Since KOH is a strong base, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation. But wait, if it's a dihalide, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide, so elimination would form an alkene. But the IR shows a carbonyl, which suggests a ketone or similar. Oh wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, if KOH is in excess and heated, perhaps it's a double elimination. 1,3-dibromoadamantane could undergo two eliminations, but that doesn't directly give a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation leading to a conjugated diene, but that wouldn't explain the carbonyl peak. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the reaction isn't elimination but a nucleophilic
