Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think through this.

The question says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given as A_y = c · S. The constant c is h/(4π), right? And S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So S is a 2x2 matrix.

I remember that in quantum mechanics, the angular momentum operators are related to Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Oh wait, but S here looks familiar. Let me write down S:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i,  0]]

Wait, wait. The standard Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], right? So yes, S is the Pauli Y matrix. So S is sigma_y.

So A_y = c * sigma_y, where c is h/(4π). So A_y is a 2x2 matrix, let's compute it.

c = h/(4π). So A_y = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me compute each element. The (1,1) element is (h/(4π))*0 = 0. (1,2) is (h/(4π))*(-i) = -i h/(4π). Similarly, (2,1) is i h/(4π), and (2,2) is 0.

So A_y is:

[ [0, -i h/(4π)],
  [i h/(4π), 0] ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. The eigenvalues are found by solving det(A_y - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue.

The matrix (A_y - a I) is:

[ [-a, -i h/(4π) ],
  [i h/(4π), -a ] ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [(-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π))] = a² - [ (-i)(i) (h²)/(16 π²) ) ]

Wait, (-i)*(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1? Because i squared is -1. So (-i) * i = (-i^2) = 1. So the determinant becomes:

a² - [ (h²)/(16 π²) * 1 ) ] = a² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0

So a² = h²/(16 π²). Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, that's interesting. The eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers, right? Because the determinant equation gives a real solution. So the eigenvalues are real.

Wait, but I thought that angular momentum operators might have complex eigenvalues. Hmm, but since S is a Hermitian matrix (because it's sigma_y which is Hermitian), then A_y is c times a Hermitian matrix. So A_y should be Hermitian as well. Because c is real, right? Because h is Planck's constant, which is real.

So if A_y is Hermitian, its eigenvalues must be real. That makes sense. So the eigenvalues are real, ± h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check:

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ± h/(4π). Hmm, but the eigenvalues are real, so the imaginary part is zero. So Option A can't be right because their eigenvalues are complex, which contradicts the Hermitian nature of A_y.

Option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. Again, this suggests complex eigenvalues, which can't be right. So B is wrong.

Option C: eigenfunction of A_y is also eigenfunction of A^2, but not Az. Hmm. Let me think.

In quantum mechanics, the square of the angular momentum operator (A^2) commutes with the individual components (like A_x, A_y, A_z). So any eigenstate of A^2 and one component (like A_y) is also an eigenstate of the others, but that's only when considering the total angular momentum. Wait, but here, the operator is for the intrinsic spin, which is spin-1/2. So A^2 should be ( (ħ/2)^2 ) * (3) for spin-1/2? Wait, wait, no. Spin operators for a spin-1/2 particle: the square of the total spin is S(S+1)ħ², where S=1/2. So S(S+1) = (1/2)(3/2) = 3/4. So A^2 would be c² S^2, which would be (c²)(3/4)ħ²? Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, since A is proportional to S, A = c S, so A² = c² S². And S² for a spin-1/2 system is (3/4) ħ². Wait, but c is h/(4π). So A² = (h²/(16 π²)) * (3/4 ħ²) ?

Wait, perhaps that's getting too complicated. Let me think about the commutation relations. If I have [A_y, A²] = 0, then eigenfunctions of A_y are also eigenfunctions of A². Since A is c
