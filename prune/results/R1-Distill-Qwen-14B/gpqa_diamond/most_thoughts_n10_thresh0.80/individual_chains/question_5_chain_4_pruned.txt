Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll think through it step by step.

The problem is about a muon, which is like a heavier version of an electron, right? The operator is P, a vector operator, and we're looking for its eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Oh wait, so it's a spin-1/2 particle because the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, like for spin.

The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each given as (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So the operator P is probably the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. Let me write down each component:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So the operator vector P is in the x-z plane. The direction n is arbitrary in that plane, so it can be represented by angles θ and φ. Wait, but since it's in x-z, the angle φ is probably 0 or π/2 or something? Wait, no, because the x-z plane is such that the angle φ is measured from the x-axis, so any direction in x-z would have φ = 0 or π, but wait, no, the x-z plane is like the standard coordinate system where y is up, so any direction in x-z would have an angle θ measured from the x-axis towards the z-axis, meaning φ is 0. Wait, no, maybe not exactly. Let me think. Oh wait, no, in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So if the direction n is in the x-z plane, then the azimuthal angle φ is 0 or π. So for instance, if it's along the x-axis, φ=0, and θ=π/2. If it's along the z-axis, φ=0 and θ=0. So the direction n can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ?), wait no, the spherical coordinates are usually r, θ, φ where θ is the angle from the z-axis, and φ is the angle around the z-axis. So for a direction in x-z plane, φ can be 0 or π. So when in x-z, φ=0 or φ=π. Hmm.

But the problem says "along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane". Oh, so φ is 0, because any point in x-z plane has φ=0 or π, but wait, that's only if the point is on the x-axis or the negative x-axis, but wait, no, because the x-z plane is defined by y=0. So the direction can be anywhere in the x-z plane, which would mean φ is 0, but wait, no. Wait, the standard spherical
