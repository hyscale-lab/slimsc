Okay, so I have this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and symmetries that operators must respect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. The choices are A to D.

Wait, let's break down each symmetry. Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry. Oh right, because Poincare is the combination of Lorentz and translations. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But the question is about what must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with the Standard Model symmetries. So the operators must respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model. What are the SM's symmetries? Well, the SM has Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz, and also internal gauge symmetries. Wait, but the question is about which of these four (Lorentz, Poincare, CP, CPT) must be respected.

In the Standard Model, the gauge symmetry includes SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1), but that's not part of the options here. The options are about Lorentz, Poincare, etc.

Wait, the SM and thus SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry, because that's part of the foundation of relativity. So all the SMEFT operators must respect that. But wait, Poincare includes Lorentz, so if an operator respects Poincare, it also respects Lorentz. So if the question is about which are necessary, then Poincare would imply Lorentz. But the options are combinations of these.

Looking at the options, option A is 1 and 2, which are Lorentz and Poincare. But if an operator respects Poincare, it already respects Lorentz, so perhaps any operator that respects Poincare will automatically respect Lorentz. So maybe the correct answer requires that Poincare is included.

Wait, but the question is what must be respected by all operators. So SMEFT operators must respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model. The SM respects Poincare, which includes Lorentz. So all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry. Do they also have to respect CP and
