Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let's see what each step does.

First step: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240Â°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. Since there are two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in adamantane, this should form an alkene. The product would be 1,3-adamantadiene, I guess? Wait, no, wait. 1,3-dibromo would be on carbons 1 and 3 of adamantane. When KOH removes H from each adjacent carbon, the diene would form between carbons 1 and 2, and 3 and 4? Hmm, not sure about the structure, but let's think about the product.

The product 1 is a light yellow solid, which suggests it's an alkene. The NMR spectrum shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). Oh, wait, the IR has an absorbance at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Wait, so if product 1 has a carbonyl, that suggests a ketone or an ester or something. But the starting material was a dihalide. Producing a carbonyl from elimination? Oh wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh, wait, if it's a vicinal dihalide, when treated with a strong base like KOH, perhaps it's not elimination but dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene? But the product in this question has a carbonyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some other reaction? Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing an oxidation.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Vicinal dihalides with KOH can form alkenes via elimination. But if there's another reaction, like maybe the base is causing a different pathway. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more like a nucleophilic substitution, but with two leaving groups... No, wait, that's less likely. But for a vicinal dihalide, elimination would be more common.

Wait, but the product has a carbonyl. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the initial step is elimination to form an alkene, and then another reaction. But the initial product is the first product. So maybe the first reaction is elimination to form an alkene. But then, the IR shows a carbonyl. That doesn't fit, unless I'm missing something.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, with four cyclohexane rings fused together. The 1 and 3 positions are opposite each other on the adamantane structure. So when you have two bromines on 1 and
