Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is all about.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, the NMR data is given, so I need to interpret that first. The reagents it's reacted with are NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, followed by aqueous KOH and heat. So, I think I should figure out what each step does.

Let me start by looking at the NMR. The peaks are at 9.72 (t, 1H), which is probably a triplet. A triplet usually suggests coupling with two adjacent protons. 9.72 is a high value, maybe an aldehyde proton? Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. So, perhaps there's an aldehyde group here.

Then, 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). These look like two doublets each integrating to 2H. That reminds me of a para-substituted aromatic ring, like a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. The fact that they're doublets suggests coupling with adjacent protons, maybe on adjacent carbons. Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene, each substituent is opposite each other, so maybe these are from two different rings? Or perhaps it's a substituted benzene with two substituents.

The next peak is at 6.27 (bs, 2H). Broad singlet, integrating to 2H. Broad signals can mean exchangeable protons, like -OH groups, but this is a singlet. Alternatively, maybe some vinyl protons next to an electronegative group. Or maybe it's part of an aromatic ring, but I'm not sure.

Then, 3.66 (d, 2H), a doublet. This is probably a CH2 group adjacent to something, maybe an oxygen. Like OCH2 or something. The doublet suggests coupling to one neighboring proton. Wait, 2H, so maybe two protons on a CH2 group next to an oxygen. For example, in a structure like OCH2CH2... or maybe it's part of an ethyl group attached to an oxygen, but I'm not certain yet.

Putting this together, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2=10/2=5. So 5 degrees. That could be one ring (benzene, 3 degrees) plus a double bond and maybe an aldehyde (each is one degree). Alternatively, maybe a benzene ring with substituents and some other double bonds.

Looking back at the NMR, maybe the aldehyde is part of a side chain attached to a benzene ring. The 9.72 ppm is the aldehyde proton. The 3.66 ppm doublet (2H) would be adjacent to the aldehyde. So maybe the structure is something like benzaldehyde with a chain attached.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows two doublets each for 2H at around 7 ppm, which is typical for aromatic protons. If it's a para-substituted benzene, the two doublets might be from two different substituents. Wait, no, because para-substituted benzene would have two doublets each integrating to 2H for the two sets of equivalent protons.

Wait, maybe the compound has two benzene rings attached. Let me think. The molecular formula C8H9NO. If it's two benzene rings, each benzene is C6H5. So two benzene rings would be C12, but here it's C8, so that's not possible. Hmm
