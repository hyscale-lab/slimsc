Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says: Let |alpha> be the state describing an electron, proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So, that's the initial state. Then, we're asked to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, that means the matrix is a 2x2 since there are two eigenstates, up and down, right?

Wait, wait. Let me think. The operator's matrix is A with elements A_ij = hbar/2 when i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. So the matrix looks like:
[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0      ]

Oh, wait, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0 1],[1 0]], so if each element is (hbar/2), then A = (hbar/2) * X.

So the eigenstates of A would be the same as the eigenstates of X, right? Because it's a multiple of X. So the eigenstates of X are |+> and |->, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively. Because X is the spin flip operator.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. The eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix are indeed those superpositions. So if A is proportional to X, its eigenstates are the same.

So the problem is to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each of these eigenstates |+> and |->. Because when you measure an operator, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes of the eigenstates in the given state.

So first, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of operator A, which are |+> and |->. Once I have that, the coefficients' squares will give the probabilities.

But wait, before that, the initial state is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So I should first normalize this state to get |alpha>.

Let me calculate the normalization factor. The state before normalization is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>.

The norm of this state is the inner product with itself. So (1+i)* (1 - i) + (2 - i)*(2 + i). Let's compute each part.

(1+i)(1-i) = 1^2 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2.

(2-i)(2+i) = 4 + (2i - 2i) + (i^2*(-1)) )= 4 - (-1) = 5? Wait, wait, no. (2 - i)(2 + i) = (2)^2 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) = 5.

So the norm squared is 2 + 5 = 7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->.

We have |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So let's write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+> and |->.

Let me denote |alpha> as a |+> + b |->.

So,

a |+> + b |-> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Expressed in terms of |+> and |->:

a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + b (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) ) = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Combine terms:

[ (a + b) |up> + (a - b) |down> ] / sqrt(2) = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

So the coefficients must match. So:

(a + b)/sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7)

and

(a - b)/sqrt(2) = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

So, we can write two equations:

1) a + b = (1+i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
2) a - b = (2 -i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

I can solve for a and b by adding and subtracting the equations.

Adding 1 and 2:

2a = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

Simplify the numerator: (1 + i +2 -i ) = 3.

So 2a = 3 * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) → a = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) )

Similarly, subtracting 2 from 1:

2b = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

Compute (1+i) - (2 -i) = (1 - 2) + (i + i) = (-1) + 2i = -1 + 2i.

So 2b = (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) → b = [ (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7) )

Hmm. So a and b are these expressions. Now, the probability of measuring each eigenstate is |a|^2 and |b|^2.

Let me compute |a|^2 and |b|^2.

First, |a|^2:

a = 3 sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7)) → the magnitude squared is (9 * 2) / (4 *7) )= 18/(28) = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857.

Wait, but let me compute it exactly. 9/14 is 0.642857... which is approximately 0.64. Looking at the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36. But let me check if this is correct.

Wait, let me compute |a|²:

a = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) → |a|² = [ 3² * 2 ] / (2² *7) ) = (9 *2)/(4*7) )= 18/28=9/14≈0.642857.

Similarly, |b|²:

b = [ (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7) )

The magnitude squared is |(-1 + 2i)|² * (2) / (4*7) )

Compute | -1 + 2i |² = (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5.

So |b|² = [5 * 2 ] / (4 *7 )= 10/28=5/14≈0.35714.

Wait a second, but 9/14 is about 0.6429 and 5/14 is about 0.3571. So the probabilities are approximately 64% and 36%. So the sum is 9/14 +5/14=14/14=1, which is correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. Let me compute these as decimal to check the options. 9/14 is 0.642857... which is approximately 0.64, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is close to 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. But wait, option A says 0.64, 0.36, but wait, the sum there is 1.00, so that's correct. But wait, let's look at the operator's average value.

Wait, the operator is A. Its matrix is [0, hbar/2; hbar/2, 0]. So its eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2, since the eigenvalues of the Pauli X matrix are +1 and -1. So when multiplied by hbar/2, they become hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Wait, but the operator A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

So, the average value <A> is the expectation value of A in the state |alpha>.

Which is <alpha| A |alpha>.

To compute this, I can either compute it directly, or perhaps use the fact that |alpha> is expressed in terms of the eigenstates of A.

Wait, since |alpha> is a linear combination of |+> and |->, which are eigenstates of A, the expectation value would be |a|^2 * (hbar/2) + |b|^2 * (-hbar/2).

Because the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

So, <A> = (|a|^2 * (hbar/2)) + (|b|^2 * (-hbar/2)).

We have |a|^2 =9/14, |b|^2 =5/14.

So,

<A> = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2)
= [9/14 -5/14] * hbar/2
= (4/14) * hbar/2
= (2/7) * hbar/2
= hbar /7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

So putting it all together, the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is hbar/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7.

So that's the first part.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the expectation value.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute <A> directly.

|alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So the bra is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ].

Then, A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

So,

<alpha| A |alpha> = [ (1-i) (hbar/2) (2 -i) + (2 +i) (hbar/2) (1 +i) ] /7.

Wait, let me compute this.

Wait, when you multiply alpha^dagger by A, you get:

[ (1-i)/sqrt(7) , (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] multiplied by A:

A is:

[0, hbar/2;
hbar/2, 0]

So the product A |alpha> becomes:

First component: 0*(1+i) + (hbar/2)(2 -i) all divided by sqrt(7).

Wait, no, wait. Let me do it more carefully.

Wait, |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, divided by sqrt(7).

So, A|alpha> is:

A ( (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ) / sqrt(7)
= [ A_{11} (1+i) |up> + A_{12} (2 -i) |down> + A_{21} (1+i) |up> + A_{22} (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

But A_{11}=0, A_{22}=0, A_{12}=A_{21}=hbar/2.

So,

= [ (hbar/2)(1+i)|up> + (hbar/2)(2 -i)|down> ) ] / sqrt(7)
= (hbar/2)[ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ) ] / sqrt(7)

So, <alpha| A |alpha> is the inner product of |alpha> (bra) with this.

So,

= [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * (hbar/2) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ) ] / sqrt(7)

Which is (hbar/2) [ (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2 -i) ] / 7.

Wait, because when you take the inner product, |up> and |down> are orthogonal, so the cross terms would vanish, and you get the sum of the products of the coefficients.

So,

(1-i)(1+i) = 1 + 1 = 2.

(2+i)(2-i) =4 +1 =5.

So,

(2 +5) =7. Multiply by (hbar/2), and divide by 7.

So,

(hbar/2 *7) /7 = hbar/2 → wait, no, wait.

Wait, the sum is 2 +5=7. So 7*(hbar/2) /7 = hbar/2.

Wait, that can't be right because earlier calculation said hbar/7.

Hmm, this suggests I made a miscalculation. Because the two methods are giving conflicting results.

Wait, let's recompute.

The inner product <alpha| A |alpha> is computed as:

(1-i)(hbar/2)(1+i) + (2+i)(hbar/2)(2 -i) / 7.

Wait, no, the denominator is sqrt(7)*sqrt(7) =7.

Wait, the expression is [ (1-i)(hbar/2)(1+i) + (2+i)(hbar/2)(2-i) ] /7.

So, let's compute each term.

First term: (1-i)(1+i) = 2, as before.

Multiply by hbar/2: 2 * (hbar/2) = hbar.

Second term: (2+i)(2 -i) =4 +1=5.

Multiply by hbar/2:5*(hbar/2)= (5hbar)/2.

So the sum is hbar + 5hbar/2 = (2hbar +5hbar)/2=7hbar/2.

Divide by 7: (7hbar/2)/7= hbar/2.

Wait, so this gives <A> = hbar/2.

But earlier method, using the expansion into eigenstates, gave me <A> = hbar/7.

That's a problem. Something's wrong here. So which is correct?

Wait, I must have made a mistake in the expansion into eigenstates.

Wait, let me re-examine that part. The operator A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2,0]]

So, the eigenstates are |+>=(|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |->=(|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2, respectively.

So, |alpha> = a |+> + b |->.

Then, <A> = |a|^2 (hbar/2) + |b|^2 (-hbar/2)

Which is equal to (|a|² - |b|²) (hbar/2 )

We found |a|²=9/14, |b|²=5/14.

So,

(9/14 -5/14) * (hbar/2 )= (4/14) * (hbar/2 )= (2/7) * (hbar/2 )= hbar/7.

But the direct calculation gives hbar/2.

Hmm, so there's a discrepancy. Therefore, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, another approach. Let me compute <A> directly.

Given |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

The expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Compute A |alpha>:

A |up> is hbar/2 |down> and A |down> is hbar/2 |up>.

So,

A |alpha> = (1+i) * (hbar/2 |down> ) + (2 -i) * (hbar/2 |up> ) ) / sqrt(7)

= [ (2 -i) hbar/2 |up> + (1+i) hbar/2 |down> ] / sqrt(7)

Now, <alpha| is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ]

So, the inner product is:

(1-i)(hbar/2)(2 -i)/7 + (2+i)(hbar/2)(1 +i)/7

Wait, let me compute each term:

First term: (1 - i)(2 - i) = 2*1 + 1*(-i) -i*2 + i^2*(-1) → Wait, better to multiply:

(1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i^2.

i^2=-1, so 2 -3i -1 = (1) -3i.

Multiply by hbar/2: (1 -3i) * hbar/2.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2*i +i*1 +i*i = 2 + 2i +i + (-1) = (2-1) +3i=1 +3i.

Multiply by hbar/2: (1 +3i) * hbar/2.

So, the sum is:

[ (1-3i) + (1+3i) ] * (hbar/2) / 7.

The terms inside: (1-3i +1+3i) =2.

So,

2 * (hbar/2) /7 = (hbar) /7.

So <A> is hbar/7. Which matches the first method.

So earlier direct method had a mistake. Because in the first direct calculation, I think I missed the division by sqrt(7) in the inner product.

Wait, no, in the first direct method, I calculated the inner product as:

[ (1-i)(hbar/2)(1+i) + (2+i)(hbar/2)(2 -i) ] /7.

Wait, that was incorrect because A |alpha> is (hbar/2) [ (2-i)|up> + (1+i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So the inner product with <alpha| is:

[ (1-i) (2 -i) (hbar/2) + (2+i)(1+i)(hbar/2) ] /7.

Wait, that's correct, but in my calculation, I messed up the terms. Let me compute each term correctly.

Compute (1 -i)(2 -i):

= 1*2 + 1*(-i) -i*2 + i^2*(-1)
= 2 -i -2i + (-1)
= (2 -1) -3i
= 1 -3i.

Compute (2+i)(1+i):

= 2*1 + 2*i +i*1 + i*i
= 2 + 2i + i + (-1)
= (2-1) +3i
= 1 + 3i.

So, adding them: (1-3i) + (1+3i) =2.

Multiply by hbar/2 and divide by7: (2 * hbar/2) /7 = hbar/7.

So the correct expectation value is hbar/7.

So the earlier confusion was because I miscalculated the terms.

So the correct probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.642857 and 5/14≈0.357143.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. So the average value matches option A.

Wait, but wait, the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, which is about 0.64, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is about 0.36.

So the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7. So the correct option is A.


The problem involves an electron in the state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-component of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given by \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be computed.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The given state is \( |\alpha\rangle \propto (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, compute the norm:
\[
\langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + 1^2) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

### Step 2: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of the eigenstates of \( A \)
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix},
\]
which is proportional to the Pauli \( X \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( A \) are:
\[
|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle),
\]
with eigenvalues \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), respectively.

To express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \), write:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = a|+\rangle + b|-\rangle.
\]
Substituting the definitions of \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \), equate coefficients:
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (a + b)|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (a - b)|\downarrow\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]
Matching coefficients gives:
\[
\frac{a + b}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}, \quad \frac{a - b}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]
Solving these equations:
\[
a + b = \frac{(1+i)\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{7}}, \quad a - b = \frac{(2-i)\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]
Adding and subtracting:
\[
2a = \frac{(1+i) + (2-i)}{\sqrt{7}} \sqrt{2} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{7}} \sqrt{2}, \quad a = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}.
\]
\[
2b = \frac{(1+i) - (2-i)}{\sqrt{7}} \sqrt{2} = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{7}} \sqrt{2}, \quad b = \frac{(-1+2i)\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute probabilities
The probabilities of measuring \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \) are \( |a|^2 \) and \( |b|^2 \), respectively:
\[
|a|^2 = \left| \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}} \right|^2 = \frac{9 \cdot 2}{4 \cdot 7} = \frac{18}{28} = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.6429,
\]
\[
|b|^2 = \left| \frac{(-1+2i)\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}} \right|^2 = \frac{|-1+2i|^2 \cdot 2}{4 \cdot 7} = \frac{(1^2 + 2^2) \cdot 2}{4 \cdot 7} = \frac{5 \cdot 2}{28} = \frac{10}{28} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.3571.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the average value of \( A \)
The expectation value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + |b|^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]
Substituting \( |a|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \) and \( |b|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \):
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \frac{9}{14} - \frac{5}{14} \right) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{14} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with options
The probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). These match **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
