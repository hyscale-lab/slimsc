Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes (I think that's Co with two SCN- ions) among all cobalt species.

Wait, stability constants are for the formation of complexes. So each β represents the formation of a complex with a certain number of SCN- ligands. For Co(II), the complexes would be Co(SCN)_n^2- where n increases from 1 to 4, I guess.

The formula for the nth complex is βn = [Co(SCN)_n^2- ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n )

But wait, the problem is about the distribution of the different Co species. So, I think the species present are the free Co^2+ ion, the various complexes from n=1 to 4. So, each Co^2+ can form complexes with 1, 2, 3, or 4 SCN^- ions.

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would be with two SCN- ions. So that's the [Co(SCN)_2]^2- complex.

So, I need to find the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^2- relative to all cobalt species.

Wait, the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 1e-2 M. That should be the sum of all the species: [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^2- + [Co(SCN)_3]^4- + [Co(SCN)_4]^4-? Or maybe the charges are different, but for the distribution, perhaps the charges don't matter as much as the fractions.

But stability constants are involved, so I should model the distribution using the stability constants.

I remember that when dealing with such equilibria, you can use the formation constants to determine the fraction of each species.

The general approach is to consider the fraction of each complex relative to the free ion. So, for each complex, we can write an expression in terms of the stability constant and the concentrations of the ligand.

But since the ligand concentration is fixed here (0.1 M SCN^-), we can find out the fraction of each complex.

Wait, but the total Co is 1e-2 M. Let me think: each complex is a different form, so the sum of all the species equals 1e-2 M.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think about the distribution in terms of the formation of complexes from the free ion.

Let me denote [Co^2+] as x, then the concentration of each complex can be written in terms of x and the stability constants.

But for multiple complexes, the approach is to calculate each complex's concentration relative to
