Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

Alright, the problem is about an isolated system of particles. There are 13 identical particles, each has a charge of 2e. I remember that e is the elementary charge, about 1.6 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 2 times that, so 3.2e-19 C each.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I'm supposed to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, okay. So I think this is an electrostatic potential energy problem. Because when you have charges in an electrostatic system, their potential energy is stored, and I need to calculate that.

Wait, but the system is isolated. So I don't have to worry about any external fields, right? So the energy would just be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.

But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So point P is where the 13th charge is. The other 12 are at a distance of 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from the 13th charge.

So how does the potential energy work here? Each of those 12 charges contributes some energy due to their interaction with the 13th charge. Also, among themselves, they might contribute as well because they're all at the same point, right? Or wait, are the 12 charges all at point P? Or are they each at 2 meters from P but at different points? Hmm, the problem says they are "constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P." So maybe they're arranged around P at a radius of 2 meters. So perhaps they form a sphere or something, but I don't think the exact arrangement matters for the potential energy calculation because each pair contributes based on their separation.

Wait, no. The 12 charges are at 2m from P. The 13th is at P. So each of the 12 charges is at 2 meters from the 13th. Now, what about the interactions between the 12 charges themselves? Are they at the same point? Or are they each
