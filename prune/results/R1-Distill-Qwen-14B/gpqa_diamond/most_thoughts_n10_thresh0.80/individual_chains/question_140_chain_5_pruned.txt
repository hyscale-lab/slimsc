Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X. I'll try to break down the information given.

First, Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So, X is made of elements where at least one is a heavier isotope. Maybe it's something like Cl-35 and Cl-37, but I'm not sure yet.

Then, X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm, that's interesting. So, for W's molecule, the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. Let's think about common gases. Maybe something like CO2? No, wait, that's not right. Or maybe H2O? No, because H2O has 2 H (protons 1 each) and O (8 protons). So protons would be 2+8=10, and neutrons would be in O-16, which is 8. So that's 10 protons vs 8 neutrons. Not equal.

Wait, another thought: maybe NH3? No, that's not a molecule. Wait, another angle. The molecule should have same number of protons and neutrons. Let's say the molecule is H2O2. Then each molecule has 2 H (1 each) and 2 O (8 each). So total protons: 2*(1) + 2*(8) = 2 + 16 = 18. Neutrons in each O is 8 (since O-16 has 8), so 2 O would have 16 neutrons. Plus H has 0 neutrons. So protons 18, neutrons 16. Not same. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is something like O2 or N2. O2 has 16 grams per mole, but each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, so O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. Oh! So the molecule O2 would satisfy the condition because each molecule has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. Or maybe another diatomic gas. So if W is O2, that would fit. Or maybe another molecule like CH4? Let's see: C has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (if it's 12C), H has 1 each. So CH4 has 6 + 4*(1) = 10 protons. Neutrons: 6 (from C) + 4*(0) =6. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps W is CO. C has 6 protons, O has 8. So CO has 14 protons. Neutrons: C-12 has 6, O-16 has 8. So 6+8=14. So protons=14, neutrons=14. That fits! So W is CO.

Wait, but CO is a gas, yes. So if W is CO, then when X reacts with Y, it releases CO. Hmm. Let's see what else happens. A precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K. 277 K is around 4 degrees Celsius, which is just above 0 C. What substance melts around there? Maybe something like ice, but ice melts at 273 K. Oh wait, 277 is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe a different compound. Let me think: water is 273 K, so B's melting point is close to that. So B could be something like water or ice. But if G when heated releases B, perhaps G is a hydrate. Alternatively, perhaps G is a carbonate or something else that decomposes upon heating.

Wait, let's think about the reaction. X reacts with Y to produce gas W (CO), precipitate G, and perhaps some other products. Then G, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. So B is maybe water (273 K). So if B is water, then G is something that upon heating gives off water. Like a carbonate, which upon heating can decompose into CO2 and the respective oxide, but wait, earlier in the reaction, W is CO, not CO2. Alternatively, G could be a bicarbonate that upon heating gives CO2 and water, but that would make W CO2, not CO. Hmm, not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe B is some other substance. Let's think about other melting points. Maybe B is something else. Alternatively, perhaps B is dry ice (solid CO2), but that sublimes at 273 K, which is 0 C, which is close to 277 K. No, 273 K is exactly 0 C. 277 K is about 4 C, so maybe B is something else. Alternatively, perhaps B is another compound, like a metal oxide that's not water. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let's move on and see if other parts of the problem can give us more clues.

The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Wait, so when substance X reacts with a keto acid, the product has two oxygen atoms. I'm trying to think what kind of reaction that would be. Keto acids are like those with a carbonyl group, such as acetic acid. Maybe X is a base or something that can deprotonate the acid. If X is a metal, perhaps it's a base or a salt.

Wait, another angle: the problem says that X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. I'm trying to think of reagents that are isotopic. Maybe X is something like
