Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through step by step.

First, I should understand what each spectrograph can observe. The question mentions that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. That means stars with V mag ≤ 17 can be seen by ESPRESSO. HIRES, on the other hand, can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, for HIRES, stars must have V mag ≤ 16.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the wording says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO. Oh, but in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star's apparent magnitude is V ≤ 17, that's brighter than 17. So ESPRESSO can detect stars with V up to 17 (since anything brighter than 17 would be lower magnitude, easier to detect). Similarly, HIRES can handle up to V=16.

So any star that has an apparent V magnitude ≤17 can be seen by ESPRESSO, and also ≤16 for HIRES. So to be detectable by both, the star must have V mag ≤16, because that's the stricter condition. But I need to check each star to see if they meet both observatory's brightness requirements, as well as other factors.

Wait, wait. Oh, but the question is which stars can be detected with both spectrographs. So each star must be observable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES. So for a star to be detected by both, it must satisfy both the brightness conditions of each instrument.

Wait, but each instrument has their own limitations. ESPRESSO's limit is brighter than 17 mag (so V ≤ 17), HIRES's limit is brighter than 16 (V ≤ 16). So for a star to be detected by both, it must have V ≤16, because HIRES can't see V=17. So the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤16 for both.

Now, I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star, considering any extinction (dust) which is given in some cases.

Looking at the stars:
