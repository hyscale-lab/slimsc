Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

Alright, the problem says there are two astronauts. One has a mass of 2m and the other 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. So, both are moving forward, but at different speeds.

First, I remember that when dealing with relative velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract the speeds like you would in classical mechanics. Because at high speeds, the effects of relativity become significant. The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/c²). Wait, but wait, I need to get this right. So if astronaut A is moving at v1 and astronaut B at v2 (both in the same direction), then the relative speed of A as seen from B would be (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)).

Wait, but in this case, both are moving in the same direction, so if I want the relative speed of the 3m astronaut (moving at 0.5c) as seen from the 2m astronaut (moving at 0.6c), I should plug in v1 = 0.6c and v2 = 0.5c into the formula.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, from the perspective of the 2m astronaut, which is moving at 0.6c, how fast is the 3m astronaut moving? Since they're both moving in the same direction, the 3m astronaut is moving slower than the 2m astronaut. So the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Calculating numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.6 * 0.5) (since c² cancels out). 0.6 * 0.5 is 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So relative speed v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 = (1/7) c ≈ 0.1428c. Which is approximately 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c for the relative speed.

Now, the other part is the total energy of the system. Hmm, I think the total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. Each astronaut's energy is given by gamma * m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for astronaut A (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

Gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E_A = gamma_A * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

Gamma_B = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

So energy E_B = gamma_B * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 *3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E_total = E_A + E_B ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking back at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5mc², which is lower, so probably not.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says "the total energy of the system." Does this refer to the sum of their energies in their rest frames? Or is it the energy in the rest frame of another observer?

Wait, from the problem statement, each astronaut's speed is given from some frame (probably the same frame). So the total energy would be the sum of their energies as measured in that frame.

So yes, the calculation I did earlier adds the energies correctly.

So the options:

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc². That matches.

Option D: same speed, but E=5mc², which is about 5. So our calculation is around 5.96, so option C is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the relative velocity calculation. Because sometimes, I might confuse which one is moving relative to whom.

The formula for relative velocity when moving in the same direction is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)).

So if the 2m astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the 3m is moving at 0.5c, then the relative speed of the 3m as seen by the 2m is (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²))? Wait, wait, wait, that would give a negative numerator, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c in the same direction, then from A's perspective, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/(c²)) )= (-0.1c) / (1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 = -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates direction, so the speed is 0.1428c in the opposite direction. But when they ask for relative speed, it's the magnitude. So 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c.

So the relative speed is 0.14c, and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options again, option C says v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc².

So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed Calculation
The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) (for the 2m astronaut) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\) (for the 3m astronaut). Substituting these values:

1. **Numerator**: \(v_1 - v_2 = 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c\)
2. **Denominator**: \(1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7\)

Thus, the relative speed is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} = 0.1428c \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy Calculation
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of each astronaut is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the 2m astronaut (\(v = 0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_A = \gamma_A (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the 3m astronaut (\(v = 0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_B = \gamma_B (3m)c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is \(E_{\text{total}} = 5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\)**.
