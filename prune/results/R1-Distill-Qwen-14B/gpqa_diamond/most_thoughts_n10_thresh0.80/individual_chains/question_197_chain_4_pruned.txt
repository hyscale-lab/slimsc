Okay, so I need to figure out what the final product is when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Let me start by looking at the given IR and NMR data to determine what Compound X is.

First, the IR data. The peaks are at 3400-2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But since there's a 1720 cm-1 peak, that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid or an ester. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 could be aromatic C=C stretching, so there's probably a benzene ring involved.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a strong peak, probably an aldehyde proton. Wait, but wait, aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. But another possibility is a carboxylic acid, but the -COOH proton is usually broader and around 10-12 ppm. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, that would fit because the IR has a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde. Hmm.

Wait, but in the IR, the 3400-2500 region is broad, which might be an O-H stretch. Carboxylic acids have broad O-H stretches. So maybe Compound X is a carboxylic acid. The 10.5 ppm peak could be the -COOH proton. But wait, that's usually more upfield than that. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents.

Wait, let me think again. The NMR peaks:

- 10.5 ppm, broad singlet (1H): Could be a phenolic OH, but that's usually lower, maybe. Or an aldehyde proton. Wait, but wait, in a carboxylic acid, the OH is usually a broad peak around 10 ppm. So maybe it's a -COOH group.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The protons are split into two doublets, which suggests two substituents on the benzene ring, in para positions. So maybe something like para-substituted benzene.

Then, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Maybe a methine (CH) group near an electronegative group. Like a CH adjacent to a carbonyl.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Possibly a CH2 group adjacent to another CH or something.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH that's split into a doublet. So maybe a CH(CH3) group.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A terminal methyl group, like from an ethyl chain perhaps.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is something like a benzene ring with substituents. Let me try to sketch it out.

So the ring has two substituents para to each other. One substituent is a carbonyl group (from
