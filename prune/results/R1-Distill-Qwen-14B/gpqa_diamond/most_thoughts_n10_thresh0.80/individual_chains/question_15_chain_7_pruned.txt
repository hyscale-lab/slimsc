Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so that the researchers can prioritize their observations. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. The formula I recall is something like (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by something related to the orbital distance, maybe the impact parameter. But wait, I'm not too sure about the exact formula. Let me think.

Wait, the transit probability isn't just about the size ratio. I think it also depends on the orbital period. Oh right, the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / a), where 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a). Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, I remember that the probability of a transit is given by (R_p + R_s) divided by (a * (1 - e²)^0.5), but since the orbits are circular (e=0), the equation simplifies. Wait, but that's for a specific scenario. Let me think again. Oh right, the probability P is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a)) * (1 / something else?), but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the key factors are the size of the star, the size of the planet, and the distance of the planet from the star. The transit occurs when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view. The probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius, or something like that.

I think the transit probability can be approximated by (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a)), but adjusted for the fact that the planet's orbital plane must be edge-on. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Another approach: the probability is higher if the planet is closer to the star because the chance of the alignment is better.

Wait, I should look for a formula or model. Oh right, the transit probability for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:

P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a)) * (some factor), but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, I've
