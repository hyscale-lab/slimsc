Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the speed of light in glass when the glass itself is moving. Hmm, I remember that light's speed in a medium depends on the refractive index, but wait, how does the movement of the medium come into play? I'm a bit rusty on this, so let me think.

The problem states that the glass has an index of refraction n. So normally, the speed of light in the glass should be c/n, right? Because in a vacuum, c is 1, so it's 1/n. But wait, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, towards the observer. Oh, so the glass is moving towards me, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion.

I'm trying to remember if the speed of light in the medium is affected by the medium's motion. From what I recall, in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, regardless of the source's motion. But wait, this is about the speed within a moving medium, not in vacuum. Hmm, does that change things?

Wait, another thought: the speed of light in a medium is determined by the medium's properties. So if the medium is moving, does that affect how we measure the speed of light in that medium? Or is it still c/n regardless?

But wait, the observer is in the lab frame. So the light's speed in the glass might be measured by the lab observer differently. Or maybe not. Because in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. So regardless of the medium's motion, when observed from the lab frame, light's speed should still be c? Because that's a fundamental postulate.

Wait, but the options given don't have c as an option. Wait, the options are A, B, C, D, and the speed is supposed to be relative to the observer. Wait, the question is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. So the glass is moving, but the light is inside the glass.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the frame of reference. From the lab frame, the glass is moving, so the light inside it might have a different speed as measured by the lab observer? Or do I need to account for the Doppler effect or something else?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is simpler. The speed of light in the glass is c/n, regardless of the glass's motion. So the observer would measure the speed as
