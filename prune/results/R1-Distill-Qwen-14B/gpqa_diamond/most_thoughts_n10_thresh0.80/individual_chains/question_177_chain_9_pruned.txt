Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Let's read the problem again and jot down the key points.

Alright, so Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Both stars have the same mass ratio, which is 1.5 times as well. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Also, their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. The question is about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

Hmm, okay. So the first thing that comes to mind is the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which relates luminosity, radius, and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both stars are radiating as black bodies, this should apply here.

Wait, but the problem says the wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. Oh right, because the peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's law: λ_max ≈ b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K). So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is the same, then T would be the same since λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait a moment. The radial velocities are given, but how does that affect things? Oh, radial velocity is about the Doppler shift. Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, it shifts the wavelengths we observe. But the problem says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So if Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s, would its observed temperature be different?

Wait, let me think. The Doppler effect could shift the wavelengths. So when a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted; moving away, redshifted. But in this case, Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so no shift. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. But wait, which direction? The problem doesn't specify
