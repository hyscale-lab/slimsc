Okay, I'm trying to figure out this physics problem here. Let's see what it's about. So, the question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that, so 2e each.

Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system. Hmm, okay. So I remember that the potential energy in a system of charges is related to the work done to assemble them, considering their interactions.

Wait, but energy is usually considered in terms of potential energy when dealing with charges. Since the system is isolated, we can ignore external work, I think. So the total potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges.

Wait, but how? Let me think. The formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1*q2)/r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

But wait, in this case, most of the charges are fixed. The 13th charge is at P, and the others are 2m away. So each of the 12 charges at 2m distance contributes to the potential at P. So the 13th charge, fixed at P, would have each of the 12 charges contributing to its potential.

Wait a
