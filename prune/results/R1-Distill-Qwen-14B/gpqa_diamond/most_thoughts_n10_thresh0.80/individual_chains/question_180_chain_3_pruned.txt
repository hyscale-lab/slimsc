Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to find the minimum energy of a system of charges. Hmm, let's try to unpack this step by step.

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, which is about 1.6 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 2 times that, so 3.2e-19 coulombs each. But wait, wait, I should be precise. Let me jot that down: q = 2e = 2 * 1.6e-19 C = 3.2e-19 C.

Now, the setup: 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. So point P has one charge, and the other 12 are arranged on a sphere of radius 2 meters around it.

I'm trying to find the minimum energy of the system. Oh right, the potential energy of a system of point charges is the work required to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. But wait, since they are identical and the same sign, bringing them closer would require work because they repel each other. So the potential energy would be positive, and I need to find the minimum possible energy, which might be the configuration with the least potential energy? Or wait, maybe the problem is about the minimum potential energy state, which for repelling charges would be when they're as far apart as possible, but in this case, they're constrained at a fixed distance from P.

Wait, no, the 12 charges are constrained at 2 m from P, which is where the 13th is. So each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 meters from P. So the system consists of a charge at P, and 12 charges on the surface of a sphere of radius 2m.

Wait, but potential energy is calculated based on interactions between all pairs. So for each pair of charges, I have to calculate the potential energy and sum them all up.

So the total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies between each pair.

But wait, each charge at P interacts with each of the 12 charges on the sphere, and the 12 charges on the sphere also interact with each other.

So let's break this down into two parts:

1. The potential energy between the fixed charge at P and each of the 12 charges on the sphere.
2. The potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges on the sphere.

Hmm, but wait, each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from P. So, for the first part, each of the 12 charges is interacting with the fixed charge at P.

So the energy from the fixed charge and the 12 charges: Each of the 12 charges has a charge of 2e, and the fixed charge is also 2e. The potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula: U = (k * q1 * q2) / r.

So for each of the 12 charges, the potential energy with the fixed charge at P is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m). Wait, but wait, when you bring a charge from infinity to a point where another charge is present, the potential energy is given by the charge times the potential at that point. Alternatively, since all the charges are being brought in, perhaps each contributes a term.

Wait, let's think about it more systematically.

The total potential energy U of the system is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. Since all the charges are identical and we're dealing with pairs, we can calculate this in two parts: interactions involving the fixed charge, and interactions among the 12 charges.

First part: The fixed charge at P interacts with each of the 12 charges on the sphere. So each such pair contributes U1 = (k * q1 * q2) / r. Since q1 = q2 = 2e, and r = 2 m.

So for each of the 12 charges, U1 = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2). So that's 12 * U1.

Wait, wait, but wait a second. When you have multiple charges, each pair contributes to the total potential energy. So for the fixed charge (call it Q) and the 12 moving charges (each q), the U between Q and each q is (k Q q)/r. Since Q is fixed, each of the 12 contributes (k*(2e)*(2e))/(2 m). So 12 * (k*(4e²)/(2)) = 12*(2 k e²) = 24 k e².

But I'm not sure if that's right. Wait, each of the 12 charges is at 2 m, so for each, the potential energy is (k * 2e * 2e) / 2. So each contributes (k *4 e²)/(2) = 2 k e². And 12 * 2 k e² is 24 k e².

Wait, but wait another thing. When you calculate the potential energy of a system, the formula is U = (1/2) * sum over all pairs of (k q_i q_j)/r_ij. Wait, no, that's when you have all pairs contributing. Wait, no, that's for when you have multiple charges and you're calculating the work done to assemble them. But in this case, the charge at P is fixed, so perhaps only the work done on the other 12 charges is considered. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the sum of the work done to bring each charge into place, considering the potential
