Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the solution. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The astronomers are interested in their luminosities. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. But wait, the question mentions that their wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission depends on its temperature. Oh right, it's given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if their peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because if T changes, λ_max would change. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait wait, but the problem says they radiate as black bodies. So luminosity depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power. Luminosity L is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since the radius and temperatures are the same? No, wait, no: the radii are different. Star_1 has radius 1.5 times Star_2. But the problem says their peak wavelengths are the same, so their temperatures are the same. So then, L would be proportional to R² T⁴. Since T is same for both, L should be proportional to R².

Wait, but the question says that the astronomers found the same wavelengths, so same T. So for luminosity, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. Since T1 = T2, the ratio is (1.5/1)^2 = 2.25. So the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2. So the factor is approximately 2.25, which is option A.

Wait, but wait. There's another part about radial velocities. The radial velocities are given as 0 and 700 km/s. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does that affect the luminosity calculation?

Oh wait, the problem says that they computed the luminosity of each star, assuming they radiate
