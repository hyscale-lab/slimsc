Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, rhombohedral... I remember that's one of the crystal systems. So, the question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Right, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. I think the formula involves the lattice parameter and some angles.

Wait, the given data is that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, no, wait. Interatomic distance is the distance between atoms, which in a crystal is the lattice parameter 'a' when it's a simple cubic structure. But wait, in a rhombohedral crystal, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, so all edges are equal (a), but the angles between them are equal and not 90 degrees. Oh, right, in this case, all angles are 30 degrees each.

So, the lattice parameter 'a' is 10 Angstroms. So, for a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice is determined by the vectors a, b, c, but in this case, a = b = c = a0 (let's say a0 is 10A), and all angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} is 1/d = |(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) - sqrt(2)(h k)/(a^2) cosα - sqrt(2)(h l)/(a^2) cosβ - sqrt(2)(k l)/(a^2) cosγ)|^0.5. Wait, no, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, I think the general formula for d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral system can be simplified because all a, b, c are equal and all angles are equal.

Wait, I remember that in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar spacing formula can be expressed using the Miller indices and the lattice parameter, considering the angles. The formula might be d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - sqrt(2)(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ) ), where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors. Since here all angles are 30 degrees, θ=
