Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? And a resonance in this context probably refers to a particle that doesn't exist long enough to be observed directly, so it decays quickly. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of this meson X.

The given data are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 10^-15 to 10^-16 meters, so the answer is going to be really tiny.

Wait, I think the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle. Because the decay distance is how far the particle travels before decaying, which is the product of its velocity and lifetime. So, distance = v * τ. So I need to find the lifetime τ first.

Oh right, the uncertainty principle relates the width (Γ) to the lifetime. The relation I remember is Γ = ħ / τ, or maybe τ is ħ / Γ. Wait, no, the natural line width or the uncertainty in energy is related to the lifetime. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So for a resonance, the width Γ is like the uncertainty in energy ΔE, and the lifetime τ is the uncertainty in time Δt. So Γ ≈ ħ / τ → τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, I've also heard that Γ is the total decay width, and the lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ. Yeah, so that makes sense. So τ = ħ / Γ.

Once I have the lifetime, I need to find the velocity v. But how? Well, for a relativistic particle, the velocity can be approximated. Since the production energy E is given as 8 GeV, and the mass m is 1.2 GeV. So the particle is moving relativistically because E is much larger than m. So the energy E is the total energy, which is γ m c². So γ = E / (m c²). Wait, but since E is in GeV and m is in GeV/c², maybe I can work in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1 for calculation, then convert back.

Wait, let's think. Let me write down the equations.

First, find velocity v. v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/(γ²)) ), but maybe a better approach is to use beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)) ), because the total energy E = γ m c², so γ = E/(m c²). So beta squared is 1 - (m² c^4)/(E²).

Wait, or perhaps more accurately, beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).

Hmm, but wait, if E is the total energy, and m is the rest mass, then yes, that's the right formula.

Let me plug in the numbers.

E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². But in terms of units, when using GeV, I need to handle the mass in GeV/c². But when calculating beta, perhaps I can set c=1 (as in natural units) to make it easier.

So, if c is taken as 1, then E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV, so E² = 64 (GeV)^2, m² = 1.44 (GeV)^2.

So beta = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So beta is approximately 0.9887, which means v ≈ 0.9887 c.

Wait, but maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute 1.44 divided by 64: 1.44 /64 = 0.0225. So 1-0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775. Hmm, sqrt(0.9801) is 0.99, since 0.99^2 is 0.9801. 0.9887 squared is approximately 0.9775, since (0.9887)^2 ≈ (0.98)^2 + ... Let me compute 0.9887^2:

0.9887 * 0.9887 ≈ (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.0087 + 0.0087^2 = 0.9604 + 0.0171 + 0.000076 ≈ 0.977576, which is very close to 0.9775, so beta is approximately 0.9887.

So v ≈ 0.9887 c.

Now, the lifetime τ is ħ / Γ.

Wait, but Γ is given in MeV, so I need to make sure all the units are consistent.

Γ is 320 MeV. Let's convert that to GeV: 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

But ħ has units of GeV·s when using natural units where c=1. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused with the units. Let's recall that ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

So, τ = ħ / Γ.

So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Then, the mean decay distance is v * τ.

v is approximately 0.9887 c, and c is about 3e8 m/s.

So v = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, multiply by τ to get distance:

distance ≈ 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e-16 m.

Calculating 2.966 * 2.056875:

Let me compute that. 2 * 2.056875 is 4.11375. 0.966 * 2.056875 ≈ approximately 2.000 (because 2 * 2 is 4, but wait, 0.966 is about 96.6% of 1. So 2.056875 * 0.966 ≈ let's calculate 2.056875 *0.9=1.8512, 2.056875 *0.066≈0.136. So total ≈ 1.8512 + 0.136 = 1.9872. Then total is 4.11375 + 1.9872 ≈ 6.10095.

So 6.10095e-16 meters. Hmm, wait, but looking at the options, options are around 4.06e-15 or 5.02e-15, etc. So this 6e-16 doesn't match any of the options. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of beta. Let me double-check.

E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV.

In natural units (c=1), E² = p² + m² → p = sqrt(E² - m²) ≈ sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV.

So the momentum p is 7.91 GeV. Then, the velocity beta is given by p c = gamma m v, but maybe a better approach is to use beta = p c / E. Because p c = gamma m v c, and E = gamma m c². So p c = (gamma m v c) = (gamma m c²) * (v/c) ) → p c = E * (v/c) → v = (p c) / E.

Wait, but in natural units, the equation is p = gamma m v, because p = gamma m v (since v is in terms of c, beta = v/c, so v = beta c, so p = gamma m beta c). But E = gamma m c². So p c = gamma m beta c^2. Thus, p c = beta E. So beta = (p c) / E.

Wait, but in natural units where c=1, p (in GeV/c) multiplied by c gives GeV. So p c is GeV. E is GeV. So beta = (p c) / E.

Wait, but p c is sqrt(E^2 - m^2) c * c? No, wait, p is in GeV/c. So p c is GeV. So beta = (p c) / E.

So with E=8 GeV, p c = sqrt(8^2 - 1.2^2) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈7.91 GeV. So beta = 7.91 /8 ≈ 0.98875. So that's correct, same as before.

Hmm, then where is the mistake?

Let me recompute the distance.

tau = hbar / Gamma. hbar is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Gamma is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So tau = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

v = beta c ≈ 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So distance = v * tau = (2.966e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) = let's calculate this.

2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e-16.

So 2.966 * 2.056875 ≈ 6.1009, as before. So the distance is approximately 6.1e-16 meters.

But looking at the options, the options are much smaller, like 4e-15 or 5e-15, or 4e-16 etc. Wait, wait. Oh wait, I think I messed up the calculation of tau.

Wait, Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So tau is hbar divided by Gamma, but hbar is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So yes, 6.582e-25 /0.32 is 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again.

6.582e-25 /0.32 = 6.582 / 0.32 = ~20.56875, multiplied by 1e-25 → 20.56875e-25 → 2.056875e-24 s. So that's correct.

Hmm, but the distance I'm getting is 6e-16 m, but the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.

Wait, another approach: the mean path length is given by (gamma m c^2) * tau / (m c^2 ), but no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, gamma is E/(m c²), so gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So gamma is about 6.6667.

Wait, the mean decay length L is given by L = gamma * c * tau.

Because the lifetime is tau, and the particle is moving at speed v ≈ c, so L = v * tau ≈ c * tau * gamma? Wait, no. Because v is beta c, so L = beta c * tau.

But beta is sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)) = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = 0.9887. So L = 0.9887 c tau.

Alternatively, since gamma is E/(m c²), which is 8/(1.2) = 6.6667.

Wait, perhaps L = gamma * c * tau * (m c²)/E? No, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, another way. The proper lifetime tau is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. The observed lifetime is gamma * tau, so the mean path length is v * gamma tau.

Wait, no. The total lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. So the decay length is v * gamma tau = beta c * gamma tau.

But gamma tau is the same as (E/(m c²)) * tau. Alternatively, because tau is hbar / Gamma, and Gamma is the decay width.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to use the formula for the decay length which I think is L = (E c tau)/(m c^2), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I've read that the decay length can be expressed as L = (gamma beta c tau). So that would be L = gamma beta c tau.

So let's compute it that way. Gamma is 8/(1.2) = 6.6667. Beta is 0.9887. So gamma beta is 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ approx 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ let's compute 6.6667 * 0.98 = 6.5333, and 6.6667 *0.0087≈ 0.058. So total approx 6.5913.

So L = gamma beta c tau.

c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So, L = 6.5913 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 6.5913 *3e8= approx 1.977e9.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24: 1.977e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.977 * 2.056875) × 1e-15.

1.977 * 2.056875 ≈ let's compute:

2 * 2.056875 =4.11375. Subtract (0.023 *2.056875)≈0.047. So 4.11375-0.047≈4.06675.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 1.977 is approximately 2 * (0.9885). Wait, maybe I should compute it directly.

1.977 * 2.056875: let me compute 2 * 2.056875 =4.11375. 0.977 * 2.056875 ≈ (1 * 2.056875) - (0.023 * 2.056875) = 2.056875 - 0.0472 ≈ 2.0096.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 1.977 is (2 - 0.023). So 1.977 *2.056875 = 2*2.056875 - 0.023 *2.056875.

Which is 4.11375 - (0.0472) ≈4.06655.

So about 4.06655e-15 meters.

Hmm, looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

Option D is 4.0655e-16 m.

So the correct answer would be option B.

Wait, why the discrepancy earlier? Because I was calculating L as v * tau, which is beta c * tau, but that's the proper way when considering the lab frame. But wait, I thought gamma was E/(m c²), and then the lab frame lifetime is gamma tau. So L= v * gamma tau.

Wait, no. The proper lifetime is tau. The lab frame lifetime is gamma tau. So the mean decay distance is v * gamma tau.

Wait, but v is beta c. So L = beta c * gamma tau = gamma beta c tau.

Which is what I did in the second approach, which gave about 4.066e-15 m, matching option B.

So where did I go wrong earlier? Because in the first approach, I was calculating L = v * tau, which would be the distance in the rest frame, but that's not correct because the particle is moving in the lab frame, so the lifetime is longer by gamma. So the correct approach is to include gamma in the calculation.

So, putting it all together:

Gamma_total = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

hbar = 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

tau = hbar / Gamma_total = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

Gamma (Lorentz factor) = E / (m c²) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6667.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.9887.

So, L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Compute each part:

gamma * beta = 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈6.5913.

c is 3e8 m/s.

tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So,

L = 6.5913 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16.

Then, multiply by 6.5913: 6.5913 *6.170625e-16.

Wait, 6 *6.17 is 37.02. 0.5913 *6.17≈3.647. So total about 40.667e-16 m, which is 4.0667e-15 m.

So that's approximately 4.0667e-15 m, which matches option B: 4.0655 *1e-15 m.

So the correct answer is option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the relationship \( L = \gamma \beta c \tau \), where:

- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, given by \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \),
- \( \beta \) is the velocity of the particle in units of \( c \), given by \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2}{E^2}} \),
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle, related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The energy \( E \) is \( 8 \, \text{GeV} \), and the mass \( m \) is \( 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). Using \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \) (in natural units where \( c = 1 \)):

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \)
The velocity \( \beta \) is given by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2}{E^2}}.
\]

Substituting \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \) and \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1.44}{64}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}.
\]

Given \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \), and \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \):

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \), \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 6.6667 \cdot 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24}.
\]

First, calculate \( \gamma \beta \):

\[
\gamma \beta = 6.6667 \cdot 0.9887 \approx 6.5913.
\]

Next, calculate \( c \tau \):

\[
c \tau = 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16}.
\]

Finally, calculate \( L \):

\[
L = 6.5913 \cdot 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \approx 4.0667 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The calculated mean decay distance \( L \approx 4.0667 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) matches option **B**, which is \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).

Answer: B
