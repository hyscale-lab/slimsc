Okay, so I have this physics problem about the quantum rotation-vibration model, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see, the question is about a diatomic molecule, X and Y, that's modeled using this model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that, when absorbed, will take the molecule to the next lowest energy state.

Hmm, wait. So the molecule is in its ground state, and absorbing a photon will cause it to transition to the next state. But wait, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. I remember that the energy levels for a diatomic molecule have both rotational and vibrational contributions. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) with the lowest rotational state (probably J=0 or J=1, depending on the model). Oh wait, for a rigid rotor, the ground state is J=0, but the non-rigid rotor model might be a bit different, but I'm not sure. Wait, the question says "non-rigid rotor model," so that probably affects the rotational energy levels.

Wait, but the problem is about the transition from the fundamental state to the next lowest energy state. So maybe the molecule is in the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). Then, when it absorbs a photon, it can either go to a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So which transition gives the lower energy photon?

Wait, I think that the vibrational energy levels have a larger spacing than rotational ones. Because vibrational energy levels are quantized based on the harmonic oscillator model, which has a high frequency, leading to larger energy differences. So perhaps the first transition would be a vibrational one. Or maybe it's a rotational one. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state could be either the next vibrational state (v=1) or the next rotational state (J=1). Which one has a lower energy difference?

Let me think about the energy levels. The vibrational energy levels are given by E_v = (v + 1/2) h w_vib, where w_vib is the angular frequency of vibration.
