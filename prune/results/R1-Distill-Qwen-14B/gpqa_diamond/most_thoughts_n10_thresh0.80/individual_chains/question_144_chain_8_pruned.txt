Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances, and I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to think through it. The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that in particle physics, the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. The uncertainty principle comes into play here, right? The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So, I think the mean lifetime τ is inversely proportional to the width Γ. Oh wait, the formula I think is τ = ħ/(Γ). But wait, sometimes I see it as τ ≈ ħ/(2Γ) or something like that. Oh, right, the mean lifetime τ is approximately ħ divided by the width Γ. Or maybe it's Γ = ħ/(τ), so τ = ħ/Γ.

But wait, let me get this straight. The width Γ is related to the inverse of the particle's lifetime. So the decay width Γ is equal to ħ/τ, which implies that τ = ħ/(Γ). So that's the first part.

Once I have the lifetime, I can find the mean decay distance. The mean decay distance L is the velocity v multiplied by the lifetime τ. So L = v * τ. But wait, v is the velocity of the particle, which I need to calculate using its energy and
