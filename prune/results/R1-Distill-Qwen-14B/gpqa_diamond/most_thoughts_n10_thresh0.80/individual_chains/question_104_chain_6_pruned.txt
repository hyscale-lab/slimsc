Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves a bit as the planet orbits it, and we can see that shift in the spectral lines.

The question says that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So the key here is comparing the orbital periods of the two planets based on the RV measurements.

Planet #1 caused a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's star shifted by 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but how does the shift relate to the orbital period? I think the shift is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. Because the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us, which depends on the planet's mass and orbital period.

The formula I remember for the RV method involves the velocity semi-amplitude K. K is the maximum velocity of the star due to the planet. The formula is something like K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) * (1/( (P) )^(1/3) ) ), but wait, since both planets are similar to Neptune, their masses are roughly the same. And the stars are the same mass as the Sun, so M_star is same. Also, the orbits are circular, so e=0, so the (1 - e²)^(0.5) is 1. So maybe the formula simplifies a bit.

Wait, another approach: The velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) ) * (1 / (P) )^(1/3) * (something with other terms?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the RV velocity depends on the mass of the planet and the period in such a way that for the same star and planet mass, a longer period would lead to a smaller velocity shift. Because if a planet has a longer period, it takes more time to orbit, so the star's velocity (back and forth) would be smaller.

Wait, maybe the formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(P)) )^(1/3) * (1 / (1 - e²)^(0.5)) )

But since M_p is much less than M_star (Neptune is much less than the Sun), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. And e=0, so 1/(1-e²)^0.5 is 1.

So K ≈ [ G * M_p / M_star ]^(1/3) * (1 / P )^(1/3 )

Wait, that would make K proportional to (M_p / M_star )^(1/3) * (1/P)^(1/3 )

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps a more straightforward way is to think about the ratio of the periods.

Since both stars have the same mass and the
