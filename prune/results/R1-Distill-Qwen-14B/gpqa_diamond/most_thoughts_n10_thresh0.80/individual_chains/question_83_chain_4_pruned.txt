Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

Alright, let's read the problem again. We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. We dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

Okay, first, what's happening here. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When you titrate them, they react to form acetate ions and water. The reaction should be CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

So, the first part is about the initial solution after dilution. Let me calculate the concentration after diluting with water. Oh right, dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add 20 cm³ of water, so total volume is 40 cm³. The initial concentration is 0.05 M. So M2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the volume doubles. So the concentration becomes half. 0.05 / 2 is 0.025 M, yes. So the concentration of acetic acid after dilution is 0.025 M.

Now, when titrating, we'll add NaOH. Let's think about the 25% titration point first.

Wait, what does 25% titration mean? It means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So, the amount of NaOH added is 25% of the moles of acetic acid present.

Let me calculate the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. Volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 M × 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

So, 25% of that is 0.00025 mol. That's the amount of NaOH added, because each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid.

But wait, wait. Let me think about the stoichiometry. The reaction is 1:1, so yes, moles of NaOH added at 25% is 0.25 × 0.001 = 0.00025 mol.

So, when we add 0.00025
