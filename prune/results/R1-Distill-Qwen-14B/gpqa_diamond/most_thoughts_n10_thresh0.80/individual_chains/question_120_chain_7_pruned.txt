Alright, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, particularly how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, okay, I need to think this through.

Wait, stars are uniformly distributed. So that means the number density is the same throughout the space we're considering, right? I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/distance. Oh right, because the formula is plx (in arcseconds) = 1 / distance (in parsecs).

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So if we consider a small range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range?

Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars should depend on the volume of space corresponding to that parallax range. Wait, how does the volume relate to parallax?

Let me think about it. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So when plx increases, distance decreases. So a small change in plx would correspond to a certain range in distance.

Let me model this. Parallax plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. But wait, actually, d is in parsecs, and plx is in arcseconds. So plx = 1/d, where d is distance in parsecs.

Suppose I have two stars at distances d and d + dd. Their parallaxes would be plx = 1/d and plx + dplx = 1/(d + dd). Wait, no, actually, if the parallax is plx, then distance d = 1/plx. So if plx increases by dplx, then the distance decreases by dd = 1/(plx + dplx) - 1/(plx) )? Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of differentials.

Let me compute the change in distance when plx changes by dplx. So, d = 1/plx. So, dd = - (1/(plx)^2) * dplx. Because derivative of d with respect to plx is -1/(plx^2). So dd = -dplx/(plx^2). But since distance decreases as plx increases, the actual change in distance is a small negative value when plx increases.

But for the purpose of calculating the number of stars, I'm more interested in the volume of space between certain parallax values. So let's say I have a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx. The volume of that shell would be the surface area of the sphere at radius d, multiplied by the thickness in distance, dd.

Wait, but since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars per unit volume is constant. So the number of stars in a volume element dV would be n * dV, where n is the number density.

So the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd would be n * 4π d² dd. Because the volume of a thin shell is 4π d² dd.

But wait, we're considering a change in parallax, which is a change in d. So the volume is 4π d² dd. And since dd is related to d
