Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the probabilities of measuring an electron in certain eigenstates and the average value of an operator. Hmm, let me read it again.

The state is given as |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Oh wait, proportional means it's just a scalar multiple, but we can probably normalize it later. The states |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, they're the standard spin-up and spin-down states.

The operator in question has a matrix representation A where A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. So, for a 2x2 matrix, since we're dealing with two states, the operator A would look like this:

[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   0  ]

Because the diagonal elements are 0, and all the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. I think this operator is related to the spin operator in the x or y direction, but maybe not exactly. Alternatively, it's a Pauli matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me think, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if A is [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]], that's exactly (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So A = (ħ/2) σ_x. But wait, I'm not sure if that's the case, but maybe it's relevant.

The first task is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A. Oh right, because each operator has its own eigenstates. So, the eigenstates of A are different from |up> and |down>, unless A shares eigenstates with the z-spin operator.

Wait, no. The eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>. So, the eigenstates of A are the same as those of σ_x, just scaled by a factor.

So, to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, and then the square of the coefficients will be the probabilities.

Alternatively, I can diagonalize A and find its eigenvectors, then express |alpha> in that basis.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A. Let's proceed with that.

The operator A is a 2x2 matrix with 0 on the diagonal and ħ/2 on the off-diagonal. So, let's find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

The characteristic equation is det(A - λI) = 0.

So,

| -λ    ħ/2 |
| ħ/2   -λ  | = 0

Which is λ² - (ħ²/4) = 0 → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

The corresponding eigenvectors can be found. Let's take λ = ħ/2.

Then, (A - (ħ/2) I) v = 0.

Which gives:

[ -ħ/2   ħ/2 ] [v1]   [0]
[ ħ/2   -ħ/2 ] [v2]   [0]

From the first equation: -(ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 = 0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to [1, 1]^T. But we need to normalize them.

Wait, the eigenvectors are not normalized yet. Let me compute the normalization factor.

The eigenvectors for λ = ħ/2 is (1,1). The norm is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), so the unit vector is (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)).

Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2, the eigenvectors satisfy (A + (ħ/2) I) v =0.

So:

[ ħ/2    ħ/2 ] [v1]   [0]
[ ħ/2    ħ/2 ] [v2]   [0]

Which leads to (ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 = 0 → v1 = -v2.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to (1, -1)^T. Normalizing gives (1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)).

So the eigenstates of A are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with corresponding eigenvalues ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Wait, wait. Or is it? Let me check: the eigenstates are these, but let's make sure about the signs. When λ is ħ/2, the eigenvector is [1,1], so |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). Similarly for the other.

So, to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate, we can express |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->, and the square of the coefficients will give the probabilities.

But first, we need to normalize |alpha>. Because the question says |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>.

So, the actual state is |alpha> = N [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ], where N is the normalization factor.

Let me compute N. The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1.

So, compute the inner product:

N² [ (1-i)(2 + i) + (2 + i)(1 - i) ) ] = 1.

Wait, let me compute the modulus squared of each term.

Wait, more accurately, the state is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ]. The inner product is:

(1-i)(2 + i) + (2 + i)(1 - i) ?

Wait, no. Let me compute the inner product of the state with itself: (1+i) (1-i) + (2 -i)(2 + i) ?

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because |up> and |down> are orthonormal, their inner product is zero except when they're the same.
