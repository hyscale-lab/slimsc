Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The options are about the allowed decay channels of X into different fermion-antifermion pairs.

Wait, the Lagrangian is given as L = -λ f ψ̄ f (y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, I remember that the interaction term in the Lagrangian tells us which particles can interact and what their couplings are. So the X field is interacting with the fermions f.

But wait, looking at the structure, it's something like ψ̄ (something) ψ. Oh right, that's a Yukawa coupling kind of term. So the X boson is coupling to the fermion ψ with a coupling strength λ. So the interaction term is something like λ X ψ̄ ψ, because the (υ + X) part could be the mass term when X is replaced by its vacuum expectation value, but I'm not entirely sure.

But for decay purposes, what's important is the mass of X and the masses of the fermions it can decay into. Because for a boson to decay into a fermion pair, the combined mass of the fermions must be less than the mass of the boson. So each fermion in the pair must have a mass less than half of X's mass, I think. Because if each is less than half, together they can add up to less than X's mass.

Wait, X's mass is 6 GeV. So each fermion must be less than 3 GeV, because 3 GeV + 3 GeV =6 GeV. So the maximum mass each fermion can have is 3 GeV.

Now, let's list the known fermion masses. Let me recall:

- Electron (e): negligible, ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Up (u): ~0.003 GeV
- Down (d): ~0.0
