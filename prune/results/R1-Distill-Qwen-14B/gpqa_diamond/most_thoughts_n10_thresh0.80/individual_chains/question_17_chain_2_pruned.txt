Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution with EDTA. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and the temperature is 25°C. The stability constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. They're asking for the concentration of calcium ions. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions like calcium. So the complex here is Ca-EDTA, which probably means it's in a 1:1 ratio. So each complex has one Ca²+ ion and one EDTA^4- ion.

Stability constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The formula for the stability constant would be something like K = [CaEDTA^2-]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ). Wait, no. Wait, EDTA is usually in the deprotonated form when it's binding, so the complex is CaEDTA²- or something like that. Let me get that right.

So the formation reaction is: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²-.

The stability constant K would then be [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in this problem, the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So [CaEDTA²-] is 0.02 M. Because the solution is just the complex, right?

So if we let the concentration of the complex be 0.02 M, that's our starting point. Now, we can set up the expression for K.

K = [CaEDTA²-]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ) = 5e10. So 5e10 = 0.02 / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, I'm thinking about the dissociation. The complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. But in solution, the EDTA is usually deprotonated enough to bind the metal. So in this case, maybe the concentration of free EDTA is approximately equal to the concentration of free Ca²+? Or not exactly, but perhaps they are related.

Wait, but
