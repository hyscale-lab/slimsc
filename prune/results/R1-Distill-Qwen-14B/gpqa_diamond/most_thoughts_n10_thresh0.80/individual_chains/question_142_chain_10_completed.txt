Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question gives me the density matrix ρ = 1/2 (|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. Each state corresponds to a point in some space, right?

Wait, I think the Bloch sphere is involved here. The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of qubit states. But wait, density matrices can represent any mixed state, not just pure states. So how does that translate into the Bloch sphere?

I remember that for a pure state |ψ>, the density matrix is |ψ><ψ|. The Bloch vector (r) for a pure state |ψ> = α|0> + β|e^{iθ}β|1> is r = (2αβ*, 2|β|² - 1, θ). Or wait, maybe I got that a bit wrong. Let me think again. The general form for a density matrix for a qubit is:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2,

where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector in 3D space (the Bloch vector). The Pauli matrices are [[1,0],[0,-1]], [[0,1],[1,0]], and [[0,-i],[i,0]] for σx, σy, σz respectively.

So, if I can express the given ρ in terms of I and the Pauli matrices, I can find r.

Given ρ = (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute each term. |0><0| is a diagonal matrix with 1 and 0. Similarly, |1><1| is diagonal with 0 and 1. So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So ρ = (I)/2.

Wait, that's interesting. Because I is the identity, so ρ = I/2. So in terms of the Bloch form, that would be (I + 0·σ)/2. So the r vector must be zero. Because r·σ is 0.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That would place the state at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Wait, but the origin in the Bloch sphere is the completely mixed state. Because for a pure state, the Bloch vector has length 1 (on the surface), and a mixed state would have a vector shorter than that. The completely mixed state (maximally mixed) has a density matrix of I/2 for a qubit, right? Because for a single qubit, the maximally mixed state has no coherence and both diagonal elements are 0.5.

So the density matrix given is the maximally mixed state, which in Bloch sphere terms is at the origin. So the geometrical position is (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. In the Bloch sphere representation, a general qubit density matrix can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(\mathbf{r}\) is the Bloch vector and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given density matrix, it is clear that the term \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}\) must be zero, which implies that \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). 

The Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\) corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere, which represents the completely mixed state. Since the given density matrix is maximally mixed, its geometrical position in the qubit space is at the origin.

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\)**.

Answer: C
