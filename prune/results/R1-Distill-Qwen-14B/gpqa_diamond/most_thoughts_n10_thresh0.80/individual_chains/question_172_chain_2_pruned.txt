Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's see what I remember from my studies.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, I think this has something to do with the Boltzmann distribution because it's about the distribution of particles in energy states, especially in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), which the question mentions.

Right, the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels. The equation is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the energy difference (E_i - E_j) is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but 1.38 is close to Boltzmann's constant, which is k = 1.38e-23 J/K. So E = k * T * something?

Wait, the question says that the excitation is twice as much in star 1. So the ratio n_i1/n_j1 is twice that of n_i2/n_j2. Or maybe the ratio n_i/n_j in star1 is twice that of star2.

Wait, the problem states that the iron atoms in star1 are twice as excited. So the population in the excited state (n_i) is twice that of star2. But wait, I'm not sure. Let me read it again: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited..." So perhaps the number of atoms in the higher energy level in star 1 is twice that in star 2.

Assuming that the statistical weights g_i and g_j are the same for both stars (since it's the same energy levels for iron), then the ratio (n_i/n_j) would depend on the exponential term. So for star 1, (n_i1)/(n_j1) = (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star 2, it's (n_i2)/(n_j2) = same g terms, so same factor, exp( -ΔE/(k
