Okay, so I have this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. But I'm not exactly sure about the details. Let me think.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, wait. Each term here is a projector into the |0> and |1> states, right? So when you take the sum and multiply by 1/2, it's like an equal mixture of the two states.

I think I remember that for a single qubit, the state can be represented on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. But how does the density matrix relate to the Bloch vector?

Oh, right! The density matrix can be written in terms of a Bloch vector r. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and I is the identity matrix. So if I can express the given ρ in this form, I can find r.

Let me write down the given ρ. It's (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. I know that |0><0| is the projector, which in matrix form is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Wait, but then ρ is (I)/2. Oh, so ρ = I/2.

Now, compare this to the general form ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. Let me compute the general form. The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So r·σ would be r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z.

But our ρ is I/2. So set (I + r·σ)/2 equal to I/2. That implies that I + r·σ = I. Subtracting I from both sides, r·σ must be zero. So r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z = zero matrix.

Looking at each component, each Pauli matrix is only zero when their coefficients are zero. So r_x = 0, r_y =0, r_z=0. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That's the origin, which is the completely mixed state. Because for a single qubit, the completely mixed state is I/2, which has no coherence and is at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So that's the answer.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. For a single qubit, the density matrix can generally be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector \(r = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + r_x \sigma_x + r_y \sigma_y + r_z \sigma_z \right),
\]

where \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\), it is evident that the terms involving the Pauli matrices must vanish. This implies \(r_x = 0\), \(r_y = 0\), and \(r_z = 0\), so the Bloch vector is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\). 

This corresponds to the completely mixed state of a qubit, which is located at the origin of the Bloch sphere. Among the given options, the correct geometrical position is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).

Answer: C
