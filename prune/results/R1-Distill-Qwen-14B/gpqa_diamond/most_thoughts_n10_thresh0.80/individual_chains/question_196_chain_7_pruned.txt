Okay, so I've got this problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has maximum speed based on its amplitude and the spring constant. But wait, this is relativistic, so things are probably different because of the speed limits involved.

The question gives me a 1D oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. I need to find the maximum speed v_max. The options are A to D, each with different expressions involving c, k, m, and A.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is calculated using energy conservation. The potential energy at maximum displacement is (1/2)kA², and this converts into kinetic energy at the equilibrium point. So the maximum speed v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m). Looking at the options, option C is exactly that. But wait, this is a relativistic problem, so option C might not be the correct answer.

Relativity comes into play when velocities approach the speed of light. So I probably need to use relativistic mechanics here. I remember that in special relativity, kinetic energy is given by (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, how does this apply to a harmonic oscillator?

Let me think. The total energy in a relativistic harmonic oscillator would include both the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy. At maximum displacement A, the oscillator's velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential. At the equilibrium position (x=0), the potential energy is zero, and all energy is kinetic, which is the maximum kinetic energy.

So the total energy E is the sum of relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy. Wait, wait, actually, in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy isn't just (1/2)kx² anymore. Because when you have relativistic effects, the equations change. Or maybe it's treated differently. Alternatively, perhaps the potential is treated classically, and the kinetic is relativistic. I'm not quite sure.

Wait, maybe the force is given by F = -kx as usual, so the potential is (1/2)kx². But the kinetic energy is relativistic. So the total energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential.

At maximum displacement A, the velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero. So E is
