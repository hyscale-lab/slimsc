Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because these synthesis reaction questions can be tricky. But I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about Compound X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the given options. The data provided are IR and NMR spectra, which should help identify Compound X first.

Looking at the IR data: the peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which probably indicates an -OH stretch (like in a carboxylic acid) or maybe an O-H stretch in another functional group. Wait, but wait, another possibility is an alkene or maybe an amine? Hmm. Then I see 1720 cm-1, which is a strong peak. That's a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or ester or carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks suggest possible aromatic C=C stretching. Oh, right, aromatic rings with substituents can have these peaks.

Now the 1H NMR: Let's analyze each peak. The first peak is at 10.5 ppm, a broad singlet with integration 1H. That's a strong indication of an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid -COOH. The COOH proton is usually around 10-12 ppm, broad because it's usually exchanging rapidly. So that suggests the compound has a carboxylic acid group.

Next, 8.0 ppm is a doublet (d) with 2H. That's likely aromatic protons. So maybe a para-substituted benzene. Let me think, if it's para, then the two protons would be equivalent, leading to a doublet. So perhaps something like para-substituted benzene with substituents in the para positions.

Then 7.2 ppm is another doublet, also 2H. That fits with being another set of equivalent aromatic protons adjacent to substituents. So maybe a structure like para-substituted with two substituents in the para positions. Wait, but wait, if there's a substituent on the ring, the protons next to it would be split. Alternatively, perhaps it's a para-disubstituted benzene, with groups in the para positions. So the aromatic region suggests a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions.

Moving on, the next peak is at 2.9 ppm, a multiplet (m) integrating to 1H. That seems like a methylene group adjacent to something, perhaps in a chain. Maybe a CH group next to a carbonyl? Or maybe part of an isopropyl group or something like that.

At 1.7 ppm, a multiplet with 2H. That's probably another methylene group, maybe next to a carbonyl or near a branching point. 

Then 1.4 ppm is a triplet (d) with 3H. A triplet integrating to 3H suggests a methyl group adjacent to a CH2. Like maybe a CH2CH(CH3) group or similar. Wait, no, a triplet implies two neighboring protons. So perhaps a CH2 connected to a CH(CH3) or something else.

Finally, 0.9 ppm is a triplet with 3H. That's a methyl group attached to something, probably a CH2, like in an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, let's try to imagine the structure of Compound X. The IR suggests a carboxylic acid (the 10.5 ppm peak and the 1720 cm-1 peak for the carbonyl). The aromatic protons suggest a para-substituted benzene. So perhaps a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking at the NMR, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. Benzoic acid has a COOH group, which is usually in the ortho, meta, or para positions. Wait, but if it's para-substituted, the two protons would be in positions 2 and 6, but that's not possible. Wait, no, wait. For a substituent in the para position, the ring would have two substituents opposite each other. So perhaps the substituent is in the para position, and the COOH is at another position. Or maybe the substituent is in one position and the COOH is at another. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the aromatic protons are a doublet each, so maybe a substituent is in the para position and the COOH is in another position. Wait, but where? Let's think. If the substituent is in the para position relative to the COOH, then the ring would have the COOH in position 1 and another group in position 4, for example.

Wait, let me think of the structure. Suppose the benzene ring has a COOH group in one position and another group in the para position. Then the remaining protons would be in the ortho and meta to these substituents.

Wait, but looking at the NMR, the aromatic protons are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests that the ring has two substituents, each in the para position relative to each other. So when you have two substituents in the para positions, the aromatic protons would be two pairs of equivalent protons. For example, if the substituents are in positions 1 and 3, but that's not para. Wait, no, para is positions 1 and 4. So substituents at 1 and 4 would make the ring para-substituted.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are at positions 1 and 4. So substituent A is at position 1, substituent B at position 4. Then the remaining protons would be at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6. But in that case, how would the NMR look?

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a single group that's in a position where it causes the aromatic protons to split into two doublets. For example, if the substituent is in position 4, then the protons at positions 2 and 6 would be one doublet, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 would be another. Wait, but a para substituent would cause the adjacent (ortho) protons to couple, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is in position 4, and the COOH is at position 1. So the structure would be 4-(something)-benzoic acid. Then the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. The substituent at position 4 would cause the protons at 3 and 5 to be equivalent, and the protons at 2 and 6 to be equivalent. So each would be a doublet, and they'd split each other. So, in the NMR, two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That matches the data.

So the aromatic part is a para-substituted benzoic acid. The substituent in position 4 is something else. Now, looking at the other NMR peaks.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. So perhaps a propyl chain attached to the ring. Let me try to think. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is another CH2, and the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) suggest a branching. Hmm, a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) is probably a CH2CH2CH3 group. Wait, wait, 0.9 ppm is usually a CH3 in an ethyl group, as in CH2CH3. So perhaps the chain is something like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH? Or wait, maybe it's a propyl group with branching.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm is a triplet, but wait, the integration is 3H, so that's a CH3 group. The 0.9 triplet (3H) would be a CH2CH3 group. So perhaps it's a CH(CH2CH3) group. Wait, let's think about the multiplets.

So, the 1H NMR has:

- 10.5 (COOH)
- 8.0 (d, 2H)
- 7.2 (d, 2H)
- 2.9 (m, 1H) → maybe a CH adjacent to something
- 1.7 (m, 2H) → maybe another CH2
- 1.4 (d, 3H) → CH3
- 0.9 (t, 3H) → CH2CH3

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent in position 4 is a propyl chain with a branch. Let me see: maybe it's a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the ring. Wait, but that would give a branching point. Let me think.

If the substituent is an isobutyl group, for example, the structure would be something like CH2CH(CH2CH3). But wait, the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 (3H) which is likely the end CH3 of an ethyl group. So maybe it's a CH2CH2CH3 group, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2CH(CH3)2 or something else.

Wait, let me think about the splitting. The 1.4 ppm is a triplet for 3H. Wait, no, wait, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (d) for 3H. Oh, because the formula is (d, 3H). Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, a doublet would imply two neighboring protons. So perhaps the CH3 is attached to a CH that has two neighboring protons. Like in an isopropyl group. For example, a CH(CH3)2 would have the CH's protons split into a septet, but wait, no, perhaps I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, let's think about this: The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, which is adjacent to another CH2 group. Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let me try to visualize. Let's say the substituent is a propyl group with a branch, perhaps a isopropyl group attached to the benzene.

Wait, but considering all the protons, if the substituent is a propyl group, perhaps in the structure it's a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Wait, that might not fit.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a
