Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, we're comparing two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that's the peak wavelength emission, which relates to the star's temperature. Then, the radial velocities are given: Star_1 has 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. 

The question is about the luminosity of Star_1 compared to Star_2. They say the astronomers computed that Star_1 is brighter by a certain factor, and we have to pick the option from the given choices.

Alright, so first things first. I remember that luminosity of a star depends on both its radius and its temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So, L is proportional to R² multiplied by T⁴.

But wait, the problem says that the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. Oh, that must mean they have the same effective temperature. Because the peak wavelength λ_max is related to temperature by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both, their temperatures are the same. So T1 = T2. That makes things easier because T is the same for both stars.

So, since T is the same, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 is (R1²/R2²) * (T1^4/T2^4) → but since T is the same, that factor is 1. So L1/L2 = (R1²)/(R2²). 

Given that R1 is 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. So R1²/R2² is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that would mean L1 is 2.25 times L2. That would point toward option A, which is ~2.25, or option D, which is ~2.23. Wait, but why are the options different? Let me double-check.

Wait, no, wait. Because, the problem mentions radial velocities. Oh, right! Radial velocity could affect the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Oh, wait, but the question says they found the peak wavelengths are the same. So the observed wavelengths are the same, but does the radial velocity affect the star's actual temperature, or just the observed wavelength?

Hmm. Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, its emitted wavelengths are shifted. So if Star_2 has a radial velocity, its emitted peak wavelength would be shifted. But the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same. So maybe we're supposed to correct for the Doppler shift to find the actual temperatures?

Wait, let me think. The peak wavelengths they observed are the same. But if one star is moving towards us and the other away, their actual temperatures might be different. So perhaps the observed lambda_max is the same, but the real lambda_max (and hence temperature) could be different.

Wait no, the problem states: "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So the observed wavelengths are the same. So if one is moving towards us and the other away, their rest wavelengths would be different, but as observed, they're the same. So that would affect the temperature calculation. Because the actual temperature would be different, but our observed peak would be same.

Wait, this sounds a bit tricky. Let me think. Let's model it. Suppose Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, and Star_1 is stationary. According to the Doppler effect, the observed wavelength is shorter (blue shifted) for Star_2. But the problem says both have the same observed wavelength, so maybe Star_1 is moving towards us as well, but the problem says Star_1's radial velocity is zero. Hmm, wait, the question says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2, respectively. So Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s, but in which direction? The problem doesn't specify, but regardless, the observed wavelength depends on the radial velocity.

Wait, but the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same. So perhaps the Doppler shift of Star_2 compensates for the actual temperature difference? Or maybe not, because the actual temperature determines the peak wavelength, and the Doppler shift would alter the observed wavelength, but the problem says the observed are the same.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me go back to the problem statement. It says that the observed wavelengths are the same. So the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. But the actual λ_max is different because of their velocities.

Wait, no, because if the star's emitting at a certain λ_max, but it's moving, then the observed λ_max would change. So if the observed λ_max is the same, but the stars are moving, that would mean their actual (rest) λ_max are different. Therefore, their temperatures are different.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the peak wavelengths are the same, so their temperatures are the same. That was a mistake. Because the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same. So if one star is moving towards us, its observed λ_max is shorter than its rest λ_max. If the other star is moving away, its observed λ_max is longer. But in this case, Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so its observed λ_max is the same as its rest frame. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. So for Star_2, the observed λ_max is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ), where beta is v/c.

Wait, because when a source is moving with velocity v, the observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) ) if moving away (v positive). If moving towards, it's the other way around.

But in this case, Star_1 is stationary, so its λ_obs is same as λ_rest. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Is it moving towards us or away? The problem doesn't specify, but the radial velocity is given as 700 km/s. Radial velocity is positive if moving away, or if moving towards, negative?
