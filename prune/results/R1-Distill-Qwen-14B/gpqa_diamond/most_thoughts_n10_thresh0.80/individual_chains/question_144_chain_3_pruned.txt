Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but let's think it through.

The question gives me E_X as 8 GeV, m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. So I guess this involves some formula related to particle decay lengths.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance of a particle is calculated using its lifetime and velocity. The formula is something like L = v * c * τ, where τ is the mean lifetime. But wait, how do I get τ from the given parameters?

Oh right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy (Γ) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (τ) is on the order of ħ. So Γ * τ ≈ ħ. So τ is approximately ħ / Γ.

But wait, particles don't always decay immediately; their lifetime is the mean lifetime, which relates to the width. Oh, right, the relation is τ = ħ / Γ. Or wait, I think it's τ = ħ / (Γ/2), because Γ is the total decay width, and the lifetime is inversely proportional to the width. So Γ = ħ / τ. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify.

In quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle says ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/(2π). For a particle with a definite lifetime τ, the energy uncertainty ΔE is Γ, the decay width. So Γ * τ ≈ ħ, but considering the exact relation, Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. Wait, no, I might have it backwards. Let me think again: the decay width Γ is the total rate of decay. The mean lifetime τ is Γ^{-1} multiplied by some factors. Oh wait, the relation is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

Okay, so τ is ħ divided by Γ. So once I have τ, I can find the velocity v, and then multiply by c * τ to get the distance.

Wait no, the distance is v multiplied by c * τ? Or is it just v multiplied by τ, but considering units. Let me think: units of velocity (m/s),
