Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics and decay modes of a boson. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question gives me a Lagrangian term: L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think this is describing an interaction between a boson field X and some fermions. The fermions are probably quarks or leptons since the options involve things like b, s, u, d, etc.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So I need to figure out which particles can be produced when X decays, considering conservation laws and energy constraints.

I remember that for a boson to decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because in particle physics, for a particle to decay into two particles, the mass of the original must be greater than or equal to the sum of the masses of the decay products. Since X is a boson, and it's decaying into fermions, each fermion must have a mass less than or equal to half of X's mass.

Wait, but wait. X is a boson, so maybe it's a scalar boson. The decay would be X → f f̄, right? So each fermion must have a mass m such that 2m ≤ 6 GeV. Because 6 GeV is the X mass, so each f's mass must be ≤3 GeV.

But wait, I should think about the actual masses of the particles. Let's list the fermion masses.

- Up quark (u): very light, around 2 MeV, negligible compared to GeV.
- Down quark (d): similar, about 4-5 MeV.
- Strange quark (s): around 95-100 MeV.
- Charm quark (c): around 1.5 GeV.
- Bottom quark (b): around 4.5-5 GeV.
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, about 173 GeV.
- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV.
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV.
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV.
- Also, neutrinos are super light, but since the decay products are pairs, maybe ν and anti-ν? But the given Lagrangian seems to involve charged fermions, as it's written as ψ_f, which I think are Dirac fermions. Oh, but wait, the interaction is given as ψ_f (y) and ψ_{f} (y), which might be the same, so maybe it's a Yukawa coupling.

Wait, the Lagrangian term is -λ f ψ̄_f (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f (y). Wait, I'm a bit confused. Maybe it's ψ̄_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f, but I'm not sure. Oh well, maybe that's not crucial for determining the decay modes. The main point is that X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs if the fermion's mass is less than half of X's mass.

So X is 6 GeV. So each fermion must be ≤3 GeV.

Let me list the fermion masses:

- u: ~2 MeV → yes.
- d: ~5 MeV → yes.
- s: ~100 MeV → yes.
- c: ~1.5 GeV → yes, since 1.5 <3.
- b: ~4.5 GeV → no, because 4.5 >3. So b quarks are too heavy.
- t: 173 GeV → way too heavy.
- e: ~0.5 MeV → yes.
- μ: ~100 MeV → yes.
- τ: ~1.78 GeV → yes, since 1.78 <3.

Wait, but wait. The tau is about 1.78 GeV, so 2m would be ~3.56 GeV, which is more than
