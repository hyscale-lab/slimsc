Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its molecular formula and NMR data, then predicting the product after a series of reactions. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, that's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. Wait, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure.

Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0, so it's (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2. Let me compute that. So 2*8 is 16 plus 2 is 18. 18 minus 9 is 9, plus 1 is 10. Divide by 2, that's 5 degrees. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be from a double bond (1), a ring (1), and maybe some other rings or double bonds, or maybe some aromatic rings. Oh wait, benzene rings would account for 3 degrees each since they have 3 double bonds. So let's think, if there's a benzene ring, that's three degrees, and then another double bond or ring.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm as a triplet, 1H. That's a pretty high chemical shift; maybe an aldehyde proton? Because aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. So maybe it's an aldehyde adjacent to a CH2 group.

Then there's a 6.98 ppm doublet integrating for 2H. Then 6.51 ppm doublet for 2H. Those look like aromatic protons. The 6.98 is more downfield, so maybe para-substituted phenyl groups. Because in a para-substituted benzene, the protons are more deshielded and appear downfield. Wait, but let me think: the 6.98 is a doublet, 2H. If it's a para-substituted benzene, I would expect a doublet of doublets or something else, but maybe coupled with adjacent protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a coupling with another substituent.

Then 6.27 ppm, a broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like an -OH group? But wait, that's 2H. Maybe it's a vinyl group adjacent to an OH group? Or perhaps a diol, but not sure.

Next, 3.66 ppm, a doublet for 2H. That's around where CH2 groups next to oxygen would appear. Maybe an OCH2 group or something similar. So perhaps an ethyl group adjacent to an oxygen.

Putting this together: the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's think about the structure. There's a benzene ring, perhaps. The triplet at 9.72 for 1H suggests maybe a CH2CHO group. Wait, if that's an aldehyde, then maybe the structure is something like Ph-CH
