Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let's try to break this down.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this looks like a 2D metric in terms of x and y coordinates. Oh right, because it's dx² + dy² multiplied by some function. So this is a 2-dimensional manifold, probably a surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space.

Wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere. Pseudosphere... I'm trying to remember. Oh, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? Like the tractricoid, which is the surface of revolution of a tractrix.

But wait, in this metric, I need to figure out what kind of geometry it represents. Let me think about the form of the metric. The general metric for a surface of revolution can be expressed in terms of x and y, but more commonly in polar coordinates. Oh, but this is in Cartesian coordinates. Alternatively, maybe it's conformally flat because the metric is a multiple of (dx² + dy²), which is the standard Euclidean metric.

Conformally flat metrics are those that can be written as f(x,y)(dx² + dy²). The function f here is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So, the geometry is locally like flat space but scaled by this function.

Let me consider the curvature. For a conformally flat metric, the Gaussian
