Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, transiting exoplanets... I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

Wait, the question says both planets are Earth-like and have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 orbits closer to its star since the period is shorter. Also, both have circular orbits.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Oh, interesting. So higher mass but same radius—maybe Planet_1's star is more massive but not larger, which could affect their densities too. But for transit probability, I think the key factors are the size of the planet and the size of the star.

The transit probability formula, if I recall, is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by something else. Wait, no, that's the depth of the transit. The probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit relative to our line of sight. For a circular orbit, the probability is proportional to (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis. Wait, no, I think the transit probability P is given by (R_planet / a) * (something with the impact parameter and all), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is approximately (R_star * sin i) / a, where i is the inclination. But for exoplanets, the maximum probability is when the orbit is edge-on, which is when sin i is 1. So the probability P is (R_star) / (a) multiplied by another factor based on the star's size relative to the orbit.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability for a given star and planet depends on the ratio of the star's radius (R_s) and the planet's orbital distance (a). The formula is roughly (R_s / a)^2 times something else. No, wait, maybe the probability relates to the ratio of the area of the star's disk to the area of the planet's orbital path. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, I think the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / a) * (R_p / R_s), but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (something else). Wait, no, that's the transit depth.

Wait, the actual formula for the probability of a transit is (R_s + R_p) / (a * (1 - e²)^(1/2)), but since both orbits are circular (e=0), it simplifies. So for circular orbits, the transit probability is (R_s + R_p) / a. But wait, maybe for small planets, R_p is negligible compared to R_s. So it becomes approximately R_s / a. So the probability is proportional to R_s / a.

Wait, but wait, no. The transit probability is actually the chance that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is aligned such that it crosses in front of
