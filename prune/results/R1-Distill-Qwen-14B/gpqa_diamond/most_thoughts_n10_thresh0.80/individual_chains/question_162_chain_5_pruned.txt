Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to think this through.

First, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a two-dimensional metric because dx and dy are the differentials. So maybe this is a 2-dimensional spacetime? But the question mentions a pseudosphere, which is a surface in 3D, but perhaps in the context of general relativity, a pseudosphere is a solution in 2D? Or maybe it's just a surface with constant negative curvature.

Wait, pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? Like a saddle shape. The metric given might be representing such a surface. I remember that in 2D, the metric can describe the geometry of a space, and the area can be found by integrating the area element over the surface.

The area element in 2D is dA = sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. So first, I need to write down the metric tensor. The given metric is diagonal, so the components are g_xx and g_yy. Let me see: g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and same for g_yy because dx² + dy² is multiplied by that factor.

So the determinant g would be g_xx * g_yy, since it's diagonal. Since both are same, g = (32/(4 - x² - y²))². Wait, no, wait. The metric tensor for 2D is usually written as:

ds² = g_11 dx² + g_22 dy².

In this case, both g_11 and g_22 are equal to 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant is g_11 * g_22. So determinant g = (32/(4 - r²))^2, since in polar coordinates, x² + y² = r².

Wait, but the metric is expressed in Cartesian coordinates, but maybe switching to polar would make integration easier. Because the area is radially symmetric, I think.

So, let's consider converting to polar coordinates. Let x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then x² + y² = r². The area element in polar coordinates is r dr dθ. But
