Okay, so I have this physics problem about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

So the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R. There's a small cavity inside it, which is also spherical. The center of the cavity is at a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. 

Point P is located at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the center of the cavity is l. Both L and l are greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, I remember something about conductors and charges. Since the conductor is uncharged, the charges inside the cavity must induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. But wait, the conductor was initially neutral. So when we put a charge +q inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface must have an induced charge -q, and the outer surface will have a charge +q to keep the conductor neutral. Oh wait, no, the conductor was uncharged, so the total charge on the conductor is zero. So the inner surface would have -q, and the outer surface would have +q, making the total conductor charge zero. Or wait, am I mixing this up?

Wait, no, the conductor as a whole is neutral. The charge inside the cavity is +q. The inner surface of the conductor (inside the cavity) must have an induced charge of -q, because the conductor's material can't have a net charge inside. So, the cavity's charge +q induces -q on the inner surface. Then, since the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q, because the inner surface is -q. So the conductor as a whole remains neutral because (-q) + (+q) = 0.

But wait, no, the conductor is neutral, so the total induced charge on the conductor must be zero. So if the inner surface has -q, the outer surface must have +q, because the conductor was neutral and the +q inside the cavity is isolated. So the outer shell's charge
