Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules can vibrate and rotate, and their energy states are quantized. The question is about a photon being absorbed, causing the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state. 

The problem gives me the masses of X and Y as 20 amu and 2 amu, respectively. The bond length is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency of vibration is 4e14 rad/s. I need to find the momentum of the absorbed photon.

Wait, let me think. The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. But when a photon is absorbed, it might go to a higher energy state. Since it's a rotation-vibration model, maybe the energy levels come from both rotation and vibration.

But the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, right, the next state would be the next higher energy state overall. So perhaps the molecule is in the ground state of rotation and ground state of vibration, and when it absorbs a photon, it moves to the next higher state, maybe the first excited state of vibration or rotation.

Wait, but in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized, and the vibrational levels are as well. The energy levels for vibration are given by E_vib = (v + ½) ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number. For rotation, E_rot = B J (J+1), where J is the rotational quantum number, and B is the rotational constant.

The fundamental state is v=0 and J=0, I think. So when the molecule absorbs a photon, it can either go to a higher vibrational state (like v=1) or a higher rotational state (like J=1). But the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one with the least energy increase. So which transition has a lower energy requirement?

The vibrational energy difference from v=0 to v=1 is ΔE_vib = (1+½ - 0 -½ ) ħω = ħω. The rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 would be ΔE_rot = B [1(1+1) - 0(0+1)] = 2B, where B is (ℏ²/(2I)) * something. Wait, what's the formula for B? Oh, right, B is (ℏ²)/(2 I R²), where I is the moment of inertia.

Wait, but I need to find the energy of the photon required. The photon's energy must match the energy difference between the states. So first, I should compute the energy differences for both possible transitions and see which is smaller.

Let me calculate both ΔE_vib and ΔE_rot.

First, the angular frequency ω is given as 4e14 rad/s. So ΔE_vib is ħω. ħ is Planck's constant over 2π, approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So ħω ≈ 1.05e-34 * 4e14 = approx 4.22e-20 J. But that's in joules. I might need to relate this to photon momentum, since the question is about momentum.

Wait, the photon's energy is E = p c, where p is momentum and c is speed of light. So p = E/(c). So if I can find the photon's energy, I can find its momentum.

But wait, the other option is the rotational transition. Let's calculate the rotational energy difference.

The moment of inertia I for the molecule is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass. The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Oh, but I need to convert amu to kg. 1 amu is about 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg. Let me compute that: 1.818 * 1.66 ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

Wait, let me calculate it accurately: 1 amu = 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So 1.818 amu is 1.818 * 1.660539e-27. Let me compute that:

1.818 * 1.660539e-27 ≈ (1.8 * 1.66 is about 2.988e-27, but 1.818 is a bit more. Let me compute 1.818 * 1.660539e-27. Hmm, 1.818 * 1.660539 is approximately 1.818*1.66= about 2.999, so around 3.02e-27 kg.

Wait, let me compute 1.818 * 1.660539: 1.818 * 1.660539. 1.8 * 1.66 is 2.988, 0.018 * 1.66 is approx 0.02988. So total is about 3.01788e-27 kg.

Then, I = μ R². R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R=2e-10 m. So R squared is (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So I = 3.01788e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.20715e-46 kg m².

The rotational constant B is (ℏ²)/(2I). Wait, is that correct? Or is it (ℏ^2)/(2I)? Let me recall the formula. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B = (ℏ²)/(2 I). Wait, no, I think B is actually ħ²/(2 I), but sometimes expressed with other factors. Wait, another approach: the rotational constant B is related to
