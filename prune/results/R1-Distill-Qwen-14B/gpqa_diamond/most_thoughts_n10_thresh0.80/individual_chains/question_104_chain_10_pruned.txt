Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet, or the closer it is, I guess.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet similar to Neptune. Both orbits are circular. So, same star masses, same planet masses. The RV method detected shifts in their spectral lines: planet 1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and planet 2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. I need to find how many times longer the orbital period of planet 2 is compared to planet 1.

Wait, the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us. The velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass and the orbital period, I think. The formula I remember is something like K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) )^(1/ something). Wait, maybe I should look up the exact equation.

Oh right, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:
K = ( (G * (M_p)^3 sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 * (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P * c))^(1/3) )

Wait wait, no, that's probably not right. Alternatively, the formula I think is K = (v) = [ (G * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (1) / (P) )^(1/3) )

Wait wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Another approach: the formula for K is K = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) / c, maybe? Wait, no. Alternatively, the formula is K = (v) = (
