Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully and breaking it down.

The problem describes a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. The reaction is violent and produces gas W, a precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K, which I know is about 4 degrees Celsius. That temperature is close to the melting point of ice, but I'm not sure if that's relevant yet.

Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm, equal numbers of protons and neutrons. Let me think about possible gases. Common gases include CO2, H2O, maybe NH3, but wait: the molecule needs to have equal protons and neutrons. Let's see:

Wait, gas W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So each molecule's total protons and total neutrons are equal? Or each atom in the molecule?

Wait, the problem says the gas W's molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. So for each molecule, the total number of neutrons equals the total number of protons.

Wait, but protons are in the nucleus, neutrons too. So for a molecule, the sum of protons from all atoms equals the sum of neutrons from all atoms in that molecule.

Wait, but that seems tricky. Maybe it's referring to each molecule having equal numbers of protons and neutrons, like a molecule where each atom contributes to this. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is made up of atoms where each atom has equal protons and neutrons. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is something like O2 or N2, but I don't think that fits. Wait, another approach: maybe the molecule is H2O. Let's see: H2O has 2 H's and one O. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. O normally has 8 protons and 8 neutrons for the most common isotope (O-16). So total protons: 2*(1) + 8 =10. Neutrons: 2*0 + 8=8. Wait, not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe it's CO2? Each CO2 molecule has one C and two O's. C has 6 protons
