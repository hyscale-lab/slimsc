Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

Alright, the scenario is about a star similar to the Sun. The star has dark spots covering one hemisphere, and the spots have a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. When the star rotates, these spots cause brightness variations that can mimic an exoplanet transit. The question is asking what the radius of an exoplanet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the spots do.

Wait, so I think the key here is to compare the change in brightness caused by the planet transiting the star with the change caused by the spots. Since the problem states that the star isn't covered by spots in the alternative scenario (so just the planet), we need to calculate the planet's radius relative to the star's radius.

Hmm, I remember that the change in brightness during a transit is given by the formula (Rp / Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet's radius and Rstar is the star's radius. That's because the area blocked by the planet is a fraction of the star's area.

But wait, in this case, the star has spots. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view from our perspective. The spots are cooler, so when they face us, the star appears dimmer than when they're not visible.

So the brightness variation caused by the spots isn't just about blocking light but about the change in the star's total light output as different parts of its surface come into view. The star's overall brightness depends on the sum of the flux from each part of its surface.

The star's flux without any spots is given by its effective temperature. The spots have a lower temperature, so each spot emits less flux. The filling factor is 0.2, meaning 20% of one hemisphere is covered by spots.

Wait, the star's total flux without spots is σTeff^4 multiplied by the surface area. When spots are present, each spot contributes σ(Teff - ΔT)^4, right? But the spots cover a fraction f of the surface.

Wait, no. The filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. So the total flux when the spots are facing us would be the sum of the flux from the spotted area and the rest of the star.

So the star's total flux when spots are visible is F_total = F_unspotted + F_spots.

F_unspotted is (1 - f) * 4π Rstar^2 σ Teff^4. Wait no, maybe I should think of it per unit area. Wait, the flux from the star (without spots) is F0 = σ Teff^4 multiplied by the surface area (which is 4π Rstar²). But when spots are present, part of the surface is cooler.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the change in brightness when the spots are present compared to when they're not.

The flux from the unspotted parts is (1 - f) * F0, assuming F0 is the flux per unit area at Teff. The flux from
