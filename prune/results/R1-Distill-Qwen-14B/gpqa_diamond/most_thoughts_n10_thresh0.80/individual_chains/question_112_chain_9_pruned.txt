Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll give it a go.

Alright, the state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because probabilities depend on the state being normalized. The state is a linear combination of |up> and |down>, which are orthonormal eigenstates of the spin-z operator.

Let me write the state: |alpha> = c_up |up> + c_down |down>, where c_up is (1+i) and c_down is (2-i).

The normalization condition is |c_up|^2 + |c_down|^2 = 1. So let me calculate the magnitudes.

|c_up|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the magnitude squared of (1+i) is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2? Because for a complex number a+ib, |a+ib|^2 = a² + b². So yes, that's right.

Similarly, |c_down|^2 is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5.

So the total magnitude squared is 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the normalized state would be |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7). But the question says it's proportional to that, so the actual state is that divided by sqrt(7) because the coefficients are not normalized yet. Wait, no, the state is given as proportional, so I need to normalize it by dividing by sqrt(7), so that the sum of the squared magnitudes is 1.

So, the state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the next part is about the operator with matrix elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, what's the size of the matrix? Since we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles, the state space is two-dimensional, so the matrix is 2x2.

So the operator matrix looks like:

[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0   ]

Wait, because for i≠j, A_ij is hbar/2. So diagonal elements are zero, and off-diagonal are hbar/2.

Wait, but wait, the operator is acting on the spin states. So the eigenstates of this operator are important because when we measure the operator, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this operator and express |alpha> in terms of those eigenvectors. Then, the probability of measuring each eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in |alpha>.

Alternatively, since the operator is 2x2, maybe it's easier to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Let me compute the eigenvalues. The matrix is:

[[0, hbar/
