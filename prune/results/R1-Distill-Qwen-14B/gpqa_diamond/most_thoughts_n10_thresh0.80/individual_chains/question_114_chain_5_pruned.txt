Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to these kinds of reaction mechanisms, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about selecting the suitable reagents for two different reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with a reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving possible A and B reagents. Let's break down each reaction.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one (which is methylacetone, I think) reacting with NaCN and reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic substitution. But wait, ketones typically don't have good leaving groups unless something activates the carbonyl. Oh wait, maybe it's a case of enamine synthesis or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic addition.

Wait, but NaCN is a nucleophile. So maybe this is a cyanide adding to the carbonyl group. But in ketones, the carbonyl isn't very reactive towards nucleophilic addition as in aldehydes, unless the conditions are such that it's possible. Alternatively, maybe it's an example of the formation of an enol, which can then react.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. But for that, the carbonyl group would need to be converted into a better leaving group. Oh! Maybe it's a situation where the ketone is treated with a hydride source, but wait, that's for reductions.

Wait, wait, another thought: perhaps it's a condensation reaction. Or maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh yeah! Cyanohydrin formation. I think that's when a nucleophile attacks a carbonyl group, and then a proton is added. The product is a geminal diol with a nitrile group.

So, the reaction would involve the addition of cyanide ion to the ketone. The mechanism would be: the ketone's carbonyl oxygen attacks the cyanide, leading to a tetrahedral intermediate, then a proton is added to form the alcohol. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

But wait, how are the conditions set up for this? Cyanide is a strong nucleophile, but in the presence of a strong acid, perhaps. Because the mechanism for cyanohydrin formation usually involves some acid catalysis. So the reagent A might be H3O+ (like a strong acid) to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, facilitating the attack by the cyanide.

So in the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN + H3O+ would produce the cyanohydrin. Therefore, reagent A is H3O+.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with H2O and reagent B to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is converting into a carboxylic acid (-COOH).

Wait, how does that happen? I know that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. Under acidic conditions, typically, you get amides or acids. Wait, the hydrolysis of nitriles can be done in a couple of ways. One way is using strong acid and water, which would give a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, using a base would give a carboxylate, which can then be acidified.

Looking at the structure, the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So when we hydrolyze the nitrile group, we want
