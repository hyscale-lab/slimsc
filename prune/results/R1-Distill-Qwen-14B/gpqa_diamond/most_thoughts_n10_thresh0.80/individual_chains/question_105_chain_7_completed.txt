Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the question is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the star's surface is covered by these spots. The star's effective temperature, Teff, is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, I guess, because they're dark. The temperature difference between the spots and the rest of the star is 1000 K. Hmm, so if the star is 6000 K, the spots must be 5000 K?

The setup is that when only one hemisphere has spots, when we observe the star from Earth, as it rotates, the brightness variations we see would look similar to those caused by an exoplanet transiting in front of the star. So the question is asking, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variations as these spots do?

The options are A) 0.39, B) 0.07, C) 0.11, D) 0.32. All of these are fractions of the host star's radius, I suppose.

I remember that the transit method for detecting exoplanets involves a planet passing in front of the star, blocking some of the star's light. The depth of the dip in brightness is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius. So the formula I think is ΔF = (R_planet / R_star)^2, where ΔF is the fractional change in brightness.

But wait, in this case, it's not a planet, but star spots. So how do star spots contribute to the observed brightness variation?

Well, when a star with spots rotates, the spots come into and out of view. The brightness change would depend on the area of the spots and their temperature compared to the rest of the star.

The observed brightness from the star is the sum of the brightness from all the regions on its surface. Brightness per unit area is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: B = σ T^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So, the total flux from the star without spots would be F = σ T_star^4 * π R_star^2. But with spots, some fraction of the surface is cooler. The flux would then decrease when the spots are facing us, because their emission is lower.

But in the case of the star, the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, sometimes the spotted side is facing us, and sometimes the unspotted side is. Wait, no, because the star is rotating, so the spots would come into view in a way similar to a planet transiting. Wait, but the spots are on only one hemisphere, so as the star rotates, the amount of spotted area visible would change depending on the viewing angle. Hmm, but perhaps for this problem, we can model it as when the star rotates, the flux from the spots comes into and out of view as a function of time, similar to a planet's transit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying it by considering that when the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots block a certain amount of light, and when the other hemisphere is facing, the spots are on the far side, so their effect on the observed flux is the same as not being there.

Wait, but the star's rotation would cause the spots to come into view as the star spins. So when the star's rotation brings the spotted side into view, the total flux would decrease because the spots are darker. So the variation in flux would be similar to that of a planet transiting the star.

The key here is that the observed brightness variation from the spots is being compared to the variation caused by a planet. So the problem is to find the radius of a planet that would cause the same fractional change in brightness as the spots do.

So let's model the two scenarios.

First, the planet transit scenario. The fractional change in flux (ΔF) is (R_p / R_s)^2, assuming the planet transits directly in front of the star and blocks some of the light.

In the star spot scenario: when the spots are on the near side of the star (facing us), the flux is lower. The fractional change in flux would be related to the area of the spots and the temperature difference.

So, let's compute the fractional change in flux caused by the spots.

The filling factor is 20%, which is 0.2. So 20% of the star's surface is covered by spots. Each spot has a temperature of T_spot = T_star - 1000 K = 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K.

The total flux from the star when spots are on the near side is F = (F_unspotted * (1 - filling factor)) + (F_spotted * filling factor).

Wait, but wait. The total flux without any spots is F0 = σ T^4 * π R^2.

With spots, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F = (unspotted area's flux) + (spotted area's flux).

The unspotted area is (1 - filling factor) * π R^2, but wait no. The filling factor is the fraction of the surface area covered by spots. So the surface area of the star is 4 π R^2. So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 4 π R^2. Wait, no. Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered. So when the star is viewed such that the entire spotted hemisphere is visible, the area of the spots is 0.2 * 4π R^2? No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as: each spot covers a certain fraction of the visible hemisphere. But perhaps it's better to model the flux when the spots are in view.

Wait, another approach. The fractional change in flux when the spots are on the star's near side is the difference between the flux without any spots and the flux with spots on the near side.

So the flux without spots is F0 = σ T^4 * 4 π R^2 (since the entire surface is at T).

When the spots are on the near side, the flux is F = (flux from unspotted regions) + (flux from spotted regions).

The unspotted regions are (1 - 0.2) of the surface, but wait, wait. The filling factor is 0.2, so 20% of the entire surface is covered by spots. So when you look at the star, you see that 20% of its surface is spots, and 80% is normal.

Wait, but when the star is viewed from Earth, only one hemisphere is visible. Hmm, but in reality, when the star is rotating, at any given time, we see half of the star (the near side). So if the spots are on one hemisphere, that hemisphere includes 20% of the entire star's surface. So when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots are covering 0.2 * 2 * π R^2? Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the spots are on one hemisphere, which is 50% of the star's surface. But the filling factor is 20% within that hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2π R^2), which is the area of a hemisphere.

Wait, but the filling factor is the fraction of the star's entire surface that is covered by spots. So the total area of the spots is 0.2 * 4 π R^2. Since the star is a sphere, the total surface is 4 π R². So the spots cover 0.2 * 4 π R² = 0.8 π R².

But each hemisphere (the front and the back) is 2 π R². So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots on it contribute to the observed flux. The area of the spots in the visible hemisphere is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, no, because the filling factor is 0.2 of the entire star. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 4 π R² = 0.8 π R². So when looking at a hemisphere, the spots that are in that hemisphere would be 0.8 π R² divided by 2, which is 0.4 π R².

So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_visible = (unspotted area) * σ T^4 + (spotted area) * σ (T_spot)^4.

The unspotted area in the visible hemisphere is (2 π R² - 0.4 π R²) = 1.6 π R². So the flux from the unspotted part is 1.6 π R² * σ T^4.

The flux from the spotted part is 0.4 π R² * σ (T_spot)^4.

So the total flux when we see the spotted hemisphere is F_spotted = [1.6 T^4 + 0.4 (T_spot)^4 ] * σ π R² / π R² ? Wait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me calculate:

The total flux from the visible hemisphere (without any spots) would be 2 π R² * σ T^4. With spots, some areas are cooler.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the average flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible compared to when it's not.

The average flux when the spots are visible is F1 = (fraction_unspotted * T^4 + fraction_spotted * T_spot^4) * σ * (area of each region).

Wait, let's compute F1 and F0 (the flux without any spots) and find the difference.

F0 = σ T^4 * 4 π R² / 2 → because we're considering the light from the entire star, but when only one hemisphere is visible, the flux is from 2 π R². Wait, perhaps I should think differently. No, when the star emits, we get the sum of all the flux from the entire surface. So F0 = σ T^4 * 4 π R². When the star has spots covering 20% of its surface, and those spots are at T_spot = 5000 K, then the total flux is F_spotted = (0.8 * T^4 + 0.2 * T_spot^4) * σ * 4 π R².

Wait, no. Because the spots are on one hemisphere, when that hemisphere is visible, the flux from the spots is their contribution. But when the other hemisphere is visible, the spots are on the far side, so their contribution is not visible. So the observed flux would vary as the star rotates, bringing different hemispheres into view.

Wait, but the problem states that the spots are on one hemisphere. So, when that hemisphere is visible, the observed flux would be lower. The other hemisphere has no spots, so when that's visible, the flux is normal.

So the maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, F_max = F0 (normal flux).

The minimum flux is when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, F_min = (flux from unspotted part of that hemisphere) + (flux from spotted part).

Wait, but the spotted hemisphere is 50% of the surface. So within that hemisphere, 20% is covered by spots. So the area of the spots in the visible hemisphere is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

So F_min = (flux from unspotted part of the visible hemisphere) + (flux from spotted part).

The unspotted area in the visible hemisphere is 2 π R² - 0.4 π R² = 1.6 π R².

So F_min = [1.6 π R² * σ T^4 + 0.4 π R² * σ (T_spot)^4 ].

F0 is the flux without any spots, which is 4 π R² * σ T^4.

Wait, no. Because when the star is not covered by spots, the flux is F0 = 4 π R² σ T^4. But when part of the star (a hemisphere) is covered by spots, the flux when that hemisphere is visible is F_min.

Wait, but the problem says that the star has a filling factor of 20% of spots on one hemisphere. So when that hemisphere is visible, only those spots are contributing less flux. So the total flux in that case is:

F_min = (flux from unspotted areas on the visible hemisphere) + (flux from spotted areas on the visible hemisphere).

The unspotted area on the visible hemisphere is (1 - 0.2) * 2 π R². Wait, no. Wait, the entire star has 0.2 of its surface covered with spots. So each hemisphere is 2 π R², and the spots cover 0.2 * 4 π R² = 0.8 π R². So each hemisphere (assuming the spots are all on one hemisphere) would have all 0.8 π R² in that hemisphere? No, because the spots cover 20% of the entire star. So if the spots are all on one hemisphere, that hemisphere has 0.2 * 4 π R² = 0.8 π R², but each hemisphere is 2 π R². So that would mean that the spotted hemisphere has 0.8 π R² of spots, and the other hemisphere has none.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The star's total surface is 4 π R². The spots cover 0.2 of that, so 0.2 * 4 π R² = 0.8 π R². So if all the spots are on one hemisphere, that hemisphere (which has a surface area of 2 π R²) has 0.8 π R² of spots. So the fraction of the visible hemisphere covered by spots is 0.8 π R² / 2 π R² = 0.4, or 40%.

So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux from that hemisphere is:

F_spotted_hemi = (flux from unspotted area) + (flux from spots).

The unspotted area in the visible hemisphere is 2 π R² - 0.8 π R² = 1.2 π R². So the flux from this is 1.2 π R² * σ T^4.

The flux from the spots is 0.8 π R² * σ (T_spot)^4.

So F_spotted_hemi = [1.2 T^4 + 0.8 (T_spot)^4 ] * σ π R² ?

Wait, no, because the entire hemisphere's area is 2 π R². So the flux from the unspotted part is (2 π R² - 0.8 π R²) * σ T^4 = 1.2 π R² σ T^4. The flux from the spots is 0.8 π R² σ (T_spot)^4.

So F_spotted_hemi = [1.2 T^4 + 0.8 (T_spot)^4 ] * σ π R² ?

Wait, no. The total flux is (1.2 π R²) * σ T^4 + (0.8 π R²) * σ (T_spot)^4.

Similarly, when the other hemisphere is visible (unspotted), the flux is F_unspotted_hemi = 2 π R² σ T^4.

So the maximum flux is F_unspotted_hemi = 2 π R² σ T^4.

The minimum flux is F_spotted_hemi = [1.2 π R² T^4 + 0.8 π R² (T_spot)^4 ] * σ.

Wait, no, σ is a constant, so it's a factor in both terms.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the fractional change in flux.

The fractional change when the spotted hemisphere is visible is (F_spotted_hemi - F_unspotted_hemi) / F_unspotted_hemi.

Wait, wait, no, actually, the fractional dip is (F_unspotted_hemi - F_spotted_hemi) / F_unspotted_hemi.

Because F_spotted_hemi is less than F_unspotted_hemi, so the dip is the difference over F_unspotted_hemi.

So let me compute that.

F_unspotted = 2 π R² σ T^4.

F_spotted = [1.2 π R² σ T^4 + 0.8 π R² σ (T_spot)^4 ].

So the difference is F_unspotted - F_spotted = 2 π R² σ T^4 - [1.2 π R² σ T^4 + 0.8 π R² σ (T_spot)^4 ]

= (2 - 1.2) π R² σ T^4 - 0.8 π R² σ (T_spot)^4

= 0.8 π R² σ T^4 - 0.8 π R² σ (T_spot)^4

= 0.8 π R² σ [ T^4 - (T_spot)^4 ]

So the fractional dip is this difference divided by F_unspotted.

= [0.8 π R² σ (T^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / [2 π R² σ T^4 ]

The π R² σ terms cancel out.

So we get (0.8 (T^4 - T_spot^4 )) / (2 T^4 )

Simplify:

= (0.8 / 2) * (T^4 - T_spot^4 ) / T^4

= 0.4 * [ 1 - (T_spot / T )^4 ]

Plugging in T = 6000 K, T_spot = 5000 K.

Compute (T_spot / T) = (5000/6000) = 5/6 ≈ 0.833333.

(5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 ≈ 0.517747.

Multiply by 0.4: 0.4 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.2071.

So the fractional dip is ≈ 20.71%.

Wait, but that would be a dip of about 20.7% when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

In the planet transit scenario, the dip is (R_p / R_star)^2.

So we set (R_p / R_star)^2 = 0.2071.

So R_p = R_star * sqrt(0.2071).

Compute sqrt(0.2071). Let's see, sqrt(0.25) is 0.5, sqrt(0.16)=0.4. So 0.2071 is between 0.16 and 0.25. Let's compute it more accurately.

0.45^2 = 0.2025. Close to 0.2071.

0.45^2=0.2025. 0.458^2 = ?

458^2 = (450+8)^2 = 450² + 2*450*8 +8² = 202500 + 7200 +64=209764. So 0.458^2=0.209764.

Wait, but 0.458^2=0.209764 which is slightly above 0.2071.

Wait, the value we have is 0.2071.

Let me find x where x²=0.2071.

x ≈ 0.455.

Because 0.455^2 = (0.45 + 0.005)^2 = 0.45² + 2*0.45*0.005 +0.005² = 0.2025 + 0.0045 + 0.000025 = 0.207025. Close to 0.2071.

So x≈0.455.

So R_p/R_star ≈ 0.455.

Wait, but looking at the options:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Hmm, none of the options are close to 0.45. So wait, am I making a mistake here?

Wait, the problem says that the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots is the same as that from a planet. So the fractional change in brightness is the same in both cases.

Wait, but I think I might have miscalculated the fractional dip. Let me double-check.

Wait, in the scenario where the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotted_hemi = [1.2 T^4 + 0.8 (T_spot)^4 ] * π R² σ.

But wait, earlier I thought the hemisphere's area is 2 π R², so when the spots are on the visible hemisphere, the area for the unspotted part is 1.2 π R² (because the total area is 2 π R², and 0.8 π R² is spotted). Hmm, maybe I messed up the calculation somewhere.

Wait, let's re-do the flux calculations correctly.

The star's total surface area is 4 π R². The spots cover 0.2 of that, so 0.8 π R².

When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the area of the spots we see is 0.8 π R² (since they're all on that hemisphere).

So the flux from the unspotted part of the visible hemisphere is:

(2 π R² - 0.8 π R²) * σ T^4 = 1.2 π R² σ T^4.

The flux from the spotted part is 0.8 π R² σ (T_spot)^4.

So the total flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is F_spotted = 1.2 π R² σ T^4 + 0.8 π R² σ (T_spot)^4.

The flux when the unspotted hemisphere is visible is F_unspotted = 2 π R² σ T^4.

The difference is F_unspotted - F_spotted = (2 π R² σ T^4) - (1.2 π R² σ T^4 + 0.8 π R² σ (T_spot)^4 )

= (0.8 π R² σ T^4) - (0.8 π R² σ (T_spot)^4 )

= 0.8 π R² σ [ T^4 - (T_spot)^4 ]

The fractional dip is this difference divided by F_unspotted.

So:

Fractional dip = [0.8 π R² σ (T^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / [2 π R² σ T^4 ]

= (0.8 / 2) * (T^4 - T_spot^4 ) / T^4

= 0.4 * [1 - (T_spot / T )^4 ]

As before.

So 0.4 * [1 - (5000/6000)^4 ].

Compute (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 = (625/1296) ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 ≈ 0.517747.

Multiply by 0.4: 0.4 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.2071.

So the fractional dip is about 0.2071, or 20.71%.

In the planet transit scenario, ΔF = (R_p / R_star)^2.

So (R_p / R_star)^2 = 0.2071 → R_p / R_star ≈ sqrt(0.2071) ≈ 0.455.

But looking at the options, the closest is option A) ~0.39, but that's lower than 0.455. Hmm. None of the options are around 0.45. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem models the situation differently. Maybe the spots are only on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view but from a single side, leading to a different kind of variation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not accounting for the entire hemisphere but just the fraction of the surface covered on the hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps the spots cover 20% of the star's surface, but since they're on one hemisphere, when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots contribute less flux, and when it's away, the flux is normal.

Wait, but the calculation I did earlier assumes that when the spotted hemisphere is visible, all the spots are visible, and when it's not, the spots are on the far side. So the fractional dip is 20.7% when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

But perhaps the problem is considering that when the star is observed, the spots are only on the hemisphere that's facing us, which is 50% of the star's surface. So the area of spots is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

In that case, when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F = (2 π R² - 0.4 π R²) σ T^4 + 0.4 π R² σ T_spot^4.

So F = 1.6 π R² σ T^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (T_spot)^4.

F_unspotted is when the other hemisphere is visible: 2 π R² σ T^4.

The dip would be F_unspotted - F_spotted = 2 π R² σ T^4 - [1.6 π R² σ T^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (T_spot)^4 ]

= (0.4 π R² σ T^4 ) - (0.4 π R² σ (T_spot)^4 )

= 0.4 π R² σ (T^4 - T_spot^4 )

Fractional dip: [0.4 π R² σ (T^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / [2 π R² σ T^4 ]

Simplify: (0.4 / 2) * (T^4 - T_spot^4 ) / T^4 = 0.2 * [1 - (T_spot/T)^4 ].

That's 0.2 * [1 - (5/6)^4 ].

Compute (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 ≈ 0.517747.

0.2 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.1035.

So the fractional dip is approximately 10.35%.

Hmm, that's about 10.35% dip. Now, comparing to the planet transit scenario.

ΔF = (R_p / R_star)^2 = 0.1035 → R_p ≈ sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217 → ~0.32.

Wait, that's option D) ~0.32.

So perhaps I made a mistake earlier in considering the area of the spots. Because if the filling factor is 20% of the star's entire surface, then when the hemisphere is viewed, the area of the spots visible is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R², not 0.8 π R² as I thought earlier.

Wait, because the total surface area is 4 π R². So 20% of that is 0.8 π R² for the entire star. But if all the spots are on one hemisphere, then when that hemisphere is viewed, you see all 0.8 π R² of the spots. But if the spots are spread across the entire star, then when viewing a hemisphere, you'd only see half of the spots. Oh wait, but the problem states that one hemisphere is completely covered with spots. Wait, no, the problem says "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." That suggests that the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere's area.

Ah, this is where I went wrong earlier. The filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So, in the case where the spots are entirely on one hemisphere, the filling factor for that hemisphere is 20%.

So the area of the spots within the hemisphere is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F = (2 π R² - 0.4 π R²) σ T^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (T_spot)^4.

So F = 1.6 π R² σ T^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (T_spot)^4.

The maximum flux (when the unspotted hemisphere is visible) is F_unspotted = 2 π R² σ T^4.

The difference is F_unspotted - F_spotted = 2 π R² σ T^4 - [1.6 π R² σ T^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (T_spot)^4 ]

= 0.4 π R² σ T^4 - 0.4 π R² σ (T_spot)^4.

= 0.4 π R² σ (T^4 - T_spot^4 )

The fractional dip is this divided by F_unspotted.

So (0.4 π R² σ (T^4 - T_spot^4 )) / (2 π R² σ T^4 ) = (0.4/2) * (T^4 - T_spot^4 ) / T^4 = 0.2 * [1 - (T_spot / T)^4 ].

Now, T=6000, T_spot=5000. So (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.482253.

1 - 0.482253 ≈ 0.517747.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.2 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.10355.

So the fractional dip is approximately 10.355%.

In the planet scenario, ΔF = (R_p / R_star)^2 = 0.10355.

So R_p = R_star * sqrt(0.10355) ≈ R_star * 0.3218.

Which is approximately 0.32, which is option D.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve as the observed brightness variation caused by the star spots, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} \) (same as the Sun).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a **filling factor of 20%**.
   - Spots have a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The star's total surface area is \( 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \), and the spots cover 20% of this area, i.e., \( 0.2 \times 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.8 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).
   - Since the spots are entirely on one hemisphere, when this hemisphere is visible, the area of the spots visible is \( 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \) (as each hemisphere has an area of \( 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \)).

3. **Flux Calculations**:
   - **Maximum Flux** (\( F_{\text{unspotted}} \)): When the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is:
     \[
     F_{\text{unspotted}} = 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4
     \]
   - **Minimum Flux** (\( F_{\text{spotted}} \)): When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is:
     \[
     F_{\text{spotted}} = \left( 1.6 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \right) + \left( 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4 \right)
     \]
     Here, \( 1.6 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \) is the unspotted area of the visible hemisphere, and \( 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \) is the spotted area.

4. **Fractional Brightness Dip**:
   - The fractional dip in brightness when the spotted hemisphere is visible is:
     \[
     \Delta F = \frac{F_{\text{unspotted}} - F_{\text{spotted}}}{F_{\text{unspotted}}}
     \]
     Substituting the expressions for \( F_{\text{unspotted}} \) and \( F_{\text{spotted}} \):
     \[
     \Delta F = \frac{0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma \left( T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4 \right)}{2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4}
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     \Delta F = 0.2 \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right)
     \]
     Substituting \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \):
     \[
     \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} = \frac{5000}{6000} = \frac{5}{6}, \quad \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.482253
     \]
     \[
     \Delta F = 0.2 \left( 1 - 0.482253 \right) = 0.2 \times 0.517747 \approx 0.10355
     \]

5. **Planet Transit Brightness Variation**:
   - The fractional brightness dip caused by a planet transiting the star is:
     \[
     \Delta F = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
     \]
     Setting this equal to the fractional dip caused by the spots:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.10355
     \]
     Solving for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218
     \]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately **0.32**. This corresponds to **Option D**.
