Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the different complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. The options are A to D.

Wait, what's a stability constant again? Oh right, the stability constant (β) is a measure of the stability of a complex. It represents the equilibrium between the metal ion and the ligand(s) forming the complex. A higher β means a more stable complex.

So, the complexes here are Co(SCN)_n, where n can be 1 to 4, I suppose. The stability constants increase up to β3 and then decrease at β4. Wait, β3 is 63, which is higher than β2=40 and β4=16. So, maybe the most stable is the [Co(SCN)_3]^2- complex, which is the one with three SCN- ions attached.

The question specifically asks about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ions per Co^2+ ion. So, the complex [Co(SCN)_2]^0 or something like that. Wait, but wait, the color (blue) usually refers to the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- or [Co(SCN)_2]^0? Hmm, I remember that the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is blue. Or wait, no, [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is blue, but wait, the problem says dithiocyanato, which is two SCN- ions. So maybe [Co(SCN)_2]^(2-)? Or something else.

Alternatively, the complexes are Co(SCN)_1, Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3, and Co(SCN)_4. Wait, but the charge would depend on the number of SCN- ions.
