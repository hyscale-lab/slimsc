Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with light and moving media, things get a bit tricky because of relativity, but wait, maybe this is a non-relativistic case since the speeds involved are probably much less than the speed of light.

Let me read the question again. A light beam is moving through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab.

Wait, the speed of light in glass is normally c/n, right? Because the refractive index n is c divided by the speed of light in the medium. So in the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at v_light = c/n.

But the glass is moving towards the observer. So I think this is a case where I need to consider the relative velocities. But wait, in classical mechanics, velocities add up linearly, but does that apply here? Because when dealing with light, which is an electromagnetic wave, maybe the addition is different.

Wait, no, the problem says the speed of light in vacuum is c=1, so perhaps we're working in units where c=1. So the speed of light in the glass is 1/n.

But now, the glass is moving at velocity v. How does that affect the speed of the light as observed in the lab?

Wait, in the lab frame, the glass is moving. The light is moving through the glass, so I think I should consider
