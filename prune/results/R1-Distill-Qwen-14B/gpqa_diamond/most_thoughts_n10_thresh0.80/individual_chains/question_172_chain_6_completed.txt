Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. I remember that the photosphere is the layer of a star where photosynthesis happens, but wait, no, that's plants. Oh right, the photosphere is the outermost layer of a star where light is emitted. So the question is about two stars, star_1 and star_2, and their iron atoms in the photosphere.

The problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're told that the photospheres are in LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, that means each small region of the photosphere behaves like a blackbody at a certain temperature.

Hmm, I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution here. The Boltzmann factor relates the number of particles in different energy states to the temperature. The formula is something like n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

In this case, the energy levels are E_i and E_j. Since the energy difference is given as delta E = 1.38e-23 J, that would be E_i - E_j. Let's say for star 1, the number of excited atoms is twice that of star 2 for the same energy level. Or wait, the problem says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. Oh, right, so for a specific energy level, the excitation is higher.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the ionization or excitation state. The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state to a lower state depends on temperature. So, if star_1 has twice as many in the excited state as star_2, how does that relate to their temperatures?

Let me think. The ratio would be n1/n2 = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T') ), where T is temperature of each star. Wait, no, each star has its own temperature. So for each star, the ratio of the excited state to a lower state is given by the Boltzmann factor.

So for star_1: n1 = (g_i/g_j) * exp(-ΔE/(k T_1)) * something. Wait, maybe I should write the ratio for each star.

Let me denote for star_1: the ratio of atoms in the excited state (let's say level i) to the ground (level j) is (n_i)_1 / (n_j)_1 = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T_1) )

Similarly, for star_2: (n_i)_2 / (n_j)_2 = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T_2) )

But the problem says that the excited level in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2. Wait, but are they comparing the same energy levels, so g_i and g_j are the same for both stars? I think so, because it's the same element, iron, so the energy levels are the same.

So the ratio for each star is (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

But the problem states that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Wait, no, the question says the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So I think the ratio (n_i)_1/(n_j)_1 = 2 * [ (n_i)_2/(n_j)_2 ]

So substituting the Boltzmann expressions:

(g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T_1) ) = 2 * (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T_2) )

The (g_i/g_j) terms cancel out since they're same for both stars.

So exp( -ΔE/(k T_1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T_2) )

Hmm, let's take the natural logarithm of both sides to solve for T_1 and T_2.

ln [ exp( -ΔE/(k T_1) ) ] = ln [ 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T_2) ) ]

Which simplifies to:

-ΔE/(k T_1) = ln(2) + [ -ΔE/(k T_2) ]

Wait, using the property that ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b), so ln(2 exp(x))= ln 2 + x.

So rearranging:

-ΔE/(k T_1) + ΔE/(k T_2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T_2) - 1/(T_1) ] = ln(2)

Hmm, but I can write 1/T_2 - 1/T_1 as (T_1 - T_2)/(T_1 T_2 )

So,

ΔE/(k) * (T_1 - T_2)/(T_1 T_2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute 1/T_2 - 1/T_1.

1/T_2 - 1/T_1 = ( T_1 - T_2 ) / ( T_1 T_2 )

So, the equation becomes:

(ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 T_2) ) ] = ln(2 )

So,

(ΔE / k) (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Hmm, but looking at the options, the question has options with ln(2) equal to some expression involving T1 and T2.

Wait, let's rearrange the equation.

Let me write the above equation as:

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE

But wait, the problem gives us the energy difference ΔE as approximately 1.38e-23 J. Wait, 1.38 is close to Boltzmann's constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE is about k * something.

Wait, let me compute ΔE divided by k:

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J ≈ k * 1. So ΔE ≈ k * T. Wait, but T is in Kelvin, so 1 K gives k*T = 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, so ΔE = 1.38e-23 J = k * T, where T is 1 K. So here, ΔE = k * 1 K.

Wait, but that would imply that (ΔE / k) = T, but here ΔE is fixed, so (ΔE /k) is 1 K.

So substituting into the equation:

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE = [ ln(2) * k ] / (k * 1 K ) ) → [ ln(2) * k ] / (k * T ) )

Wait, wait, wait. No, because ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k * 1 K, since k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * 1 K.

So, the equation becomes:

(ΔE / k ) = 1 K.

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) * (k) / ΔE → which is ln(2) * (k) / (k * 1 K ) ) → ln(2)/1 K * 1 K = ln(2).

Wait, wait, no. Let me substitute ΔE = k * T, but in this case, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Since k is 1.38e-23 J/K, so ΔE = k * 1 K.

So, when we have [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE → [ ln(2) * k ] / (k * 1) ) = ln(2).

So putting it all together, we have:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) → ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Yes, option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, let me double-check the steps. Let me write all the equations again.

We started with (n_i)_1 / (n_j)_1 = 2 * (n_i)_2 / (n_j)_2.

The ratio for each star is (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So,

(g_i/g_j) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * (g_i/g_j) exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Cancel (g_i/g_j):

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Take ln both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Bring the terms together:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

But 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So,

ΔE/(k) * (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

As ΔE = k * (1 K), then ΔE/k = 1.

So,

( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) * 1 = ln(2)

Which gives,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2)

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which is option D.


The problem involves two stars, star_1 and star_2, where iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and the photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The goal is to determine the correct equation relating the effective temperatures of the stars, \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \).

Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (\( n_i \)) to a lower state (\( n_j \)) is given by:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_i \) and \( g_j \) are the degeneracies of the energy levels, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. For star_1 and star_2, this becomes:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} \bigg|_{\text{star}_1} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} \bigg|_{\text{star}_2} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2, so:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} \bigg|_{\text{star}_1} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_i}{n_j} \bigg|_{\text{star}_2}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions:

\[
\frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Canceling \( \frac{g_i}{g_j} \) from both sides:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} + \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \( \Delta E / k \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Using the identity \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Since \( \Delta E = k \cdot 1 \, \text{K} \), we have \( \Delta E / k = 1 \). Substituting this:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Thus, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches **Option D**.
