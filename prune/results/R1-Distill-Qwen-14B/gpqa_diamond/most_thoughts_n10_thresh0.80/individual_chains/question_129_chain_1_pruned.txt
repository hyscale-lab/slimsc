Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to work through it step by step. Okay, the question is about identifying compound E in a reaction scheme. Let me read the question again and the hints carefully.

So, the reaction steps are:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (probably nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints provided are:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) The IR spectrum of compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, while compound E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are four different cyclic ketones. Let me think about each step.

Starting with step 1: A + HCN → B. HCN is a nucleophile, so maybe it's adding to a carbonyl group. If A has a ketone group, reacting with HCN would form a cyanohydrin. So B would be a cyanohydrin, which is a compound with an alcohol and a nitrile group adjacent.

Step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. Hydrogenation of nitriles typically gives amines, but under what conditions? Wait, Pd is a catalyst for hydrogenation. H2 and Pd would probably reduce the nitrile group (-CN) to an amine (-CH2NH2?), but wait, no, maybe to a primary amine. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is reduced to an amine, but wait, H2 and Pd might be for hydrogenation of triple bonds. Wait, no, nitriles can be hydrogenated with H2 and a catalyst like Pt or Pd to form amines. Wait, but I think that nitriles (RCN) upon catalytic hydrogenation (H2, Pd) usually give amines (RCH2NH2?), but wait, no, that's maybe under different conditions. Alternatively, sometimes nitriles are reduced to amines using H2 and a catalyst like Raney Ni, or maybe they're hydrogenolyzed to amines. Alternatively, perhaps in some cases, the nitrile group is hydrogenated to a methylene group, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, another possibility: if B is a cyanohydrin, then it's a vicinal diol (but wait, no, a cyanohydrin is an addition to a carbonyl, so it's a secondary alcohol and a nitrile group attached to adjacent carbons. So when B is reduced, perhaps the nitrile group is being hydrogenated. So if the nitrile (RC≡N) is hydrogenated, under H2 and Pd, maybe it becomes an amine. Wait, that's more likely. So for example, R-CN + H2 (Pd) → R-CH2-NH2. So in that case, compound C would have an amine group. But wait, the next step is reaction with HNO2, which is nitrous acid. Nitrous acid is often used to convert amines to diazonium salts, but that's usually for aryl amines or certain aliphatic amines. Wait, if it's a primary amine, HNO2 would typically form a diazonium salt, which then can undergo elimination, especially if it's a cyclo compound.

Wait, but let's think about the structure. So, step 3: compound C reacts with HNO2 to form D. If C has a primary amine, then D would be a diazonium salt. But then step 4 is elimination of an inert gas, which I think refers to the release of N2 (since diazonium salts often lose N2 gas upon heating or
