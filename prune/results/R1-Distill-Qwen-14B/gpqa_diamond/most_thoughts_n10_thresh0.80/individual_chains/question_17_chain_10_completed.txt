Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where there's a Ca-EDTA complex. The solution has a concentration of 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The temperature is 25°C, and the K for the complex is 5x10^10. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms a complex with metal ions like calcium. The reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The formation constant Kf is given, which is 5e10 here. Oh wait, the problem says K_Ca-EDTA is 5e10. So I think Kf is the same as that.

But wait, the complex is already formed, right? So the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA^2- complex. So I need to find the [Ca²+] in this solution.

I think the idea is that the complex dissociates a little bit. So the concentration of free calcium ions will be very low because Kf is large, meaning the complex is stable. So we can model this using the dissociation equation.

The dissociation would be: CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

The formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10. So in terms of the dissociation, the K for the reverse reaction (which is the dissociation) would be 1/Kf. Because if Kf is forward (complex formation), then Kd (dissociation) is 1/Kf.

So Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Now, let's denote the concentration of the complex as [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M initially. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. Then, at equilibrium, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x.

Since Kd is very small (2e-11), x should be much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So we can approximate [CaEDTA^2-] as 0.02.

So the expression for Kd is approx (x)(x) / 0.02 = 2e-11.

So x² = (2e-11) * 0.02 = 4e-13.

Taking the square root, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 10^-13. Square root is 2 * 10^-6.5? Wait, 10^-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7. So x is about 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3x10^-7 M. That must be the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. The Kf is given as 5e10, so the calculation seems right. Let me redo the math.

x^2 = Kd * [complex] = 2e-11 * 0.02 = 4e-13. So x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? No, wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 1e-1 is 0.1, 1e-3 is 0.001. So 1e-6 is millionth, 1e-7 is ten millionth. 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7, which is option C.

Yes, that makes sense. So the [Ca²+] is approximately 6.3e-7 M.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we consider the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant \( K_f \) is given as \( 5 \times 10^{10} \), so the dissociation constant \( K_d \) is:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \) at equilibrium. The equilibrium concentrations are:

\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x, \quad [\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

Substituting into the expression for \( K_d \):

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = K_d \cdot 0.02 = (2 \times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}.
\]

Since \( 10^{-6.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \), we find:

\[
x \approx 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
