Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax is the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I think is that distance is inversely proportional to parallax. So if a star has a parallax 'p' in arcseconds, the distance d is approximately 1/p parsecs. 

Wait, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. So, uniformly in what sense? I think it must mean that the number density of stars is uniform in space. So the number of stars in any volume depends on the size of that volume. Since volume increases with distance, but if the density is uniform, then more stars would be found in larger volumes, but how does that translate into parallax?

Let me think. Parallax p is 1/d, where d is distance. So as p decreases (because p is inversely proportional to d), distance increases. So small p means the star is farther away. Now, the number of stars per unit parallax range. So, for a given range of parallax, say from p to p + dp, how does the number of stars in that range depend on p?

If stars are uniformly distributed, the number density n is constant. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd would be n * 4π d² dd. Because the volume of a thin shell is surface area (4π d²) multiplied by thickness dd. So N = n * 4π d² dd.

But since d = 1/p, we can express everything in terms of p. Let's substitute d = 1/p. Then d² = 1/p², and dd is the change in d. Hmm, how does dd relate to dp? Let me see, d = 1/p → dd = -1/p² dp. Wait, because if p increases, d decreases. So dp is positive when p increases, but dd becomes negative. But since we are considering a small range, perhaps the negative sign indicates direction, but for the number calculation, we can take the absolute value.

So, let's write N as n * 4π (1/p²) * |dd|. But dd is -1/p² dp, so the absolute value is (1/p²) dp. So N = n *4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp. Wait, that would make N proportional to 1/p^4. So the number of stars per unit parallax range (dp) would be proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, wait, let me double-check. The number of stars in a thin shell between d and d+dd is 4 π d² n dd. But since d = 1/p → dd = - (1/p²) dp. So substituting, N = 4 π (1/p²) n * (1/p²) dp. So N = (4 π n) * (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars per unit dp is proportional to 1/p^4. So looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4.

So the answer should be A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), such that \( p = 1/d \). If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density \( n \) of stars is constant. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is given by \( N = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 \cdot dd \), where \( 4\pi d^2 \) is the surface area of the shell.

Since \( d = 1/p \), we substitute \( d = 1/p \) and \( dd = -1/p^2 \, dp \) into the expression for \( N \). This gives:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p^2}\right) \cdot \frac{1}{p^2} \, dp = n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{p^4} \, dp.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax \( dp \) is proportional to \( 1/p^4 \). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) ~1/plx^4**

Answer: A
