Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about relativity. I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, you can't just use classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use Einstein's velocity addition formula or something like that.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, okay.

First, let's tackle the relative speed. In classical mechanics, you'd just subtract the two velocities, but since these are relativistic speeds, that's not right. I think the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is a bit more complicated. Oh wait, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). But wait, wait—no, actually, that's the formula when you're changing frames. Oh wait, no, wait. The relative speed when two objects are moving in the same direction.

Wait, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, the second at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from the perspective of the first astronaut, the second is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²))? Or wait, no, the first astronaut is at rest, and the second is approaching him. So the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 + (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)) ), because when objects are moving in the same direction, you subtract, but wait, maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, no, let me think again. The relative velocity formula is v = (u - v')/(1 - (u v')/c²). But wait, no, I think it's (u' - v)/(1 - (u' v)/c²), where u' is the velocity of the second object in the first's frame. Wait, perhaps I should approach this more carefully.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the reference frames. Let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c relative to the lab frame, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c relative to the lab frame, both in the same direction. Then, from A's perspective, what is B's speed?

In the lab frame, B is moving slower than A. So from A's frame, B's speed would be (B's speed in lab - A's speed in lab) / (1 - (B_speed * A_speed)/(c²)).

So substituting, that's (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²))).

Calculating numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. Wait, but that's a negative value, which would mean B is moving in the opposite direction relative to A. But wait, that can't be right because both are moving in the same direction. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, no, perhaps I should consider the correct formula. Oh wait, when the lab frame
