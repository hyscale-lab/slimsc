Okay, so I'm trying to solve this particle physics question about the decay of a boson. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem gives me the Lagrangian interaction term between the bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as:

L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Wait, no, wait, maybe I read that wrong. Let me see. Oh, actually, the given Lagrangian is:

L(y) = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Hmm, I think I should parse this correctly. So, it's the product of λ, some fermion field terms, and X. So this looks like a Yukawa coupling kind of interaction, where the boson X couples to fermions.

Yukawa interactions are usually something like λ X ψ ψ, right? So in this case, the X field is interacting with fermions ψ_f. The term (v + X) suggests that X is the fluctuation around the vacuum expectation value v. But wait, isn't v usually the Higgs VEV? Maybe in this case, the X could be a scalar similar to the Higgs, but perhaps a different field. Or maybe X is a massive scalar boson.

The question is about the possible decay channels of the X boson. The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. So I need to find which fermion-antifermion pairs are kinematically allowed for X to decay into.

The key here is to determine which fermion pairs have a combined mass less than or equal to the mass of X. Because for a decay to be possible, the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of the decaying particle.

So first, I need to list out all possible fermion pairs that X can decay into. Let me think about all the possible fermions:

Leptons: e-, mu-, tau- and their antiparticles.
Quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top, and their antiquarks.

Each fermion has a rest mass. The rest masses are approximately (but I'll have to recall them):

Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV. So its pair would be e+ e-.
But wait, wait, 0.511 MeV is negligible compared to 6 GeV. So e+ e- is definitely allowed.

Tau lepton (tau): ~1.78 GeV. So tau+ tau- would have a combined mass of around 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So that's allowed.

Mu lepton (mu): ~0.105 GeV (105 MeV). So mu+ mu- is about 0.21 GeV, way below 6 GeV.

Now for quarks:

Up quark: ~2.2 MeV. So u and anti-u. The sum would be about 4.4 MeV, way under 6 GeV.

Down quark: ~4.7 MeV. d and anti-d: ~9.4 MeV, also way under.

Strange quark: about 95 MeV. s and anti-s: ~190 MeV, still much under 6 GeV.

Charm quark: ~1.5 GeV. So c and anti-c would sum to about 3 GeV, which is under 6 GeV. So this is allowed.

Bottom quark: about 4.7 GeV. b and anti-b would sum to around 9.4 GeV. Wait, but X is 6 GeV. So 9.4 GeV is more than 6. So X can't decay into b and anti-b because 4.7*2=9.4 >6. So b and anti-b are not allowed.

Top quark: way too heavy, around 173 GeV. So X can't decay into t and anti-t for sure.

Wait, but wait, in some cases, maybe the rest mass is given as the average or different sources might have varying numbers. Let me double-check the quark masses.

Wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes
