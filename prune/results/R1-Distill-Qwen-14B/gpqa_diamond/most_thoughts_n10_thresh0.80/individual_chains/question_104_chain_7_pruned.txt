Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The bigger the wobble, the more massive the planet, or maybe the closer it is? Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around.

The question says that two stars have the same mass, similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, the key variables here are the Doppler shifts observed for each star.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. So, the answer is the ratio P2/P1.

I think the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star. The formula I'm trying to recall is something like the semi-amplitude K of the velocity is related to the planetary mass and the parameters of the orbit. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) )) / ( (P * (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_*)) ) )

Wait, maybe I should simplify. Since M_p is much less than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, and (M_p/M_*) is negligible, so the equation simplifies. Let me think. The formula for K is:

K = ( (27 * π) )^(1/3) ) * ( (G)^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_*^(2/3)) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But another approach I know is that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_* )^(1/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the semi-amplitude K and the orbital period. Another formula I remember is:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But since the orbits are circular, e=0, so the denominator is just (P)^(1/3) and the other terms. Since M_p is much smaller than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so:

K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Since both planets have the same mass (Neptune-like) and the stars have the same mass (solar-like), and assuming sin i is the same for both (probably a fair assumption, but the question doesn't specify inclination angles), then K should be inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Wait, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3) → P ∝ 1/K^(3).

So if K1 is the shift for planet 1, K2 for planet 2, then:

P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so P is proportional to 1/K^3.

Wait, let me think again. Let's write the proportionality:

K ∝ 1/P^(1/3) → P ∝ 1/K.

But wait, K is the velocity semi-amplitude. So if K is larger, that means the star is moving faster in its orbit. How does that relate to the period?

The star's velocity is K, and the orbital speed is related to the size of the orbit. Since the star's velocity K is v = 2π a_* / P, where a_* is the star's orbit radius (which is much smaller than the planet's orbit, but for the same system, a_* is proportional to (M_p / M_*) a_p, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating).

Wait, maybe it's better to express the formula for K in terms of P.

The formula I found earlier:

K ≈ ( ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) / ( P^(1/3) )

Wait, not sure. Let me think about the formula for the velocity amplitude of the star. The formula is:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (
