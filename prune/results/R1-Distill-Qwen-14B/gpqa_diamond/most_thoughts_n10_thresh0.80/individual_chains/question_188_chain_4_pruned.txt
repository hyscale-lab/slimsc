Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal, right? So the lattice parameters a, b, c are the same, and the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all the same. In this case, they're each 30 degrees.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Interplanar distance, I think that's the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. For that, I recall the formula involving the Miller indices (hkl), the lattice parameters, and the angles between them.

Wait, right, the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl in a crystal is d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ) ), but wait, no, maybe I'm mixing that up. Alternatively, I think another formula comes into play when the unit cell isn't cubic. Because in a cubic system, the formula is simpler, but rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal or trigonal system, I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, no, rhombohedral is part of the cubic system, right? Oh wait, no, wait. No, wait, the crystal systems include cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic, rhombohedral, etc. Wait, rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal system? Or is it a separate system? I'm a bit confused. But regardless, the formula for interplanar distance in a general crystal is more complicated than the cubic case.

The general formula for interplanar distance d for a cubic system is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² ), but for non-cubic systems, it's more involved. Oh right, wait, the correct formula is given by:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α)/(a²)

Wait, but I might be getting this mixed up. Alternatively, for a general tetragonal or orthorhombic system, the formula adjusts. But for a rhombohedral system, all a, b, c are equal, and all angles are equal. So perhaps the formula simplifies.

Wait, no, rhombohedral has a = b
