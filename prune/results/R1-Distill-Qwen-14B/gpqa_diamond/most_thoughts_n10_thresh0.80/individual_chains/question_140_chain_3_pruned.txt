Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem is about a substance X which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. When X reacts violently with liquid Y, it releases a gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. Also, a precipitate G forms, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which is around 3 degrees Celsius, I think. So B is probably a solid at room temperature but just melts a bit above 0.

Another part says that the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X has two atoms of oxygen. So, the product has O2? Or maybe two oxygen atoms in the molecule. And X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog of X. So I'm thinking X might be something like a strong base or a metal that's commonly used in reactions.

Let me think about the possible substances. When a substance reacts violently with a liquid, maybe it's something like sodium reacting with water. But wait, the reaction is with a liquid Y. If Y is water, maybe X is a metal like sodium. Sodium reacts with water violently, producing hydrogen gas (H2), which is gas W. Hydrogen has one proton and one neutron, so the molecule has equal protons and neutrons. That fits because H2 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons? Wait, no, each hydrogen atom has one proton and one neutron. So each molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, which matches. So gas W would be H2.

Then, when sodium reacts with water, it produces sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and hydrogen gas. So precipitate G might be NaOH, but wait, NaOH is soluble in water. Hmm, maybe I'm off. Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is something else. Alternatively, if Y is not water. Wait, maybe Y is an acid. Let me think again.

Wait, when a metal like sodium reacts with an acid, like hydrochloric acid, it produces hydrogen gas, a salt, and heat. So if Y is an acid, then the precipitate could be a salt. But wait, sodium chloride is soluble, so that can't be. Unless the acid is something else.

Alternatively, if Y is a liquid like alcohol, then perhaps the reaction is different. But I'm not sure. Let me think about other possibilities.

Looking at the first part, gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases:

- H2: each H has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So two H's make 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So the molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. Wait, but the total number of protons in the molecule is 2, and the same for neutrons. So protons equal to neutrons: 2=2, yes. So W is H2.

So this suggests that W is hydrogen gas. So the reaction produces H2. So X could be a metal that reacts with an acid (Y
