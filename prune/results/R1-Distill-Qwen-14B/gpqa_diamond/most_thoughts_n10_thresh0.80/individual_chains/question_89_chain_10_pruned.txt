Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in that structure. When heated with excess KOH at 240°C, it produces a light yellow solid product 1. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or an ester. The ¹H NMR of product 1 has peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). 

Wait, so KOH is a strong base. Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH probably leads to an elimination reaction. Since there are two bromine atoms, maybe it's a double elimination, forming an alkene. But then why is there a carbonyl group in the IR? Oh, wait, elimination of HBr twice from adjacent bromides would form a double bond. But wait, the IR is carbonyl, so perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. Hmm, maybe it's a dihalide undergoing a double elimination to form a ketone via a neighboring group effect or something like that.

Wait, another thought: when dibromides react with a strong base, they can undergo a double elimination to form an alkene. But if the structure of adamantane is such that the two adjacent bromides are on the same face or something, elimination would form a double bond, leading to an alkene, which might not have a carbonyl. But the IR shows a peak at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl, maybe a ketone.

Wait, perhaps it's an example of the formation of a ketone from a dibromide. Let me think: if two adjacent bromides are present, maybe the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to a double elimination and forming a carbonyl. For example, in the formation of acetone from 2-bromoacetophenone and another bromide, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but since both are bromides, perhaps it's a double elimination to form an enol or something. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing a substitution, but I don't think so because substitution would more likely give an alcohol, but the IR doesn't show an O-H stretch. Wait, the IR does have a peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when heated with KOH, perhaps undergoes a two-step elimination. Let's think about the structure of adamantane. It's a diamond-like structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. The 1 and 3 positions are adjacent? Or maybe they're in a certain arrangement that allows elimination
