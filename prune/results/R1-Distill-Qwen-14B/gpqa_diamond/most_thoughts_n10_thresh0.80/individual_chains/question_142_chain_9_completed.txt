Okay, so I've got this question about quantum states and density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is about the density matrix given as ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I need to find its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are A to D, each with different coordinates.

Wait, what's a density matrix exactly? I remember that a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (not a pure state). A pure state would be a projector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, right? But here, this ρ is an average of two projectors: |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1|, each multiplied by 1/2.

So, each of those projectors is a pure state. |0⟩ is the state where the qubit is definitely 0, and |1⟩ is the same for 1. So when we average them with equal weights, ρ becomes a mixed state. That makes sense because the density matrix is a statistical mixture of two orthogonal basis states.

Now, what's the geometrical position of this density matrix? I think this relates to how the density matrix is represented in the Bloch sphere. Wait, the Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states. A pure state is a point on the surface, right? But when it's a mixed state, it's inside the sphere.

The Bloch vector for a qubit is usually written as a vector (x, y, z) which corresponds to the parameters in the density matrix. The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2,

where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (x, y, z) with |r| ≤1 because it's a Bloch vector.

Let me write out the Pauli matrices:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, our given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| ) / 2. Let's compute that. The |0⟩⟨0| matrix is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ = (I)/2.

Wait, that's interesting. So ρ is I/2, which is the maximally mixed state for a qubit. Because for a qubit, the maximally mixed state has equal probability of being 0 or 1, which is exactly what this is.

Now, let's express ρ in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form is (I + r·σ)/2. So I can set ρ = (I + r·σ)/2 and solve for r.

Given that ρ is I/2, let's set them equal:

I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2

Multiply both sides by 2: I = I + r·σ

Subtract I: 0 = r·σ

Which implies that r·σ must be zero. So r must be the zero vector, because if any component of r is non-zero, then the dot product would involve the Pauli matrices which have non-zero trace when multiplied by identity?

Wait, no. Because Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z each have trace zero. So r·σ is a matrix where each component is a Pauli matrix scaled by r_i. So the trace of r·σ would be zero, because Tr(r·σ) = r_x Tr(σ_x) + r_y Tr(σ_y) + r_z Tr(σ_z) )= 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.

But in our case, r·σ must be the zero matrix, not just zero trace. Because the whole equation after subtraction is r·σ = 0 matrix.

So, the only way that r·σ equals the zero matrix is if all components of r are zero. Because each term in r·σ is a matrix, and for their sum to be zero, each must individually be zero. Wait, no, that's not exactly the case. If I have r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z = 0. Each Pauli matrix is linearly independent, so the only solution is r_x = r_y = r_z = 0. Because you can't have a non-trivial combination of these matrices summing to zero unless all coefficients are zero.

So r is (0,0,0). Therefore, the density matrix I/2 corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere, which makes sense because it's completely mixed—there's no coherence and it's equally likely to be in any state. So the geometrical position is (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, as it is an equal statistical mixture of the two orthogonal basis states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). The density matrix can also be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector \(r = (x, y, z)\) as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + r \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices. For the given \(\rho\), it simplifies to:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

Comparing this with the general form \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} (I + r \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma})\), it is evident that \(r \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\). Since the Pauli matrices \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\) are linearly independent, the only solution for \(r \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\) is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\). This means the density matrix corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere, which represents the maximally mixed state.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to option C.

Answer: C
