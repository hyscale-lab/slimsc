Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ̄f(y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). Hmm, I remember that the Lagrangian describes the interactions in the theory. So the boson X is interacting with fermions, and the mass of X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order.

Wait, kinematically allowed means that the decay products must have enough energy and the right quantum numbers. And since it's the lowest order, we're probably looking at tree-level decays, so the simplest possible processes.

So, the boson X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. That makes sense because the Lagrangian looks like it's a Yukawa interaction term. In Yukawa theory, the boson couples to fermions, and the coupling is proportional to the mass term, right? So when X decays, it would produce a pair of fermions.

Now, the mass of X is 6 GeV. For a decay X → f f̄ to be kinematically allowed, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion, because each fermion must have enough energy to exist (mass-energy equivalence). So I need to find all fermions whose mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV (since 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV).

Wait, but wait, what are the masses of the known fermions? Let's think. The fermions we usually consider are quarks and leptons. For quarks, up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. But wait, top is really heavy, about 173 GeV, so X can't decay into top quarks because 3 GeV is much less than that. Same with the bottom quark: the bottom quark is around 4.5 GeV or so? Wait, I might be mixing the masses. Let me recall: up, down, and strange are light, charm is about 1.5 GeV, bottom is about 4.5 GeV. Top is around 173 GeV.

Leptons: electrons, muons, taus. Electrons are about 0.0005 GeV, muons about 0.1 GeV, taus about 1.78 GeV. So X has 6 GeV, so any fermion pair where each is up to 3 GeV.

So possible fermions are any with mass m < 3 GeV. So let's list the fermions and their masses.

Quarks:
- u, d: light, mass ~ a few MeV, so way below 3 GeV.
- s: strange, ~100 MeV? Or is it higher? Wait, I might be getting confused. Wait, the masses of up, down, strange are about 2-5 MeV, 4-8 MeV, and 95-105 MeV, respectively. So all of them are well under 3 GeV.

Wait, but when considering quarks in a decay, we have to think about their constituent quarks. Wait, no, in terms of particle decay, the quarks are part of hadrons, but when X decays into quark-antiquark, it's because the X can annihilate into a quark-antiquark pair. But wait, the X is a boson, so it can couple to any fermion that's in the theory.

Wait, but wait the problem gives the interaction Lagrangian. Let me look again. The interaction is λf * ψ̄f(y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). So the index f here refers to the fermion type. So X couples to the fermion ψf. So the possible decay modes are X → ψf ψ̄f. So which fermions does X couple to? The Lagrangian seems to couple X to all the fermions, because it's written as a general term. Or wait, in the problem statement, is it that X couples to all fermions, or is f a specific fermion?

Wait, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ̄f (v + X) ψf. So for each fermion species f, there's a term coupling X to that fermion. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair, provided that the energy is sufficient.

But wait, when considering which decay channels are allowed, we have to think about whether the fermion pair can be created. The mass of X is 6 GeV. So for each fermion f, the sum of the masses of f and f̄ must be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

But fermions are massless in the Lagrangian? Or not? Wait, the fermions have their own masses from their
