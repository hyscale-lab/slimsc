Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is all about.

Alright, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so it's a pretty rigid molecule. The molecule has two bromine atoms attached at the 1 and 3 positions. 

The first reaction is heating this compound with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, so I think this is an elimination reaction. When vicinal dihalides (two halides on adjacent carbons) react with base, they typically undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. But wait, in the case of adamantane, the structure is more complex. Oh right, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have the two bromines on adjacent carbons in the adamantane framework. So when KOH is added, it should eliminate two equivalents of HBr, forming an alkene.

The product mentioned is a light yellow solid. So product 1 is probably an adamantyl compound with a double bond. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm-1. Wait, that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Hmm, but wait, elimination usually gives alkenes, which don't have carbonyl groups. Unless I'm missing something. Oh wait, maybe the product isn't an alkene but something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. But KOH is a base, more likely elimination. Alternatively, could it be a ring-opening? Or perhaps the base abstracts a proton leading to a different structure.

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. But in this reaction, KOH is a strong base. If we have a dihalide reacting, perhaps the base isn't just eliminating but causing some kind of substitution. Oh wait, if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, maybe the base performs a double elimination, leading to a ketone. Because I think in some cases, if the dihalide is on adjacent carbons in a cyclic structure, elimination can form a ketone. For example, in a six-membered ring dihalide, elimination can form a conjugated diene, but in adamantane, perhaps the structure is such that elimination leads to a bridged ketone.

Wait, when I think about adamantane, it's a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings connected together. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have the bromines on two adjacent bridgeheads. When KOH is added, perhaps it deprotonates and eliminates HBr twice, which would form a double bond? But how would that fit with the IR data?

Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again. Another possibility is that each Br is replaced by an -OH group, but then we'd have diol, but that wouldn't explain the IR peak at 1720. Alternatively, maybe the elimination forms an epoxide, but I don't think so. Wait, perhaps it's a Hofmann or Saytzeff elimination. But in that case, I'm not sure about the product.

Wait, another angle. The product's 1H NMR spectrum is given. It has peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is probably an -OH group, but wait, in an NMR, -OH protons are usually broader, unless it's an exchange process. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether or something else. Alternatively, maybe those are NH protons, but KOH is a strong base, so perhaps the product is a diol, but then why the IR at 1720?

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong, probably a carbonyl. So if it's a ketone, where would that come from? Maybe the KOH is causing the elimination to form a bridged ketone. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when deprotonated and eliminating HBr twice, could form a bridged bicyclic ketone. Because if each elimination removes a Br and a hydrogen, perhaps the double elimination leads to a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Dieckmann cyclization, but that's for esters. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the NMR data. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is probably a pair of equivalent protons. Maybe an -OCH2O- group, but that's for a diether. Or maybe -CH2OH, but that would be more downfield. Alternatively, maybe those are protons on an oxygen-bearing carbon, like an ether. Alternatively, it could be a ketone with adjacent protons.

Wait, another approach: the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is likely a ketone. So the product 1 is a ketone. How?

1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon treatment with KOH, could undergo a double elimination to form an alkene, but that doesn't explain the ketone. Alternatively, maybe the base induces a rearrangement. Wait, the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is such that elimination of two HBr molecules would form a conjugated diene? But that doesn't form a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. If KOH substitutes each Br with an -O- group, maybe forming a diepoxide or something else. Wait, but how would that lead to a ketone?

Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing the formation of a Grignard-like reaction, but that's unlikely with KOH as the base.

Wait, another thought: when vic
