Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. In the classical case, it's F = -kx. But this question is relativistic, so I need to think about how relativity affects things.

The question asks for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are given in terms of c, the speed of light, which tells me relativity is definitely in play here.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator can be found by equating the maximum potential energy to the kinetic energy. So when the mass is at the maximum amplitude A, all the potential energy (1/2 k A²) is converted into kinetic energy (1/2 m v_max²). Solving that gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, the question is about the relativistic case, so C might not be the correct answer here.

Relativistically, the energy considerations change because the total energy includes relativistic kinetic energy. The total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy (mc²) and kinetic energy. In the rest frame of the oscillator, when the mass is at maximum displacement (A), all the energy is potential. But wait, in relativity, the potential energy isn't just ½ kx², right? Or does that still hold?

Wait, the problem says the oscillator obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. So the potential energy is U = ½ k x², same as classical. But the kinetic energy has to be treated relativistically. Hmm, so the total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So when the mass is at x=0 (the equilibrium point), it's moving the fastest, so all energy is kinetic. But when it's at maximum displacement x=A, it's momentarily at rest in terms of velocity, so all energy is potential.

Wait no, wait. Wait, in the classical case, the potential energy is maximum at x=A, and the kinetic is zero there. But in reality, in quantum mechanics, the particle can't reach zero velocity because of the uncertainty principle, but in this problem, I think we're treating it classically. So in the relativistic case, the maximum speed occurs when all the energy is kinetic, which would be when x=0. But wait, no, because the potential energy is maximum at x=A, so the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and potential energy. So when the mass is at x=A, the potential energy is ½ k A², so the total energy E = mc² + ½ k A². Then, when the mass is at x=0, all that energy goes into kinetic energy. But wait, wait, relativistic kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc². So setting that equal to the total energy minus rest mass energy.

Wait, maybe I should approach this step by step.

The total mechanical energy E of the oscillator is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement, because at maximum displacement, the kinetic energy is zero. So E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

But wait, actually, in the relativistic case, does the potential energy still add to the total energy in the same way? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Because in the classical case, E = T + U, where T is kinetic and U is potential. But relativistically, the total energy is gamma mc², which includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So if the potential energy is ½ k A², then the total energy E is gamma mc², which would include that potential energy. Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating things.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the energy conservation in the relativistic scenario. The total energy of the oscillator is the sum of the rest mass energy and the maximum potential energy (at x=A). So E = mc² + (1/2)k A². When the mass is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic. So gamma mc² = E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

Wait, but that can't be right because that would imply gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²). So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me solve for v_max. Let's denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some term, say, a.

So,

gamma = 1 + a,

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + a.

Taking reciprocal on both sides,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + a).

Square both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + a)^2.

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2.

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [1/(1+a)^2] )

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

1 - 1/(1+a)^2 = [ ( (1+a)^2 - 1 ) ] / (1+a)^2

Expand (1+a)^2 = 1 + 2a + a²,

so (1+a)^2 -1 = 2a + a².

Thus,

v_max = c * sqrt( (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2 )

Factor numerator:

a(2 + a) / (1 + a)^2.

Wait, but a is (k A²)/(2 m c² ), which is a small quantity if m is large or kA² is small compared to mc². But perhaps for the general case, we can write it as:

v_max = c * sqrt( (2a + a²) ) / (1 + a )

But 2a +a² = a(2 + a) = a (a + 2). Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, another approach: let me write a as (k A²)/(2 m c² ) as before.

So,

v_max² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2 ]

= c² [ ( (1+a)^2 -1 ) / (1+a)^2 ]

= c² [ (1 + 2a + a² -1 ) / (1+a)^2 ]

= c² (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2.

Factor numerator: a(2 + a) = a (a + 2).

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( a (a + 2) ) / (1 + a )

Hmm, but not sure if this helps.

Wait, let me try to compute a:

a = (k A²) / (2 m c² )

So,

a + 2 = (k A^2)/(2 m c² ) + 2.

But perhaps it's better to go back and see the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: v_max= c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2m ) )^2 )

Wait, that seems off because if k A² is big, the denominator becomes small, making it larger, but in our expression, when k A² is large, v_max approaches c, which makes sense.

Wait, but our expression is:

v_max
