Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again.

So, the question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. Half of its surface is covered in dark spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler, at 5000K because the temperature difference is 1000K. The problem says that when we observe this star, the brightness variations due to rotation look similar to those caused by an exoplanet transiting in front of the star. We need to find the radius of such a planet relative to the star (Rpl/Rstar) that would produce the same brightness variation.

Hmm, I remember that when a planet transits a star, the drop in brightness is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. So the formula for the transit depth is (Rp / Rstar)^2. But wait, in this case, the star isn't just a uniform brightness. The spots make it more complicated. 

The star has a filling factor of 20% for the spots. Filling factor usually means the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So 20% of one hemisphere is covered. But the spots are cooler. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view, making the star appear dimmer because the spots are cooler than the rest of the surface.

So, the variation in brightness isn't just a simple dip like a planet would cause. Instead, it's a modulation due to the spots rotating in and out of view. But the question says that this variation is similar to a planet. So, they're asking what planet size would cause the same amplitude in the light curve.

Wait, the amplitude here refers to the change in brightness. So if the star's brightness varies by a certain amount because of the spots, we need a planet that would block the same amount of light when it transits.

But wait, the star's brightness without spots would be different. The star has spots, so when the spots are on the visible hemisphere, the total brightness is less. But when the spots are on the far side, the brightness is higher. Hmm, but the question says that if the star had no spots, what planet radius would produce the same signal. So in other words, the observed brightness variation from the spots is equivalent to the variation we'd get from a planet blocking some light.

Wait, that's a bit tricky. Let me think. Normally, when a planet transits, the brightness drops because the planet blocks part of the star's light. The maximum drop is proportional to (Rp / Rstar)^2. But in this case, the star's brightness variation is due to spots rotating. So when the spots are facing us, the star is dimmer because those spots are cooler. When the spots are on the far side, the star is brighter than usual because more of the hotter surface is visible.

So the variation in brightness is due to the spots' effect. Let's model this.

The star's brightness without spots is L0. The spots cover 20% of the hemisphere, so for a star with radius R, the area of the star is 4π R². The area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π R² (since it
