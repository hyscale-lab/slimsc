Okay, so I have this question about transit probabilities of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Let's try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet compared to the star and the orientation of the orbit relative to our line of sight. The basic formula, as I recall, is something like P = (R_planet / R_star) * (1 / (a_planet / (R_star + a_planet)))). Wait, no, maybe I should think about it another way. Oh right, the transit probability is roughly proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by the ratio of the star's distance (in the plane perpendicular to our line of sight) to the planet's orbital distance. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing some terms here.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbit as seen from Earth is edge-on enough for us to see it pass in front of the star) is given by the formula P = (R_star / a) * (1 / sin i), where i is the inclination angle of the orbit. But wait, I think the actual formula is more like P = (R_planet / R_star) * (1 / (a / d)), where d is the distance to the star. No, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should think in terms of the relative sizes.

Wait, no, the probability
