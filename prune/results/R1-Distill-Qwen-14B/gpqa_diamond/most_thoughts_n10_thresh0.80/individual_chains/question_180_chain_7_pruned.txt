Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with electrostatics, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, let's read the question again. Hmm, it says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh, right, e is the elementary charge, about 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 2 times that, so 3.204 x 10^-19 C. Got it.

The setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th is fixed at P. So, point P has one charge, and the other 12 are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. Since they're constrained, I guess they form some sort of arrangement around P. Maybe they're all on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters? But the problem doesn't specify their exact positions beyond being 2m from P. Hmm, but wait, for calculating potential energy in an isolated system, maybe their mutual interactions matter?

Wait, the question is about the minimum energy of the system. Oh, right, the potential energy in an electrostatic system is related to the configuration of charges. The minimum energy would be when the potential energy is minimized.

But wait, wait. Since all the 12 charges are at the same distance from P, how do they arrange themselves? If they're all on a sphere of radius 2 meters, then each of them is equally distant from P. But what about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves? Because each charge will interact with the others, so their mutual repulsion contributes to the total potential energy.

Wait, but the problem states it's an isolated system. So I think I need to calculate the potential energy of the entire system, including the interactions between all pairs.

So first, let's think about the system. There's one charge at P (let's call it charge Q1) and 12 charges each at 2 meters away (Q2, Q3, ..., Q13).

Each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P. So the distance between Q1 and each Q_i (i from 2 to 13) is 2 meters.

So the potential energy contributed by each of these 12 charges with Q1 would be U =
