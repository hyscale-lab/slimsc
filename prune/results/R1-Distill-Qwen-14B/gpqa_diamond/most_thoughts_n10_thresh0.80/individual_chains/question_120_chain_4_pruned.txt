Alright, so I've got this question here about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let me think. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, and I need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself.

Wait a second, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. So if a star is closer, its parallax is larger, and if it's farther, the parallax is smaller. Like, plx = 1/distance in parsecs or something.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So, I guess I need to figure out how the density of stars changes with parallax. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, their actual number density in space is constant. But when we observe them, their apparent distribution changes because of how parallax relates to distance.

So, if I imagine a thin shell at a certain distance from us, the volume of that shell is 4πr² dr, right? Because the volume of a sphere is 4/3 π r³, so the shell's volume would be the difference between two spheres, 4πr² dr.

Wait, but how does this relate to parallax? Oh, because plx is 1/r. So, r = 1/plx. Let me think about the differential volume element. dr in terms of plx: if plx = 1/r, then dr = - (1/r²) dplx. Because differentiating both sides, dr = - (dplx)/(r²). So, the volume element dV = 4π r² dr. Substituting r = 1/plx, so r² = 1/plx². And dr is - (1/( (1/plx)^2 )) ) dplx = - plx² dplx.

Wait, let's compute dV: 4π (1/plx²) * (- plx² dplx) ) = 4π (-dplx). Oh, the negative just indicates direction, but since we're dealing with magnitudes, perhaps we can ignore the sign. So dV = 4π dplx.

Wait, that's interesting. So the volume element in terms of parallax is proportional to dplx. But wait, because in reality, each shell at a certain r contributes to a certain plx, and the number of stars in that shell would be the volume times the number density (which is constant).

So number of stars in a shell is n * dV, where n is the number density. dV is proportional to dplx, so the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to dplx. Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So if dV is 4π dplx, then the number of stars between plx and plx+dplx is proportional to dplx. So the number per unit plx (like stars/(unit plx)) would be proportional to 1? Because the stars per unit plx would be n * dV / dplx = n * (4π dplx)/dplx = 4π n, a constant. But that can't be right because the options don't have a constant. Hmm, maybe I messed up somewhere.

Wait
