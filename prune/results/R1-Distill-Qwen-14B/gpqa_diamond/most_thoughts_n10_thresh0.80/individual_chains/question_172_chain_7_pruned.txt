Alright, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, okay, let's try to break this down. I remember that the photosphere is the visible layer of a star, and the question is about iron atoms in their energy levels. Oh right, the question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Oh wait, but wait, what does that mean exactly? I think it refers to the excitation level, maybe the number of atoms in a higher energy state compared to a lower one.

So the energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, that's a specific number, but maybe I don't need to use it directly. The question is about finding the equation that relates the effective temperatures (T1 and T2) of the two stars. The problem states that the photospheres are in LTE, which is Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So I think that means we can use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Boltzmann distribution... right. The probability of a particle being in a state with energy E is proportional to exp(-E/(kT)), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. So for two energy levels, say E1 and E2, with E2 higher than E1, the ratio of their populations would be (n2/n1) = exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE is E2-E1.

Wait, but in this question, it's about the excitement. So I think the ratio is n_high / n_low. But the problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let's read it again. "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Oh, wait, maybe n1 is the number of excited atoms in star_1, and n2 in star_2. Or perhaps it's the ratio of excited to ground state atoms.

Wait, no, I think the question says that the number of iron atoms in a certain excited state in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n1/n2 = 2. Or is it the other way around? Let me think. If star_1 has more excited atoms, then T1 is higher because higher temperature means more atoms are in higher energy states. So n1, the number in the excited state, is twice n2. So n1 / n2 = 2.

Wait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, the ratio of populations (n2/n1) where E2 > E1 is exp(-ΔE/(kT)). Wait, no, actually, if E2 is higher than E1, then the ratio is n1/n2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(kT) ), because n2 is the lower state. Oh wait, wait, no. Let me get this right. The Boltzmann factor says that the ratio of the number of particles in two states is (n2/n1) = exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So if E2 is higher than E1, then (n2/n1) is less than 1, meaning more particles are in the lower energy state.

In this problem, star_1 has twice as many excited atoms as star_2. So for star 1, the number of excited atoms (n_high) is twice that of star 2 (n_high). Wait no, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited when compared to star_2. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.

Wait, perhaps the excited state is a higher energy level. Let me define E_high and E_low. The energy difference ΔE is E_high - E_low. For each star, the ratio of atoms in E_high to E_low is given by the Boltzmann factor.

So for star_1: (n_high1) / (n_low1) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
For star_2: (n_high2)/(n_low2) = exp
