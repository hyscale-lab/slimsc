Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, okay, let's see. The question is asking about the relative speed between the two and the total energy of the system. 

First, the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, you can't just add them normally because of special relativity. Newtonian addition would give 0.6c + 0.5c = 1.1c, but that's more than the speed of light, which isn't possible. So I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, right! The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Wait, no, I think that's for when the speeds are in opposite directions. Or wait, no, that's when one is moving relative to the other. Let me think. Oh, wait, actually, the formula is (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/(c²)) when the objects are moving in the same direction. Because in this case, both are moving in the positive x-direction, so we subtract the smaller from the larger? Or wait, no, let me get this right.

Wait, no, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is used when you have two objects moving at u and v relative to a rest frame, and you want to find the speed of one as seen from the other. So if astronaut A is moving at u = 0.6c, and astronaut B at v = 0.5c, both in the same direction, then from B's frame, how fast is A moving?

Wait, no, wait. I think the relative velocity formula is for when you have two observers. So if observer A is moving at velocity u relative to the rest frame, and observer B is moving at velocity v relative to the rest frame, then the relative velocity of B with respect to A is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). But wait, if both are moving in the same direction (same sign), then I think u is 0.6c and v is 0.5c. So for A's frame, what's B's speed? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is for the relative speed of A as seen from B, or B
