Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I need to figure out the relationship between the luminosities of two stars. Let me go through this step by step.

First, the problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Also, their masses are the same ratio. But wait, the question is about luminosity, so mass might not directly affect it unless we're considering something like the mass-luminosity relation, but I'm not sure if that's needed here. The problem says they radiate as black bodies, so I think I should use the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

Stefan-Boltzmann's law states that the luminosity L is proportional to R² times T⁴, right? Because L = 4πR²σT⁴. So L = σ * R² * T^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both stars are black bodies, I can ignore the constants for the ratio, so L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴)/(R2² T2⁴).

We know R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 is 1.5. So R1²/R2² is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that part is 2.25. Now we need to find the ratio of their temperatures to the 4th power, T1^4 / T2^4. But how?

The problem mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. The peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. If λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2. That means the temperature ratio T1/T2 is 1, and (T1/T2)^4 is 1. So the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (2.25) * 1 = 2.25.

Wait, but wait. The options are a bit tricky. The options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23. So 2.25 is option A. But I might be missing something here. Let me double-check.

The problem also gives the radial velocities. Star_1's radial velocity is 0 km/s, and Star_2's is 700 km/s. Hmm, how does that affect the calculation? Radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. If a star is moving towards or away from us, its observed wavelength will shift due to the Doppler effect. But wait, the peak wavelengths were the same. So perhaps the observed wavelengths are the same, but their rest wavelengths are different?

Wait a minute. I might have made a mistake earlier. If the observed λ_max is the same for both stars, but their actual (rest frame) λ_max might be different because of their radial velocities. Because the Doppler effect can shift the wavelength.

So, the observed wavelength λ_obs is related to the rest wavelength λ_rest by the Doppler shift formula. The formula for recessional velocity is v = c * (λ_obs / λ_rest - 1), but if the star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter (blue shift), and away would be longer (red shift). But Star_1 has zero radial velocity, so λ_obs1 = λ_rest1. Star_2 has a velocity of 700 km/s. Let me check if that's moving away or towards us. The problem says radial velocities of 0 and 700 for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Wait, radial velocity is positive when moving away. So Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s.

So for Star_2, λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c). Because when moving away, the wavelength stretches. Since v is 700 km/s, which is a significant fraction of
