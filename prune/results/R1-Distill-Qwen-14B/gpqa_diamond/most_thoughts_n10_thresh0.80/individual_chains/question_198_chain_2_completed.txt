Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about cobalt complexes and stability constants. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. 

The question says that there's a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are given: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, what's a stability constant again? Oh right, β is the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex. So for each complex, the higher the β, the more stable the complex is.

The complexes are probably [Co(SCN)]^n+ where n is the number of SCN- attached. So β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, and so on. I think the complexes go from [CoSCN]^+ (β1=9), then [Co(SCN)₂]^+, β2=40, [Co(SCN)₃]^3+, β3=63, and [Co(SCN)₄]^4+, β4=16. Wait, but wait, β4 is lower than β3. That's a bit unexpected because normally higher complexes are more stable, but maybe in this case, the stability decreases beyond a certain point.

Wait, no, I think β4 is the stability constant for the fourth complex. So each β represents the step-wise formation. Or wait, maybe it's overall. Hmm. Oh, wait, I think β is the formation constant for each additional ligand. Or is it the overall? I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the stability constants are for the overall complex. So for each complex, β is the overall K for that complex. So the first complex, [Co(SCN)]^+, has β1=9. The second, [Co(SCN)_2]^+, has β2=40. The third, [Co(SCN)_3]^3+, β3=63. The fourth, [Co(SCN)_4]^4+, β4=16. Hmm, but why would β4 be lower than β3? Maybe it's because adding more ligands becomes less favorable after a certain point. Or perhaps the log might be involved, but I'm not sure. 

Wait, the problem is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. So dithiocyanato would be the [Co(SCN)₂]^+ complex, right? Because di means two SCN- ligands. So the question is asking for the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^+ among all the Co species.

So the species present are the different complexes: Co²+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)₂]^+, [Co(SCN)₃]^3+, [Co(SCN)₄]^4+. The total Co concentration is the sum of all these species. 

To find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)₂]^+), I need to calculate the concentration of this species relative to the total cobalt.

But how do I do that? I think I need to use the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand (SCN-) to compute the fraction of each complex.

Wait, the general approach for these kinds of problems is to use the stability constants and the ligand and metal concentrations to find the fraction of each complex. Then, sum all the fractions multiplied by the total concentration to get each species' contribution.

But here, the total Co concentration is given as 1e-2 M. So the sum of all the complex concentrations plus free Co²+ should equal 1e-2 M? Or maybe the sum of all the complexes (including Co²+) equals 1e-2 M. Because the problem says the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2, which includes all species.

So the plan is:

1. Write the formation expressions for each complex.
2. Use the β values to express the concentration of each complex in terms of [Co²+] and [SCN^-]^n.
3. Set up equations based on the total Co.
4. Solve for the fraction of each complex.

But this might get complicated because each complex depends on the others. Maybe I can use the step-wise formation constants, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the overall formation constants can be used.

Wait, perhaps using the concept of the distribution of metal species based on ligand concentration and stability constants.

The problem gives the concentration of SCN- as 0.1 M, which is much higher than the Co concentration. So the solution is probably in the region where higher-order complexes are favored. But since β4 is lower than β3, perhaps the highest fraction is the third complex. But the question is about the second complex.

Alternatively, maybe I can model this using the stability (formation) constants as the overall K for each complex. So for each complex, the formation constant is given, and I can compute the fraction.

Let me denote the species as:

Co²+ → species 0
[CoSCN]^+ → species 1
[Co(SCN)_2]^+ → species 2
[Co(SCN)_3]^3+ → species 3
[Co(SCN)_4]^4+ → species 4

Each species i has a concentration [i] and β_i is the formation constant for that complex. So, for species 1:

β1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co²+][SCN^-])
Similarly, for species 2:

β2 = [Co(SCN)₂+]/([Co²+][SCN^-]^2)
Wait, no. Wait, the formation constants are cumulative. Oh right, perhaps the stability constants are for each step. So β1 is the formation of [CoSCN]^+ from Co²+ and SCN-.

Then, β2 is the formation of [Co(SCN)_2]^+ from [CoSCN]^+ and another SCN-.

Wait no, I'm getting confused. Maybe each β is the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands. So:

β1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co²+][SCN^-])
β2 = [Co(SCN)_2+]/([Co²+][SCN^-]^2)
β3 = [Co(SCN)_3^3+]/([Co²+][SCN^-]^3)
β4 = [Co(SCN)_4^4+]/([Co²+][SCN^-]^4)

So each β is the overall K for that complex.

If that's the case, then the fraction (f_i) of each species can be calculated using:

f_i = (β_i [SCN^-]^i) / (1 + sum from j=1 to 4 of β_j [SCN^-]^j )

Wait, no. Because the free Co²+ is also a species. So the total is all the species, including Co²+.

So the fraction for each complex i is [i]/( [Co²+] + sum [i] )

But since [Co²+] is part of all the expressions, maybe it's better to express everything in terms of [Co²+].

Let me think. Let me denote [Co²+] as x. Then, the concentration of [CoSCN]^+ is β1 * x * [SCN^-].

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_2]^+ is β2 * x * [SCN^-]^2.

Wait, no. Because for [Co(SCN)_2]^+, it's β2 * x * [SCN^-]^2. But wait, is that correct? Because β2 is the overall formation constant for the di complex. So, [Co(SCN)_2]^+ = β2 * x * [SCN^-]^2.

So the concentrations of each complex can be written as:

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 * x * (0.1)
[Co(SCN)_2]^+ = β2 * x * (0.1)^2
[Co(SCN)_3]^3+ = β3 * x * (0.1)^3
[Co(SCN)_4]^4+ = β4 * x * (0.1)^4

And [Co²+] is x.

The sum of all these should equal the total cobalt concentration, which is 1e-2 M.

So,

x + β1 * x * 0.1 + β2 * x * (0.1)^2 + β3 * x * (0.1)^3 + β4 * x * (0.1)^4 = 1e-2

Factor out x:

x [ 1 + β1*(0.1) + β2*(0.1)^2 + β3*(0.1)^3 + β4*(0.1)^4 ] = 1e-2

We can compute the terms inside the brackets.

Let me compute each term:

β1 * 0.1 =9 * 0.1=0.9
β2 * (0.1)^2=40 * 0.01=0.4
β3 * (0.1)^3=63 * 0.001=0.063
β4 * (0.1)^4=16 * 0.0001=0.0016

Sum all these coefficients:

1 (the x term) + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 

Let's add step by step:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

1.9 + 0.4=2.3

2.3 +0.063=2.363

2.363 +0.0016=2.3646

So,

x * 2.3646 = 1e-2 → x = (1e-2) / 2.3646 ≈ 4.224e-3 M.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Because the way the equation is set up is correct?

Wait, the equation is:

x [ 1 + (β1 * 0.1) + (β2 * 0.01) + (β3 * 0.001) + (β4 * 0.0001) ] = 1e-2.

So that's correct.

So x ≈ (1e-2) / 2.3646 ≈ approximately 4.224e-3 M.

Now, we need to find the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]+, which is β2 * x * (0.1)^2.

Plugging in the numbers:

β2 =40, x≈4.224e-3, (0.1)^2=0.01.

So [Co(SCN)_2]^+ = 40 *4.224e-3 * 0.01 = 40 *4.224e-5 ≈ 1.6896e-3 M.

Wait, but what about the other complexes? Because the question is about the percentage of dithiocyanato complexes among all. So the total Co species is 1e-2 M.

But wait, the sum of all the fractions (including Co²+ and all complexes) should be 1e-2.

But to get the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^+, we take ([Co(SCN)_2]^+) / (1e-2) *100%.

So [Co(SCN)_2]^+ is 1.6896e-3 M, and the total is 1e-2 M.

So percentage = (1.6896e-3 / 1e-2 ) *100% = (0.16896) *100% =16.896% → approximately 16.9%.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 16.9%. So that would be the answer. But wait, is this correct?

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Compute β2 term: 40 * (0.1)^2 =40 *0.01=0.4.

The sum inside the brackets was 2.3646.

x=1e-2 /2.3646 ≈ 0.004224.

Then, [Co(SCN)_2]^+ =40 * x * (0.1)^2 =40 * 0.004224 * 0.01.

Compute 40 *0.004224=0.16896.

Multiply by 0.01: 0.0016896.

So 0.0016896 M is [Co(SCN)_2]^+.

Total Co concentration is 0.01 M.

So (0.0016896 / 0.01)*100% =16.896% → ~16.9%, which is option D.

Hmm, but wait a second. The problem says "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

Wait, the stability constants are given as β1, β2, β3, β4. But in my calculation, I assumed that each β is the overall constant for that complex, meaning βn = [Co(SCN)_n^(2-n)] / ( [Co²+][SCN^-]^n )

But I'm not entirely sure if that's correct. Because sometimes, stability constants are given as stepwise constants. For example, β1 is for adding the first ligand, β2 is for adding the second, etc., such that:

β1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co²+][SCN^-])

β2 = [Co(SCN)_2+]/([CoSCN+][SCN^-])

β3 = [Co(SCN)_3^3+]/([Co(SCN)_2+][SCN^-])

β4 = [Co(SCN)_4^4+]/([Co(SCN)_3^3+][SCN^-])

In that case, the overall formation constant for the fourth complex would be β1 * β2 * β3 * β4.

So in that scenario, the approach would be different. Because each β is a step-wise constant, so the overall β for each complex would be the product of β1 to βn.

Wait, that complicates things. Because the way I approached it earlier assumes that each β is the overall K for the complex, but if β is step-wise, the approach would be different.

So if βn represents the step-wise addition, then the overall K for [Co(SCN)_n]^something is the product of β1 through βn.

So let's clarify: 

If the problem gives step-wise β values, then the overall K for each complex is the product of β1 to βi, where i is the number of ligands.

So for the first complex, K1 = β1 =9.

For the second, K2 = β1*β2=9*40=360.

For the third, K3=9*40*63= 9*40=360, 360*63=22680.

For the fourth, K4=9*40*63*16= 22680 *16=362880.

Wait, but that makes the fourth complex have a K of 362880, which is much larger than the third, which is 22680. So the fourth would be much more stable. But in the problem statement, β4 is given as 16, but if it's step-wise, then the overall β4 is a big number.

But in the problem, the given β4 is 16, which is smaller than β3 (63). So that suggests that the β values given are not step-wise, but rather overall constants for each complex. Because if they were step-wise, β4 would be small, but that would make the overall K4 much larger.

Wait, no. Wait, step-wise β's are each subsequent addition. So if β4 is the step-wise for the fourth ligand, it's possible that adding the fourth ligand is less favorable, leading to a lower β4. But then the overall K would be product up to β4, so that would make the fourth complex's K higher if β4 is positive. But in the previous calculation, β4 is 16, which is lower than β3 (63), which is the third step. So the product might vary.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. I think I need to check whether the given β's are overall or step-wise. The problem says "stability constants", which are usually overall. So, for each complex, the given β is the overall stability constant for that complex. So the [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ complex has a stability constant βn.

So then my initial approach is correct.

So, with that, the percentage is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, wait a minute. Let me check the calculation again.

Sum inside the bracket:

1 + β1*(0.1) + β2*(0.1)^2 + β3*(0.1)^3 + β4*(0.1)^4.

Plugging in the numbers:

1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 *0.01) + (63 *0.001)+(16 *0.0001 )

Calculating each term:

9 *0.1=0.9

40 *0.01=0.4

63 *0.001=0.063

16 *0.0001=0.0016

Sum is 1 + 0.9=1.9 → +0.4=2.3 → +0.063=2.363 → +0.0016=2.3646.

So x= (0.01) /2.3646 ≈ 0.004224 M.

Then [Co(SCN)_2]^+ is β2 * x * (0.1)^2 =40 *0.004224 *0.01.

40 *0.004224=0.16896.

0.16896 *0.01=0.0016896 M.

Total Co is 0.01 M. So the fraction is 0.0016896 /0.01 =0.16896 → 16.896%, which rounds to 16.9%. So the answer should be D.

But wait, the options are:

A)42.3%

B)25.6%

C)38.1%

D)16.9%

So the correct answer is D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]⁺, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the given stability constants (β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16), the total cobalt concentration ([Co] = 10⁻² M), and the thiocyanate concentration ([SCN⁻] = 0.1 M).

### Key Steps:
1. **Stability Constants and Complex Formation**:  
   Each stability constant β represents the overall equilibrium constant for the formation of the corresponding cobalt-thiocyanate complex. The concentrations of the complexes can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co²⁺], and [SCN⁻].

   - [CoSCN⁺] = β₁ [Co²⁺] [SCN⁻]  
   - [Co(SCN)₂⁺] = β₂ [Co²⁺] [SCN⁻]²  
   - [Co(SCN)₃³⁺] = β₃ [Co²⁺] [SCN⁻]³  
   - [Co(SCN)₄⁴⁺] = β₄ [Co²⁺] [SCN⁻]⁴  

2. **Total Cobalt Concentration**:  
   The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:  
   \[
   [\text{Co²⁺}] + [\text{CoSCN⁺}] + [\text{Co(SCN)₂⁺}] + [\text{Co(SCN)₃³⁺}] + [\text{Co(SCN)₄⁴⁺}] = 10^{-2} \, \text{M}.
   \]  
   Substituting the expressions for the complexes, we get:  
   \[
   [\text{Co²⁺}] \left( 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN⁻}] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN⁻}]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN⁻}]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN⁻}]^4 \right) = 10^{-2}.
   \]  

3. **Calculate the Coefficient**:  
   Substituting β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16, and [SCN⁻]=0.1 M:  
   \[
   1 + (9 \cdot 0.1) + (40 \cdot 0.1^2) + (63 \cdot 0.1^3) + (16 \cdot 0.1^4) = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.
   \]  

4. **Solve for [Co²⁺]**:  
   Using the total cobalt concentration:  
   \[
   [\text{Co²⁺}] = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 4.224 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}.
   \]  

5. **Concentration of [Co(SCN)₂⁺]**:  
   Using the expression for [Co(SCN)₂⁺]:  
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)₂⁺}] = \beta_2 [\text{Co²⁺}] [\text{SCN⁻}]^2 = 40 \cdot (4.224 \times 10^{-3}) \cdot (0.1)^2.
   \]  
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)₂⁺}] = 40 \cdot 4.224 \times 10^{-3} \cdot 0.01 = 1.6896 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}.
   \]  

6. **Percentage of [Co(SCN)₂⁺]**:  
   The percentage of [Co(SCN)₂⁺] among all cobalt species is:  
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)₂⁺}]}{[\text{Total Co}]} \right) \cdot 100 = \left( \frac{1.6896 \times 10^{-3}}{10^{-2}} \right) \cdot 100 = 16.9\%.
   \]  

### Final Answer:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂⁺], among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.  

Answer: D
