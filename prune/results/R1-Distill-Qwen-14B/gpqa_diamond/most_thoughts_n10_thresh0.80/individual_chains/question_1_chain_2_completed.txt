Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish the two levels. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. 

Wait, but in this case, the lifetimes given are the lifetimes of each state. So each state has its own lifetime. I think the time uncertainty Δt for each state is the lifetime itself. So for E1, Δt would be 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, it's 1e-8 seconds. 

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. So the energy difference ΔE must be such that the uncertainty in energy (from each state's lifetime) is smaller than the actual energy difference. Otherwise, the two states might not be distinguishable. 

So, the uncertainty in energy for each state would be ħ divided by the lifetime. Let me calculate that. The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. 

For E1: ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J. To convert that into eV because the options are in eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602176634e-19 joules. So, 1.05e-25 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV = approximately 6.56e-7 eV. So about 6.56e-7 eV uncertainty for E1. 

Similarly, for E2: τ2 is 1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J. Converting to eV: 1.05e-26 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 6.56e-8 eV. 

Wait, but I'm not sure if I should take the maximum uncertainty from either state. Because when we have two states, perhaps the overall uncertainty is the larger of the two? Or maybe we need the energy difference to be larger than both uncertainties to resolve them. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, the states would appear the same. 

So the maximum uncertainty between the two states would be the larger ΔE between the two. Here, E1 has a smaller lifetime, which leads to a larger uncertainty in energy. So the uncertainty in E from E1 is about 6.56e-7 eV. 

So, the energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 should be larger than this uncertainty to clearly distinguish them. Let me check the options.

Option A: 1e-9 eV. That's smaller than 6.5e-7 eV. So it's too small; they can't be resolved.

Option B: 1e-11 eV. Also too small.

Option C:1e-4 eV. That's much larger than 6.5e-7 eV. So this should be resolvable.

Option D:1e-8 eV. Also smaller than 6.5e-7 eV. So not enough.

Therefore, the correct answer must be option C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish the two quantum states, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is approximately ħ/2. Here, the lifetimes of the states, τ1 and τ2, correspond to the time uncertainties Δt. 

For the first state with τ1 = 10⁻⁹ seconds:
\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} \approx 1.05 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}.
\]
Converting to electron volts (1 eV = 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ J):
\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For the second state with τ2 = 10⁻⁸ seconds:
\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} \approx 1.05 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]
Converting to electron volts:
\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 must be larger than the larger uncertainty, which is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.56 × 10⁻⁷ eV. 

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A (10⁻⁹ eV):** Too small, as it is smaller than ΔE₁.
- **Option B (10⁻¹¹ eV):** Too small, as it is also smaller than ΔE₁.
- **Option C (10⁻⁴ eV):** Sufficiently large, as it is much greater than ΔE₁.
- **Option D (10⁻⁸ eV):** Too small, as it is smaller than ΔE₁.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**.

Answer: C
