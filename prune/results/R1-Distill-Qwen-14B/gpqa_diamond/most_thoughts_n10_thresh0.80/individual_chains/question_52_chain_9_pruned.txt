Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see what it's about. The question is about stars and their effective temperatures, and how spots on the star affect certain atomic ratios in the photosphere. Hmm.

Alright, let's break it down. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Interesting. So the presence of spots cools the star's surface overall.

Now, the main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). They've observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, without spots, the ratio is higher, and with spots, it's lower. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes. So, ratio without spots divided by ratio with spots.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. I remember that this is in the near-ultraviolet range. And the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium holds. So, I can probably use the Boltzmann equation here.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels. The formula is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of each level, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, the ratio is N1/N2. Because the question says the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2. Let me check that. The question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So N1/N2 decreases, meaning that N1 is going down compared to N2 when there are spots.

But wait, when the effective temperature of the photosphere goes down, how does this affect the ratio? Let me think. The Boltzmann factor is exp(-ΔE/(k T)). Since T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the factor becomes smaller. So, if T goes down, the ratio N1/N2 would go up because the denominator (level 2) is lower in population.

Wait, no, let me think again. The ratio is N1/N2. Let me write the equation: N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Wait, because E2 is higher than E1 (they are different energy levels, let's assume E2 > E1 for the transition). So (E2 - E1) is positive.

So, when T decreases, the exponent (E2 - E1)/(k T) increases. Because T is in the denominator. So, the exponential term becomes larger, which makes N1/N2 larger. So when the overall temperature goes down, the ratio N1/N2 should increase. But the question states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Hmm, that seems conflicting.

Wait, maybe I got the levels wrong. Maybe E1 is higher than E2. No, because the transition between them is a specific wavelength. Oh, wait, the transition corresponds to a photon emitted when an atom drops from level 2 to level 1. So E2 is higher than E1. So the transition energy is E2 - E1.

So in the Boltzmann equation, the ratio N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Wait, no, actually, the equation is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So N1/N2 would be the inverse: N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ).

So, when T decreases, the exponent (E2 - E1)/(k T) increases because T is in the denominator. So exp(positive number) increases. So N1/N2 increases as T decreases.

But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So that would mean that when T decreases, N1/N2 decreases. But according to the equation, that's not the case. Hmm, that's a conflict. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me think again. When the star has spots, the overall effective temperature is lower. So T is lower. So if T is lower in the spots scenario, then according to the equation, N1/N2 should be higher. But the problem says the ratio decreases. So perhaps the ratio is N2/N1 instead? Or I have the levels reversed.

Wait, perhaps the ratio in the problem is N2/N1, not N
