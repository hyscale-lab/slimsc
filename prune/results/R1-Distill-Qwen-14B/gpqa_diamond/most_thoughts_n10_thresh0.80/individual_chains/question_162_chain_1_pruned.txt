Okay, so I've got this question here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let me think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) multiplied by (dx² + dy²). Wait, so that's like a line element in two dimensions, right? So this is a 2D metric, which suggests that the space is either a 2D surface or part of it.

I remember that for surfaces, the metric can tell us about the curvature. The area element in such a metric is usually found by taking the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. Since this is 2D, the metric tensor is a 2x2 matrix. The determinant would be (g_xx * g_yy - g_xy²). But wait, in this case, the metric is diagonal, so cross terms (g_xy) are zero. So the determinant is just (g_xx * g_yy).

Looking at the metric, g_xx and g_yy are both 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². So the square root of that would be 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element dA would be that times dx dy. So dA = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. Oh wait, pseudosphere... Hmm. A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? Like a tractricoid. Its area is finite even though it's infinitely long.

But wait, I'm given a specific metric here. So maybe I don't need to think about the pseudosphere in general but instead compute the area from this metric.

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. So perhaps this metric represents a pseudosphere of radius 2. Let me think about the metric of a pseudosphere.

The standard metric for a pseudosphere (tractricoid) in polar coordinates is something like ds² = dr² + (a² / cosh²(r/a)) dθ², where a is the radius. But wait, that's in polar coordinates. The given metric is in terms of x and y. Alternatively, perhaps it's in isothermal coordinates or something like that.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the area by integrating the area element
