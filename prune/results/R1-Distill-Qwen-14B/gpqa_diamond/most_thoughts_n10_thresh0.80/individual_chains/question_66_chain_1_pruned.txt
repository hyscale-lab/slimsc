Okay, so I have this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that its operators must respect. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. But wait, which symmetries exactly?

The question gives four options: Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. And the options are combinations of these. I need to figure out which of these symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

Wait, let me think. Lorentz symmetry is definitely a big one. Because the Standard Model is Lorentz invariant, and SMEFT is an effective theory built from it, right? So all the operators in SMEFT should be Lorentz scalars. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) must be respected.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like boosts and rotations). Wait, but in a renormalizable theory, Poincare symmetry is a bigger symmetry, but in effective theories, perhaps some of the symmetries are broken more. Or wait, no, because SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, it's still supposed to respect the same spacetime symmetries as the Standard Model. So Poincare symmetry (option 2) must also be respected. So 1 and 2 are correct so far.

CP symmetry (option 3): I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think that in the Standard Model, the symmetry is only approximately CP. But wait, SMEFT can include operators that violate CP, right?
