Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that an unknown compound was prepared, and they used FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry for characterization. The FTIR shows a very broad peak at 3000 cm^-1. Hmm, I remember that broad peaks around there are usually O-H stretches. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Oh wait, but carboxylic acids have a very broad peak because the O-H is acidic and has strong hydrogen bonding. So maybe that's a clue.

Then, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. I'm trying to think what those could be. The 1700 is a strong peak—could that be a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid? The 1650 is a bit lower, maybe an aromatic ring or conjugated carbonyl groups. Wait, maybe it's an ester. Esters have two carbonyl peaks? No, wait, esters typically have one around 1700-1750. Maybe the 1650 is something else. Oh, like an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds—maybe a C=C in conjugation with something else. Or maybe it's an amide, but the question doesn't mention anything about NMR peaks that would suggest amines. Let me think. Another possibility is that the 1700 is a carbonyl, and the 1650 is an aromatic C=C stretch. Like in a benzene ring with substituents that cause the absorption to shift.

Moving on to the 1H NMR. It says there are several peaks, including vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound likely has a double bond, probably part of a ring or maybe an isolated double bond. If it's aromatic, then the H's would be in a certain region, but vinyl could be either. Wait, but vinyl in alkenes would show up around 4.5-6 ppm or something like that, while aromatic protons are usually higher, around 6.5
