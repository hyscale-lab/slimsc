Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that a rhombohedral crystal has all its edges equal and all angles the same. So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between atoms, which in a crystal is the lattice parameter, I think. So a rhombohedral system has a lattice parameter 'a' which is the same for all sides, right?

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. I remember that the interplanar distance, d(hkl), is calculated using the formula derived from the crystal's lattice. For a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but since this is a rhombohedral system, which is a special case, the formula must be a bit different.

Wait, rhombohedral is part of the hexagonal crystal system? Or no, wait, no, rhombohedral is a type of crystal system on its own, part of the cubic system when angles are 90. So perhaps the formula for d is similar but adjusted for the angles.

I think the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles alpha, beta, gamma is given by:

1/d² = (h²)/(a²) + (k²)/(b²) + (l²)/(c²) - [2h k cos(beta - gamma)/(a b) + 2h l cos(alpha - gamma)/(a c) + 2k l cos(alpha - beta)/(b c)] )

But wait, in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and alpha = beta = gamma, so this should simplify things. So let me substitute a for b and c, and all angles are 30 degrees.

So the formula becomes:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - [ 2hk cos(0) / a² + 2hl cos(0)/a² + 2kl cos(0)/a² ]

Wait, because for rhombo, all angles are the same, so beta - gamma is zero, so cos(0)=1.

So simplifying:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - [ 2hk + 2hl + 2kl ] / a²

The numerator becomes:

h² + k² + l² - 2hk - 2hl - 2kl

Which factors into (h - k - l)^2? Wait no, let me think. Actually, h² + k² + l² - 2hk - 2hl -2kl = (h - k - l)^2? Wait, let me compute (h - k - l)^2. That's h² + k² + l² - 2hk - 2hl + 2kl. No, because (a - b - c)^2 = a² + b² + c² - 2ab - 2ac + 2bc. Wait, that's not matching the terms. So maybe I made a mistake in factoring.

Wait, perhaps the expression can be rewritten. Let's see: h² + k² + l² - 2hk - 2hl - 2kl = (h² - 2hk + k²) - 2hl - 2kl + l². Hmm, not obvious. Alternatively, maybe it's (h +k + l)^2 but with a negative sign. Wait, no, (h +k + l)^2 is h² +k² + l² + 2hk + 2hl + 2kl. So our expression is the opposite: h² +k² + l² - 2hk -2hl -2kl = (h +k + l)^2 - 4(hk + hl + kl). Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to just plug in the specific case given in the question. The plane is (111), so h=k=l=1. So let's substitute h=1, k=1, l=1 into the equation.

So substituting:

1/d² = (1² +1² +1²)/(a²) - [ 2*(1)(1) + 2*(1)(1) + 2*(1)(1) ] / a²

Compute numerator:

3/a² - [ 2 + 2 + 2 ] /a² = (3 -6)/a² = (-3)/a².

Wait, that can't be right because 1/d² can't be negative. Did I mess up the formula? Hmm, maybe I used the wrong sign in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system. Because I might have the signs wrong.

Another approach: I think the formula for d in a rhombohedral system is given by:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) * cos(θ) ) 

Wait, or perhaps it's:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) * cos(θ) )

But wait, θ is the angle between the lattice vectors, which in a rhombohedral system is 30 degrees here. So substituting θ=30°, a=10 Angstrom.

But wait, is that the correct formula? Maybe I should check.

Alternatively, I remember that in a rhombohedral system, the Miller indices (hkl) correspond to the same as a cubic system but with a modified structure factor. So perhaps the formula for d is indeed:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl)*cos(α) )

Assuming α is the angle between the lattice vectors, which for the rhombo case is 30°, and a is the lattice parameter (10 Angstrom). Wait, but wait, the formula I derived earlier, when substituting h=k=l=1, gives 3 - 6 cos(30°), right?

Wait, perhaps I should correct the formula. Let me think again. The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 (1/a^2)) + (k^2 (1/b^2)) + (l^2 (1/c^2)) - 2hk/(a b) cos gamma - 2hl/(a c) cos beta - 2kl/(b c) cos alpha ) )

But for a rhombo system, a = b = c = a0, and alpha = beta = gamma = θ. So substituting, the equation becomes:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²)/(a0²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ / (a0²) )

So,

d = a0 / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

So in this case, h=k=l=1, θ=30°, a0=10 Angstrom.

So let's compute the denominator:

h² +k² +l² = 1 +1 +1 =3.

2(hk + hl + kl) = 2*(1*1 + 1*1 +1*1) = 2*(3) =6.

So the denominator becomes sqrt(3 -6 * cos(30°) )

Wait, cos(30°) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So 6 * cos(30) =6 * 0.8660 =5.196.

3 -5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, that's negative. Taking the square root of a negative number isn't possible. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Hmm, this can't be, because the interplanar distance must be a real positive number. So perhaps I messed up the formula's signs.

Wait, let me re-examine the general formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos beta - 2kl cos gamma )

Wait, but wait, in a rhombo case, all the angles are the same, so:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2hk cosθ - 2hl cosθ - 2kl cosθ )

So,

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2 cosθ (hk + hl + kl) )

With h=k=l=1, that becomes:

d = a / sqrt(3 - 2 cosθ *3 )

Because (h² +k² +l²) is 3, and (hk + hl + kl) is 3.

So substituting θ=30°, a=10:

d = 10 / sqrt( 3 - 6 * cos(30°) )

Compute cos(30) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 6 * 0.8660 ≈5.196.

So 3 -5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, that's the same as before. So the denominator is sqrt(-2.196), which is imaginary. That can't be right.

But wait, that's impossible. So I must have the wrong formula. Maybe I should think differently.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is different. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, another approach: in a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice vectors can be used to find the interplanar distances. But perhaps that's getting too complicated.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, but why plus? Because earlier, I had a minus, and that led to a square root of a negative number, which is impossible. So perhaps the correct formula is with a plus in front of the cross terms. Let me try that.

So,

d = a / sqrt( 3 + 6 cosθ )

Because h=k=l=1, so h² +k² +l²=3, and hk + hl + kl=3, so 2*(3)=6.

So,

d = 10 / sqrt(3 + 6 * cos(30°) )

Compute cos(30) ≈0.8660.

So 6 * 0.8660 ≈5.196.

Sum is 3 +5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) ≈ approx 2.863.

So d ≈10 /2.863 ≈3.49 Angstrom? But none of the options are close to that. Hmm, the options are around 8-10 Angstroms. So I must have messed up the formula.

Wait, maybe I have the angles in the wrong way. Because in some crystal systems, the angles can be different, but in rhombohedral, all angles are the same. Wait, but the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombo system might involve taking into account the angles correctly. Maybe I should use the formula in terms of the reciprocal lattice.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the unit cell vectors
