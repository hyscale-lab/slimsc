Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is like a surface of constant negative curvature, right? But wait, the question is about the area, so I need to think about how to compute that from the given metric.

The metric provided is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) times (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a conformal metric because it's a scalar function multiplied by (dx² + dy²). Conformal metrics are easier to work with because you can use standard area computations with the conformal factor squared.

I think the area in such a metric would involve integrating the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. But wait, since it's conformally flat, the determinant is just the square of the conformal factor. So for a 2D metric, the area element dA would be (g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Let me see, the metric tensor here is diagonal with components g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))². Therefore, the area element would be sqrt(det) dx dy, but wait, for 2D, the area element is just (sqrt(g)) dx dy, which in this case is (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

Wait, no. Wait, the determinant of a 2x2 diagonal matrix with elements A and B
