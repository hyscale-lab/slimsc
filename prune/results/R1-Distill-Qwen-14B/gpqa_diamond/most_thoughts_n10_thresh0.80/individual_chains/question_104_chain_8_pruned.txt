Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand it.

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the Radial Velocity (RV) method. There are two stars, both with the same mass as our Sun. Each star has a planet, and both planets have masses similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits.

The RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The problem states that Planet #1 caused a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm, okay. I remember that the RV method measures the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude is something like K = (v*sin i) where v is the actual velocity. But wait, I think there's a more precise formula involving the masses and the orbital period.

Wait, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p)^3 ) / (M_star^2 + M_p^2) )^(1/3) ] * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )) * (1 / (P * (1 - e^2)^(1/2)) ) )

But since the planets have masses similar to Neptune, which is much less than the star's mass (Sun-like stars), M_p << M_star. So M_p/M_star is negligible, so we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, and (M_p / (M_star + M_p))^3 ≈ (M_p / M_star)^3. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Let's recall the correct formula.

Wait, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude is:

K = ( (G * P ) / (2π c^3) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) * (1/(1 - e²)^(1/2)) )

But since e=0 for circular orbits, and M_p << M_star, this simplifies. Let me think. Simplifying, the formula becomes:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p^3 ) / ( M_star^2 * P ) )^(1/3) / (c)

Wait, no, perhaps I should remember that K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1 / P^(1/3))), because if the star's velocity is inversely related to the planet's orbital period. Alternatively, I think K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3))).

Wait, let me get this right. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) )^(1/3) * [ sin i / (1 + M_p/M_star) ]

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the relation between K and the orbital period. Since both stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses, maybe the ratio of their K values relates directly to the inverse cube root of their periods?

Wait, the formula for K is (from my notes):

K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) (1 + M_p/M_star) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps the exact formula is:

K = [ (G * M_p^3 ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 * P ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / c )

But since M_p is much less than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so it becomes:

K ≈ [ (G * M_p^3 ) / ( M_star^2 * P ) ) ]^(1/3) / c

Wait, but perhaps I'm complicating this. Let's think about what variable affects K. Since both stars have the same mass, M_star is the same for both. The planets have similar masses, so M_p1 ≈ M_p2. So, K is proportional to (M_p / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)))).

Wait, wait, let me write down the formula correctly.

The formula for the semi-amplitude of radial velocity is:

K = (v star) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * ( (1) / (P * (1 - e^2)^(
