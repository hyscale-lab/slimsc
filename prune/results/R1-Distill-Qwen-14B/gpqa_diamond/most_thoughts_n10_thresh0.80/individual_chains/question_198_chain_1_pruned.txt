Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with stability constants and complex ion equilibria. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species in the solution. The given data includes the concentrations of Co(II) and SCN⁻, and the stability constants for the different complexes.

Hmm, okay, let's break it down. First, I remember that stability constants (β) indicate how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form. So the complexes with higher β values will dominate.

The problem states that the solution has Co²+ and SCN⁻. The total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M, and SCN⁻ is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, wait, that's a bit confusing because the β's don't seem to be in order. Let me check again: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Oh, I see, so β3 is the highest, followed by β2, then β4 and β1. Wait, no, β3=63 is the highest, then β2=40, then β4=16, then β1=9? Or wait, maybe the order is based on the number of SCN⁻ attached. Let me think: the complexes are probably Co(SCN)_n^(2- n) where n is 1,2,3,4.

Wait, but the question specifically asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN⁻ ions attached, right? So the complex would be [Co(SCN)₂]^0. Because each SCN⁻ contributes -1 charge, two of them would be -2, and Co²+ would balance that. So [Co(SCN)₂] is a neutral complex. So the species we're interested in is the one where n=2, which is the second complex.

Wait, but the stability constants given are β1, β2, etc. So I think βn corresponds to the complex with n SCN⁻ ions. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)₂], β3 for [Co(SCN)3]^- and β4 for [Co(SCN)4]^2-.

Wait, but I need to make sure I get the charge right. For Co²+ and SCN⁻, each SCN⁻ adds a negative charge. So:

- [CoSCN]^+ would have Co²+ + SCN⁻ → Co(SCN) → charge is 2+ (Co) + (-1) (SCN) = +1. So the overall charge is +1. So the complex is [CoSCN]^+.

- [Co(SCN)₂]^0: 2*(-1) from SCN⁻ + 2+ from Co gives 0 charge.

- [Co(SCN)3]^−: 3*(-1) +2+ = -1.

- [Co(SCN)4]^2−: 4*(-1) +2+ = -2.

So the stability constants are for each of these complexes. The β values are β1=9 (n=1), β2=40 (n=2), β3=63 (n=3), β4=16 (n=4). Wait, that's a bit confusing because beta3 is higher than beta2. So the [Co(SCN)3]^- has a higher stability constant than [Co(SCN)₂], meaning it's more stable? But wait, maybe I got the order wrong. Let me make sure: the β is the formation constant, which for each step. Wait, no, the given β are the overall formation constants, so each βn is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex with n SCN⁻ ions.

So the β values for each complex are as
