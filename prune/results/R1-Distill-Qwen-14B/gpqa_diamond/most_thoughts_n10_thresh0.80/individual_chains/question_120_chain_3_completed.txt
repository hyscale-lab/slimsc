Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question says to assume that stars are uniformly distributed, and we need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Let me start by recalling what parallax is. Parallax is a measure of how much a star's position shifts in the sky as the Earth orbits the Sun. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh right, the formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So a star at 1 parsec has a parallax of 1 arcsecond, 2 parsecs is 0.5, etc.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax range. So if I consider a range of parallax values, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range?

Wait, the problem states that stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly in what sense? I think it probably means uniformly in space, so their distances are uniformly distributed. Or maybe they are uniformly distributed in some other way. Oh, right, the question says "uniformly distributed in the sky," but that's a bit ambiguous. I think in astronomy, when they say uniformly distributed in the sky, it often refers to in terms of distance. So maybe the number of stars per unit volume is constant.

Wait, another approach: stars are uniformly distributed in space, so their distances are uniformly distributed. But how does that translate into parallax?

Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So if you have a uniform distribution of stars in space, their distances (d) are spread out uniformly. Let's model this.

Suppose the number density of stars is n (so per unit volume). Then, in a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd, the number of stars would be n * 4πd² dd. Because the volume of a thin shell is 4πd² dd.

But since parallax plx is 1/d, we can express d as 1/plx. So let's substitute d into the expression.

The number of stars in the shell is n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d plx / (d plx/d d)) ) Wait, maybe I should relate dd to dplx.

Let me think. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Taking the derivative, dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx. Since we're dealing with small increments, the negative sign just indicates direction, so for the purpose of counting stars, we can take absolute values. So, d d = (1/plx^2) dplx.

Wait, let's be careful. The number of stars between plx and plx + dplx is the integral over d from 1/(plx + dplx) to 1/plx. So the integral over d is from d to d + dd, where dd is - (d^2) dplx because d = 1/plx.

But perhaps I should approach this more straightforwardly.

We have the number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dd is n * 4πd² dd.

But I need to express this in terms of parallax plx. So, since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx, and dd = -d^2 dplx = - (1/(plx)^2) dplx.

The number of stars per unit parallax range (dplx) would then be:

N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/(plx^2) dplx) ) / dplx.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again.

Actually, the number of stars in the shell is n * 4πd² dd.

But I want to find the number per unit change in plx, so I need to express this in terms of plx.

So, since d = 1/plx, then dd = (d^2) dplx = (1/plx)^2 dplx.

Substituting back into the number of stars in the shell:

N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx.

So N = 4πn / plx^4 * dplx.

But wait, that's the number of stars per unit dplx (since dplx is the range). So the number per unit plx would be N/dplx = 4πn / plx^4.

Wait, but that seems to suggest that the number of stars per unit range of plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. But that's option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because if the stars are more numerous at larger distances (since plx is smaller), but the number per unit plx... Hmm, let me think again.

Wait, no. Wait, for small parallax (large d), the number of stars in that shell would be larger because the volume is larger. But since plx is small, if you have a fixed dplx (say, 0.1 parallax units), how does the number of stars in that range change with plx?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the differential number of stars per unit plx.

The number of stars between plx and plx + dplx is N = n * 4π (d)^2 * dd.

But d = 1/plx, so d^2 is 1/plx^2. And dd = d (dplx) because plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx, so dd = (d^2 dplx). Because, plx increases as d decreases.

Wait, let me compute dd in terms of dplx.

We have plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx.

Taking derivative: d d = - (1/plx²) dplx → so dd = (1/plx²) dplx.

So substituting into N:

N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx.

So N = n *4π/(plx^4) * dplx.

But the question is about the number per unit plx range; that is, N / dplx = 4 π n / plx^4.

So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number decreases as plx increases, which makes sense because higher plx implies closer stars, which are fewer in number.

Wait, but let me think about the volume. If you have a unit change in plx, how much volume does that correspond to? Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, the volume increases as you go to larger distances, but the change in plx is the same.

Wait, no, the number of stars in a given plx range (like from plx to plx + dplx) would decrease as plx increases because the same dplx corresponds to a smaller volume element as plx increases.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of it another way. For a given dplx, how many stars are there at a certain plx.

If the distribution is uniform in space, the number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dd is n * 4πd² dd.

But since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So the number of stars in that shell is n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/(plx^2)) dplx.

Wait, that gives n 4 π / plx^4 dplx. So the number per unit dplx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but if the number per unit dplx is 1/plx^4, then the number per unit plx (since dplx is 1) would be 1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit plx is inversely proportional to plx^4.

So the number decreases as plx increases, which makes sense because higher plx (closer stars) are fewer, and lower plx (more distant) have more stars.

So looking at the options, option A is ~ 1/plx^4.

But wait, another way to think: the number of stars per unit volume is uniform, so n = constant.

The number of stars per unit volume is n. The volume of a shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4 π d² dd.

But since we're considering a range in plx, which is 1/d, we have to express this in terms of plx.

As we did before, the number is N = n *4π (d)^2 dd = n 4 π (1/plx)^2 (1/plx^2 dplx) ) = n 4 π / plx^4 dplx.

Thus, the number per unit plx (dplx=1) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the correct answer is option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: 

\[
\text{plx} = \frac{1}{d},
\]

where \(d\) is the distance in parsecs. Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density of stars is constant (\(n\)), and the number of stars in a spherical shell at distance \(d\) with thickness \(dd\) is given by:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 \, dd.
\]

To express this in terms of parallax, we substitute \(d = 1/\text{plx}\) and compute \(dd\) in terms of \(d\text{plx}\). Taking the derivative of \(d = 1/\text{plx}\), we find:

\[
dd = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx}.
\]

Substituting \(d = 1/\text{plx}\) and \(dd = 1/\text{plx}^2 \, d\text{plx}\) into the expression for \(N\), we get:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx}.
\]

Simplifying, this becomes:

\[
N = \frac{4\pi n}{\text{plx}^4} \, d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars per unit range of parallax is then:

\[
\frac{N}{d\text{plx}} = \frac{4\pi n}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is inversely proportional to \(\text{plx}^4\). Therefore, as parallax increases (closer stars), the number of stars per unit range decreases, and as parallax decreases (more distant stars), the number of stars per unit range increases.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ 1/\text{plx}^4.**
