Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are 1e-2 M for cobalt and 0.1 M for SCN-. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The options are A to D.

Hmm, right. So, first, I need to figure out which complex is the dithiocyanato one. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands, so that's probably the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, which is the one with the β2 value of 40. Wait, but wait—no, β2 is for the second complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+? Or is β1 the first complex with one ligand, β2 with two, etc.? Or maybe β1 is [CoSCN]^+, β2 [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 [Co(SCN)_3]^-? I'm a bit confused about the charge here.

Wait, let's think. Cobalt is Co^2+. Thiocyanate is SCN^- with a charge of -1. So each SCN adds -1 to the complex. So:

- [Co(SCN)]^+ would be Co^2+ plus one SCN^-, so charge is 2+ + (-1) = +1. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+.

- [Co(SCN)_2]^0 would be Co^2+ plus two SCN^-, so 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0. So β2 is for that, and that's the colorless complex, I think.

Wait, but the problem refers to the blue dithiocyanato complex. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the colors. Wait, I recall that [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is blue. Oh wait, maybe β4 is for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? So in that case, the dithiocyanato would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is β2=40.

Wait, but the problem mentions dithiocyanato, which is two SCN- ligands. So that's [Co(SCN)_2]^0, with β2=40. So the question is about that species. So we need to find the fraction of Co species that are in this form.

To find the percentage, I need to calculate the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 relative to all possible Co species.

In such a scenario, the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all possible complexes and the free Co^2+ ion. The species present are:

1. Co^2+ (free ion)
2. [Co(SCN)]^+ (β1=9)
3. [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (β2=40)
4. [Co(SCN)_3]^- (β3=63)
5. [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} (β4=16)

Wait, but also, there's [Co(SCN)_3]^-, β3=63, and [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, β4=16.

Wait, the stability constants are given as β1 to β4. So β1 is for the first complex, [CoSCN]^+ (charge +1), β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- (charge -1), β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

So the complexes are ordered with increasing number of SCN- ligands, and each has a different stability constant.

But wait, the problem is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Wait, I thought that the blue color comes from [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Because I remember that when you add excess SCN- to Co^2+, the color changes from pink (Co^2+) to blue when tetrahedral complexes form. So maybe the blue one is [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Wait, but the problem says "dithiocyanato", which is two SCN- ligands. So that's [Co(SCN)_2]^0. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the colors mixed up. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 as the blue one. I'm a little confused, but perhaps I should proceed with the given stability constants.

So, the approach here is to calculate the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 among all possible Co species.

In solution, the Co exists in various complexed forms. The concentrations are dependent on the stability constants and the concentrations of SCN-.

The formula for each complex is:

For each complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}, the concentration is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} = β_n * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^n

But wait, I think the general formula for each complex is:

[CoL_n]^{2-n} = β_n [Co^2+][L]^n

Here, L is SCN^-.

So the concentration of each complex depends on β and the concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN^-.

The total concentration of Co is the sum of all these complexes plus the free Co^2+.

So, c_total = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}

But the problem states that c(Co) is 1e-2 M. So this is the sum of all the Co species.

Wait, but what about the concentration of SCN^-?

SCN^- is 0.1 M. But as the complexes form, they consume SCN^-.

But wait, the problem gives [SCN^-] as 0.1 M. So perhaps we can assume that the concentration of SCN^- is in excess, and that the free SCN^- concentration isn't significantly affected by the complex formation. Alternatively, if the concentration isn't too high, the free SCN^- might change, but for the sake of this problem, maybe we can take [SCN^-] as 0.1 M.

But I'm not sure. Let's think: if the SCN- concentration is high, then the formation of higher complexes is favored. But in our case, the free [SCN^-] is given as 0.1 M.

So, perhaps the approach is to model the distribution of Co species using the stability constants, the concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN^-.

So, let's denote:

Let [Co^2+] = x

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 * x * [SCN]^1 = 9 * x * (0.1)

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 * x * [SCN]^2 =40 * x * (0.1)^2

[Co(SCN)_3]^- = β3 * x * [SCN]^3 =63 * x * (0.1)^3

[Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} = β4 * x * [SCN]^4 =16 * x * (0.1)^4

Wait, but wait, the concentration of each complex is given by β multiplied by [Co^2+] multiplied by [SCN^-]^n, where n is the number of SCN ligands.

So, the sum of all these concentrations (including free Co^2+) equals the total cobalt concentration, c_total = 1e-2 M.

So,

x + 9*x*(0.1) + 40*x*(0.1)^2 +63*x*(0.1)^3 +16*x*(0.1)^4 = 1e-2

Wait, let me compute each term:

Term 1: x
Term 2:9x*0.1=0.9x
Term3:40x*(0.01)=0.4x
Term4:63x*(0.001)=0.063x
Term5:16x*(0.0001)=0.0016x

Sum: x +0.9x +0.4x +0.063x +0.0016x = (1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016) x

Calculating the sum inside the parentheses:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 +0.4=2.3

2.3 +0.063=2.363

2.363 +0.0016=2.3646

So,

2.3646 x = 1e-2

So,

x = (1e-2) / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004225 M

So [Co^2+] is approximately 0.004225 M.

Now, the concentration of the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex is:

40 * x * (0.1)^2 =40 * x *0.01 =0.4 x

Substituting x:

0.4 * 0.004225 ≈ 0.00169 M

Similarly, the total concentration is 1e-2 M, so the percentage is (0.00169 / 0.01) *100 =16.9%.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, when I calculated the sum, I think I might have missed a decimal somewhere. Let me recompute each term.

Wait,

x = [Co^2+] = 0.004225 M.

[CoSCN]^+ = 9 * x * 0.1 = 9*0.004225 *0.1 = 9 *0.0004225 = 0.0038025 M

Wait, no, wait: 9 * (0.004225) *0.1 = 9 *0.0004225 = 0.0038025 M.

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 =40 * x * (0.1)^2 =40 *0.00
