Okay, so I need to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh wait, |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. So they form an orthonormal basis. The state is given up to a proportionality constant, which I probably need to normalize.

Then, the question is about calculating the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Wait, that sounds familiar. Oh right! For a 2x2 matrix, if the diagonal elements are 0 and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A would be (hbar/2) times that.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are usually sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. So this operator A is (hbar/2) times sigma_x. But wait, the standard Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So if A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, then its eigenvalues would be ± hbar/2.

Wait, so the operator is A = (ħ/2) σ_x. So when you measure this operator, you can only get eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

The next part is to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate. But wait, the eigenstates of A would be the eigenstates of sigma_x, which are |+x> and |-x>, right? Because sigma_x's eigenstates are the superpositions of |up> and |down>.

So the state |alpha> is given, but expressed in the z-basis. To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of A, I need to express |alpha> in the x-basis, i.e., in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the expansion coefficients of |alpha> in the x-basis and compute the probabilities from there.

But wait, let's structure this step by step.

First, normalize |alpha>.

The given state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let's find the normalization factor.

The state is proportional to a|up> + b|
