Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about identifying the product when compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of certain functional groups, maybe something like an elimination reaction or a substitution.

First, I need to figure out what compound X is based on the given IR and NMR data. Let's look at the IR data. The peaks in IR can tell me about the functional groups present. The broad peak between 3400-2500 cm-1 suggests there might be an O-H stretch, perhaps from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But wait, carboxylic acids usually have a very broad O-H peak around 2500–3300 cm-1. Oh, but another peak is at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong indication of a carbonyl group. That could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Also, there's a peak at 1610 cm-1 which might be from aromatic C=C stretching, and 1450 cm-1 could be related to aromatic ring vibrations.

Now looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows several signals. The first peak is at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet (bs) integrating to 1H. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton? Wait, no, aldehydes are around 9-10, but that might also be a carboxylic acid proton. Wait, but in NMR, carboxylic acids are usually broad and around 10-12 ppm. So that 10.5 ppm could be a carboxylic acid proton. Or maybe an acidic proton like from an alcohol, but more likely a carboxylic acid. 

The next peak is at 8.0 ppm, a doublet (d) integrating 2H. Then 7.2 ppm, another doublet for 2H. That sounds like para-substituted aromatic protons. So maybe a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. The 8.0 and 7.2 ppm signals are typical for a para-disubstituted benzene, like a nitro group or a methyl group? Wait, if the substituent is electron-withdrawing, the ring protons would be downfield. The 8.0 ppm is more downfield than 7.2, so perhaps one substituent is electron-withdrawing.

Looking further, there's a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which is a multiplet for one proton. That could be a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen or another substituent. Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) – maybe a CH2 group next to a branching point. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a triplet or a doublet, which often is a methyl group attached to something like a CH, perhaps a ketone or a branched chain. And 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl group, like in an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, maybe compound X is a benzene ring with a substituent that has a carbonyl group, perhaps a ketone or ester. The IR at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. The 10.5 ppm peak could be a carboxylic acid, but wait, if it's a carbonyl, maybe it's an ester or a ketone. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid would have a broad peak, so that fits. But the 1720 cm-1 is a bit low for a carboxylic acid; more around 1700-1725. Wait, maybe it's an ester. Esters have carbonyl peaks around 1730-1740, so 1720 is a bit lower. Could it be a ketone? Then the 10.5 ppm wouldn't make sense because ketones don't have protons. So perhaps it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would show up as a broad peak around 2500-3300. The IR shows a broad peak between 3400-2500, which could include the O-H stretch. So that fits.

So maybe compound X is a benzoic acid derivative. The NMR shows a benzene ring with two substituents in para positions. One substituent is a methyl group (if the shifts are such), and another substituent is a side chain with a carbonyl group.

Wait, the NMR has an aromatic region: 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). That suggests that the substituents on the benzene are in the para positions and they are electron-withdrawing groups because the protons are more deshielded. So if one substituent is -COOH, the ring would have two substituents: -COOH and another group. Or perhaps it's a substituent with a carbonyl, like an ester or ketone.

Alternatively, maybe it's a benzene ring with a side chain that includes a carbonyl. Let's think about the NMR signals in the aliphatic region. 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) – maybe a CH adjacent to an oxygen. 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) – perhaps a CH2 next to a branching. 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) – a methyl group attached to a CH, perhaps a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) structure? Or maybe it's a -CH(CH2CH3) something.

Wait, the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl, so that's a CH2CH3 group. So perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a side chain that includes a ketone or another group.

Wait, putting this together: if the benzene ring has a substituent that's a -CO-R group, where R is a branched chain. Let's see, the NMR has a CH at 2.9 ppm, then a CH2 at 1.7, then a CH3 at 1.4 (maybe a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group?), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propionyl group attached to a branched alkyl chain. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

The benzene ring has a substituent at the para position. Let's say the substituent is a propiono group (like -CH2-CO-O-R or something else). Wait, but the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is high. If it's a carboxylic acid, the substituent would be -COOH.

Wait, but then the other substituent on benzene would be a methyl group? Because the aromatic peaks are a doublet each, which suggests two substituents in para, each with two equivalent protons. So the benzene is 4-substituted with two groups. But wait, benzene can't have two substituents in para positions if it's only one substituent. Oh wait, no, the substituents are in the para positions relative to each other. So if you have a benzene ring with two substituents in para positions, like 1,4-disubstituted.

Wait, but the NMR shows two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that suggests that the ring has two substituents, each in para positions, and each causing the neighboring protons to split into doublets.

So perhaps the ring is 4-methyl and 4-something-else. Wait, no, that's not possible. Wait, another scenario: the ring is 4-substituted with a group that has two protons each on adjacent carbons. Maybe the substituent is a side chain with a carbonyl group, like a benzoyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group attached to the ring. Let me think about the aliphatic region. There's a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is probably a CH2CH2CH3 group. The 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H, perhaps a CH2 next to a branching. The 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H, which could be a methyl attached to a CH group. So maybe the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

Wait, let's think about the structure. If the benzene ring is para-substituted with a sec-butyl group and a carbonyl group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propionyl group attached to a sec-butyl chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzoyl group attached to a sec-butyl group. Let me think: the benzene ring has a substituent that is a propionyl chain. So the substituent would be -CH2-CO-...? Or perhaps it's a propyl group attached via a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe it's a benzoyl group attached to a sec-butyl group. So the structure would be something like benzene with a substituent that is a sec-butyl group attached to a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the NMR data must fit. Let me try to imagine the substituent on the benzene is a group like CH2CO-R. No, perhaps the substituent is a propyl chain with a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a ketone, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, another approach: when red phosphorus and HI are used, they typically hydrolyze certain groups. For example, they can be used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, or in the cleavage of alkenes via the oxymercuration or other addition reactions. Alternatively, HI can act as a source of H+ and I- in substitution reactions.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is with a Grignard reagent or some other organometallic, but I'm not sure. Wait, red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of alkyl halides, but more commonly, they're used in the hydrolysis of nitriles, where a nitrile is converted into an amide, then into a carboxylic acid. Oh, wait, but the reaction conditions might vary. If the starting material is a nitrile, then upon hydrolysis with HIO4 (periodic acid) or similar, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, no, for nitrile hydrolysis, typically you'd use H2O and H+ (like H2SO4) for acid hydrolysis, or base with heat. Alternatively, using red phosphorus and HI is another way. Oh, I think that when a nitrile is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes hydrolysis to form an amide, which can then be further hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid under certain conditions. Wait, but in this problem, perhaps the starting material is a nitrile, and the product is a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution. For example, if the starting material has a good leaving group, like a tosylate or a bromide, then treating with HI might lead to an alkylation
