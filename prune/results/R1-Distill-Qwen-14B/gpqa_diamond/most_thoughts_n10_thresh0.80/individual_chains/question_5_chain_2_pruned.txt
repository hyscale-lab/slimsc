Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me try to unpack all the information given.

The operator is P, a vector operator, and we're looking for its eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Wait, right, since we're dealing with angular momentum-like operators, the eigenvalues are usually multiples of ħ/2.

The components of the operator P are given as P_x, P_y, P_z. Each is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down.

P_x is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row [0, 1] and second row [1, 0]. So that's (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]. That's the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2.

P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. That's the Pauli Y matrix scaled similarly.

P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]]. The Pauli Z matrix scaled.

The operator P is a vector, so I think it's represented as a vector of these three components. But wait, to find the eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, we need to construct the operator P·n, which would be a linear combination of P_x, P_y, P_z with coefficients given by the components of n.

Since n lies in the x-z plane, its direction can be described by an angle θ from the z-axis. So the components of n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Wait no, wait. Wait, in the x-z plane, the direction vector would have components (x, 0, z). So yes, n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis.

So the operator along n is P·n = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

Let me compute that. Each component is multiplied by ħ/2, so:

P·n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me write that out as a matrix. Adding the two matrices:

The (1,1) element is cosθ*(1) = cosθ.
The (1,2) element is sinθ*(1) = sinθ.
The (2,1) element is sinθ*(1) = sinθ.
The (2,2) element is cosθ*(-1) = -cosθ.

So the matrix is:

[[cosθ, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ]]

But wait, each element is multiplied by ħ/2. So the matrix is (ħ/2) multiplied by the above. So the actual operator matrix is:

(ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ],
          [sinθ, -cosθ]]

We are looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is:

P·n |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So let me set up the equation.

Let me denote |v> as a two-component vector [a, b]^T. Then,

(ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ],
          [sinθ, -cosθ]] * [a, b]^T = (ħ/2) [a, b]^T

We can divide both sides by ħ/2 to simplify, since it's non-zero:

[[cosθ, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ]] [a, b]^T = [a, b]^T

So the matrix equation becomes:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Let me write these two equations:

1. cosθ a + sinθ b = a → (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0
2. sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b = 0

Hmm, so I need to solve these equations for a and b. Let me write equation 1 and equation 2.

From equation 1: (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0 → equation (1)
From equation 2: sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b = 0 → equation (2)

I can try to express a in terms of b or vice versa.

Let me take equation (1):

(cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

Wait, but cosθ -1 is equal to -(2 sin²(θ/2)), perhaps it's easier to manipulate using trigonometric identities.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out. Let me see if the two equations are multiples of each other.

Wait, let me see equation (1) multiplied by (cosθ +1):

Equation (1) becomes (cosθ -1)(cosθ +1) a + sinθ (cosθ +1) b = 0 → (cos²θ - 1) a + sinθ (cosθ +1) b =0 → (-sin²θ) a + sinθ (cosθ +1) b =0

Equation (2): sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b =0 → equation (2)

Hmm, maybe let me try to find a ratio between a and b.

From equation (1):

(cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b

Similarly, from equation (2):

sinθ a = (cosθ +1) b → a = [ (cosθ +1) / sinθ ] b

So setting these two expressions for a equal:

[ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b = [ (cosθ +1) / sinθ ] b

We can cancel b (assuming b is not zero, and we can check that case later). So,

sinθ/(1 - cosθ) = (cosθ +1)/sinθ

Cross-multiplying: sin²θ = (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ) → sin²θ = 1 - cos²θ → which is an identity since sin²θ + cos²θ =1. So the equations are consistent, and the ratio a/b is [ (1 + cosθ)/ sinθ ]

Wait, that's from equation (2): a = (cosθ +1)/sinθ * b.

So the ratio a/b is (1 + cosθ)/sinθ.

Hmm, another approach: let me express this ratio using trigonometric identities.

(1 + cosθ) = 2 cos²(θ/2)
sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

So the ratio a/b becomes [2 cos²(θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] ) = [ cos(θ/2) ] / [ sin(θ/2) ] = cot(θ/2)

So a = cot(θ/2) * b.

But maybe I can write a and b in terms of a common variable. Let me let b =1 (for simplicity, then normalize later). Then a = cot(θ/2).

Wait, but it's probably easier to express everything in terms of sin and cos of theta/2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can choose the eigenvector to be:

[a, b] = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, let me think. Let me suppose that the eigenvector has a = cos(theta/2) and b = sin(theta/2). Let me test if this satisfies the eigen equation.

So,

a = cos(theta/2), b = sin(theta/2)

Then, from the ratio a/b = cot(theta/2), which matches our earlier expression.

So plugging into equation (1): (cosθ a + sinθ b) = a ?

Wait, equation (1) is (cosθ a + sinθ b) = a.

Let me compute cosθ a + sinθ b.

But a = cos(theta/2), b=sin(theta/2)

So cosθ a = cosθ cos(theta/2) → using the identity cosθ = 2 cos²(theta/2) -1.

Wait, alternatively, cos(theta) = cos(2*(theta/2)) = 2 cos²(theta/2) -1.

So cos(theta) a = [2 cos^2(theta/2) -1] * cos(theta/2) = 2 cos^3(theta/2) - cos(theta/2).

Similarly, sin(theta) b = sin(theta) sin(theta/2) → sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So sin(theta) b = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = 2 sin^2(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So adding cos(theta) a + sin(theta) b:

2 cos^3(theta/2) - cos(theta/2) + 2 sin^2(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

Factor cos(theta/2):

cos(theta/2) [ 2 cos^2(theta/2) -1 + 2 sin^2(theta/2) ]

Hmm, 2 cos^2(theta/2) -1 is equal to cos(theta), and 2 sin^2(theta/2) is 1 - cos(theta).

Wait, let me compute the expression inside the brackets:

[ (2 cos²(theta/2) -1 ) + 2 sin^2(theta/2) ]

= [ cos(theta) + 2 sin^2(theta/2) ]

But 2 sin^2(theta/2) = 1 - cos(theta), so:

= cos(theta) + 1 - cos(theta) = 1.

So the entire expression becomes cos(theta/2) * 1 = cos(theta/2) → which is equal to a. So equation (1) is satisfied.

Similarly, equation (2): sin(theta) a - cos(theta) b = b ?

Wait, equation (2) is sin(theta) a - cos(theta) b = b? Let me recheck.

Wait, the equation is:

sin(theta) a - (cos(theta) +1) b =0 → equation (2).

Wait, in our setup, perhaps equation (2) should be sin(theta) a - (cos(theta) +1) b =0.

Wait, let me plug in a=cos(theta/2), b=sin(theta/2) into equation (2):

sin(theta) a = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] * cos(theta/2) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos^2(theta/2)

(cos(theta) +1) b = [2 cos²(theta/2) -1 +1] sin(theta/2) = [2 cos²(theta/2)] sin(theta/2)

So equation (2) becomes:

2 sin(theta/2) cos^2(theta/2) = 2 cos^2(theta/2) sin(theta/2)

Which is true. So equation is satisfied.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

But wait, are these normalized? Let's check the magnitude. The vector's components are cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) =1. So yes, it's already normalized.

Wait, but let me check the eigenvalue. The operator P·n has eigenvalue +ħ/2, so the eigenvector is correct.

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). So that's option C.

Wait, but wait, the question says the eigenvector is for the operator P along n, which is a combination of P_x, P_y, P_z. So the eigenvector we found is 2-component, so the options should be 2-component vectors.

Looking at the options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) → which matches what I have.

But wait, the question says "the elements of the normalized eigenvector". Since our vector [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] is already normalized, it's correct.

So the correct
