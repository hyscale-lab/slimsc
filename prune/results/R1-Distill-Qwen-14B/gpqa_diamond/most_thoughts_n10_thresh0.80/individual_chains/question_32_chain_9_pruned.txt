Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy of the nucleus they're using. The question states that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c, and I need to find the energy. The options are given as A to D with some GeV values.

First, I should figure out what nucleus X is. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6 because 3 protons +3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion, which is a helium ion perhaps? Or wait, Li-6 is the isotope with 3 neutrons. So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number A=6.

Next, I need to find the total energy of this ion when it's moving at 0.96c. I remember that in relativity, the total energy of a particle isn't just kinetic energy but includes the rest mass energy. So the formula I should use is:

E = γ * m₀c²

Where γ is the Lorentz factor. γ is calculated as 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So let's compute γ first. The speed v is 0.96c. Let me plug in the numbers.

v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c².

Then, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784) is... hmm, I think 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. Let me check: 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784, yes. So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is 0.28. Therefore, γ is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me do the exact calculation.

Wait, 1 - (0.96)^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So 1 / 0.28 is 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

So γ is approximately 3.5714.

Next, find m₀. The mass of the nucleus is the mass of Li-6. Wait, but in particle physics, they often use the reduced mass when considering collisions, but I'm not sure if that applies here. Alternatively, I might have to find the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus.

I think for heavy ions, the rest mass is considered in terms of the number of nucleons. Each nucleon (proton and neutron) has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c². So Li-6 has 6 nucleons, so m₀c² would be 6 * 938 MeV.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no. The actual mass of a nucleus isn't exactly 6 times the mass of a nucleon because of binding energy. However, in high-energy physics, especially in colliders, they often approximate the rest mass of the nucleus as A times the mass of a proton, where A is the atomic mass number. So for Li-6, A=6, so m₀c² = 6 * m_p c². And m_p is approximately 938 MeV/c², so 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.

Wait, but that's an approximation. I'm not sure if this is accurate. Alternatively, the mass can be calculated using the exact atomic masses from the periodic table. Let me think. The exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.0175669 × 10^-27 kg. Wait, but I don't remember the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to convert the atomic mass to MeV/c².

The atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So the mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0175669 u. So m₀c² = 6.0175669 u * 931.5 MeV/u = let's compute that.

First, 6 * 931.5 is about 5589 MeV. Then, 0.0175669 * 931.5 ≈ 16.35 MeV. So total is about 5605.35 MeV, which is approximately 5.60535 GeV.
