Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. The question is about the decay of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ_f fψ^† (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and I need to find the kinematically allowed decay channels.

Hmm, wait, the Lagrangian term looks like it's describing the interaction between the boson X and some fermions. The term is -λ_f f ψ† (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh, right, in the Standard Model, Yukawa interactions are like this, where a scalar field couples to fermions. So the boson X is probably a scalar because the term looks similar to how the Higgs field interacts with fermions.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So when it decays, the possible products must have a combined mass less than 6 GeV, right? Because for a decay to happen, the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle. So I need to look for particles whose rest mass is less than 6 GeV/2 each, since the boson can decay into two particles.

Wait, but the decay products could be fermion-antifermion pairs. Because the interaction term involves ψ and ψ†, so probably X can decay into fermions and their antiparticles.

So the possible decay products are pairs of fermions. Let's list the possible fermions and their masses. 

Quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. But wait, their masses are very different. For example, top quark is around 173 GeV, which is way above 6 GeV. So the top quark is out of the question. How about the others?

Up quark: about 2 MeV, negligible compared to 3 GeV. So X could decay into u and anti-u. Same with down and strange quarks. But in reality, when considering decay products, the mass of each fermion needs to be less than half of X's mass. So each must be less than 3 GeV.

But wait, the particles' masses have to be considered. Let's think about the masses:

- Electron: ~0.5 MeV, so e+ e- is possible.
- Muon: ~105.7 MeV, so mu+ mu- is possible.
- Tau: ~1.78 GeV, so tau+ tau- is possible.
- For quarks, the masses are (approximate):
   u: 2 MeV, d: 4-6 MeV, s: ~95 MeV, c: ~1.3 GeV, b: ~4.5 GeV, t: 173 GeV.

Wait, the bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV. So each b quark is 4.5 GeV. If X is 6 GeV, then 4.5*2 is 9 GeV, which is more than 6. So X can't decay into b b-bar because 4.5*2 =9 >6. So that's not allowed. So any decay into b quarks is impossible. So options that include b b-bar would be incorrect.

Wait, but the problem is about the decay products. So X can't decay into b or t quarks because each is too heavy. So let's see the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A includes b b-bar, which would be impossible because 2*4.5=9>6. So A is not allowed. So A is out.

Option B includes c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, and e+ e-. Let's check each.

c quark mass is about 1.3 GeV. 2*1.3=2.6 <6, so possible.

s quark is about 95 MeV, so 0.19 GeV, 2*0.19=0.38 <6. So yes.

u and d quarks are even lighter, so their pairs are allowed.

Tau is 1.78 GeV, so 2*1.78=3.56 <6. So tau pair is allowed.

e and mu are even lighter, no problem.

But option B includes mu+ mu- which would have a total rest mass of about 0.211 GeV (since each mu is ~105.7 MeV). So yes, that's allowed.

Wait, option B's answer is X→c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. So all these are allowed, except for b quarks and t quarks, which are too heavy.

Option C includes t quarks. Wait, t is 173 GeV, which is way above 6, so X can't decay into t. So C is out.

Option D includes b b-bar, which we know is not allowed, so D is incorrect.

So the only possible option is B, because it includes all the allowed decay channels except for the heavier fermions.

Wait, but what about the interaction term? The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f f ψ† (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe the fermions involved are those that can interact with X. So which fermions are present in the Lagrangian?

Looking at the term, ψ_f(y) is the fermion field. The interaction is proportional to λ_f, which varies for each fermion species. So the Lagrangian would have different terms for each type of fermion. But the question is about the possible decays. So X can decay into any of the fermion-antifermion pairs where each has a mass less than 3 GeV.

Wait, but in reality, quarks can't be produced alone because of confinement, but in high-energy interactions like decays of a boson, they can be produced as pairs. So the decay products can be quark-antiquark pairs.

So the possible decay channels are into any fermion pair where each has mass less than 3 GeV. So for quarks, up, down, strange, charm. Because charm is about 1.3 GeV, 2*1.3=2.6 <6, so possible.

But what about bottom quarks? 4.5 GeV each, so 9 GeV total, which is more than 6, so no. So X can't decay into b or t quarks. So any option that includes b quarks is invalid.

Looking back at the options, option D includes b b-bar. So D is invalid. So the correct options would have to exclude b.

So the correct allowed decays are into: c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, but there's another point. The interaction term may only include certain fermions. The term has f as a suffix, perhaps indicating flavor? Or maybe it's about whether the fermion has a mass. Because the Yukawa interaction is usually for massive fermions. Wait, the interaction term is L(y) = -λ_f f ψ† (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps the fermion gets a mass from the v term. Because in the Standard Model, the Higgs gives mass via the vev (v). So when X couples to ψ_f, it's only for fermions that have a mass term.

So, the fermions that have a mass (i.e., all except neutrinos for the charged leptons) would have a Yukawa coupling. So for the fermions, the interaction is present.

But for the decay, the possible products are any of the fermions whose mass is less than M_X/2.

So the fermions with mass less than 3 GeV are: e-, mu-, tau-, u, d, s, c. Because b is 4.5 GeV, which is more than half of X's mass (6/2=3 GeV). Wait, no, 4.5 is more than 3, so can't be. So for fermions with mass less than 3 GeV, they can be produced.

Wait, but 4.5 GeV is more than 3 GeV, so a b quark cannot be produced, as each would require 4.5 GeV, which is higher than 3. So the decay into b quarks is forbidden.

So the allowed decays are into any pairs where each fermion's mass is <3 GeV. So the possible fermions are: e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

So their pairs would be e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, c c-bar.

So the allowed decay channels are all of these. Looking at the options, option B lists all of these except for the t quark, which is not present. Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, and e. So yes, that's correct.

Other options include t or b, which are impossible. So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the given interaction Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda_f f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (\upsilon + X(y)) \psi_f(y).
\]

### Key Analysis:
1. **Interaction and Decay Mechanism**: The Lagrangian describes a Yukawa-like interaction, where the boson \( X \) couples to fermions. The decay products must be fermion-antifermion pairs, as the interaction term involves \( \psi_f \) and \( \bar{\psi}_f \).

2. **Mass Constraint**: For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the rest mass of each fermion \( f \) must satisfy:
   \[
   2m_f < m_X,
   \]
   where \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Thus, \( m_f < 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

3. **Fermion Masses**:
   - **Leptons**:
     - Electron (\( e \)): \( m_e \approx 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
     - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( m_\mu \approx 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
     - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - **Quarks**:
     - Up (\( u \)): \( m_u \approx 2 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
     - Down (\( d \)): \( m_d \approx 4-6 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
     - Strange (\( s \)): \( m_s \approx 95 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
     - Charm (\( c \)): \( m_c \approx 1.3 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
     - Bottom (\( b \)): \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed (since \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).
     - Top (\( t \)): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed.

4. **Allowed Decay Channels**: The boson \( X \) can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the fermion mass is less than \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This includes:
   - \( e^+ e^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \),
   - \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( c \bar{c} \).

5. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Rejected**.
   - **Option B**: Lists \( c \bar{c} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), \( e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. **Accepted**.
   - **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed. **Rejected**.
   - **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Rejected**.

### Conclusion:
The kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) are \( X \to c \bar{c} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), \( e^+ e^- \), as listed in **Option B**.

**Answer: B**
