Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule. Hmm, let me think. The question is about the momentum of a photon that causes the molecule to transition to the next lowest energy state when it's in its fundamental state. 

Wait, the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, so this model considers both rotational and vibrational energy states. But when it's in its fundamental state, that probably means the lowest energy state for both rotation and vibration.

So the molecule is in the fundamental state, which I think is the first vibrational state (v=0) and the ground rotational state (J=0). Or wait, no, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is when both vibration and rotation are at their lowest levels. So v=0 and J=0.

When a photon is absorbed, it must provide enough energy to move the molecule to the next higher state. But what's the next lowest possible energy state? Well, the next state after the ground state would be the first excited state. But wait, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized for both rotation and vibration. So the molecule can transition either by changing the vibrational state or the rotational state, or both.

The question says it switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the photon must cause the smallest possible energy increase. So we need to find the transition that requires the least energy. Because the next state would be the one that's just the next higher in either vibration or rotation. But wait, the energy levels for rotation and vibration are different, so which one requires less energy to change.

Let me think about the energies involved. The vibrational energy levels are quantized with spacing given by the vibrational frequency, which is given as w=4e14 rad/s. The rotational energy levels are given by the rotational constant, which depends on the moment of inertia.

So for the vibrational transition, the energy difference would be the first overtone, but wait, the fundamental state is v=0. The next vibrational state is v=1. The energy difference for that would be the h*w, where w is the angular frequency. Because E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w. So the difference between v=0 and v=1 is h*w.

For rotational transitions, since the rotational energy levels are E_rot = (J)(J+1) * ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. The ground state is J=0, so the next is J=1. The energy difference would be E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0). For J=0, E=0. For J=1, E= (1)(2) * ħ²/(2I) = 2 ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/(I). So the energy difference is ħ²/(I).

Which energy is smaller? The photon's energy must match either the vibrational or rotational transition, whichever requires less energy.

So let's compute both.

First, compute the vibrational energy difference. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J*s. Angular frequency w is given as 4e14 rad/s. So the energy is E_vib = h*w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Now the rotational energy difference. The moment of inertia I for the diatomic molecule is I = μ r². Where μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length.

The masses are Mx=20 amu and My=2 amu. So the reduced mass μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20 * 2)/(22) = 40/22 = 20/11 amu. 

Wait, 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = (20/11) * 1.6605e-27 kg. Let's compute that. 20/11 is about 1.818. So 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.023e-27 kg.

The bond length r is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r=2e-10 m.

So I = μ r² = 3.023e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2. Let's compute that. (2e-10)^2 is 4e-20. Multiply by 3.023e-27: 3.023e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2092e-46 kg·m².

Now the rotational energy difference is ħ²/(I). Planck's constant ħ is h/(2π), so approx 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

Divide that by I: 1.112e-68 / (1.2092e-46) = approximately 9.20e-23 J.

Wait, that's the rotational energy difference. Rotational energy per transition from J=0 to J=1 is about 9.2e-23 J.

Compare that to the vibrational energy change, which is about 2.65e-19 J. Oh wait, 9.2e-23 is way smaller than 2.65e-19. So the rotational transition requires much less energy.

So, the photon needs to have just enough energy to cause the molecule to transition to the next state. Since the rotational transition requires less energy, the photon must match the rotational energy difference.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state, and we're to find the momentum of the photon that allows it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the one that's the next in energy, which is the rotational transition, since that requires less energy. So the photon's energy must match the rotational energy difference.

But wait, I might have to think about the selection rules. In a rigid rotor model, dipole transitions are allowed when ΔJ=±1. So the molecule can go from J=0 to J=1. But for rotation, the energy levels are quantized, but for vibration, the selection rules allow Δv=±1.

Wait, but the question is about the photon causing a transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So whether it's a vibrational or rotational change. Since the rotational change requires less energy, that's the next state.

But wait, the problem statement says the model is the non-rigid rotor model, which also includes vibrational transitions. Hmm. So the molecule can change either vibration or rotation. But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy.

So the photon must have the energy equal to the smallest possible energy transition, which is the rotational one.

So the photon's energy E_photon must be equal to the rotational energy difference.

Given that, then the momentum p of the photon can be found. Because photon momentum p is E/c, where c is the speed of light.

Wait, photons have energy E = hf = ħ w, and momentum p = E/c. Alternatively, since E = pc, so p = E/c.

So the energy of the photon is E = ħ²/(I), which we found to be about 9.2e-23 J. So p = E/c = 9.2e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, looking at the options given:

Options:
A) 1.9e-28 Ns
B) 2.3e-27 Ns
C) 1.1e-27 Ns
D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, the options are in N·s, which is kg·m/s. Because 1 N·s = 1 kg·m/s.

So our calculation gives about 3.07e-31 kg·m/s, which is 3.07e-31 Ns.

But none of the options are close to that. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let's go back. Let me double-check the calculations.

First, calculating the reduced mass μ.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) =40/22 = 20/11 amu ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.023e-27 kg. That seems correct.

Bond length r = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

Moment of inertia I = μ r² = 3.023e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 is 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.023e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.2092e-46 kg·m². That seems correct.

Then, the rotational energy difference is (ħ²/(2I)) * (2) since J goes from 0 to 1. Wait, no. The rotational energy is E_J = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. B is ħ²/(2I). So for J=0, E=0. For J=1, E= B * 2. So the energy difference is 2B = 2 (ħ²/(2I)) ) = ħ²/(I).

Wait, that's correct. So E_rot = ħ²/(I) ≈ (1.05457e-34)^2 / 1.2092e-46.

Compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ (1.05457)^2 * 1e-68 = 1.112e-68.

Then, 1.112e-68 / 1.2092e-46 = approx 9.20e-23 J. Correct.

So E_photon =9.2e-23 J.

Momentum p = E/c =9.2e-23 J / (3e8 m/s)= 3.066e-31 kg·m/s=3.066e-31 Ns.

But the options are much higher. So maybe I made a mistake in understanding the model.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the vibrational transition. Let me compute the photon's momentum for the vibrational transition.

E_vib = h*w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c =2.65e-19 /3e8 =approx 8.83e-28 kg·m/s =8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28. Hmm, 8.8e-28 is close but not exactly matching any option. But wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the rotational-vibrational transition. But that might involve both changes, but that would require more energy.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. If it's in the ground state, that's v=0, J=0. The next possible state could be either v=1, J=0 (vibrational transition), or v=0, J=1 (rotational transition). The one with lower energy is the rotational transition, so the photon must have the energy for the rotational transition.

But according to my earlier calculation, the rotational photon's momentum is about 3e-31 Ns, which isn't in the options. But none of the options are close to that. So maybe I made a mistake in the model.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the first excited state, which is the combination of both, but that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, perhaps the model expects the photon to cause a transition from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state (v=1), which would be a larger energy jump, but the options don't match that either.

Wait, perhaps I confused the energy levels. Let me think again about the vibrational energy. The vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_v = (v + 1/2) h w. So the difference between v=0 and v=1 is h w. So that's correct.

But perhaps the
