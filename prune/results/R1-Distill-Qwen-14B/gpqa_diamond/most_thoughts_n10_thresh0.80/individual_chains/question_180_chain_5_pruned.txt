Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their mass is negligible. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system in Joules, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm. So, this must be an electrostatic potential energy problem. I remember that the potential energy between point charges is given by Coulomb's law. But wait, since there are multiple charges, I need to calculate the potential energy for each pair and sum them all.

Wait, but the system is isolated. So, the potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. Since all charges are identical, maybe there's a formula for that.

Let me think. Each charge is 2e, so the charge of each is 2 times the elementary charge e. The value of e is approximately 1.6 x 10^-19 Coulombs.

The 13th charge is fixed at P, so I guess the other 12 are arranged around it. Each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 meters from P. So, the distance between the fixed charge and each of the 12 is 2 meters. But what about the distances between the 12 charges themselves? They are all at the same distance from P, but are they arranged in some way, like on a sphere? Well, the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 m from P. But the problem doesn't specify how they're arranged relative to each other. Wait, but since we're calculating potential energy, the total is the sum of the potential energies between each pair. If the 12 charges are all at the same distance from P, but their mutual distances vary, that complicates things. But wait, the problem asks for the minimum energy, so perhaps we can arrange the 12 charges in a way that minimizes the potential energy.

Wait, but for a system of identical charges, the configuration with the lowest potential energy is when they are as far apart as possible. So perhaps they're arranged in a regular dodecahedron or something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the potential energy between the moving
