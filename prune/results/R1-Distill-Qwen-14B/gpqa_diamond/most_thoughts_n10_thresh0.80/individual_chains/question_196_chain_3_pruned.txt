Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through step by step. The question is asking for the maximum speed of the mass in a one-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different formulas.

Wait, so the setup is a harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx, but it's relativistic. Oh right, in classical mechanics, the harmonic oscillator equation is F = -kx, but when you go relativistic, things change because of the speed limits and the nature of forces.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed of the oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², where A is the amplitude. So the kinetic energy at maximum speed would be (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max² → v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). Oh, that's option C. But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. The problem here is relativistic, so that's probably not the right answer.

So in relativity, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². Instead, the total energy includes rest mass energy and kinetic. The total energy E of a relativistic particle is gamma * mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The kinetic energy is E - mc² = (gamma - 1) mc².

But wait, in the harmonic oscillator scenario, the potential energy isn't just (1/2)kx². Or is it? No, in the relativistic case, does the potential energy change? I'm a bit confused here. Wait, the problem says it's obeying Hooke's law, so F = -kx, which suggests the potential is still (1/2)kx², but the equation of motion would be modified because of relativity.

Wait, another approach: the equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator. The force is F = -kx, but in relativity, F is also d(momentum)/dt. Momentum p is gamma mv. So F = d(gamma mv)/dt. Hmm, that seems complicated.

Alternatively, maybe we
