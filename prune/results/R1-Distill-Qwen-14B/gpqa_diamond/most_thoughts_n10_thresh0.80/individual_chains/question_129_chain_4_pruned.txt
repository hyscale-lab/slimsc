Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound E is. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question describes a series of reactions starting from Compound A and going through several steps to produce E. There are also some hints given, so I should make sure to pay attention to those.

First, let me outline the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce Compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form Compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form Compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form Compound E.

Additionally, there are two hints:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of A has a peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

Let me start by thinking about the possible structures involved in each step.

Starting with the first reaction: A + HCN → B. HCN is typically used in the formation of nitriles from acid chlorides, or in the formation of ketones via the cyanohydrin reaction. Wait, but HCN is more commonly used in the formation of nitriles from acid chlorides. Alternatively, if A is an aldehyde or ketone, HCN could form a cyanohydrin (a compound with an adjacent CN and OH group). But I'm not sure yet. Let me think about the other reactions.

Next, B is reduced with H2 and Pd to get C. Since H2 and Pd are usually for hydrogenation, maybe B has a triple bond or a nitrile group. Let's consider that HCN could add to a carbonyl group to form a nitrile.

Wait, for example, if A is a ketone (like cyclohexanone), reacting with HCN would form a cyanohydrin, which would have an alcohol and a nitrile group. But when B is hydrogenated, maybe the nitrile group (which is R-CN) would be reduced to an amine (R-CH2-NH2?), but no, wait, the typical reduction of a nitrile with H2 and Pd would give an amine. Alternatively, if B is an alkyne, hydrogenation would give an alkane. Hmm, maybe I'm going off track here.

Let me consider what the IR data tells me. Compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1. That's a region where carbonyl groups (C=O) show up. So A is likely a ketone or an aldehyde or maybe an ester. But since it's reacting with HCN, which is a good nucleophile, perhaps A is a carbonyl compound.

Wait, if A is a ketone, reacting with HCN would form a cyanohydrin. The cyanohydrin has an alcohol and a nitrile group. So B would be a secondary alcohol with a nitrile attached. Then, when B is hydrogenated with H2 and Pd, perhaps the nitrile group is reduced. But I'm not sure what would happen to a nitrile under hydrogenation.

Wait, nitriles (R-C≡N) when hydrogenated in the presence of a catalyst like Pd would typically reduce the nitrile to an amine. But that would give R-CH2-NH2. Alternatively, if the conditions are different, maybe it's a hydrogenation of a triple bond, but in this case, B is from A plus HCN, so maybe B is an alkyne? No, HCN adds to a carbonyl, making a nitrile and an alcohol.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reactions again.

Step 1: A + HCN → B. If A is a ketone, the reaction could be a nucleophilic addition. HCN adds to the carbonyl, forming a cyanohydr
