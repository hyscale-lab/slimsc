Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm. Let me try to think this through. I remember that neutrinos are produced in various nuclear reactions in the Sun, right? The main one is the proton-proton chain, which has different branches. Oh, right, the pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, that's the same time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So, the neutrinos from the Sun's core reach us in about that time. So, if the pp-III stopped, the change in neutrinos would be detectable now on Earth.

Neutrinos are produced in the core, so if a branch stops, the flux of neutrinos we detect would change. But which neutrinos are affected? I think the pp-III branch produces specific types of neutrinos, maybe higher energy ones. Oh right, pp-III is responsible for producing higher-energy neutrinos compared to other branches.

Wait, the question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So if pp-III stops, how does that affect these bands?

I remember that the pp-III branch contributes to the production of neutrinos in higher energy ranges. So, if it stops, the number of high-energy neutrinos would drop. Specifically, the neutrinos from the pp-III process are in the higher energy bands.

So, neutrinos from the pp-III branch are probably in the 800-900 keV range (band 2). If pp-III stops, the flux in band 2 would decrease. But what about band 1, 700-800 keV? Are those mainly from other branches?

Wait, the other branches, like pp-I and pp-II, produce lower energy neutrinos. So band 1 might be mainly from those. So, if pp-III stops, band 2 flux decreases a lot, while band 1 remains mostly unaffected.

So the flux in band 1 (700-800) would be similar, and band 2 (800-900) would drop significantly. So the ratio flux1/flux2 would be higher than 1, because flux1 is same, flux2 is lower.

Wait, but let me think again. The pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos. So if it stops, the higher energy neutrinos would be less. So the question is about the ratio of flux in lower band (700-800) to higher band (800-900).

So normally, there's a certain amount of neutrinos in each band. If pp-III is stopped, the 800-900 band loses a significant portion. Let's say the pp-III was contributing a lot to the 800-900 band.

Suppose without pp-III, the flux in band 2 drops. So the ratio (band1) / (band2) increases.

But how much? What's the typical contribution of pp-III to these bands?

I think that the main neutrino flux from the Sun comes from the dominant pp-I branch, which produces lower energy neutrinos. The pp-III is a minor branch but contributes more to higher energies.

So, if pp-III stopped, the flux in the higher band (800-900) would drop by a significant amount, but the lower band might not change much. So the ratio would be higher than 1.

Wait, but what's the typical flux ratio? Let me think about the solar neutrino spectrum. I remember that the majority of solar neutrinos detected have energies around a few hundred keV. The flux peaks in the 200-400 keV range, I think. But the exact distribution varies.

Wait, but the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in higher energies. So, if they suddenly stop, the 700-800 band might lose some, but the 800-900 band would lose a lot more. Because the pp-III is the main source for higher energy neutrinos.

So, before the pp-III stopped, let's say the flux in band1 was F1 and band2 was F2. After stopping, F1' = F1 - some part, F2' = F2 - most of its contribution.

But if the pp-III was the main contributor to band2, then F2' would be much less than F2. For example, if F2 was 10 units, and F1 was 5. After stopping, F2' might be 1 unit (if pp-III contributed 90% of F2), and F1 might decrease a bit, say to 4 units.

So the ratio (4/1)=4. But the options don't have 4. The options are 10, 0.01, 1, 0.1.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this backwards. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III is a minor contributor, but its stopping would affect the flux more in the higher band.

Wait, another approach: the pp chain has three main branches. The pp-I branch is the most important, producing about 86% of the Sun's energy via the CNO cycle? No, wait, the pp chain is the main source of energy for the Sun, about 99% of the fusion. The CNO cycle is about 1%, but that's for more massive stars. Our Sun is mostly pp.

Wait, the pp chain: pp-I, pp-II, pp-III. The pp-I is the dominant branch, producing lower-energy neutrinos, and the other branches contribute less but produce higher-energy neutrinos.

If pp-III stops, then the higher energy neutrinos (like those in band2) would drop. So, the flux in band 2 would be much less than before, while band 1 (which is lower) might be less affected.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio after the pp-III stops. So, the ratio would be (flux band1)/(flux band2). If band2 flux drops by a lot, the ratio would be higher than 1.

But the options given don't have a 10 as the correct ratio yet. Let me think of the possible reason.

Wait, another thought: the neutrinos in the Sun's spectrum. The majority of them are in the lower energy range. The higher energy neutrinos are fewer. So pp-III probably contributes to the higher end, but the absolute number is small compared to the lower bands.

Wait, but if pp-III was contributing a significant portion to the 800-900 keV band, then stopping it would make that band's flux drop. Let me think of the flux in each band.

Suppose without the pp-III, the 800-900 band's flux is almost zero. So flux_band2 becomes almost zero. But then, the ratio would be (flux_band1)/(flux_band2) approaches infinity, but that's not one of the options. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III contributes a small fraction to the higher band. Let's say, for example, that the pp-III contributes about 10% of the total neutrino flux, and most of that goes into the higher band.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of the fluxes in these two specific bands. So the key is to figure out how much each band depends on pp-III.

Another approach: the pp-III branch produces neutrinos with energies higher than the pp-I and pp-II. So the neutrinos from pp-III are in the higher energy ranges. Hence, the 800-900 band (band2) would have a significant contribution from pp-III. If pp-III stops, the band2 flux would drop, while band1 might not change much.

Let me think about the relative contributions. Suppose that band1 is mainly from pp-I and pp-II, which are not affected. So band1's flux remains almost the same. Band2's flux, which was mainly from pp-III, drops to zero or a very small fraction.

So, for example, if band1 flux is F1 and band2 is F2, then after pp-III stops, band2 is F2' = F2 * (1 - x), where x is the fraction contributed by pp-III. If x is, say, 0.9, then F2' is 0.1 F2.

But if band1's flux F1 is only slightly affected, then the ratio F1/F2' becomes (F1) / (0.1 F2) ) = 10 * (F1 / F2).

Wait, but what was F1/F2 before?

If the pp-III contributes a lot to band2, but band1 comes from other branches, the initial F1 and F2 could be of the same order. For example, F1 = 10 units, F2 = 1 unit (if pp-III was a minor but significant source of that band).

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let's think of the solar neutrino spectrum. The peak is around 1-2 MeV (but wait, no, the solar neutrinos are actually lower energy than that. Wait, I might be mixing up with supernova neutrinos. Solar neutrinos are typically a few tens of keV to a few MeV, but most are below 1 MeV.

Wait, but the question is about neutrinos in the 700-900 keV range. That's about 0.7-0.9 MeV.

So, the pp-III branch produces these higher-energy neutrinos. So if that stops, the flux in 700-800 and 800-900 would drop, but the 700-800 would drop less than the 800-900.

Wait, but band1 is 700-800, band2 is 800-900. So pp-III is the main source of neutrinos in band2. If it stops, band2 flux drops sharply, while band1 might have some contribution from other processes.

So, if before stopping, band1 was F1, band2 F2. After stopping, band2 is F2 - F2_ppIII, where F2_ppIII is the part of band2 from pp-III.

Suppose F2_ppIII is, say, 90% of F2. So F2' = 0.1 * F2.

Then, the ratio would be F1 / (0.1 F2) = 10 * (F1/F2).

But what was F1/F2 before? If before, F1 and F2 were about the same, then the ratio would be 10. If F1 was much larger than F2, the ratio could be even higher.

But looking at the options, option A is 10. So that might be the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III contributes a small portion, so the ratio isn't as high as 10.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure. Another approach: in the Sun, the dominant neutrinos come from the pp-I branch, which produces lower-energy neutrinos. The pp-III produces higher-energy neutrinos, but they are less in number.

So the majority of neutrinos in the 700-800 band would come from other branches, and the 800-900 band mainly from pp-III.

So when pp-III stops, the 800-900 band's flux drops, making the ratio (700-800)/(800-900) increase.

If the 800-900 band's flux is, say, 10% of the 700-800 band, then the ratio would be 10. So the answer would be 10.

That makes sense. So the ratio would be about 10. So the correct option is A)10.


The question involves the sudden stoppage of the pp-III branch in the Sun's core, which affects the flux of neutrinos in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The pp-III branch is responsible for producing higher-energy neutrinos, particularly in the 800-900 keV range. If the pp-III branch stops, the flux in band 2 will decrease significantly, while band 1, which is primarily contributed by other branches (pp-I and pp-II), will remain largely unaffected.

Before the stoppage, the flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV) would have been influenced by the contributions from different branches. The pp-III branch is a major contributor to the higher-energy neutrinos in band 2, while band 1 receives most of its flux from the lower-energy processes of pp-I and pp-II. After the pp-III branch stops, the flux in band 2 is expected to drop significantly, potentially by a large fraction (e.g., 90% or more), while the flux in band 1 remains nearly constant.

The ratio of the fluxes, \( \frac{\text{flux (band 1)}}{\text{flux (band 2)}} \), will increase due to the sharp decline in band 2 flux. If the pp-III branch contributed a large portion of the flux in band 2, the ratio could approach 10. This aligns with the given options, where option A (10) is the most reasonable choice based on the expected contributions of the pp-III branch to the higher-energy neutrinos.

Answer: A
