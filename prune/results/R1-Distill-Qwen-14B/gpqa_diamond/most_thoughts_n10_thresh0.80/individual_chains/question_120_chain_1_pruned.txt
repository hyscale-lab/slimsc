Okay, I'm trying to figure out this question about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about parallax and how it relates to the distribution of stars.

Parallax is a measure of how much a star appears to move relative to background stars when observed from different points in Earth's orbit. The formula I remember is that the distance (d) to a star in parsecs is the reciprocal of the parallax (plx), so d = 1/plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniform distribution in what sense? Oh, I think it means that the number density of stars is uniform in space. So the number of stars in a given volume doesn't depend on how far you go, which is different from reality where stars are more concentrated in galaxies, but the question simplifies it.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So if I consider a range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars would be in that range?

Since distance d is 1/plx, a small change in plx corresponds to a change in distance. Let me think about differentials. If plx changes by dplx, then d = 1/plx, so dd = -1/(plx^2) dplx. Hmm, because d is 1/plx, so the derivative is -1/(plx^2).

So the change in distance (dd) is related to the change in parallax (dplx). But how does this relate to the number of stars?

I think I need to relate the number of stars per unit parallax to the volume element. Because if stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a volume is proportional to the volume. So volume per unit parallax.

Wait, the volume element in spherical coordinates is something like 4π r² dr. Because when you consider a shell at radius r with thickness dr, the volume is the surface area (4π r²) multiplied by dr.

But wait, since stars are uniformly distributed, the number in a volume is proportional to the volume. So for a given range of distances, the number of stars would depend on the volume of that shell.

But the question is about parallax. So let's express everything in terms of parallax. Since d = 1/plx, and plx is p, then r = 1/p. So the volume element would be expressed in terms of p.

Wait, let me think step by step.

The number density of stars is n (number per unit volume), and it's constant. So the number of stars between distances r and r + dr is n * 4π r² dr.

But since r = 1/p, dr = -1/p² dp. So substituting, the number of stars between p and p + dp is n *4π (1/p)^2 * ( - dp/(p^2) ) ) ... wait, no, I think I messed up the substitution.

Wait, let me get back. The number of stars in a small shell between r and r+dr is N = n * 4π r² dr.

But r is 1/p, so dr is the change in r. So dr = - (1/(p^2)) dp, because dr = d(1/p) = -1/p² dp.

So substituting, N = n *4π (1/p)^2 * (dr). But dr = - (1/p²) dp, so substituting:

N = n *4π (1/p^2) * ( -1/p² dp )= n*4π (-1/p^4) dp.

Wait, but the negative sign just indicates the direction of increase, but since we're considering positive ranges, we can ignore the sign. So N = n *4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, but that's the number of stars per unit range of p. So the number of stars per unit p is proportional to 1/p^4. But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of plx changes with plx. So it's N ∝ 1/p
