Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question about the distribution of stars and how their number changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Let me think. Oh right, parallax (p) is the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is p = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So a smaller parallax means the star is farther away.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Wait, does that mean their density is the same everywhere? Or are they spread out uniformly in space? I think it's the latter. So in all directions, there are the same number of stars per volume. But how does that translate to the number we observe when considering parallax.

Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So if a star is at distance d, its parallax is p = 1/d. But when we count stars, how does the number of stars in a certain parallax range work?

Let me think about the number density in terms of distance. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a small volume is proportional to the volume. So for a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr, the volume is 4πd² dr. So the number of stars in that shell is N = n * 4πd² dr, where n is the number density (stars per volume).

But we want this in terms of parallax. Since p = 1/d, then d = 1/p. Let me express everything in terms of p. So, change the variables. The volume element in terms of p would involve the differential of p with respect to d. Let's see, dp = -1/d² dd. Oh wait, but I'm considering a range in p, so maybe I can relate the number of stars in a certain dp range.

Let me rearrange the variables: when d increases, p decreases. So for a small change in p, dp, what's the corresponding change in d? dp = - (1/d²) dd. Or, solving for dd, dd = -d² dp. But since d is positive, and we're considering small increments, the negative just indicates the direction. So the thickness in distance dr corresponds to a change in p, and dr is related to dp by dr = d² dp.

Wait, but in the volume element, it's 4π d² dr. So substituting dr in terms of dp: dr = (1/p²) dp because d = 1/p. So dr = (1/p²) dp. Then the number of stars in a thin shell with parallax p is N = n * 4π (d)^2 dr. Substituting d=1/p and dr=(1/p²) dp:

N = n * 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp = n * 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, that gives N proportional to (1/p^4) dp. But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax, which I think is the number of stars in a range dp, so the number would be proportional to 1/p^4. So the number of stars per unit parallax range (dp) would decrease as 1/p^4. 

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So that must be the answer. But wait, let me think again. Did I miss any factors?

Wait, another approach: the number of stars with parallax between p and p+dp is the number density multiplied by the volume at that p. Volume as a function of p is 4π (d)^2 * dr, but dr is the change in distance corresponding to dp. Since d = 1/p, dr = -d² dp. So the volume element becomes 4π (1/p)^2 * ( (1/p^2) dp ). So 4π (1/p^4) dp. Multiply by number density n, and the number of stars in that p range is n * 4π / p^4 dp.

So the number per unit parallax (dp) is indeed proportional to 1/p^4. So that's option A.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes when dealing with flux or brightness, the number depends on distance squared, but this is purely about the number of stars in a given parallax range. Hmm. Another way: as p increases (closer stars), the number of stars in that p range would be higher because there are more stars nearby. So for small p (large d), the number is less.

If the number is N ∝ 1/p^4, that would mean
