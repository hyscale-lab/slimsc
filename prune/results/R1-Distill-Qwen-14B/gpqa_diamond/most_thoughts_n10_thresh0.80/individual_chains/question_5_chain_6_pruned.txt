Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, specifically for the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables like momentum are represented by operators, and their eigenvectors correspond to the possible states of the system with definite values. So, the eigenvector here would be a state that has a definite value of P in the direction n.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, the operator P along an arbitrary direction n can be written as the dot product of n with the vector of Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Right, the general form for a vector operator like P is P = n · (σ) * ħ/2, where σ represents the Pauli matrices. So, the operator for the direction n would be (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z). But in this problem, the direction n lies in the x-z plane, which means the y-component n_y is zero. So, P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, no, not exactly. The operator along direction n is P_n = n · σ * ħ/2. Wait, because each component P_x, P_y, P_z is (ħ/2) times the respective Pauli matrix. So, P_x = (ħ/2) σ_x, P_y = (ħ/2) σ_y, P_z = (ħ/2) σ_z. Therefore, P_n = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z) * ħ/2.

But since n lies in the x-z plane, n_y = 0. So, P_n = (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) * ħ/2. But wait, the direction is arbitrary in x-z, so n can be parametrized by an angle theta, perhaps? Like, n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ, since in the x-z plane, the angle is measured from the x-axis.

Wait, no, more accurately, if the direction is in the x-z plane, then n can be represented as (cosθ, 0, sinθ), where θ is the angle from the x-axis. So, the operator P_n becomes (cosθ * σ_x + sinθ * σ_z) * (ħ/2).

And we're looking for the eigenvector of this operator corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, the eigenvalue equation is P_n |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>.

Substituting the expression for P_n:

( (cosθ σ_x + sinθ σ_z) * ħ/2 ) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

We can multiply both sides by 2/ħ to simplify:

(cosθ σ_x + sinθ σ_z) |ψ> = |ψ>.

So, the equation becomes (cosθ σ_x +
