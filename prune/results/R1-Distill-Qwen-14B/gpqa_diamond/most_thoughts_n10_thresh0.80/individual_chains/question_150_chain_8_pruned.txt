Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, let's see. The molecular formula can sometimes give me a hint about the structure. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18-9-1+1)/2= (9)/2=4.5? Wait, that doesn't make sense, maybe I did the calculation wrong. Oh wait, I think the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, so 2*8=16, 16+2=18. Then 18 minus H (9) is 9. Then minus X (if any, but here it's zero) plus N (1) equals 9+1=10. So 10 divided by 2 is 5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That means five rings or double bonds. Since each ring or double bond is one degree, I might have a benzene ring (which is 3) plus some double bonds.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm (t, 1H) is probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually appear around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests that the aldehyde proton is next to a CH2 maybe? Or perhaps it's coupled with something else. Next peak: 6.98 (d, 2H). That seems like two protons in a doublet, possibly aromatic protons. 6.51 (d, 2H) another aromatic doublet. Oh wait, those two could be para-substituted on a benzene ring. Let me think: if there's a benzene ring with two substituents opposite each other, then each set of protons would be a doublet. Like in para-substituted benzene, the protons are split into two doublets.

Then 6.27 (bs, 2H)â€”broad singlet. Broad usually suggests exchange, like an -OH proton, but there are two Hs here. Wait, maybe it's a pair of protons attached to something else, but not splitting much. Or perhaps it's a vinyl proton adjacent to an oxygen or something. The last peak is 3.66 (d, 2H), which is probably a CH2 group. The downfield shift (around 3.6) suggests it's near an electronegative atom, maybe an oxygen. So maybe it's an OCH2 group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is something like a benzaldehyde derivative with substituents. Wait, the aldehyde is at 9.72, which is a strong peak. So maybe the compound has a benzene ring with an aldehyde group attached. Let me think about how the substituents are arranged.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count the atoms. If it's benzaldehyde, that's C7H6O. But this compound has one more N, and more H and one more O. So perhaps it's something like benzaldehyde with an additional substituent that includes an O and N.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted acetophenone? No, because the NMR doesn't show a ketone peak. Wait, the absence of a carbonyl peak in the NMR suggests maybe it's an aldehyde instead.

Alternatively, perhaps we have a benzene ring with an aldehyde group and another substituent. Let me think about the structure.

Wait, the NMR data: the triplet at 9.72 (1H) suggests that the aldehyde is adjacent to a CH2 group. Because aldehyde protons are typically deshielded and appear around 9-10 ppm. If it's a triplet, that would mean it's coupled with two neighboring protons. So maybe the aldehyde is on a group like RCH2CHO. Wait, but then R would have protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is part of a conjugated system. Wait, the 6.27 (bs, 2H) could be protons on a double bond adjacent to an oxygen, like an enol structure. Or maybe it's a dienol or something else.

Wait, the 6.27 is a broad singlet with 2H. Broad suggests exchange, so maybe it's an acidic proton like an -OH. But there are two H, so maybe two -OH groups. Alternatively, maybe it's a pair of protons adjacent to an oxygen, like in a conjugated system.

Let me think of the structure. Let's say we have a benzene ring with an aldehyde group and an amino group as substituents. Wait, but the molecular formula has an N and an O. So perhaps the compound is an aminophenyl aldehyde? Alternatively, maybe it's a benzamide or something else.

Wait, let me try to sketch a possible structure. Suppose the benzene ring has an aldehyde group and another substituent which is an amino group. But I'm not seeing that in the NMR. Alternatively, perhaps there's an ether group or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a benzaldehyde with a substituent that is a secondary or tertiary amine. Hmm, but the NMR doesn't show any peaks that would suggest amines, unless they're exchanging and not appearing in the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a glycoside or
