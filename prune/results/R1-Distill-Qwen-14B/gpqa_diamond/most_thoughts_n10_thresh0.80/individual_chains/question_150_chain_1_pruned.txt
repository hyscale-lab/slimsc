Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR problems can be tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. That's an important starting point. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is zero here. So, C=8. So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2. Let's compute that: 18-9+1=10. 10/2=5 degrees. So that's five rings or double bonds. Each ring or double bond is one degree. So maybe one ring and a couple of double bonds or something like that.

Looking at the NMR data next. The 1H-NMR shows peaks at 9.72 ppm as a triplet (t, 1H), which suggests an aldehyde proton because those are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, that's a triplet, which is a bit unusual for an aldehyde. Aldehydes are typically singlets because there's no neighboring protons. Hmm. Or maybe it's not an aldehyde. Wait, another possibility is an enol, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with some substitution.

Wait, let me look at all the peaks: 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H). 

The triplet at 9.72 ppm is probably a proton adjacent to two others. Or maybe it's an enol tautomer? Wait, I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a conjugated system. Let's think about the other peaks.

The 6.98 and 6.51 peaks are each doublets (d, 2H each). That suggests two sets of doublets, maybe para-substituted aromatic rings. Like two aromatic groups with substituents in para positions. The 6.27 is a broad singlet (bs, 2H). Broad suggests maybe exchange with something else, like
