Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about an electron's state and some probabilities and expectation values involving an operator. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vectors and operators work together to give probabilities and expectation values. Let me break it down.

Alright, the state |alpha> is given as (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think is the Sz operator. So the state is a linear combination of these two basis states. The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i), but since the state is proportional to that, I guess I can normalize it first. Because probabilities depend on the squared magnitudes, so normalization is important.

Wait, normalization. To do that, I need to compute the inner product of the state with itself. The inner product is (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i), right? Because when you take the conjugate, (1+i)* becomes (1 - i) and (2 - i)* is (2 + i).

Calculating each term: (1 - i)(1 + i) = (1)^2 + (i)^2 - i^2? Wait, no, wait. Let me compute it correctly. (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b². So (1+i)(1-i) = 1² - (i)^2. i squared is -1, so 1 - (-1) = 2. So the first term is 2.

The second term: (2 + i)(2 - i) = 4 - (i)^2. Again, i squared is -1, so 4 - (-1) = 5. So the sum is 2 + 5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the normalized state is 1/sqrt(7) times [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>].

Wait, but the problem says it's proportional, so maybe I don't need to normalize right away. Because when we calculate probabilities, the coefficients' squared magnitudes over the sum will automatically normalize. Hmm, but maybe I should normalize first to find the probabilities correctly.

Wait, the question asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the given operator. The operator's matrix is given, which is Aij = hbar/2 if i != j, else 0. So it's a 2x2 matrix because it's spin up and down. Let me write what this matrix looks like.

The matrix has 0 on the diagonal and hbar/2 off the diagonal. So it's [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. Wait, that's a spin-flip operator perhaps? Or something else. Wait, the spin operators usually have diagonal elements. Hmm, but this is some other operator, perhaps a spin rotation or something else. But for the purposes of this problem, I just need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this operator, because when measuring, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probability is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.

So first, I need to find the eigenstates of the operator A. The matrix is:

[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

Because A12 = A21 = hbar/2, and A11 = A22 = 0.

To find eigenvalues, I can compute the characteristic equation. The trace is 0, so the sum of eigenvalues is 0. The determinant is (0)(0) - (hbar/2)^2 = - (hbar^2)/4. So the eigenvalues λ satisfy λ^2 - trace λ + determinant = 0. So λ^2 - 0 λ - (hbar^2)/4 = 0. Solutions are λ = [sqrt( (hbar^2)/4 + 0 )] / 1. Wait, the quadratic formula: λ = [0 ± sqrt(0 + (hbar^2)/4)] / 2. Wait, no, wait: the standard equation is λ² - (sum of diag) λ + (product of diag) = 0. So in this case, λ² + (0) λ - (hbar^2)/4 =0.

So solutions are λ = [0 ± sqrt(0 +4*(hbar^2/4))]/2. Hmm, sqrt( hbar^2 ) is hbar. So sqrt( (hbar^2)/4 *4 )? Wait, wait. Let me compute the discriminant correctly. The discriminant is 0^2 - 4 * 1 * (- (hbar^2)/4 ) = (hbar^2). So sqrt of that is hbar. So λ = [0 ± hbar ] / 2. Therefore, λ = hbar/2 and λ = -hbar/2. So the eigenvalues are plus and minus hbar/2.

Now, the eigenvectors. Let's find them for each eigenvalue.

For λ = hbar/2:

(A - λ I) v = 0.

So the matrix becomes:

[ -hbar/2   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2   -hbar/2 ]

So the equations are:

(-hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0,

(hbar/2) v1 + (-hbar/2) v2 = 0.

Both equations simplify to v1 = v2.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to [1, 1] or any scalar multiple. But we can normalize them. Let me compute the normalized eigenvectors.

The normalized vector would have components [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)].

Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2:

The matrix (A + λ I) is:

[ hbar/2   hbar/2 ]

[ hbar/2  -hbar/2 ]

Wait, no. Let me compute (A - (-hbar/2) I ):

[ 0 + hbar/2,  hbar/2 ]

[ hbar/2, 0 + hbar/2 ]

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Let me recompute A - λ I for λ = - hbar/2.

Wait, when λ = -hbar/2, the matrix becomes:

[ 0 - (-hbar/2) , hbar/2 ] → [ hbar/2 , hbar/2 ]

[ hbar/2 , 0 - (-hbar/2) ] → [ hbar/2, hbar/2 ]

So the equations are:

(hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0,

(hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0.

Which simplifies to v1 = -v2.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to [1, -1], and normalized to [1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)].

So the eigenstates of the operator A are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/
