Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this particle physics problem. Hmm, the question is about the possible decay products of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f_bar ψ_f (y)(ν + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully. Oh wait, I think the Lagrangian is written as L = -λ ψ_f̄ (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y), but maybe the fermion part is more about the coupling.

So, the boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. I need to find its possible decay channels at the lowest order. Oh right, in particle decays, the decay products must have a combined mass less than the mass of the parent particle. Because energy and momentum conservation require that the total invariant mass of the decay products can't exceed the parent's mass.

Wait, the boson X is a scalar, I think. So, it can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs if the fermions are light enough. The possible fermions would need to satisfy that twice their mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV because each fermion would have about half the mass (since they're pairs, so 2m_fermion ≤ m_X).

So, let me list all the possible fermions that could be produced. The fermions are the quarks (u, d, s, c, b, t) and the leptons (e, mu, tau).

But wait, the top quark is way too heavy. Its mass is around 173 GeV, so 2*173 is way more than 6 GeV. So top quarks are out. So, possible quarks are u, d, s, c, b. Wait, wait, what's their mass?

Wait, but for the purpose of decay, it's about the rest mass. So for a fermion f, if 2m_f ≤ m_X, then the boson can decay into f and f_bar.

The mass of X is 6 GeV.

So, let's list the masses:

Electron (e-): about 0.0005 GeV.
Muon (mu-): ~0.1057 GeV.
Tau (tau-): ~1.777 GeV.
So for leptons
