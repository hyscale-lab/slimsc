Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants (β) are related to the formation of complexes. Each β corresponds to a different complex. For example, β1 is for the first complex, which would be CoSCN maybe? Or wait, actually, the complexes are probably [Co(SCN)]^n+ where n increases with each β.

Wait, more accurately, each βn corresponds to the nth complex. So β1 is for the first complex, which is Co(SCN), maybe [Co(SCN)]+ because Co^2+ plus SCN^- would form that. Then β2 is for [Co(SCN)2]^0, because each SCN- is -1, so two of them would be -2, added to Co^2+ gives neutral. Similarly, β3 is [Co(SCN)3]^2-? No wait, because each SCN- is -1. So, the charge would be Co^2+ plus n SCN^- would be 2 - n. So, for the third complex, n=3, charge would be 2-3 = -1. Hmm, but I'm not sure; maybe it's better to think in terms of the number of ligands.

But maybe the key point is that each β corresponds to the formation of a complex with n SCN- ions. So, the complexes are:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n}.

The stability constant βn is given by the formula log K = βn, where K is the formation constant. Wait, no, actually, the stability constant β is the formation constant. So for each complex, the β is the equilibrium constant for the formation of that complex.

So, the problem is about determining the distribution of different Co complexes in solution. The total Co concentration is 1e-2 M, and SCN- is 0.1 M. We need to find what fraction is the dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the complex with two SCN- ions, so [Co(SCN)_2]^{0}, since 2 SCN- would be -2, and Co^2+ gives overall 0 charge.

Wait, but the problem says "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes". I think the blue complexes are usually the ones with more SCN- ligands. Wait, I think the different complexes have different colors. For Co(II), the complexes with different numbers of SCN- ligands have different colors. The hexaaqua ion is pink, and the thiocyanate complexes are blue, green, etc., depending on the number of ligands.

But maybe the dithiocyanato is the one with two SCN- ligands. Wait, wait, I should clarify. Let me think: the first complex is [Co(SCN)]^+, which has one SCN- (β1=9). The second is [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (β2=40), the third is [Co(SCN)_3]^- (β3=63), and the fourth is [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} (β4=16).

Wait, but why does β4 have a smaller value than β3? That might complicate things because higher stability constants usually form more, but maybe beyond a certain point, the stability isn't as high.

But the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think the dithiocyanato has two SCN- ligands, so we're focusing on the β2 complex, which is [
