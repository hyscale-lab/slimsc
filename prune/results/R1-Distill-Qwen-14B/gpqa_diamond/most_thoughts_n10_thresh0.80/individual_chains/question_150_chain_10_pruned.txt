Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and then it's reacted with a series of reagents. I need to find out what the final product is from the options A to D.

First, let me break down the information I have.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. So, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So substituting:

C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So, applying the formula: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be from a ring and some double bonds or something similar.

Looking at the NMR data:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H) â€” that's a triplet around 9.7. In aromatic regions, but maybe an aldehyde proton? Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, the triplet... Hmm, maybe not aldehyde. Or maybe it's another proton, like an aromatic with two neighboring protons.

Wait, the triplet might indicate coupling with two equivalent protons, like a -CH2- group or something else. But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Then 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). Those look like aromatic protons. The doublets suggest perhaps two sets of two protons each, in an AB system. So maybe a para-substituted benzene ring. Like two protons in one environment (d, 2H) and two in another (d, 2H). So maybe a para-substituted benzene attached to something else.

Another peak: 6.27 (bs, 2H). Broad singlet, 2H. Could that be a proton adjacent to an electronegative group, like oxygen? Or maybe part of a double bond. Wait, if it's a singlet, maybe they're equivalent and not split much. Like maybe two protons on a benzene ring that's attached to something else. Or perhaps it's a coupling with another group.

Then 3.66 (d, 2H). That's a triplet of two protons. The chemical shift is around 3.66, which suggests maybe a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2. The doublet suggests two adjacent protons, so perhaps -OCH2- something.

Putting this together. Let's try to imagine the structure.

The 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) could be an OCH2 group attached to a carbonyl or something. The 6.98 and 6.51 could be a benzene ring with substituents. The 6.27 (bs, 2H) could be another set of protons, maybe on another aromatic ring, but perhaps in a position that makes them a singlet.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the carbons. If it's two benzene rings (each with 6 carbons), but wait that would be 12 carbons, which is way more than 8. So perhaps the molecule has a single benzene ring and another substituent. Or maybe the 8 carbons include substituents and a side chain.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me think: maybe the structure is a benzene ring with substituents like a side chain. Let's think about possible structures.

Looking at the NMR, the 9.72 could be an aldehyde proton, but that's a triplet, which is a bit unusual for an aldehyde. Aldehydes usually have a
