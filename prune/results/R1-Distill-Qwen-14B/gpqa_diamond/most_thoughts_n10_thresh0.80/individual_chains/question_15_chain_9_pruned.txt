Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting its star, so the researchers should pick that one to observe. They want the one with the highest chance of a transit because they have limited time.

Alright, from what I remember, the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. But wait, since both planets have circular orbits, the alignment part might not vary much, right? Or maybe it's the same since both are circular, so we can focus on the size ratio.

Wait, but the planets' masses are the same. Oh, but the question is about transit probability, which depends more on the size of the planet and the star, not the mass. Because a larger planet has a higher chance of blocking the starlight, but if the star is bigger, the probability goes down. So the key factors are the planet's size and the star's size.

Wait, the planets' masses are the same, but their sizes might not be. Because if they're Earth-like, their masses are similar, but maybe their radii are too. Or maybe not. Wait, the question says that the host stars have the same radii. Oh, because the host stars have the same radii. So the stars are the same size.

Wait, but the host stars have same radii. So for both planets, the star's radius R* is the same. So R* is same for both.

Now, the probability of transit (P) depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (a) and the star's radius (R*), but also the planet's radius (R_p) and the star's radius. Hmm, I think the formula is something like P ≈ (R_p / R_*)² × (R_* / a)² × something else. Wait, maybe the formula is P = (R_p / R_*)^2 × (1 / (a / R_* )^2 ) × something. Wait, maybe I should recall the exact formula.

I think the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_*)² multiplied by the probability that the orbital plane is aligned edge-on enough to cause a transit. But since both are circular orbits, but the alignment probability is the same, assuming random orientations. So the main factor would be (R_p / R_
