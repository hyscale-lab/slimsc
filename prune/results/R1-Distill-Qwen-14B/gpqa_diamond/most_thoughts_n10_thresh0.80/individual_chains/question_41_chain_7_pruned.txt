Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1, which is the usual case.

I remember from my studies that the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's refractive index. Normally, when a medium is at rest relative to the observer, the speed v of light is c/n. So for example, in glass with n=1.5, the speed would be 2/3 c.

But here, the glass is moving. Oh wait, that's probably where things get tricky because of relativity. I mean, if the medium is moving, does that affect the speed of light in that medium? Or do the principles of special relativity come into play here?

Wait, let's clarify. According to special relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c, regardless of the motion of the source or the observer. But this is in a medium, so the speed isn't c. Hmm.

So the light is inside the glass. The glass is moving. From the lab frame, what's the speed of the light beam?

In the frame of the glass (let's call it the rest frame S'), the light is moving at speed v_light' = c/n. But the glass itself is moving at velocity v in the lab frame (S). So we need to transform the speed from S' to S.

Wait, but how does that transformation work? I think this involves the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v)/(cÂ²)) ), right? But wait, in this case, u' is the velocity of the light in the glass's frame, which is v_light' = c/n.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Because when the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, the velocities add in a particular way. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at v_light' = c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion (since the beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass's movement towards the observer).

So in S' (glass's frame), light's velocity
