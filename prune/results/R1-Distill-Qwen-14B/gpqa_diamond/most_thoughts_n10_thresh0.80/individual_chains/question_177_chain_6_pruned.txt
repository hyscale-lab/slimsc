Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about the luminosities of two stars. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. Alright, let's read the question again carefully.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh wait, and the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times bigger. Interesting. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh right, I remember that the peak wavelength emitted by a star is related to its temperature. I think it's something like Wien's law, where wavelength_max = constant divided by temperature. So if their peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same too. Or wait, is that correct? Because Wien's law says lambda_max * T = constant, so if lambda is same, T must be same. So both stars have the same temperature.

Then, the radial velocities: Star_1 is not moving (0 km/s), while Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. But how does that affect their luminosity? Oh, maybe it's about Doppler shifting. Because when a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, and when moving away, redshifted. But if we're considering the observed wavelengths, but the question says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, perhaps the observed wavelengths are the same, but the actual emitted wavelengths (temperature) are different? Wait, no, the problem says the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So maybe the Doppler effect is in play here.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. If a star is moving towards us, its emitted light is blueshifted, so the peak we observe is shorter than the actual peak. Similarly, if moving away, the peak is longer. So the observed wavelength depends on the star's velocity. But in this case, Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so no Doppler shift. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. So if Star_2's actual peak was at a different wavelength, but due to Doppler shift, we observe the same wavelength as Star_1.

Wait, but the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So Star_1's actual lambda_max is, say, lambda. Since it's not moving, we observe lambda. Star_2 must have a different actual lambda_max, but due to Doppler effect, its observed lambda_max is also lambda. So the observed lambda is same for both, but the actual emitted lambdas are different.

So, for Star_2, if it's moving towards us, its observed wavelength is shorter (blueshifted) than its emitted. If moving away, it's longer. So the observed lambda is lambda_2_obs = lambda_2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r)/(1 - v_r) ) or something like that? Wait, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), but when v is much smaller than c, this can be approximated as lambda_obs â‰ˆ lambda_emit (1 + v/c). Wait, no, I
