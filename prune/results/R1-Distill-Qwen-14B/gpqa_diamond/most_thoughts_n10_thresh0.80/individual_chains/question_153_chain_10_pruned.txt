Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Michael addition reaction question. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but let's think through it step by step.

The question has three parts, labeled A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. I need to figure out the major products for each and then match them with the options provided.

Starting with reaction A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, and the conditions are NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). So, this is a Michael addition scenario.

I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophilic enolate attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form an enolate easily. The enolate will attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure where the acrylate is substituted with a p-tolyl group. The enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta carbon (the one adjacent to the carbonyl) of the acrylate. So, the malonate's enolate will add to the acrylate.

The product would be a new compound where the malonate's part is attached to the acrylate. Specifically, the structure would be a tri-carboxylate. Let me imagine the structure: the p-tolyl group is on the acrylate, and the malonate adds to the beta position. So the product is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. This seems to match option A or B in the choices.

Moving to reaction B: The reactants are 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine and (E)-but-2-enenitrile, with conditions of MeOH and H3O+. Michael addition again, so an enolate (or enamine) attacking the alpha-beta unsaturated nitrile.

Wait, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. So piperidine has a cyclohexenyl group attached. Piperidine can act as a base, maybe generating an enamine or enolate. But since the other reactant is (E)-but-2-enenitrile, which is an alpha-beta unsaturated nitrile. The nitrile is a good Michael acceptor.

Wait, no, the piperidine compound might be the nucleophile here. The enamine or the enolate would attack the alpha-beta unsaturated nitrile. But wait, I'm a bit confused about which is the nucleophile and which is the electrophile.

Wait, in Michael addition, the nucleophile (enolate) attacks the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (the Michael acceptor). So here, the acrylate is the acceptor. So in reaction B, the acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile, which has the structure CH2=CH-CN. The nucleophile would be the enamine from 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine.

Wait, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is a piperidine ring with a cyclohexenyl substituent. Piperidine is a cyclic amine. The cyclohexenyl group can be a site for conjugate addition. Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine acts as a base, deprotonating the cyclohexenyl group to form an enamine.

Wait, the cyclohexenyl group is itself part of a conjugated diene? Or maybe the piperidine is a part of the conjugated system. Hmm, perhaps the cyclohexenyl group is part of the conjugated system that can form an enamine.

Alternatively, maybe the piperidine is acting as a base, deprotonating the alpha position of the acrylate. Wait, but the other reactant is (E)-but-2-enenitrile, which is like CH2=CHCN. That's an alpha-beta unsaturated nitrile, which is a good Michael acceptor.

So the nucleophile is the enamine (from the piperidine and cyclohexene part) attacking the alpha-beta unsaturated nitrile. The addition would be to the beta position of the nitrile.

Wait, the piperidine has a cyclohexenyl substituent. Maybe that's where the enamine forms. When the cyclohexenyl's alpha hydrogen is abstracted, forming an enamine, which then attacks the but-2-enenitrile.

Wait, maybe the mechanism is that the piperidine's cyclohexenyl group is deprotonated to form an enamine, which then performs a conjugate addition to the nitrile.

So the product would have the cyclohexenyl group attached via the buten-nitrile.

Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine's own amine isn't part of the conjugated system, but the cyclohexenyl is. So the cyclohexenyl group's hydrogen is abstracted, making an enamine, which then attacks the nitrile.

So the product would be a new carbon-carbon bond between the cyclohexenyl (enamine) part and the buten-nitrile.

Wait, but the conditions here are MeOH and H3O+—acidic conditions. So maybe it's more of an acid-catalyzed addition, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is a source of enamine. The enamine would attack the (E)-but-2-enenitrile. The addition would be at the beta position of the nitrile.

So, the product would be a longer chain. Let me try to visualize: the cyclohexenyl part connected to a buten-nitrile. So the product would be 3-(2-oxocyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile? Wait, no. Wait, the nitrile is R-C≡N. The alpha-beta unsaturated part is CH2-CH2-CN (but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN? No, wait, but-2-enenitrile is CH2CH2CN with the double bond between C2 and C3: CH2=CHCN. So the structure is CH2=CHCN.

When the enamine attacks, the enamine (from the cyclohexenyl part) would add to the beta carbon (the CH2 next to the nitrile). So the product would have a new bond between the cyclohexenyl group and the CH2 of the buten-nitrile. So perhaps the product would be something like (2-cyclohexenyl)propyl cyanide? Not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is 3-(cyclohexenyl)propanenitrile? Or perhaps more accurately, 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile? Or wait, maybe the product is 3-(2-oxocyclohex-1-enyl)butanenitrile. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 3-(cyclohexenyl)butanenitrile. Wait, but I'm not quite getting the structure right. Let's think about how the addition occurs.

When the enamine attacks the but-2-enenitrile, the nucleophile (enamine's carbon) attacks the beta carbon (the CH2 of CH2=CHCN). So the structure after attack would be the enamine's carbon connected to the CH2, and the double bond shifts. So the product would have the cyclohexenyl group attached to the CH2, and the nitrile would be at the end.

Wait, perhaps the product is CH2(cyclohexenyl)-CH2-CN? No, that doesn't seem right. Or maybe it's a longer chain.

Wait, another approach: in the Michael addition, the alpha-beta unsaturated nitrile (acceptor) is CH2=CHCN. The enamine (nucleophile) attacks the
