Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the details.

The question says that an unknown compound was prepared, and they used FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry to identify it. The options given are different chemical formulas, and I need to choose the correct one based on the spectral data provided.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. It mentions a very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, if it's a very broad peak, maybe it's a strong hydrogen bond, which is more characteristic of a carboxylic acid. But alcohols have O-H too, but their peaks are usually broader than those of alcohols if it's a -OH group. Hmm, not too sure yet, but I'll keep that in mind.

Then there are two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 region is often a carbonyl group (like ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.), and the 1650 might be another carbonyl or possibly an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds. Oh wait, 1650 could be an aromatic ring's C=C stretching, but that's usually in the range of 1450-1600. Alternatively, an amide might have a peak around 1650, but there's no mention of N here. Alternatively, if it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester or maybe a ketone with conjugated groups. Wait, esters typically have a carbonyl around 1740, but maybe if it's something else... Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is an absorption from a conjugated system, like an aromatic ring. Wait, benzene's C=C is around 1480-1600. But if there's conjugation, like in a vinyl group or an enol, maybe that peak shifts. Alternatively, it could be a carbonyl group in a different environment, like an amide or an ester. Wait, but the two peaks at 1700 and 1650... perhaps a compound with two different carbonyl groups. But that's not common. Alternatively, maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is something else, like an aromatic C=C.

Wait, another thought: the 1700 might be an ester or ketone, and the 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like an enone (C=C double bond conjugated to a carbonyl). So maybe the compound has a conjugated system, like a ketone next to a double bond.

Looking at the NMR data: several peaks, including vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound must have a double bond, probably conjugated with something. So maybe an enol or an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

Then, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm, what could that be? The molecular ion breaks into fragments. The m/z of 45 is interesting. Let's think about common fragments. For instance, a fragment of CH3CO (which is 43, but wait, 45 is 43 plus 2? Or maybe something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an ethyl group or something else. Wait, 45 could be CH3COO⁻, but that's 60. Or maybe it's the tropylium ion, which is C7H7+, but that's 91. Hmm.

Wait, 45 could be the molecular ion of a fragment. Let me think about possible fragments. Suppose the parent compound is something like benzaldehyde or a substituted acetone. Alternatively, maybe a ketone with some substituents.

Wait, another approach: let's consider the possible formulas and ded
