Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Oh wait, wait. So |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. That means they're the standard basis states for spin-1/2 systems, right? So probably these are the eigenstates of S_z, where S_z|up> = (ħ/2)|up> and similarly for |down>.

The next part is about another operator whose matrix elements Aij are given. So, Aij is ħ/2 if i is different from j, and zero otherwise. Wait, so the matrix would look like this for a 2x2 system (since we're dealing with spin up and down):

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0] ]

Because when i≠j, Aij is ħ/2. So this operator is actually the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so yeah, scaling that by ħ/2 gives the A matrix.

The question asks to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator A. Then find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, wait, eigenstates of A. Since A is proportional to the Pauli X matrix, its eigenstates are the eigenstates of the Pauli X. The eigenstates of X are the spin states along the x-axis, which are |+x> and |-x>, given by (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

So I need to express |alpha> in terms of these |+x> and |-x> states. Because the probability of measuring each eigenstate is the square of the amplitude in that direction.

Alternatively, since A is represented by that matrix, the operator is (ħ/2) σ_x. The eigenvalues of σ_x are ±1, so the eigenvalues of A are ± ħ/2.

But wait, the question is about the probability of measuring each eigenstate of A. So each eigenstate is |+x> and |-x>. So I need to
