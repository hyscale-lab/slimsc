Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the transit method. Hmm, I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so that the researchers should observe it first. Let's break down the problem.

The question says both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1's period is shorter, meaning it's closer to its star, right? Because orbital period relates to distance via Kepler's laws.

Wait, Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit. So, if Planet_1's period is three times shorter, its orbital radius is smaller. Let me think about the math here. If P1 = P2 /3, then (P1/P2)^2 = (a1/a2)^3. So (1/3)^2 = (a1/a2)^3 → 1/9 = (a1/a2)^3 → a1/a2 = (1/9)^(1/3) = approx 0.48 or 1/2.08. So Planet_1 is about half the distance of Planet_2 from their stars.

But wait, the host stars are different. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. That's interesting. So even though Star_1 is more massive, it's not larger in radius. That must mean Star_1 is more dense than Star_2.

The transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. A bigger planet and smaller star increase the chance of a transit because the planet blocks a larger fraction of the star's light. But wait, the probability also depends on the orbital distance. Or does it? Let me recall the formula.

The probability P of a planet transiting is approximately (R_planet + R_star) / a, but actually, I think it's (R_planet / R_star) / a. Wait, no, more accurately, the transit probability is proportional to (R_planet / R_star) multiplied by a factor involving the orbital distance. Wait, no, I think the main factor is the size of the planet relative to the star and the distance of the planet from the star. Or perhaps it's more about the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight
