Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question says we have ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle that behaves under the same conditions. Each particle moves along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measure the position, all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3. So, I need to find the value of 'a' from the options given.

Hmm, right. So in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. The probability of finding the particle in a region is the integral of the square of the absolute value of the wave function over that region. Since all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3, the probability outside this region must be zero. Or wait, actually, the problem says none were found outside, so the probability must be 1 between x=1 and x=3, meaning the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ|² dx should equal 1.

Wait, but the wave function given is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Let me write that more clearly. So ψ(x) is a function of x, and it's a complex number because of the 'i' term. So to find the probability, I need to compute |ψ(x)|².

The absolute square of ψ(x) is ψ*(x) * ψ(x). Let me compute that. ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So ψ*(x) would be (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i, because the imaginary part's sign changes.

Multiplying them together:
ψ*(x)ψ(x) = [a/sqrt(1+x)]² + (0.5i)(-0.5i) + [a/sqrt(1+x)]*(0.5i) + [a/sqrt(1+x)]*(-0.5i)
Wait, that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, since it's (A + B)(A* - B*), but perhaps it's easier to compute it as (A - iB)(A + iB) where A is a/sqrt(1+x) and B is 0.5.

Wait, no, because in this case, ψ = A - iB, where A = a/sqrt(1+x), B=0.5. Then ψ* would be A + iB. So ψ*ψ is (A - iB)(A + iB) = A² + (iB A - i A B) + (i² B²) ? Wait, no, better to think of it as A² + (iB)(-i B) because (A - iB)(A + iB) = A² + AiB - iBA - i² B². Wait, but let's compute:

(A - iB)(A + iB) = A^2 + A i B - A i B - (i^2) B^2. The middle terms (A i B and - A i B) cancel each other, so we're left with A² + B², since i^2 is -1, so:

A² + B² = [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

Wait, because B is 0.5, so B squared is 0.25.

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.25).

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because if ψ is a sum of a real and imaginary term, then their squares would add. So yeah, correct.

Now, the probability that the particle is found between x=1 and x=3 is the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3. Since all the particles are found in this region, the integral must be 1.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me compute this integral. Let me break it into two parts:

Integral [a²/(1+x)] dx from 1 to 3 + Integral [0.25] dx from 1 to 3.

Compute each part.

First integral: a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln|1+x|. So evaluating from 1 to 3 gives ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2).

So first integral is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 * (3 - 1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Solve for a²: a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213, so a ≈ sqrt(0.7213). Let's compute that. sqrt(0.72) is about 0.8485 (since 0.8485^2 is around 0.72). Wait, wait, 0.8485^2 is approximately 0.721, so sqrt(0.7213) is about 0.849.

Looking at the options, the choices are A)1.1, B)0.85, C)0.35, D)0.6.

So a is approximately 0.849, which is very close to option B, 0.85.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check the integral. Did I compute |ψ(x)|² correctly?

Yes, ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So ψ*(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i.

Multiplying them gives ψ*ψ = (a^2/(1+x)) + [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) * 0.5i - 0.5i * (a/sqrt(1+x)) ) ] + (0.5i)(-0.5i).

Wait, but the middle terms are each a*0.5i times (a/sqrt(1+x)) and the other term is negative. Wait, no— wait, (A - B)(A + B) = A² - B². Oh, wait wait! Because (A - iB)(A + iB) = A^2 + B^2. Because the cross terms involve i and -i, so they cancel out, leaving A² + B².

Wait, no, wait: (A - iB)(A + iB) = A^2 + A i B - i B A + (i)(-i) B². Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, let me compute (A - i B)(A + i B):

= A*A + A*(i B) - i B * A - i B * i B

= A² + i A B - i A B - (i²) B².

Simplify: A² cancels the i terms, and i^2 is -1. So we have A² - (-1) B² = A² + B².

So |ψ|^2 = [a^2/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

Yes, that's correct. So the integral is correct, and the calculation for a is correct.

So a is approximately 0.849, which is 0.85. So option B is the answer.


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is given by the square of the absolute value of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since all particles are found between \(x=1\) and \(x=3\), the total probability in this region must equal 1. Thus, we compute the integral of \(|\psi(x)|^2\) from \(x=1\) to \(x=3\):

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. **First term**: \(\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx\)

   The integral of \(\frac{1}{1+x}\) is \(\ln|1+x|\). Evaluating from \(x=1\) to \(x=3\):

   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second term**: \(\int_1^3 0.25 dx\)

   The integral of \(0.25\) over the interval \(1\) to \(3\) is:

   \[
   \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
   \]

Adding these results, the total integral becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

Among the given options, the closest value is \(a = 0.85\). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
