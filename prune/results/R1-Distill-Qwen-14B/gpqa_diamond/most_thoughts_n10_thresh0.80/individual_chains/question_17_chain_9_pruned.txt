Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let's see what I remember. Hmm, the question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Wait, what's that mean? Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds with metal ions like Ca²+ to form a complex.

The problem gives me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. Oh wait, K is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- (or whatever the charge is), and K is the equilibrium constant for that.

So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But I need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in solution. Because EDTA forms a very strong complex with Ca²+, the free ion concentration should be really low, right? Because the K is so large, the complex doesn't dissociate much.

Wait, so the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA. But since EDTA is in excess or not? Wait, the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution, so probably the EDTA and Ca²+ are in exact stoichiometric amounts. But in the complex form, so perhaps the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the EDTA is in excess? Or maybe the solution is just the complex, so when it dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and
