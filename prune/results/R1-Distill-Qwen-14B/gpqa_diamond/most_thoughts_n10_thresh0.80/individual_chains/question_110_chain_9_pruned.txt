Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, I should probably understand what each spectrograph can observe. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with a V magnitude brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait. It says stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Oh, right, because lower magnitude numbers mean brighter. So ESPRESSO can detect stars with V less than or equal to 17, since if a star is brighter than 17, it's magnitude is lower than 17. So, for example, a star with V=16 is brighter than V=17 and can be seen by ESPRESSO.

HIRES, on the other hand, can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So for HIRES, a star must have V mag less than or equal to 16, because anything brighter (lower magnitude) than 16 is acceptable. So, the brighter limit is 16.

So any star that can be detected by both needs to have apparent V magnitude ≤16, because that's the stricter condition. Because ESPRESSO can go up to 17, but HIRES only up to 16. So the star must be ≤16 mag in V.

Wait, but the question is which stars can be detected with both. So I need to find stars that have apparent V magnitude ≤16, because both spectrographs can see them.

Wait no, wait: no, wait. Because the two have different limits. Wait, no, let me clarify.

ESPRESSO: apparent V mag ≤17.

HIRES: apparent V mag ≤16.

So, to be detectable by both, the star's apparent V must be ≤16. Because a star with V=16 can be seen by both (since ESPRESSO can go up to 17). So, the more restrictive condition is that the apparent V magnitude must be ≤16.

So, now I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star and see which ones are ≤16. Because those are the ones that can be seen by both.

Wait, but some stars only have absolute magnitude given, others have apparent.
