Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all related to C6H something with O and maybe O2. Let me go through each piece of data step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. The broadness suggests it's either an alcohol (OH) or maybe a carboxylic acid (COOH) because those have broad and strong absorption. Then, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, 1700 is typical for carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, or maybe esters. The 1650 peak might be another carbonyl or perhaps an aromatic ring (C=C). Wait, but aromatic C=C usually is around 1450-1600 cm^-1. So maybe 1650 is another carbonyl, like an ester or maybe a conjugated carbonyl.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR. It shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound must have at least one double bond. That fits with the IR data because if there's a carbonyl, maybe it's an ester group or something else with a double bond nearby.

Then the mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z=45. I remember that m/z=45 is a common fragment, often corresponding to a CH3CO (acetone) group or maybe a (CH2)2O+ ion, but wait, 45 is also the molecular ion for methyl acetate (CH3COOCH3?) Wait, what's the molecular formula of methyl acetate? It's C3H6O2. Oh, but the options given are all C6, so that might not fit. Alternatively, m/z=45 could be a fragment from a larger molecule. Maybe it's part of a larger structure where a fragment breaks off to form a 45 m/z ion.

Let me think about the possible structures for each option.

Option D: C6H12O. The degree of unsaturation: each degree is a ring or double bond. For C6H12O, the formula is C6H12O. The general formula for an alkane is CnH2n+2O. Wait, but for degrees of unsaturation: each double bond or ring is one degree. For C6H12O, the formula is C6H12O. The formula without O is C6H12, which is 2 more H than C6H10 (since 2n+2 for n=6 is 14; wait wait, wait, no, wait. Let me calculate degrees of unsaturation properly. The formula is C6H12O. The general formula for a saturated compound (alkane) is CnH2n+2. For n=6, it's C6H14. So the given compound has 2 fewer H's than that. So each degree of unsaturation (like a double bond or ring) reduces H by 2. So 14 -12 =2 → 2/2=1 degree. So one double bond or ring. Also, there's an O, which could be an alcohol, ether, etc. But the IR had O-H broad peak, so maybe it's an alcohol. But let's see.

Option B: C6H10O. The formula without O is C6H10. For n=6, the alkane is C6H14. 14-10=4 → 4/2=2 degrees. So either two double bonds, or one double bond and a ring, or two rings. But the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond. So perhaps one double bond and another ring, or two double bonds. But another possibility is a carbonyl group. Wait, the IR shows a strong peak at 1700, which is a carbonyl. So maybe this compound has a carbonyl group, which is a double bond (C=O), plus another double bond elsewhere. So two degrees of unsaturation from that. But then the O count: C6H10O has one O. So if the O is in a carbonyl group, like a ketone, or an aldehyde, then that would fit. But in that case, the O would be part of the carbonyl, which is a ketone or aldehyde. So the IR would have the 1700 cm^-1 for carbonyl. Then the other peak at 1650 might be something else. Alternatively, maybe an ester. Esters have two carbonyl groups? No, esters have one carbonyl, but maybe conjugated with an aromatic ring.

Option A: C6H12O2. So degrees of unsaturation: formula is C6H12O2. Without O, it's C6H12. For n=6, alkane is C6H14. 14-12=2 → 1 degree. So one ring or double bond. Plus, two O's. The possible structures could be an ester (which has a carbonyl and an ether linkage, but O's are part of the ester group). Or perhaps a diol, but that would have two -OH groups, but the IR shows a broad peak which could be two -OH, but then why only one peak? Unless it's a broad peak from one OH, maybe an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. Wait, but the O2 in the formula could also be from a carboxylic acid and another group. Alternatively, maybe an ester group (O2 from the ester), but an ester is R-O-CO-O-R? No, wait, ester is R-O-CO-R. So that's one O from the ether and one from the carbonyl. So O2 in the formula.

Option C: C6H10O2. So the formula is C6H10O2. Without O: C6H10. Alkane C6H14 → 14-10=4 → 2 degrees of unsaturation. So two rings, or a ring and double bond, or two double bonds. But the NMR has vinyl H, so at least one double bond. So the other could be a carbonyl. So possible structures could be an ester (with a carbonyl and an ether linkage) or a ketone with another double bond, but the O2 would need to come from something else.

Now, looking back at the FTIR data: the broad peak at 3000 is probably an O-H group. So the compound has an -OH group. Wait, but in option C, C6H10O2. An O-H would require one O for the hydroxyl. But if there's another O elsewhere, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid (COOH), which would have two O's in the formula. So for example, if the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond, that would fit. Let's think about that.

If the compound is a carboxylic acid (COOH), the formula would have two O's. For a C6 compound, perhaps it's hexanoic acid, but that would have the formula C6H12O2. But wait, that's option A. But hexanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH → C6H12O2. Its IR would show a broad O-H (carboxylic acid) around 2500-3000, but the given IR has a very broad peak at 3000. Wait, carboxylic acids typically have broad O-H around 2500-3000, maybe overlapping with the C=O. Or maybe I'm getting that mixed up. Alternatively, alcohol O-H is usually broader and maybe at a lower wavenumber than carboxylic acids. Wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact regions. Let me think: aliphatic alcohols have O-H around 3300-3500 cm^-1 as broad peaks. Carboxylic acids have O-H around 2500-3300, but it's usually a bit lower and possibly a bit less broad, but I'm not certain. Also, in the IR, there's a peak at 1700 which could be a carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, that would fit the 1700 cm^-1.

Wait, but in the FTIR, the peaks are at 1700 and 1650. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl (C=O) is around 1700. The 1650 could be an aromatic ring, but if the compound doesn't have aromatic rings, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. So, for example, a compound with a double bond next to the carbonyl, which would lower the carbonyl absorption to around 1700 and perhaps another peak at 1650.

Wait, but the 1H NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which are adjacent to a double bond. So the compound likely has a double bond (vinyl group) and a carbonyl group. So maybe it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. For example, something like an enone (conjugated dienone or similar).

Now, looking at the mass spec: a fragment at m/z=45. Common fragments include the acetone ion (CH3CO+) which is 58 (maybe I'm confusing with something else), wait, no. Acetone is (CH3)2CO, whose molecular weight is 58. But 45 would be something else. Let me think: 45 could be the fragment from a ketone group. Wait, 45 is (CH3CO)+, but that's 58. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe a CH2CO+ group? Wait, that's 43 (CH2CO is 43). Or maybe it's a CH2O+ group, but that's 30. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH2)2O+, which is 44. Hmm, close to 45 but not exactly. Alternatively, the fragment could be a CH2CH2O group? Not sure. Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be from a methyl group attached to something else. Alternatively, perhaps the base peak is at m/z=45, which might be the molecular ion for a smaller fragment, like (CH3)2O+, which is 45? Wait, (CH3)2O is 45? Let me calculate: (CH3)2O is (2*15) + (6) + (16) = 30 + 6 + 16=52. Oh wait, no, that's 52. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2(O)CH2+? Not sure. Alternatively, the fragment could be a result of losing a larger group. For example, if the compound is an ester, perhaps losing the ester group, leaving a smaller fragment. For instance, if the compound is something like methyl something, losing the methyl ester part could leave a 45 fragment. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from the acetate group.

Wait, if the compound is an ester, like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3 (ethyl propenoate), but that would have a molecular formula C6H10O2. Wait, let me count: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3 would be C5H8O2. Hmm, but the options are C6. Alternatively, maybe something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 (propyl ester), which would be C6H10O2. That's option C. So in that case, the ester group is O-CO-O, but wait, no, that's O-CO-O. Wait, esters are R-O-CO-R. So in that case, the formula would be C6H10O2, which is option C.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which would be in the CH2=CHCOO group. So the ester could have a vinyl group attached.

In the mass spec, when the ester breaks, perhaps the acetate group (CH3COO-) could be lost, but in that case, the fragment would be from the remaining part. Alternatively, maybe the molecule breaks at the carbonyl, leading to a smaller fragment. Alternatively, the ester group could split into a smaller fragment. I'm not entirely sure about that, but the presence of a fragment at 45 is something I need to connect.

Now, looking again at the IR: the broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 is likely O-H. So the compound must have an -OH group. Wait, but if it's an ester, there's no -OH. Esters have O but not -OH. So that's conflicting. So perhaps the broad peak is from a different group. Alternative possibilities: the compound could be a ketone with an -OH group elsewhere, but that would be less common unless it's a diol or something else.

Wait, let's think again about the IR. If the O-H is from an alcohol, then the compound is an alcohol with a carbonyl group. For that, possible structures are a ketone with an alcohol group, but that's less common. Alternatively, maybe it's a hemiacetal or something else, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, the compound could be a carboxylic acid, which would have both a carbonyl and an -OH group. So in that case, the IR would show a broad peak from the -OH (carboxylic acid) and a strong peak around 1700 for the carbonyl.

So for option A: C6H12O2. If it's a carboxylic acid, the formula would fit. For example, hexanoic acid is C6H12O2. The IR would have O-H (broad) around 3000, and the carbonyl at 1700. The 1650 peak could be an aromatic ring, but hexanoic acid doesn't have that. Unless the molecule has another double bond. Hexanoic acid is just a straight chain, but maybe the compound has a double bond elsewhere. So for example, if it's pentenoic acid or something, but the formula would still be C6H12O2.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond adjacent to the aromatic group, but wait, double bonds are either isolated or conjugated. In any case, a double bond in the structure.

But wait, if the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond, maybe something like CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH (which is C6H10O2). Wait, but that would be C6H10O2, which is option C. So that would have a degree of unsaturation of 2 (because 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens: for n=6, 2n+2=14. 14-10=4 → 2 degrees). So that would fit: one from the double bond, one from the carboxylic acid's carbonyl.

But wait, the formula for CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH is C6H1
