Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says we have two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, I probably need to use the theory of relativity, specifically the velocity addition formula for relative speed because they're moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light.

Wait, the question is asking for the relative speed between them. But wait, wait—both are moving in the same direction. So I guess the relative speed is the difference between their speeds? No, wait, no. Because at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract them normally. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. So the formula for relative velocity is (u' - v) / (1 - (uv)/c²), where u is the velocity of the first object as seen from the second's frame, or something like that. Or maybe I should think about it the other way around.

Let me think. Suppose astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. If I'm astronaut A, what speed do I perceive B moving at? Because from A's frame, B is moving at (v_B - v_A)/(1 - (v_A v_B)/c²). Wait, no, that can't be right because if both are moving in the same direction, then the relative speed should be the difference. But wait, actually, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²), where u is the speed of B in the lab frame, and v is the speed of A in the lab frame. Or is it the other way around? Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the relative velocity is the speed of B as seen from A's frame. So A is moving at 0.6c, and B is moving at 0.5c, so in A's frame, B's velocity would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²). Let me compute that.

So, the numerator is (0.5c - 0.6c) = -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.5 * 0.6)c² / c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c) / 0.7, which is approximately -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates that B is moving in the opposite direction relative to A, but since the question is about speed, the magnitude is 0.1428c. So about 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel around 0.14c.

So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. So that's the first part.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Hmm, the system consists of both astronauts. But wait, when you're calculating the total
