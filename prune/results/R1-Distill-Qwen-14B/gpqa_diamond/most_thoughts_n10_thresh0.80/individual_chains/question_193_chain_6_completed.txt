Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to these concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So the formula, I think, is N ∝ 1 / plx^5. Hmm, right, because parallax is inversely related to distance. So higher parallax means closer stars, lower parallax means more distant.

Wait, what's the relation between parallax and distance again? Oh right, parallax (plx) in arcseconds is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1 / r, where r is the distance in parsecs. So r = 1 / plx.

The question is asking how the number of stars (N) changes with distance (r) per unit range of distance. So like, if you go from r to r + dr, how does N change? So essentially, they're asking about the dependence of N on r.

Given that N ∝ 1 / plx^5, and since plx = 1/r, substituting that in, N ∝ 1 / ( (1/r) )^5. Let me calculate that.

1/( (1/r)^5 ) is the same as (r)^5. So N is proportional to r^5. Does that mean that the number of stars increases with r^5? Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because if N is proportional to r^5, then as r increases, the number of stars increases rapidly. But wait, how does this make sense in the real universe?

Wait, in reality, the number of stars you can see at a certain distance depends on the volume. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr^3, so the number of stars (assuming uniform density) should increase with r^3. But in this case, the number varies as 1/plx^5, which is r^5. Hmm, that's different.

So the question is giving a specific scenario where N is proportional to 1/plx^5. So regardless of what's typical, I have to follow the given relation.

So the number of stars N varies as 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/r, then N ∝ r^5. So for each unit increase in r (distance), the number of stars increases as r^5.

Wait, but the question is about how N changes with distance, per unit range. So perhaps they're asking about the distribution function. So if you're looking at a thin shell between r and r+dr, the number of stars in that shell would be the derivative of N with respect to r, maybe?

Wait, let's think in terms of differential. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr would be N(r) multiplied by 4πr² dr (since the volume of the shell is surface area times dr, and surface area is 4πr²).

But wait, in this question, the relation between N and r is given as N ∝ r^5. Oh wait no, wait. Wait, N is the total number of stars up to a certain distance. Or is N the number per unit volume?

Hmm, maybe I'm confusing total number and number density. Let me think again.

The question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So for a given parallax, the number is 1/plx^5. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so plx ∝ 1/r. So 1/plx^5 = r^5.

Wait, wait. So N ∝ r^5. So if I have a parallax plx, then N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is the proportionality constant.

But what is N here? Is N the total number of stars within a distance r, or is it the number of stars per unit volume?

Wait, the way the problem is phrased: "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So probably, N is the total number of stars observed at a certain parallax. Wait, no, because parallax is a measure of distance. So higher parallax (lower distance) would mean more stars if they're closer, but in this case, N is 1/plx^5, which would mean N increases as plx decreases (since 1/plx^5 increases when plx decreases). So as r increases (since plx = 1/r), N increases as r^5.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So perhaps it's about the number of stars per unit distance, which would be the derivative of N with respect to r.

Wait, no. Let me think more carefully. The question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So, for a given change in r, how does the number of stars in that region change.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to model it. The number of stars observed in the region varies as 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/r, then N ∝ r^5.

So, as r increases, the number of stars increases as r^5. So the number of stars increases rapidly with distance. But that seems counterintuitive because in reality, the number of stars you can see should drop off with distance, but this case says it increases. But the question isn't about reality; it's about the given relation.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So from a unit change in r, how much does N change? That would be the derivative dN/dr. Since N = k r^5, then dN/dr = 5 k r^4. So the number of stars increases with r^4 per unit distance. Wait, but the options don't have a 5 here, but option C is r^4, D is r^2.

Wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says, how does the number of stars change with distance per unit range of distance. So perhaps they're asking for the number of stars per unit distance. So, the number of stars in a thin shell of radius r and thickness dr would be the number density multiplied by the volume of the shell.

Wait, let me think of N as the number of stars in a thin shell. So the number of stars in a shell dr thick at radius r would depend on the number density of stars at that distance. But wait, the given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. If N is the number of stars in a shell, then perhaps it's the number of stars per unit distance.

Alternatively, perhaps N is the total number of stars up to distance r. Let's model that.

If N(r) is the total number of stars within distance r, and N ∝ 1/plx^5, which is r^5, then N(r) = k r^5. Then, the number of stars per unit distance would be dN/dr, which is 5 k r^4. So that would mean the number of stars increases with r^4 per unit distance.

Wait, but wait, that's not considering volume. Because in reality, the total number of stars within radius r would be proportional to the volume, which is r^3. But in this question, it's given as r^5. So perhaps the number of stars isn't just about the volume but some other factor, like more stars existing at larger distances, which is unusual.

But the question is about how the number changes with distance. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars increases rapidly as you go further. But the question asks, how does the number change with distance? So, per unit distance, the number increase would be dN/dr = 5 r^4. So the rate of change is proportional to r^4.

Looking at the options, option C is r^4.

Wait, but let me think again. Another approach: the number of stars in a region of the sky is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, and parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/r. So the number of stars N is proportional to r^5.

Now, if I want the number of stars per unit distance, that's dN/dr. So dN/dr is 5 r^4. So the number of stars increases with r^4 as you move a unit distance. So the dependence is r^4, which is option C.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars in that region changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r). So perhaps they're asking about the number per unit distance, which would be proportional to r^4.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the number of stars in a given volume, not per unit volume. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused between N as a function of r and N as a function of volume.

Wait, perhaps I should model this using a differential. Let me think: N is proportional to (1/plx)^5. Since plx = 1/r, N = k * r^5, where k is a constant.

The number of stars in a thin shell (i.e., between r and r + dr) would be dN = k * (r+dr)^5 - k r^5. But for small dr, this is approximately 5 k r^4 dr. So the number of stars per unit distance (dr) is 5 k r^4. So the number in each shell increases with r^4.

So the change in number per unit distance is r^4, which is option C.

Wait, the options are A) r^3, B) r^5, C) r^4, D) r^2.

So the answer should be option C, r^4.


The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \), substituting this into the given relation gives \( N \propto r^5 \). This means the total number of stars increases rapidly with distance.

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, we consider the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \). Since \( N \propto r^5 \), the derivative is:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4
\]

This indicates that the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
