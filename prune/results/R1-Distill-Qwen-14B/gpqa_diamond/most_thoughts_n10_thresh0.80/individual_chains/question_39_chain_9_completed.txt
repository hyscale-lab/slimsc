Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the setup is that there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. We're told that when measuring the position of the particles, none were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3. 

The question is asking for the numerical value of 'a'. The options are A) 1.1, B) 0.85, C) 0.35, D) 0.6.

Hmm, right. So in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be normalized. That means the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. Because the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3, I think that the wave function is zero outside this region. But wait, the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So maybe this is the wave function within x=1 to x=3, and zero elsewhere. Or perhaps the wave function is only defined in that interval, and the square root makes sense there.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So that's a complex wave function. The square root of (1 + x) is only real if 1 + x is positive, so x > -1. But our region is x >=1, so that's fine. So the wave function is valid in the region where x >=1. But the measurements only found particles between x=1 and x=3. So perhaps the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, and zero otherwise. Or maybe the system is confined to that region.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So that's a complex function, which is an issue because usually, the wave function's imaginary part relates to the time dependence in the Schrödinger equation. But maybe this is a stationary state, so the time factor is incorporated elsewhere.

But in any case, the key is to normalize the wave function. Since the wave function is given, but only non-zero between x=1 and x=3, I need to calculate the integral of |ψ|^2 dx from 1 to 3 and set it equal to 1.

So let's write ψ(x) as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the absolute square is [ψ*(x) ψ(x)] where ψ* is the complex conjugate.

The complex conjugate of ψ(x) would be (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i.

Multiplying ψ and ψ* gives:

(a / sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 + (0.5i)(a / sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5i)(a / sqrt(1+x)).

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, ψ is a + b i, so ψ* is a - b i. So ψ* ψ is (a - b i)(a + b i) = a² + b².

Because the cross terms (a*b i and -a*b i) cancel out. So the absolute square is a² + b².

In this case, a is (a / sqrt(1+x)), and b is 0.5. So |ψ|^2 is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute it again. ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So a is (a / sqrt(1+x)), and b is 0.5. So ψ* is (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i.

So ψ*ψ = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5i)(a/(sqrt(1+x))) + [a/(sqrt(1+x)))(-0.5i) ] + (0.5i)(-0.5i).

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe it's easier to just compute the product correctly.

Alternatively, I can note that ψ*ψ is (a/(sqrt(1+x)) )^2 + (0.5)^2, because the cross terms are imaginary and cancel out. Let me see:

ψ*ψ = [a/sqrt(1+x)]² + (0.5)^2. Because when you multiply (a + b)(a - b) with a being a real term and b being imaginary, the cross terms are a b (a - a) which are imaginary, but their sum is zero, so only the squares remain.

Wait, no. Let me think of it as (a + b i)(a - b i) where a is a real function. Then the product is a^2 + b^2, because the cross terms are a ( -b i) and a (b i ), which add up to zero.

So in this case, a is (a / sqrt(1+x)), a real function, and b is 0.5. So |ψ|² = (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So to find the normalization, the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

So the integral becomes ∫ (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx from 1 to 3.

We can split the integral into two parts:

a² ∫ [1/(1+x)] dx from 1 to3 + ∫ 0.25 dx from 1 to3.

Let me compute each integral.

First integral: ∫ 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 is ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3.

At 3: ln(4), at 1: ln(2). So the integral is ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2).

Second integral: ∫ 0.25 dx from1 to3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Solving for a²: a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's the value of ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7202.

So a ≈ sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8485.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close. So the answer is B.

Wait, but let me double-check the setup. The wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, and the integral is from 1 to3. So that's correct.

Yes, so a is approximately 0.8485. So the answer is B) 0.85.


To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function, which states that the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over all space must equal 1. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The absolute square of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the wave function is non-zero only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), we integrate \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over this interval:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 dx = \int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx + \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 1
\]

1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln(1+x) \Big|_1^3 = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
   \]

Combining these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7202
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7202} \approx 0.8485
\]

The closest option to this value is \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
