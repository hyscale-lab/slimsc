Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull.

So, the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both have circular orbits. But the RV measurements are different for each planet.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, wait. I think the RV method's shift depends on the mass of the planet and its orbital period. Oh, right! The formula I remember is something like the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity, K, is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_star))^(1/3). But wait, since the planet mass is much smaller than the star, we can approximate that term as just M_p / M_star^(1/3) * (something else). Or wait, maybe I should think about the Doppler shift formula. Oh, right, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / (4π²) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (M_star^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star) )) ) * (1 / (a * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) )

But since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that part is 1. Also, since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star, M_p << M_star, so (1 + M_p/M_star) ≈ 1. So we can ignore that for approximation.

Wait, another approach. The RV method measures the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's orbit. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (G * P )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (2π)^(1/3) * (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G * P )^(1/3) ) * (M_p) / ( (2π)^(1/3) * M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 AU) )^something? Wait, maybe I should look for a simpler relation.

Wait, another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period. Or is it? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The RV method's shift depends on the velocity of the star, which is due to the planet's orbit. The star's velocity is given by v = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(
