Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says we have a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. And the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. I remember that the formation constant is related to how strong the complex is. A high K means the complex forms a lot.

Wait, so the complex is Ca-EDTA. EDTA is a ligand that binds metal ions, right? So the complex would be like CaY^2- or something. The problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

I think the formula I need here is the one for the dissociation of the complex. The formation constant Kf is given by [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA]). But wait, if I want to find [Ca^2+], maybe I should rearrange this equation.

Alternatively, since the complex dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- (or some form, but I think the charges might not matter for the expression), the reverse reaction would have a dissociation constant Kd, which is 1/Kf. So Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

So the dissociation equation is CaY^2- ⇌ Ca^2+ + Y^4-. The Kd for this reaction would be [Ca^2+][Y^4-]/[CaY^2-].

Wait, but in solution, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Assuming that the dissociation is so small that the change is negligible compared to 0.02, so [CaY^2-] ≈ 0.02 M.

So, assuming x is the concentration of Ca^2+ produced, then [Ca^2+] = x and [Y^4-] = x as well. So plugging into the Kd expression:

Kd = (x)(x) / 0.02 ≈ 2e-11.

So x^2 = (2e-11) * 0.02 → 4e-13.

Wait, wait, let me compute that: 2e-11 multiplied by 0.02
