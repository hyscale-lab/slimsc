Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar astrophysics, but let me try to think this through. 

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The stars are in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), so I guess I can use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, the Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium. The formula I remember is n_i / n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Since they're talking about excitation, I think E_i is the higher energy level, and E_j is the lower. So in this case, the ratio is n_upper / n_lower.

In star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So for the specific energy level, the population ratio is higher in star_1. Let me think: if star_1's ratio is twice that of star_2's ratio, then n1/n2 = 2. But I need to express this in terms of the temperatures of the stars.

Let me denote the ratio for star 1 as R1 and star 2 as R2. So R1 = 2 R2. But wait, actually, the problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice as much. So I think R1 = 2 * R2, where R is the population of the excited state. Or is it that the ratio of excited to lower state is twice as high in star 1 compared to star 2?

Wait, more precisely, the problem says that the excited level (let's say level 2) is twice as populated in star_1 compared to star_2. So (n2_1 / n1_1) = 2 * (n2_2 / n1_2). Or wait, no, maybe the excitation is twice, so the ratio (n2/n1) is twice as large for star_1 as for star_2.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio for each star is given by the Boltzmann factor. Let's say for each star, the ratio is R = n_upper / n_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, and T is the temperature of the star.

So for star_1, R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
For star_2, R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

The problem states that R1 = 2 * R2. Because in star_1, the excited level is twice as populated compared to star_2. So:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Let me write that down.

Take natural logs on both sides to simplify:

ln( exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ) = ln( 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) )

Which simplifies to:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + ( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Rearranging terms:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Alternatively, factor as:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, let me see. Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So yes, that's correct.

So ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But I'm looking for an equation that relates T1 and T2. So let's express this
