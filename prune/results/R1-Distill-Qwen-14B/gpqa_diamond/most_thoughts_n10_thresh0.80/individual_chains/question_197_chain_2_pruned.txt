Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question involves identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, okay.

First, I'll look at the spectroscopic data provided. Let's start with the IR. The IR peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates either an O-H stretch (like in an alcohol or carboxylic acid) or an N-H stretch. But since there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, the compound probably has a carbonyl group. The other peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be from aromatic rings, possibly C=C stretching vibrations.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. The peaks are at 10.5 ppm (a broad singlet, 1H), which is quite downfield. That makes me think of an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydic protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. But wait, in a carboxylic acid, the proton is usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. But wait, another possibility is an enol proton, but that's less likely. Alternatively, maybe an aromatic proton in a conjugated system, but no, that's usually around 7-8 ppm. So maybe this is a carboxylic acid. The 1720 cm-1 in IR supports that because a carboxylic acid has a strong carbonyl.

Wait, but wait another moment. Another group that shows up around 10 ppm is an aldehyde, but aldehyde protons are deshielded. So maybe it's an aldehyde. But then, the 1720 cm-1 would correspond to a ketone or aldehyde. Wait, but if it's an aldehyde, the IR would show a peak around 2820 and 2720 cm-1 for the aldehyde C-H stretch. But the IR given starts at 3400–2500, which is a broad range. Maybe it's an O-H stretch, but that's more around 3200-3600. So maybe the 3400-2500 cm-1 is an O-H stretch (like in a carboxylic acid) and an aldehyde C=O at 1720. Or perhaps it's a ketone. Wait, but a ketone's C=O is around 1715 cm-1, so 1720 is a bit higher, which might suggest a more electron-deficient carbonyl, like an acid.

Wait, but looking back, the NMR shows a singlet at 10.5 ppm for 1H. If it's a carboxylic acid, that would make sense because the -COOH proton is typically around there. But wait, in the NMR, the integration is 1H, which would fit a carboxylic acid since it's one proton. However, sometimes the OH in a carboxylic acid can be broad or even not appear if exchanged. But in this case, it's a broad singlet, so maybe it's the -OH of a carboxylic acid.

Wait another thing, in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm peak is a singlet. So, it's only one proton. So maybe it's a COOH group. So, the compound is a benzoic acid derivative, perhaps.

Looking at the other NMR peaks. There's a doublet at 8.0 ppm (2H) and another at 7.2 ppm (2H). Those seem like two sets of aromatic protons, perhaps para-substituted. So maybe a para-substituted benzene ring. Let's think, if the substituents are in the para positions, then the two sets of protons would be each as doublets, each integrating to 2H. So this could be a benzene ring where two protons are in one position and two in another, opposite position. So maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents.

Wait, but looking at the molecular structure. Let's hypothesize that the compound is a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. For example, a substituent at position 4 and another at position 1 (or perhaps a single substituent in the para position? Hmm, wait, but the NMR shows two doublets each for 2H, so perhaps two substituents in the para positions. Wait, but wait, that would mean substituents at positions 1 and 4? Or maybe each substituent is at a different position but in para positions relative to each other. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, let's think: a benzene ring with two substituents in para positions would lead to two sets of equivalent protons. For example, if the substituents are at positions 1 and 3, but that's meta. Alternatively, substituents at 1 and 4 (para), but that would make the ring have two substituents opposite each other. Wait, but in that case, the ring would have two substituents at positions 1 and 4? That's a bit unusual but possible. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is in position 4, and another substituent elsewhere, but that's not clear yet.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a benzene ring with a substituent at position 4, and another substituent that's ortho, meta, or para to it. Alternatively, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with two identical substituents, leading to two doublets in the NMR. Wait, but each doublet is 2H, so maybe each substituent is attached to the benzene in such a way that the adjacent Hs are in a doublet. For example, if the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl, which would cause the adjacent Hs to split into a doublet. So perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, like a ketone or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the 1720 cm-1 in IR suggests a carbonyl. So maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group. Let's say the substituent is a -COOH group in the para position. So the benzene ring would have a
