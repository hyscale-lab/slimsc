Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, that's a bit confusing. I remember that parallax is related to distance, right? Oh yeah, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if plx is small, the distance is large.

The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So, it's about how the number of stars depends on distance r. The options are different power laws, like r cubed, r squared, etc.

Let me think. The given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. But since plx is inversely proportional to distance, plx = 1/d, where d is distance. So plx is proportional to 1/r. Wait, but here, plx is in the denominator, raised to the fifth power. So substituting plx = 1/r, the equation becomes N ∝ 1/( (1/r)^5 ) = r^5. Oh, wait, wait. Let me double-check that step.

So, if N is proportional to 1/(plx^5), and plx is 1/r, then 1/( (1/r)^5 ) is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. But wait, that would imply that as r increases, the number of stars increases as r^5, which seems a bit counterintuitive. Because usually, the number of stars you can see would decrease with distance because they become fainter, but maybe in this specific scenario, it's different.

Wait, but the problem is about the number of stars varying with parallax, which suggests that perhaps the way we're counting them depends on how their parallaxes are distributed. So if more stars are at a certain distance, the parallax would be a certain value. But I'm not entirely sure, so maybe I should approach it more methodically.

Let me think about the relationship between distance and parallax. Parallax (plx) is equal to 1 AU divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So d = 1/plx.

Now, the number of stars N varies as 1/(plx^5). So N ∝ 1/plx^5.

Since plx is 1/d, substituting, N ∝ d^5. Because 1/( (1/d) )^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, the question is about how N changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance. So as d increases, N increases as d^5.

But wait, that suggests that the number of stars increases as you look at larger distances, which doesn't quite make sense because in reality, the number of stars you can see at a larger distance in the same region would be fewer because they're fainter. But perhaps this is an idealized scenario where the distribution is different.

Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake in the substitution. Let me redo that step carefully.

Given N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, so plx = d^{-1}.

So 1/(plx)^5 = 1/(d^{-5
