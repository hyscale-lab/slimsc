Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem about exoplanets and the RV method. Let me take it step by step. 

The question says that there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun, and each has a planet similar in mass to Neptune. They're using the radial velocity (RV) method to detect them. Both planets are in circular orbits. 

The key data given are the periodic shifts in the spectral lines of their host stars. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift in wavelength depends on the star's velocity towards or away from us. 

The formula I think I need is the one that relates the RV semi-amplitude (K) to the orbital period (P). I recall that K is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) ) ) * (1/P)^(1/3), but maybe I'm mixing up some terms. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the relation between K and P, considering the masses of the stars and the planets.

Wait, since both stars have the same mass (solar masses), and the planet masses are similar to Neptune, which is much less than the Sun, so M_p << M_star. So the formula might simplify. 

I think the key here is that the RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period, assuming other factors are constant. Because K depends on the velocity of the star, which in turn depends on the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, and the size of the orbit. 

The formula I think is K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1/(P))^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p << M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So that part becomes (M_star)^(2/3). 

Also, sin i is probably close to 1 since the orbits are circular and edge-on would give maximum shift, but maybe it's not necessary since both planets are around similar stars and the setup is the same, so i might be same for both, so sin i cancels out.

So, simplifying, K is proportional to (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

But wait, in the problem, both planets have similar masses, so M_p is same for both. And the stars are same mass, so M_star is same. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). 

Wait, that makes sense. Because if the period is longer, the star's velocity (as seen via RV) would be smaller, since the planet is moving more slowly around the star. So a larger K means a smaller period, because the star is moving back
