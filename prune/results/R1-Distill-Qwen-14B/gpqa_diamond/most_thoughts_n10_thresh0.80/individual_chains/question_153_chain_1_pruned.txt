Okay, I'm trying to figure out these Michael addition reactions. So, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile is usually an enolate, and it attacks the beta position, leading to a new carbon-carbon bond.

Let's look at each reaction one by one.

First reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + NaOEt, EtOH → A.

Hmm, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's an enolate source. I think when you have NaOEt (sodium ethoxide), it deprotonates the malonate to form an enolate. The methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate must be the Michael acceptor here because it's an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

In the Michael addition, the enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. So, the nucleophile attacks the less substituted carbon (beta) of the acrylate. Wait, but wait—actually, the enolate is a strong nucleophile and will add to the beta position of the acceptor.

So the product would be a new compound where the malonate's enolate has added to the acrylate. The structure would connect the malonate's carbon to the acrylate. Since malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2, adding it to the acrylate would form something like a longer chain.

The acrylate is CH2=CH-(p-tolyl), but wait, no—the structure is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=CH(p-tolyl)COOCH3? Or maybe it's CH2-CH2 with the double bond between carbons 2 and 3? Wait, maybe I should think about the structure as CH2=C(OAc)-something. Wait no, the correct structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is probably CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with the substituent on the third carbon.

Wait no, acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. So the E isomer would have the substituents opposite. But in this case, the substituent is on the third carbon? So maybe it's CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3 with a double bond between the first and second carbons. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. No, wait, no, that would be the case for a different substitution. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=C(R)-COOCH3, where R is p-tolyl. So when the enolate attacks the beta carbon (the middle carbon in CH2=CH-), the addition would place the malonate's carbon next to that.

Wait, adding the enolate from dimethyl malonate (which is a strong base) to the beta carbon of the acrylate. The product would be a new carbon chain.
