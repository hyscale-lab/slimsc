Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when a certain part of the fusion process stops. Hmm, let's try to break it down.

First, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. Right, because that's roughly the time it takes for solar neutrinos to reach Earth. So any changes in the Sun's core would be felt here about that time later.

Wait, the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain, right? I remember that the pp chain is the main source of energy in the Sun. The pp-I branch produces deuterium, I think, and then there's the pp-II and pp-III which branch off. Oh, right, the pp-III branch is where the deuterium captures a proton to form helium-3. So stopping the pp-III branch would mean that this part of the fusion isn't happening anymore.

So, what's the significance of pp-III for neutrinos? Well, the main neutrinos from the Sun come from two processes: the dominant one is the pp chain, which produces electron neutrinos. And a smaller contribution comes from the CNO cycle, which also produces neutrinos but in a different way.

Wait, but the question is about the flux ratio between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to figure out how the neutrino production in these bands changes when pp-III stops.

The pp-III branch is responsible for producing some specific neutrinos. Oh, right, the neutrinos from the pp chain are mostly from the Beryllium-7 process. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let's think: the main neutrinos are from the pp chain where a boron-8 nucleus decays into two helium-4 nuclei, emitting a neutrino. The energy of these neutrinos is around 1 MeV, I think. But wait, the bands are at lower energies (up to 900 keV), so maybe they're from a different process.

Wait, another thought: the neutrinos from the proton-proton chain come from two main sources. The first step is two protons fusing to form deuterium, which emits a positron and a neutrino. Those neutrinos are lower energy, around 0.42
