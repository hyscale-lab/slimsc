Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure out which stars are observable by both. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The question gives me five stars (Star1 to Star5) with various properties. Each star has an RA (right ascension), DEC (declination), magnitude details, and sometimes extinction (E(B-V)). The key is to determine each star's apparent V magnitude because that's what the spectrographs can detect.

Wait, right. The ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V mag 17, and HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 V. So, a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤17 to be seen by ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES. Wait, no, the problem says ESPRESSO can observe brighter than 17, meaning apparent magnitude less than or equal to 17? Or is it that it can't observe fainter than 17? Let me think. I think "brighter than 17" means the magnitude is less than or equal to 17 because lower magnitudes are brighter. So, a star with apparent V mag <=17 can be observed by ESPRESSO, and for HIRES, apparent V mag <=16.

Wait, wait. The question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So,
