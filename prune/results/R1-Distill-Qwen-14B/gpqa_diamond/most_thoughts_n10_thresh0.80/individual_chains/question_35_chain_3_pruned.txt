Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think this through.

The question says that Ay is a 2x2 matrix operator, and it's given as c times S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum components are often represented by Pauli matrices or similar structures. 

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Let me recall their forms. Oh right, σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which matches the given matrix S. So S is actually the Pauli y-matrix. Interesting.

So Ay = c * S. Substituting c, that's (h/(4π)) * σy. Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±ħ/2, but wait, let's think again. Oh wait, for the Pauli matrices like σy, the eigenvalues are actually ±1. Because σy has eigenvalues ±1. So when we scale the matrix, the eigenvalues get scaled by the same factor.

So Ay has eigenvalues a = c * (±1) = (h/(4π)) * (±1). Let's compute that. h is Planck's constant, but wait, actually in quantum mechanics, ħ is h/(2π). So h = 2πħ. So substituting that into c, we get c = (2πħ)/(4π) )= ħ/2. Wait, no, wait: c is h/(4π). So h/(4π) is (2πħ) / (4π) )= ħ/(2). So c is ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues a are (ħ/2) * (±1). So a = ± ħ/2.

Wait, but wait—look at the answer options. Let me see what they say.

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). Hmm, but our eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which are real. So
