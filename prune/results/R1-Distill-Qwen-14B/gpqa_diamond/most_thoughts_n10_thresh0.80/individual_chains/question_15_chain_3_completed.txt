Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit. Hmm, I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability so the researchers should observe that one.

Alright, let's start by recalling what affects the transit probability. I remember that the probability depends on the orbital distance of the planet and the size of the star. Specifically, the transit probability (P) is given by the formula P = R_star / a, where R_star is the radius of the star and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

Wait, but wait, how do I find the semi-major axis? Oh right, I can use Kepler's third law. The period P is related to a and the star's mass. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a³. But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, I can approximate M+m ≈ M. So, a³ ≈ (G*M * P²)/(4π²). 

Given that, the semi-major axis a is proportional to (P² * M)^(1/3). Because we can write a as proportional to (P² * M)^(1/3). 

Wait, but let me get the exact formula. Oh right, Kepler's law in this form: a³ = (G(M) * P²) / (4π²). So a = [ (G M P²) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3). 

So for each planet, I can find a in terms of their host star's mass and their orbital period. Then, since both have the same mass, but different periods and host masses, I can compute a1 and a2.

But wait, the star's mass is different. Planet_1's host is twice as massive as Planet_2's. So M1 = 2 M2. 

And their periods: Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 = P2 /3. Let's call P2 = P, so P1 = P/3.

So let me compute a1 and a2.

a1 is proportional to ( M1 * P1² )^(1/3 )

= [ 2 M2 * (P/3)^2 ]^(1/3 )

Because M1=2 M2. 

So a1 = [2 M2 * (P²)/(9) ]^(1/3) 

= [ (2/9) M2 P² ]^(1/3 )

Similarly, a2 is [ M2 * P² ]^(1/3 )

So a1 / a2 = [ (2/9) / 1 ]^(1/3 ) 

Which is (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.6. So a1 is about 0.6 times a2. 

So a2 is larger than a1. 

But wait, transit probability is R_star / a. Both host stars have the same radius, since the problem states that. So R1 = R2 = R.

So P1 = R / a1, P2 = R / a2.

So the probability for Planet_1 is ( R / a1 ), and for Planet_2 it's ( R / a2 ). Since a2 is larger, P2 will be smaller than P1. Wait, wait no, if a2 is larger, then (R/a2) is smaller than (R/a1). So P1 is larger than P2.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let's think again. 

Wait, no, the formula for the transit probability is roughly (R_star / a), but also depends on the inclination. But since the question is about the probability, which is the same as the geometric probability, which is a function of the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance.

So if a planet is farther away, the probability is lower because the star is smaller relative to the planet's orbit. So if a2 is larger than a1, then Planet_2's probability is lower than Planet_1's. So Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.

Wait wait, but wait, I'm getting a1 = 0.6 a2. So a1 = 0.6 a2. So a2 is about 1.666 a1. So for a1 is smaller. So R/a1 is larger than R/a2. Because a1 is smaller, so R divided by a smaller number is bigger.

So Planet_1's probability is higher. So the researchers should choose Planet_1.

But wait, let me compute the exact ratio of the probabilities.

P1 = R / a1
P2 = R / a2

So P1 / P2 = (R/a1) / (R/a2) ) = a2 / a1.

From earlier, a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) * a2. Wait no. Let me think again.

Wait, from earlier, a1 is proportional to (M1 P1² )^(1/3 ). 

So a1 = k * (M1 P1² )^(1/3 ), and a2 = k * (M2 P2² )^(1/3 ), where k is the same for both.

So a1/a2 = [ (M1 P1² ) / (M2 P2² ) ]^(1/3 )

Substituting M1=2 M2, P1 = P2/3.

So a1/a2 = [ (2 M2 * (P2² / 9) ) / ( M2 * P2² ) ) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify numerator: 2 M2 * (P2² /9) = (2/9) M2 P2².

Denominator: M2 P2².

So the ratio is (2/9) / 1 = 2/9.

So (2/9)^(1/3) is about 0.63. So a1 is about 0.63 a2.

So a2 is about 1.587 a1.

So for the probabilities:

P1 = R / a1

P2 = R / a2 = R/(1.587 a1) ≈ 0.63 (R/a1 )

So P1 is approximately 1.587 times P2.

Wait, no. Because P1 is R/(0.63 a2) ?

Wait, no, let's correct that.

Wait, wait, a1 is 0.63 a2. So a1 = 0.63 a2 → a2 = a1 / 0.63 ≈ 1.587 a1.

So P2 = R/a2 = R/(1.587 a1) ≈ (1/1.587) * (R/a1) ≈ 0.63 * (R/a1) = 0.63 P1.

So P1 is higher than P2. So the probability for Planet_1 is higher by a factor of about 1.587.

So the probability for Planet_1 is approximately 1.587 times that of Planet_2.

Wait, but looking at the options.

The options are:

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability.

So the factor is approximately 1.587, which is about 1.6 (close to 1.65, perhaps). So the probability for Planet_1 is about 1.6 times higher than Planet_2.

So the researchers should choose Planet_1, as it has a higher probability. So the correct option would be C or D.

Wait, let me recalculate the exact ratio.

a1 = (2 M2 * (P/3)^2 )^(1/3 )

a2 = (M2 * P^2 )^(1/3 )

So a1/a2 = [ (2 M2 (P^2/9 )) / ( M2 P^2 ) ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ 2/(9) ) ]^(1/3 )

= (2/9)^(1/3 )

2/9 is approximately 0.2222.

The cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.60. So a1 ≈ 0.6 a2.

So a2 = a1 / 0.6 ≈ 1.6667 a1.

Transit probability is P = R / a.

So P1 = R / a1.

P2 = R / a2 = R/(1.6667 a1) = (1/1.6667) * (R/a1) ≈ 0.6 R/a1.

So P1 is 1 / 0.6 ≈ 1.6667 times P2.

So P1 is approximately 1.67 times P2.

Looking at the options, option C says "Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability." 1.65 is close to 1.67, so that's correct.

Alternatively, option C is "Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability."

So the correct answer is C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula:

\[
P = \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a}
\]

where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets orbit stars with the same radius (\( R_{\text{star,1}} = R_{\text{star,2}} \)), the probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \). A smaller \( a \) results in a higher transit probability.

The semi-major axis \( a \) can be derived from Kepler's third law:

\[
a^3 = \frac{G M P^2}{4 \pi^2}
\]

where \( M \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period of the planet. For simplicity, we approximate \( M + m \approx M \) since the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's mass. Thus:

\[
a \propto \left( M P^2 \right)^{1/3}
\]

### Step 1: Compute the semi-major axes
- For Planet_1: \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) and \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \). Substituting into the formula:

\[
a_1 \propto \left( 2M_2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2}{9} M_2 P_2^2 \right)^{1/3}
\]

- For Planet_2: \( a_2 \propto \left( M_2 P_2^2 \right)^{1/3} \).

### Step 2: Ratio of semi-major axes
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{\frac{2}{9} M_2 P_2^2}{M_2 P_2^2} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3}
\]

The cube root of \( \frac{2}{9} \) is approximately \( 0.60 \), so:

\[
a_1 \approx 0.60 \cdot a_2
\]

This means \( a_2 \approx 1.67 \cdot a_1 \).

### Step 3: Transit probability
The transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \). Since \( a_1 < a_2 \), the transit probability for Planet_1 (\( P_1 \)) is higher than for Planet_2 (\( P_2 \)). The ratio of probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R}{a_1}}{\frac{R}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx 1.67
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 4: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred, and its probability is not 2.25 times higher.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred, and its probability is not 1.5 times higher.
- **Option C**: Correct. Planet_1 is preferred, and its probability is approximately 1.65 times higher.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Planet_1's probability is not 2.7 times higher.

### Final Answer
The researchers should observe Planet_1 due to its ~1.65 times higher transit probability.

**Answer: C**
