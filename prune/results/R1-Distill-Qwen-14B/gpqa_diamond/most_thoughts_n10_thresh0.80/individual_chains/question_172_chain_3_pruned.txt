Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astrophysics, but let me think it through.

The question says that in star 1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star 2. Oh right, excitation levels have to do with the energy states of the atoms. I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the population of different energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium.

So the Boltzmann equation is probably involved here. The formula is something like (n_i)/(n_j) equals (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where n_i and n_j are the populations of the energy levels, g are the statistical weights, E the energies, k the Boltzmann constant, and T the temperature.

Wait, in this problem, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let's denote delta E as that value. So delta E = E_i - E_j, assuming E_i is higher than E_j.

The problem states that the excitation is twice as high in star 1. So I think that means the ratio of excited to unexcited atoms is 2:1 in star 1 compared to star 2. So if n_1 is the population in star 1, and n_2 in star 2, then n_1/n_2 = 2. But wait, wait. Let me clarify. The question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited"â€”so perhaps the excitation level is higher, meaning more atoms in the higher energy state. So maybe the ratio (n_high)/(n_low) is twice as much for star 1 compared to star 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is measured as the population in the excited state, so n1 is the number in star 1 and n2 in star 2, and n1/n2 = 2.

But wait, the problem states that the atoms are "twice as excited". So for each atom, the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Hmm, maybe that's not the right way to think about it. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the excited to ground state populations is 2 for star_1, and some other value for star_2
