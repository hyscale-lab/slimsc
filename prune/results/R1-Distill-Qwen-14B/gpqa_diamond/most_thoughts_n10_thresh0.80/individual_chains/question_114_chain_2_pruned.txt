Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for the reactions given. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, it's typically a nucleophilic addition. So, in the presence of a proton source, the cyanide ion can attack the carbonyl carbon. Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So adding NaCN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN? But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me see the structure. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH2)2CO, but wait no, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write that structure. So the nitrile is on the 2nd carbon, and there's a hydroxy group and a methyl. So maybe the reaction is a ketone adding CN- in acidic conditions.

Wait, but wait a second, the reaction of ketones with CN- under acidic conditions—like in the presence of H3O+—generates a cyanohydrin. So that makes sense. So, the reagent A is H3O+ (proton source). Because in the first step, NaCN provides the CN- nucleophile, and the H+ from A protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. So when the CN- attacks, it does so, and then water or something else might help with the proton transfer.

So for the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+. Now, looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3, which I'm not sure about. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. Which is used in certain reactions, maybe for reducing or something else. But in the case of adding CN- to a ketone, I think it's an acid-catalyzed addition, so H3O+ is correct for A.

Next, the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydro
