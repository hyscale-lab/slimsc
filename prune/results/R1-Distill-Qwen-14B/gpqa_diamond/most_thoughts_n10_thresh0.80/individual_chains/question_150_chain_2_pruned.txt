Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's a bit unusual. The molecular formula tells me it's an organic compound with 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. Wait, let me double-check: C8H9NO. Oh, wait, sometimes you can use degrees of unsaturation. Let me calculate that.

Degrees of unsaturation: each degree is a ring or a double bond. The formula for degrees is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is zero. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5. Wait, that can't be right because you can't have half a degree. Oh wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me recalculate. Oh wait, wait. The formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So 2*8 is 16, +2 is 18. Then subtract H (9) and X (0), add N (1). So 18-9=9, +1=10. 10 divided by 2 is 5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That's a lot.

So five degrees—maybe a benzene ring (which is 3 double bonds or 3 degrees), a carbonyl group (another degree), and maybe a double bond somewhere else, or another ring. Hmm.

Now looking at the NMR data. The 1H-NMR shows:

- 9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H. That's a strong peak, possibly an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe that's an aldehyde.

- 6.98 ppm, doublet, 2H. That's probably aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted on a benzene ring, as doublets often indicate coupling with one neighboring H. For example, in a para-substituted benzene, each set of two protons would be a doublet.

- 6.51 ppm, doublet, 2H. Another aromatic set, maybe a meta substitution or something else. Wait, but if the other aromatic peaks are at 6.98 and 6.51, perhaps there are two different aromatic groups, maybe two para-substituted rings?

Wait, or perhaps it's a para-substituted ring with another substituent. Maybe the two doublets are from two different rings.

Then, 6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Hmm, broad singlet suggests maybe some exchange, like an -OH group, but it's a singlet. Or perhaps a double bond with coupling but it's broad. Wait, 2H as a singlet? Maybe a vinyl group adjacent to something else. Or maybe it's an enol form, but I'm not sure.

3.66 ppm, doublet, 2H. That's probably a methylene group adjacent to something else. Maybe connected to an oxygen. Like OCH2 or something. Or maybe a CH2 next to a carbonyl.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is something like a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents. Let me think.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's break it down. If there's a benzene ring (6 carbons), then the rest would be 2 carbons plus NO. But wait, it's 8 carbons in total. So maybe two benzene rings? Wait, no, because two benzene rings would be 12 carbons. So perhaps one benzene ring and another group.

Wait, C8H9NO. Let's think about possible functional groups. The NMR shows an aldehyde, so perhaps a benzaldehyde group. Then, maybe a substituent that's another ring or a side chain.

Wait, the NMR shows two sets of aromatic protons. So maybe the compound has two aromatic rings attached to a central chain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted benzaldehyde with another substituent that has an aromatic ring. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the reaction steps.

The compound is reacted with NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, then aqueous KOH and heat.

NaNO2 and HCl is usually a nitrous acid condition, which is used for diazotization. Diazotization is typically done with aromatic amines, like aniline. The conditions are often cold (like 0-5°C), and then the diazonium salt is formed.

Wait, but wait, the NMR shows a peak at 9.72 ppm. If that's an aldehyde, then perhaps there's an aromatic ring attached to a carbonyl group (like benzaldehyde), but also an amino group elsewhere. Or maybe not.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation again. 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, 1 oxygen. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*8 + 2 -9 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So five degrees. So benzene (3 degrees), aldehyde (1), and maybe an amide or something else.

Alternatively, maybe a ring plus a double bond plus a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the reaction steps.

First step: NaNO2 and HCl. That makes nitrous acid, which reacts with aromatic amines to form diazonium salts. So if the starting compound has an aromatic amine group (like -NH2 attached to a benzene ring),
