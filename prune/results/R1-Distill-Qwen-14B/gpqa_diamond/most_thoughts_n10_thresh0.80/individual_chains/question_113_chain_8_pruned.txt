Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's see what the question says.

The setup is that someone has an unknown compound and used FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spec to identify it. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Hmm, let's break down each piece of information given.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H groups. A broad peak at 3000 could be an alcohol (-OH) or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but wait, carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300. But then, the question says "very broad" which makes me think it's more like an alcohol or maybe a phenol? Or perhaps something else.

Also, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, which is typical for a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 could be another carbonyl, but maybe conjugated, or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, like in a conjugated carbonyl or something else.

Wait, but wait. Let's think. If it's 1700 and 1650, perhaps one is a carbonyl and the other a conjugated double bond, like in an ester or a ketone with an adjacent double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring (like C=O and C=C in conjugation? Hmm, not sure.

Next clue: the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like in CH2=CHâ€“ groups. So the compound has double bonds, maybe an alkene somewhere.

Then, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. So I need to think about what fragments could give m/z 45. Let me think about possible ions. 45 is a common mass for a fragment. For example, CH3CO+ is 43, but maybe another. Wait, 45 could be (CH2)2O+ or something else.

But let me think of the possible compounds. The options are C6H10O2, etc.

Let me list the molecular formulas:

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: Each degree is a double bond or ring. For C6H12O2, the formula is CnH2nO2 where n=6? Wait, 2n would be 12, so yes. Wait, the general formula for an acyclic compound with O is CnH2nOx. So C6H12O2 would be similar to hexane with two oxygen atoms. Degrees of unsaturation: each double bond or ring is one degree. So for C6H12O2, the formula is C6H12O2. The degrees of unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, so (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU. Which could be one double bond or a ring.

But wait, the 1H NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so there's a double bond, so that DoU is at least one. So in that case, maybe the other DoU comes from another double bond or a ring. Hmm, but perhaps not. Let me check the other options.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. That could be two double bonds, or one double bond and a ring, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU: (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU: (14-12)/2=1. So same as option A.

So the possible structures vary. Let's think about the IR data again. The broad peak at 3000, which I thought might be O-H. Then, the peaks at 1700 and 1650. 1700 is a carbonyl, perhaps an ester, ketone, aldehyde, maybe a conjugated carbonyl. The 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ring. Wait, aromatic rings typically show C=C in the range 1450-1600. But 1650 might be a carbonyl adjacent to double bonds.

Wait, if there's a conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester or ketone, then the carbonyl might absorb at a higher wavenumber, like around 1700, and the conjugated double bond (like C=C) might be in the 1650 region.

So perhaps the compound has both a carbonyl group and a conjugated double bond. That would fit with the two peaks.

The 1H NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, meaning there's a double bond. So the structure might have a conjugated system, like a diene, but more likely, a double bond adjacent to a carbonyl group, such as an enone.

So possible structures could be an ester with a conjugated double bond, like methyl vinyl ketone or similar. Or maybe a diester or something else.

Now, the mass spectrum. A fragment at m/z 45. Let's think about possible fragments.

For example, in esters, common fragments could be the acylium ion, like if the ester breaks into the acyl part and the alcohol part. Alternatively, in some cases, the ester might lose the R-O group, leaving the acyl part which could cleave further.

Wait, 45 is a common mass for the (CH2O) group. Let me think about a fragment that would have a mass of 45. Let's think about possible ions.

45 is 45 g/mol. So possible fragments could be:

- C3H7O+: 3*12 +7*1 +16=36+7+16=59. No, too high.

Wait, maybe (CH3)2COH+? That's 45, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe CH2CH2O+? No, that's 44.

Wait, another approach: the molecular ion. Let's calculate the molecular weights of each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. MW: 6*12=72 +12*1=12 +32= 72+12+32=116.

Option B: C6H10O. 72 +10 +16=98.

Option C: C6H10O2. 72 +10 +32=114.

Option D: C6H12O. 72 +12 +16=100.

So the molecular weight would be 116, 98, 114, or 100.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment at 45. So the fragment is a part of the molecule, perhaps a cleaved part. So what could split off to give 45?

Let me think about possible fragmentations. For example, in an ester, the ester group O-C-O could break, leading to the formation of two fragments. If the ester is R-O-CO-R', upon cleavage, you get R-OH and R'-CO-OH? Or maybe the loss of an alcohol group.

Alternatively, if the compound is an ester with a conjugated double bond, maybe the fragment is an acyl group plus something else.

Wait, another possibility is that the compound is a diester, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment comes from a carbonyl group. Let's think: 45 could be the molecular ion of a small molecule. For example, if the molecule fragments into a two-carbon fragment and the rest. Let me see: 45 is 45, so possible formula is C3H7O (3*12=36 +7=43 +16=59, no). Not matching. Or C2H5O2: 2*12=24 +5=29 +32= 85. No. Alternatively, maybe a ketene or something else.

Wait, maybe it's a methyl group attached to something. Wait, 45 is 45. Let me calculate possible combinations.

45 = 12a + 1b + 16c. Let's
