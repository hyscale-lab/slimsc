Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to think this through.

First, the metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like it's in two dimensions since it's only involving dx and dy. So maybe it's a 2D spacetime or a 2D spatial surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? And in two dimensions, the pseudosphere is sometimes referred to as the tractricoid. But wait, I'm not sure if this metric directly represents a pseudosphere. Let me think about how to find the area.

The area of a surface given by a metric can be found by computing the integral over the surface of the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor, but more precisely, for a 2D metric ds² = g_{xx} dx² + 2g_{xy} dx dy + g_{yy} dy², the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Wait, but in this case, the metric only has the dx² and dy² terms, so g_{xy} is zero. So g_{xx} = g_{yy} = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and the determinant would be (32/(4 - x² - y²))². So the square root would be 32/(4 - x² - y²).

Wait, but wait, the metric is written as (32/(4 - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²). So in matrix form, the metric tensor g would have diagonal entries g_{xx} = g_{yy} = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and off-diagonal terms zero. So the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2, because the determinant for a diagonal matrix is the product of the diagonal elements. Then the square root of the determinant is 32/(4 - x² - y²).

So the area element dA is (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy. Then the total area would be the integral of this over the region where the metric is defined. But what's the domain of x and y?

The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So the metric is defined where 4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0, because the denominator can't be zero or negative (since 4 - x² - y² is in the denominator, it must be positive to keep the metric real and non-singular). So the condition is x² + y² < 4. So the region is a disk of radius 2 centered at the origin in the x-y plane.

Wait, but wait, the area would be the integral over x² + y² < 4 of (32/(4 - r²)) dx dy, where r² = x² + y². Switching to polar coordinates might make this easier. So in polar coordinates, r goes from 0 to 2 (since radius is up to 2), and theta from 0 to 2
