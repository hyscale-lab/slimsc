Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me think. The question is a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the setup: there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and it's smaller than R. So, the cavity is entirely inside the conductor, right?

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Both L and l are greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. Also, the angle between l and s is theta.

The options are given, and I need to pick the correct expression for E.

Let me recall what I know about conductors and electric fields. I remember that when a conductor is uncharged, but a charge is placed inside a cavity, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, in this case, the conductor is uncharged, so I think that any induced charges would be on the inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, the conductor is uncharged, so initially, it has no net charge. When we put a charge +q inside the cavity, the conductor's electrons will be attracted to the cavity, leaving the outer surface with a charge. No, wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Inside a conductor, the electric field is zero. So, when a charge is inside a cavity of a conductor, the charges on the inner surface of the conductor will be induced. For a conducting shell, the inner surface would have an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface would have +q to balance it, but wait, the conductor itself was uncharged initially. Oh wait, no. The conductor's total charge is zero. So when we place +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have a charge of -q, and the outer surface would have +q, because the total conductor charge is zero. So the outer surface has +q.

But wait, the conductor is a solid sphere with a cavity. So the charges in
