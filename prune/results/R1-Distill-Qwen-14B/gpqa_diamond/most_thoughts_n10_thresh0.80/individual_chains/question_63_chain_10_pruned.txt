Okay, so I have this physics problem here about quantum rotation-vibration models. I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is about a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. They're in their fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch to the next lowest energy state. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

Hmm, I remember that when a molecule absorbs a photon, it can transition between energy states. But wait, in the rotation-vibration model, there are both rotational and vibrational energy changes. Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so the next state would be the first excited state. But how does that transition work?

Wait, the problem says it's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think combines both rotational and vibrational energies. So the total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational parts.

But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, right, that would be the next state in the vibrational energy level. Because the ground state is the lowest vibrational state, and the next would be the first excited vibrational state. Alternatively, maybe it's the next rotational state. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state for both rotation and vibration. So the next possible state would involve a change in either rotation, vibration, or both. But the question says the photon is absorbed to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, I think the transition would be the smallest possible energy jump. That would be promoting the molecule from the vibrational ground state to the first excited vibrational state. Because the rotational transitions usually require lower energy changes than vibrational ones? Or wait, no. Vibrational transitions are usually higher energy than rotational. So maybe the next state is a change in rotation.

Wait, but the problem says the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model, which assumes the rotor isn't rigid. So perhaps the system is treated as a rigid rotor for rotation and a harmonic oscillator for vibration. But in the non-rigid case, maybe the bond length can change, affecting rotation.

Hmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the energy levels for rotation and vibration.

For rotation, the energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant, and J is the rotational quantum number. For a diatomic molecule, B is given by (ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia, I = μ r², and μ is the reduced mass.

For vibration, the energy levels are E_vib = (1/2) hν + hν v, where v is the vibrational quantum number. The ground state is v=0, first excited is v=1.

So the total energy of the molecule is E_total = E_rot + E_vib.

In the fundamental state, I guess both J and v are in their lowest states. So J=0 and v=0. The next possible state would be either J=1 (rotation) or v=1 (vibration), whichever requires the smallest energy change.

Wait, but what's the energy gap for each transition? The energy required for a rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 would be ΔE_rot = B [ (1)(2) - 0 ] = 2B.
