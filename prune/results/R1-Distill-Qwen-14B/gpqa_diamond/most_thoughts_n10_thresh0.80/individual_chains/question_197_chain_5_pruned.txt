Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product from the given options. The data provided includes IR and 1H NMR spectra.

First, I should probably analyze the spectral data to figure out what Compound X is. Once I know X, I can determine what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Oh wait, red phosphorus and HI... that usually leads me to think about a substitution reaction, maybe a hydrolysis or something involving elimination. Hmm, wait, red phosphorus is often used in the hydrolysis of alkyl halides, especially in the formation of alcohols or maybe elimination if conditions are right. Or wait, no—red phosphorus is used with HI in the hydroiodic acid cleavage, perhaps for elimination? Or wait, no, another possibility: maybe it's the hydrolysis of an ester or a nitrile? Alternatively, it's the cleavage of a carbon-halogen bond, like in a substitution.

Wait, no, wait. When an alkyl halide reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it's typically a substitution reaction. Red phosphorus and HI can also be involved in the formation of alkenes via elimination, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the compound is, say, an ester, reacting with HI might cause it to undergo some kind of cleavage.

But perhaps I should first figure out what Compound X is. Let's start by looking at the NMR and IR data.

The IR data shows strong peaks. Let me list them:

- 3400–2500 cm-1: This broad range suggests O-H stretching (like in an alcohol or carboxylic acid) or maybe N-H, but more likely O-H. The broadness suggests it's not an acid because the O-H in an acid is usually a broad peak around 2500-3300. Wait, but the range here is 3400–2500, which is a pretty wide area. So maybe it's an alcohol or possibly a carboxylic acid.

Then, 1720 cm-1: That's a strong peak, probably a carbonyl group. So maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid.

1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1: These are around the regions for aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound likely has an aromatic ring.

Putting that together, maybe a substituted benzene ring with a carbonyl group and an O-H group. Hmm, wait, but 1720 is more in line with an ester or a ketone, maybe. Or perhaps a carboxylic acid? Wait, the O-H in a carboxylic acid would be a very strong, broad peak around 2500-3300, but the 1720 would be the carbonyl. So maybe it's a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): This is probably an O-H
