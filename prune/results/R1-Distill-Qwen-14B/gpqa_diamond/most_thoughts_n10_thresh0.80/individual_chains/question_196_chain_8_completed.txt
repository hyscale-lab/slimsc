Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the maximum speed of a particle in such a system. 

So, the setup is a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. We need to find the maximum speed v_max. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, wait. Relativistic, so classical mechanics might not apply here. Oh right, in special relativity, the equations of motion change because of the speed of light limit. So maybe I should consider relativistic equations of motion for the oscillator.

In the classical (non-relativistic) harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed can be found using energy conservation. The potential energy at maximum displacement A is (1/2)kA². The total energy is all potential there, and at the equilibrium position (x=0), all of that converts to kinetic energy. So (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA². Solving for v_max gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. Since this problem is relativistic, I can't just use that.

Right, so relativistic effects must come into play. So, how does relativism change the equation? I remember that in relativity, momentum isn't just mv anymore. The energy-momentum relation is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². Also, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv², but involves relativistic terms.

So, let's think about energy conservation in the relativistic case. The oscillator's potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is relativistic. At the maximum amplitude A, the total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and potential energy. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

At the equilibrium point (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. So the total energy would be E = gamma * m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So setting these equal:

mc² + (1/2)kA² = gamma m c².

Let me rearrange that. The left side is the total energy, and the right is the relativistic kinetic plus rest energy. Wait, no, the total energy E is mc² plus kinetic energy, which is (gamma - 1)mc². So in that case, when x = 0, all energy is kinetic. So the total energy would be E = mc² + (1/2)kA² = gamma m c².

So, mc² + (1/2)kA² = gamma m c².

Divide both sides by m c²:

1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = gamma.

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, but gamma is also 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some term, say, alpha. So alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then,

1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) = 1 + alpha.

Let me square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Rearranging,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2].

So,

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 ]

Hmm, but I need to solve for v. Let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Let me expand (1 + alpha)^2: 1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2.

So 1/(1 + alpha)^2 = 1/(1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2).

So,

v² = c² [ ( (1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2 ) - 1 ) / (1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2) ) ]

Wait, that's maybe not the best approach. Let me compute 1 - 1/(1+a)^2:

1 - 1/(1+a)^2 = ( (1+a)^2 -1 ) / (1+a)^2 )

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2a + a² -1 ) = 2a + a².

So,

v² = c² [ (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2 ) ]

Factor numerator:

a (2 + a) / (1 + a)^2.

But a is alpha, which is (k A²)/(2 m c²). So substituting back:

v^2 = c^2 [ ( (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ( 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ) / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ) ]

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe it can be simplified.

Let me write it as:

v^2 = c^2 [ ( (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ( 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ) ] / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

Let me factor numerator and denominator.

The numerator inside the [] is:

(k A²)/(2 m c²) * [2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ] 

Denominator inside the [] is [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]^2.

Let me factor (k A²)/(2 m c²) as alpha. Then,

v^2 = c^2 [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

But 2 + alpha = 2 + alpha, and 1 + alpha is the denominator.

Wait, perhaps I can write this as:

alpha (2 + alpha) / (1 + alpha)^2 = [ alpha (1 + alpha + 1) ] / (1 + alpha)^2. Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express it as:

Let me write 2 + alpha = (1 + alpha) +1.

So,

alpha ( (1 + alpha) +1 ) = alpha (1 + alpha) + alpha.

So,

(alpha (1 + alpha) + alpha ) / (1 + alpha)^2 = [ alpha (1 + alpha) ]/(1 + alpha)^2 + alpha/(1 + alpha)^2.

Which simplifies to [ alpha/(1 + alpha) ) ] + [ alpha/(1 + alpha)^2 ].

Wait, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I should just compute it as is.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute everything in terms of a variable beta, say beta = (k A²)/(2 m c²). So a = beta.

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ beta (2 + beta) ] / (1 + beta)^2.

Let me compute the numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: beta(2 + beta) = 2 beta + beta^2.

Denominator: (1 + beta)^2 = 1 + 2 beta + beta^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 (2 beta + beta^2) / (1 + 2 beta + beta^2).

Perhaps factor beta^2 from numerator and denominator:

= c^2 [ beta^2 (2/beta + 1) ] / [ beta^2 (1/beta² + 2/beta +1) ) ]

Wait, that would complicate things more. Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps factor beta from numerator and denominator.

Wait, maybe it's better to express everything as (beta)/(1 + beta)^2 multiplied by (2 + beta). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the numerator as (2 + beta) = (1 + beta) + 1. So,

(2+beta) = (1 + beta) + 1.

So,

beta (2 + beta) = beta (1 + beta) + beta.

So,

[ beta (1 + beta ) + beta ] / (1 + beta)^2 = [ beta (1 + beta) ] / (1 + beta)^2 + beta / (1 + beta)^2.

Which is [ beta / (1 + beta) ) ] + [ beta / (1 + beta)^2 ].

Hmm, but perhaps that doesn't help much. Maybe I should just look at the options and see which one matches.

Looking at the options:

Option A: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2m)) )² )

Wait, let me compute the term inside the sqrt. Let's see:

1 + [1/(1 - x )² ] where x = (kA²)/(2m)

But in our expression, we have v^2 = c² [ (2a + a²) / (1+a)^2 ] where a = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, so:

v = c * sqrt( (2a + a²)/(1 + a)^2 )

= c * sqrt( a(2 + a) ) / (1 + a)

But I don't see any options matching this, so maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me think about the equation mc² + (1/2)kA² = gamma m c².

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

We found that gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

Gamma is also 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)).

So, 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c² )) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2)

Let me square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2)]²

Rearranged,

1 - v²/c² = 1/( [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2)]² )

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/( [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)]^2 )

Which gives,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/( [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)]^2 ) )

Hmm, let me see if this matches any of the options.

Looking at option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Wait, no. Option D is:

v_max = c sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + kA^2/(2 m c^2)) ]^2 )

Yes, that's exactly what I have. So option D.

But wait, let me check the options again.

Option D) v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 )

Yes, that's exactly the expression I derived.

So the correct answer is option D.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.

So, the steps were: Use energy conservation, E = mc² + (1/2)kA² equals gamma mc².

Then, solving for gamma, then express 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) equals (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )).

Squaring gives 1/(1 - v^2/c^2) = (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2.

Taking reciprocal,

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1/(1 - v^2/c^2) = (1 + beta)^2, where beta is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So, 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + beta )^2.

Hence,

v² = c^2 [1 - 1/(1 + beta )^2 ].

Which is what I have.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Which matches option D.

So the answer should be D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we use relativistic energy conservation. The total energy of the system is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement:

\[
E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

At the equilibrium position (\( x = 0 \)), all the energy is kinetic, and the total energy is given by the relativistic relation:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.
\]

Equating the two expressions for \( E \), we have:

\[
mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \gamma mc^2.
\]

Dividing through by \( mc^2 \), we get:

\[
1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \gamma.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we find:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( 1 - v^2/c^2 \):

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options are incorrect because they either use non-relativistic expressions (option C), include incorrect terms in the denominator (option A), or have an incorrect structure in the square root (option B).

**Answer: D**
