Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question gives a density matrix ρ which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. For a pure state, the density matrix would be a projector, like |ψ><ψ|. But here, it's a mixture of |0> and |1>, so it's a maximally mixed state for a qubit, I think.

Wait, wait. Maximally mixed state, right. So that's like a completely random state with equal probability for 0 and 1. I remember that in the Bloch sphere representation, the state of a qubit can be visualized as a vector in 3D space. For the density matrix ρ, the corresponding Bloch vector r has components (x, y, z).

The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So, when I expand it, I get ρ = (I + xσx + yσy + zσz)/2. 

Let me write that out. The Pauli matrices are σx = [[0, 1], [1, 0]], σy = [[0, -i], [i, 0]], and σz = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. 

So, for the given ρ, let's compute it. ρ is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Computing each term: |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So ρ = (I)/2.

Putting that into the general form: ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. But wait, since ρ is (I)/2, that means I = (I + r·σ), so r·σ must be zero. Because I = I + r·σ would imply r·σ = 0. 

Wait, no, let me correct that. If ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, and our ρ is I/2, then setting them equal: I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2. Multiply both sides by 2: I = I + r·σ. Subtract I from both sides: r·σ = 0. 

But since σ matrices are all traceless and have certain properties, the only way for their linear combination to be zero is if all the coefficients are zero. So r must be (0,0,0).

So the Bloch vector r is at the origin. That would correspond to the completely mixed state. 

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit, where the qubit has equal probability of being in state \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\). In the Bloch sphere representation, the state of a qubit can be visualized as a vector \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\) in 3D space. For a general qubit density matrix, the relationship between the density matrix and the Bloch vector is given by:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = x\sigma_x + y\sigma_y + z\sigma_z\).

For the given \(\rho\), it can be computed that:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right) = \frac{1}{2} I.
\]

This implies that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\), meaning the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) must be \((0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is located at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

From the options provided:

- **A)** \(r = (1, 1, 0)\): Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state, not a mixed state.
- **B)** \(r = (0, 0, 1)\): Incorrect, as this corresponds to a different mixed state.
- **C)** \(r = (0, 0, 0)\): Correct, as this corresponds to the completely mixed state.
- **D)** \(r = (1, 1, 1)\): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
