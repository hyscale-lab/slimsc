Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds: 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. The question is about finding the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Hmm, right. So the options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me break this down into two parts: relative velocity and total energy.

First, the relative velocity. Wait, I remember that when objects are moving at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract their velocities like you would in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)).

Wait wait, wait. Let me get this straight. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's perspective, what's the speed of B? Or wait, no. Wait, perhaps I should clarify which is which. Oh, the problem says "the relative speed and the total energy of the system." So the relative speed would be the speed of one as seen from the other. So if they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed is (v_A - v_B) divided by (1 - (v_A v_B)/(c²)).

Wait no, wait. Actually, it's the other way around. If you're in the rest frame of object A, and you want to find the speed of object B relative to you, then the formula is (v_B - v_A) / (1 - (v_A v_B)/(c²)). Wait because both are moving in the same direction. Oh wait, no, the formula is (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)), where v1 is the velocity of the frame you're in, and v2 is the velocity of the object in the original frame.

Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. Let me get this straight. Let me denote astronaut 1 as the one with mass 2m moving at 0.6c, and astronaut 2 as the one with 3m moving at 0.5c. So from the perspective of astronaut 1, what is the speed of astronaut 2?

Wait, since both are moving in the same direction, from astronaut 1's frame, astronaut 2 is moving slower. So the relative velocity would be (v2 - v1) / (1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)).

Wait, no. Wait, let's clarify the formula. The velocity of object 2 as seen from object 1's frame is (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Here, v1 is the velocity of the frame (astronaut 1's velocity in the lab frame) and v2 is the velocity of astronaut 2 in the lab frame.

So substituting the values:

v1 = 0.6c, v2 = 0.5c.

So (0.5c -
