Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. 

So, from what I remember, luminosity is the total energy a star emits per second. I think the formula for luminosity when considering blackbody radiation is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Oh wait, but wait, the problem says the stars radiate as black bodies, so that formula should apply.

The problem says Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2. Also, their masses are in the same ratio, but I'm not sure if mass directly affects luminosity here. Oh, wait, but I think mass can relate to other properties like temperature, but maybe in this problem it's not directly used except perhaps for radius. Wait, but the question gives the same ratio for mass, which might be a red herring. Maybe it's just there to set up for something else.

The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength emitted by a blackbody is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if their peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait. If both stars have the same peak wavelength, then they have the same temperature. So T1 = T2. That makes things easier.

Now, the radial velocities are given: Star_1 has 0 km/s, Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Oh right! Because if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, and if moving away, redshifted. But wait, how does that affect the peak wavelength?

Wait, the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. But wait, does that mean the observed λ_max is the same, or the intrinsic λ_max? I'm a bit confused here. Because if the star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, so the
