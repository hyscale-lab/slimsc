Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem states that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are usually involved in some kind of elimination reaction, maybe a dehydrohalogenation or something similar. Wait, but wait, I think red phosphorus is often used in the formation of ylides, like the Wittig reaction. Oh right! When you have an alkyl halide and treat it with a strong base like PPh3 (triphenylphosphine) and then something else, but wait, maybe in this case, red phosphorus and HI are used to form a ylide. Alternatively, I've heard that when you have an allylic halide, treatment with red phosphorus and HI can cause elimination to form an alkene. So perhaps the compound is an allylic bromide or chloride, and the reaction leads to the formation of a double bond.

But wait, let me think again. Another possibility is that this is a dehydrohalogenation, like an E2 mechanism. But the reagents here are red phosphorus and HI, which I think is a bit different. Oh, I think when you have an alkyl halide and you use red phosphorus (maybe as a reducing agent?), but wait, maybe it's more about generating a phosphorus ylide which can then react in a Wittig-like reaction. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation where the H and X (like I-) are removed, forming a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a benzyl-type compound. Let me look at the given data for Compound X.

The IR data shows peaks at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretching. But more likely O-H since NMR doesn't show anything about amines. The 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which I think is a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone, ester, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 suggest possible aromatic C=C stretching. So maybe the compound has a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which could be an -OH proton, perhaps from a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids usually have a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton is around 9-10, but usually a singlet. But here it's a broad peak, which fits more with a carboxylic acid.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical of a para-substituted benzene ring. Like two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which suggests a substituent in the para position causing the splitting. So it's something like a para-substituted benzene, maybe with a substituent that
