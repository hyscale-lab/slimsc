Okay, I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's about the Michael addition reaction, which I remember is a type of conjugate addition where a nucleophile attacks the beta carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The question gives three different reactions, and I need to determine the reactants and major products for each, then match them with the options provided.

Let's take it step by step.

The first reaction is dimethyl malonate reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). The product is labeled A.

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile. It's a diethyl ester of malonic acid, so it has two ester groups. The structure is O=C(CO2Et)2. So, when it acts as a nucleophile, it should attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of this is CH2=CH–COOCH3, but with the substituent on the alpha position? Wait, no. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the acrylate group as CH2=CH–COOCH3, but the p-tolyl group is at the 3-position. So, the structure is CH2–C(p-tolyl)=CH–COOCH3? Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2–CH–COOCH3, but with the p-tolyl group on the second carbon (the alpha carbon). So, it's CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH2COOCH3? No, wait. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-, so 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2–CH(p-tolyl)–COO–, but wait that's not possible because the numbering would be different.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the positions. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2–C(p-tolyl)=CHCOOR. Or wait, maybe it's CH2=CH–CO–O–CH3 with a p-tolyl group on the alpha carbon (the CH2=CH– part). Hmm, maybe I should draw it out mentally.

Wait, the correct structure for (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH–C(p-tolyl)–O–Me? No, that can’t be right. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the third carbon? But wait, that would be the carbonyl carbon. That doesn't make sense because substituents on the carbonyl would
