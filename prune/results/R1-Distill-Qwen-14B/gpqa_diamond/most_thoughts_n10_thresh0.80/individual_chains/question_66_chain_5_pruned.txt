Okay, so I have this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that the operators must respect. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that extends the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators, which are suppressed by some high energy scale, like the Planck scale or something.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these four.

Wait, I think Lorentz symmetry is definitely a big one. Because the Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so any effective theory built from it should also respect Lorentz symmetry. So the operators must be Lorentz scalars. That rules out some options, like if the answer doesn't include 1.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. But wait, isn't Poincare symmetry more about the overall symmetry of spacetime, including momentum conservation? Or maybe Poincare is a larger symmetry group that includes Lorentz and translations. So SMEFT operators, being part of a field theory, must respect local symmetries. Oh wait, but SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it's constructed in a way that respects the symmetries of the Standard Model. So if the SM respects Poincare, then SMEFT must too. Or wait, is that correct? Because Poincare includes Lorentz and translations, but in the SMEFT, the operators are written in a way that's invariant under the SM gauge group and Lorentz symmetry. So maybe Poincare is automatically respected because they're part of the field theory.

Wait, but I'm not too sure. Let me think again. The Poincare group includes Lorentz transformations, translations, and some boosts. So if the theory respects Lorentz and translation symmetries, then Poincare is okay. But does SMEFT require respecting translation symmetry? Because operators are local, so they should respect local symmetries, including translations. So if the operators are written as local operators, then translation symmetry is built in. So Poincare symmetry is already covered because Lorentz symmetry is, I think.

Wait, but here the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if all operators respect Lorentz symmetry, do they automatically respect Poincare? Since Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. I'm getting a
