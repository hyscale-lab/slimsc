Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out what compound E is. Let me go through the reaction steps and the hints one by one.

First, the reaction scheme:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form B.
2. B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
3. C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
4. D eliminates an inert gas to form E.

Hmm, and there are two hints provided. Let's look at them.

Hint a: When Compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, phosphorous ylides are typically used in the Wittig reaction, right? The Wittig reagent reacts with aldehydes or ketones to form alkenes. So, if A reacts with a Wittig reagent to give that compound, which has a cyclopentane ring with substituents, that suggests that A has a carbonyl group somewhere.

Looking at the product of the Wittig reaction: the structure is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The propan-2-ylidene group is a substituent on the cyclopentane. The Wittig reaction would form a double bond, so the propan-2-ylidene is the new substituent. So the starting carbonyl compound (A) must have a group that would form the cyclopentane ring when the Wittig occurs. Wait, no, the Wittig forms an alkene. So perhaps compound A is a cyclic ketone. Let me think: if A is a cyclopentanone derivative, then the Wittig would attack the carbonyl, forming a double bond adjacent to the ring.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The substituents at positions 1 and 2 are methyl groups, and the propan-2-ylidene is at position 4. The ylidene group is a CH2CH2CH2+ something? Wait, no, the propan-2-ylidene would be a CH2-C(CH3)= group attached to the ring. So in the Wittig reaction, the carbonyl group (from A) would have a substituent that, upon reaction, forms that structure.

Alternatively, maybe A is a cyclopentanone with substituents. Let me think: the product has a cyclopentane ring with substituents. So the Wittig would have to start from a carbonyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, perhaps A is cyclopentanone itself. Then, reacting with a Wittig reagent would form a cyclopentene. But the product given has substituents. Hmm, maybe A has substituents. Let me look at the substituents in A.

Wait, the product after the Wittig is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So, the cyclopentane has two methyl groups at
