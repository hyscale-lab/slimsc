Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? And resonance in this context probably refers to a short-lived particle. The question is asking about the mean decay distance of this meson X.

The given data is the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. Wait, units are a bit tricky here. I should make sure they are all in the same units before doing calculations. Let me think about the steps needed.

So, what's the mean decay distance? I think it's related to the lifetime of the particle. Because the decay distance is how far the particle travels before it decays. So, distance is velocity multiplied by lifetime.

But wait, how do I find the lifetime? Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is often used in particle physics for these kinds of calculations. The uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is about ħ. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ.

In this case, the width Γ is the uncertainty in energy. So Γ = ΔE. So, the lifetime τ (which is the mean lifetime) is approximately ħ divided by Γ. Because Γ is the total decay width, which is the uncertainty in energy.

Wait, but sometimes I see people using τ = ħ/(Γ). Yes, that's correct. So once I find τ, I can find the distance by multiplying by the velocity of the meson, v.

But wait, what's the velocity of the meson? Since it's produced at a certain energy, we can find its velocity from its energy and mass.

The energy of the particle is given by the relativistic formula E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So, I'll need to find the momentum p.

Let me write down the variables:

E_X = 8 GeV
m_X = 1.2 GeV
Γ_X = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV

First, calculate the momentum p. Let's rearrange the energy equation.

E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2
=> (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2
But wait, since E, m are in GeV and GeV/c², I need to handle units carefully. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to work in units where c=1, but I have to remember to include it when calculating physical quantities like distance.

Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the momentum using E and m in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, and then convert to SI units later.

Wait, another approach: in natural units (c=1, ħ=1), but we'll have to adjust when calculating real distances.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, calculate the momentum p:

p^2 c^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2

Wait, no, in the equation E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)², so if I solve for p:

p = sqrt( (E^2 - m² c^4) ) / c^2 ?

Wait, maybe better to write it as:

p = sqrt( (E² - (m c²)^2 ) ) / c² ?

Wait, let me think again. The equation is E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So, (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2.

Then, pc = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2).

Thus, p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / c.

But wait, E is given in GeV, m in GeV/c², so perhaps working in terms of GeV and GeV/c².

Alternatively, it's easier to compute in terms of units where c=1. So, in natural units, E, m, and p are all in GeV. E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV. Then, p = sqrt(E² - m²) = sqrt(8² -1.2²) = sqrt(64 -1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV/c.

Wait, but since in natural units, c=1, so p is in GeV/c. So p ≈7.91 GeV/c.

Now, to find the velocity v of the particle. The relation between momentum and velocity is p = γ m v, but perhaps using beta (β) which is v/c.

In natural units, p = γ m β. So, β = p / (γ m).

But we can also relate beta to the energy. Since E = γ m c², and in natural units, E = γ m.

So, β = p / (E). Or wait, let me think again. Because p = γ m v, and E = γ m c², so v = (p c² ) / E.

Wait, let's see: p = γ m v. So, v = p/(γ m).

But E = γ m c², so γ = E / (m c²).

Wait, but in natural units where c=1, E = γ m, and p = γ m β. So, β = p / E.

Wait, beta is v/c, so if I have E and p in GeV, then β = p/E.

So, with E=8 GeV, p=7.91 GeV/c, then beta = (7.91 GeV/c) / (8 GeV) ) = 0.98875.

So v = 0.98875 c.

So, that's approximately 0.9888 times the speed of light, which is about 2.96e8 m/s.

Wait, but more accurately, let's calculate it precisely.

First, compute p:

E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2

So,

pc = sqrt( (8 GeV)^2 - (1.2 GeV)^2 )

= sqrt(64 - 1.44) GeV²

= sqrt(62.56) GeV

≈7.91 GeV.

So, p = 7.91 GeV/c.

Then, beta is (p c) / E.

Wait, because beta = (pc) / (E), since E = gamma m c^2, and pc = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2 ), and p = gamma m beta c. So, (p c) = gamma m beta c².

But E = gamma m c², so (p c) = (E) * beta.

Thus, beta = (p c) / E.

Wait, but p is in GeV/c, and E is in GeV. So, (p c) would be GeV.

So, beta = (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) = 0.98875.

So, beta is approximately 0.98875, so v ≈ 0.98875 c, which is about 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s = 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, the lifetime tau is given by the uncertainty principle. Gamma is the width, which is the uncertainty in energy. So,

tau ≈ ħ / Gamma.

Wait, but what are the units here? Gamma is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So, Gamma = 0.32 GeV.

But ħ has units of GeV·s when working with GeV and seconds. Since ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s.

So, tau = ħ / Gamma = 6.582e-25 GeV s / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) e-25 s ≈ 20.56875e-25 s ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32
