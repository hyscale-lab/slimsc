Okay, so I've got this question here about planet transits and which one is more likely to transit, right? I'm a bit new to this, but let me think through what I know.

So the question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet 1 and Planet 2. Both have been detected using the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet 1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet 2's. Also, their orbits are circular. The host stars have the same radii but different masses. Planet 1's star is twice as massive as Planet 2's. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting, given their limited time.

Hmm, the probability of a transit depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital inclination. But wait, I remember the formula for the transit probability is (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by (a / (a * sin i)), but wait, I'm not getting that right. Oh wait, no, the probability is actually the ratio of the area of the planet to the star, which is (R_p / R_s)². But wait, another factor comes into play with the orbital distance. No, wait, maybe it's just that the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)² divided by something else... Or perhaps I'm mixing it up.

Wait, no. The transit probability isn't just (R_p/R_s)^2, because that's the area ratio. But actually, the transit probability is (R_p/R_s)^2 multiplied by the probability that the orbital plane is aligned such that the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view. And that probability is 1/(a) times something? No, wait, I think the transit probability is approximately (R_p/R_s)^2 divided by (something else). Or maybe it's (R_p/R_s)^2 multiplied by something else. Wait, I'm confused.

Wait, I think the transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is aligned such that it transits the star) is given by (R_* + R_p)^2 / (a^2) ) multiplied by some factor. Alternatively, I think the probability is (R_p / R_*)² multiplied by (1 / (e² + ...)) but wait, these are circular orbits, so e
