Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of interpreting spectroscopy data, but let's try to work through it step by step.

So, the question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Let's start by looking at the FTIR data. The problem says there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretches, like from alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad peak, but so do alcohols. Another thing, the peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, 1700 is a strong peak, which could be carbonyl groups like ketones, aldehydes, or maybe esters. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring (like C=C in conjugation). Or perhaps it's an amide, but I don't think that's likely here because the options don't include nitrogen.

Wait, the 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl. For example, in a ketone, the carbonyl is around 1700, but if it's conjugated, maybe it shifts a bit. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or something else. Alternatively, the 1650 could be an aromatic ring. But aromatic C=C is usually around 1600 cm⁻¹, so 1650 might be a bit higher, but that could be possible. Or maybe it's an amide, which has N-H stretches lower than 3000, but the broad peak is at 3000... not sure yet.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's on a C=C double bond. So that suggests the molecule has some double bonds, maybe like an alkene or possibly an aromatic ring. But wait, vinyl hydrogens in an aromatic ring (like benzene) would be different. But benzene's H's are usually around 7 ppm, and if it's a vinyl group, maybe around 5-6 ppm. But regardless, the presence suggests a double bond.

Now, the Mass Spec data: a fragment peak at m/z=45. So, what could that be? Common fragments include CH3CO (which is 43?), wait but 45 is something else. Maybe it's (CH3)2O, which is 45? Let's calculate:

Carbon is 12, H is 1, O is 16. So (CH3)2O is C2H6O. So molecular weight is (2*12) + (6*1) +16 = 24 +6 +16=46. Oh, wait, that's 46. Hmm, maybe another fragment. Or maybe it's (CH3)CO, which is 59? No, wait. Wait, another common fragment is the acetyl group. Wait, maybe it's a CH3 group attached to something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a COO- ion? Or perhaps a propyl group or something else.

Alternatively, the fragment at 45 could correspond to a ketene ion, but I'm not sure. Let me think: 45 is a common mass for a fragment like CH2CH2O? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, 45 could be (CH3)2O, but wait, that's 46. Hmm. Another possibility: maybe the fragment is HCOOCH3, but that would be a larger mass. Alternatively, perhaps a CH2=CH-O something. Or maybe the fragment is a methyl group with some charge. Hmm, I'm not getting that clearly. Maybe I should look for what gives m/z 45.

Wait, let's think about the possible formulas. The options are:

A) C6H12O2: molecular weight is (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16) =72+12+32=116.

B) C6H10O: (6*12)+(10)+(16)=72+10+16=98.

C) C6H10O2: 72+10+32=114.

D) C6H12O:72+12+16=100.

So the molecular ion would be around 116, 98, 114, or 100. But the fragment is 45, which is much less than the molecular weight.

Looking at the options, which have subunits that could produce a 45 mass. Let's consider each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. What's the degree of unsaturation? For C6H12O2, the formula is CnH2mOx. Degree of unsaturation is (2n +2 - m - x)/2. So n=6, m=12/(2)=6? Wait, the formula is C6H12O2. The general formula is CnH2n+2Ox. So for n=6, 2n+2=14, but here we have 12 H, which is 2 less than 14. So degree of unsaturation is (14 -12)/2 + (number of rings or double bonds from O). Wait, perhaps I should calculate it properly.

Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, so DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one ring or double bond.

But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so that suggests a double bond. So DoU of at least 1. So that fits. But the IR has a peak at 1700, which is another DoU. So a carbonyl group. So total DoU would be 2.

Wait, but in option A, the DoU is 1. Hmm, that might be a problem. Because we have a carbonyl and a double bond, that's two DoU. So the formula should have at least two DoU.

Wait, let me recalculate. For option A: C6H12O2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14 -12)/2=1. So one DoU. But if the compound has a carbonyl (DoU=1) and a double bond (another DoU), that would require a total of two, but the formula only accounts for one. So that's a conflict. Hmm, perhaps the carbonyl is part of an ester or ketone, which uses the DoU.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: each double bond or ring adds a DoU. So for example, an ester has a carbonyl (DoU=1) and an ether linkage (which doesn't add DoU). So if the compound has a carbonyl and a double bond, then DoU would be 2. So the formula must have DoU >=2.

So let's compute the DoU for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So only one DoU. So either a ring or a double bond. But the data suggests two DoU (carbonyl and double bond). So perhaps option A isn't correct.

Option B: C6H10O.

DoU: (2*6 +2 -10)/2=(14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. That fits. So maybe a molecule with a carbonyl and a double bond. Like a ketone with a double bond, or an ester with a double bond. Or a ring plus a double bond. But the data also has vinyl H, so a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2.

DoU: (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2=(14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. That's possible. So perhaps a carbonyl and a double bond.

Option D: C6H12O.

DoU: (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU. So either a ring or a double bond. But the data suggests two DoU, so probably not D.

So options B and C have DoU of 2, which fits the data. So A and D are less likely.

Now, looking back at the FTIR. Two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. So 1700 is probably a carbonyl, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or acid. The 1650 could be another carbonyl, but that seems unlikely unless conjugated. Alternatively, 1650 could be a conjugated C=C, like in an aromatic ring. But wait, in benzene, the C=C peak is usually around 1600 cm⁻¹, but maybe when conjugated with something else, it shifts higher.

Wait, if the compound is an aromatic ester, for example, like an aromatic ring with an ester group. But then the DoU would be 4 (benzene ring is three DoU, but wait, benzene has 3 double bonds, so it's 3 DoU. Hmm, but our options have DoU as two.

Wait, wait, perhaps the 1650 peak is a conjugated carbonyl. For example, if there's a ketone conjugated with an alkene, the carbonyl peak can shift down. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring, but then the DoU would require more than two.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl. For example, an α,β-unsaturated ketone would have a carbonyl peak at around 1700 and a conjugated double bond, which might have a peak at 1650. That makes sense. So if the compound has a ketone and a double bond conjugated to it, that could explain both peaks. So that would fit with a DoU of 2, which matches options B and C.

So, moving on to the NMR. The 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. So, an alkene or vinyl group is present. So maybe our compound has a conjugated system, like in an α,β-unsaturated ketone or ester.

Now, the Mass Spec. The fragment at m/z=45. Hmm, what gives 45? Let's think. 45 is the molecular weight of HCOOCH3 (which is 45? Wait, HCOOCH3 is methyl formate. Let me calculate: HCOOCH3 is (HCOO) which is 44 (H=1, C=12, O=16, another O=16: 1+12 +16 +16=45? Wait, no. Wait, HCOO- is (1 +12 +16 +16) = 45? No, 1 (H) +12 (C) + 32 (two O, each 16) = 45. So the molecular weight of HCOO- is 45 (formate ion), and CH3 would add another 15 (15? Wait, CH3 is 15: 12+3=15). So HCOOCH3 would be 45 +15=60. But the fragment is 45, so perhaps the formate ion is present. But why would that fragment form?

Alternatively, another possibility is the (CH3)2O fragment, but that's 46. Hmm. Another possibility is the (CH2)2O group, but that's 30. Alternatively, maybe a CH2CH2O group, but that's 30 again. Or maybe a CH2=CH-O group: CH2=CH-O would have a molecular weight of 45? Let's see: C=12*2=24, H=4, O=16. 24+4+16=44. Wait, 44. Hmm, not 45.

Wait, another idea: maybe the fragment is a ketene ion. A ketene is O=C=O, but I'm not sure about its mass. Alternatively, maybe a CH2O group, which is 30 (12+2+16=30). No, that's not it.

Wait, let's think about the molecular formulas again. The options are either C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O.

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (option C), then the molecular weight is 114. If a fragment is at 45, that leaves a remaining mass of 114-45=69. But 69 is not a standard mass, so maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment comes from losing a larger group. Let's think about the possible structures.

Wait, another approach: the fragment at 45 could be the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's 91. Hmm, not 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a CH3CO (propanoyl) group. CH3CO has a mass of 43 (12*2 + 3*1 + 16 = 24 +3 +16=43). But the mass is 45. So that's close but not exact. Alternatively, it could be a CH2CO group: 29 (12*2+3+16= 24+3+16=43). Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be (CH2)2O, which is 46. No, that's not 45. Or maybe a CH2=CH-O- group, but that would be 45 (12*2 +4 +16)= 24 +4 +16=44. Close, but not exactly 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketone group, like O=C-R, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is an ester with a vinyl group. Let's think about the structure.

If it's an ester, the general formula is R-O-CO-R'. Suppose R is a vinyl group. So the ester would be something like CH2=CH-O-CO-R. Then the mass spec might break off the ester group, producing something like the acetyl group (43) or another fragment.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment comes from the ester group breaking. For example, if the ester breaks into the R-O- and the R'CO part.

Wait, another thought: the fragment at 45 could be the molecular ion of a smaller molecule. Like maybe the ester is formed from a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. For example, if the ester is formed from a three-carbon acid and a three-carbon alcohol, the ester would have a molecular weight of (3*12 +6*1 +2*16)= 36+6+32=74. But that doesn't directly help with the 45 fragment.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule undergoes a McLafferty rearrangement, which is a common fragmentation in compounds with a carbonyl and an adjacent alkene. The McLafferty rearrangement forms a gamma,delta-unsaturated carbonyl compound, and the resulting fragments can include an acylium ion or something else. But I'm not exactly sure how that would result in m/z 45.

Wait, maybe the molecule is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Then, in the mass spec, the ring might break, releasing a fragment. For example, a six-membered ring lactone might break into a smaller fragment.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an aromatic ester. For example, methyl benzoate. Let's see: benzoate has a benzene ring, which is three DoU. But our options have only two DoU, so that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible structures each option could represent. Let's take each option and think about their possible structures.

Option B: C6H10O. Degrees of unsaturation is 2. So, possible structures could be a diene with a ketone, or a cyclic ether with a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation is 2. So perhaps an ester with a double bond, or a ketone with a double bond, or an aromatic ring with an oxygen-containing group but that would require more DoU.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible structures that fit the spectroscopic data.

The FTIR has a broad peak at 3000. That suggests O-H stretch. So the compound likely has an alcohol group or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a very broad peak around 2500-3300, but so do alcohols. However, in the IR, the broad peak could also be from an -OH in an ester (but esters' O-H is usually from an alcohol, but they are usually not very broad unless it's a free -OH, which esters don't have. So maybe it's an alcohol. But wait, if it's an ester or a ketone, then the broad peak might be from something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, but that doesn't explain the broad peak.

Wait, maybe the broad peak is from an -OH group, so the compound has an alcohol. So, the formula would have an -OH. So looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. Could be an diol, or an ester and an alcohol, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid (but then the formula would have only one O, but O2 suggests perhaps ester and something else.

Option B: C6H10O. Could be a diol, or an alcohol with a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. Could be an ester (R-O-CO-R') with a double bond.

Option D: C6H12O. An alcohol with a ring or a double bond.

But wait, the NMR shows vinyl H's, so a double bond is present. Let's consider an ester with a double bond.

So, if the compound is an ester (RCOOR'), and R or R' has a double bond. Then, the IR would show the ester carbonyl peak around 1700 cm⁻¹. The 1650 cm⁻¹ could be from the conjugated double bond. For example, an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure would be something like CH2=CHCOOR, which would have a conjugated double bond and an ester group. That would give the two IR peaks: 1700 for the ester carbonyl, and 1650 for the conjugated double bond.

In that case, the structure would have an ester group (so O2 in the formula), and a double bond. So the formula would have DoU of 2. Let me check which option that is.

Looking at the options, option C is C6H10O2. Let's compute its molecular formula.

C6H10O2: molecular weight is (6*12)=72, (10*1)=10, (2*16)=32. Total is 114.

If the structure is an α,β-unsaturated ester with a six-carbon chain, that would fit.

So, for example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, but that's five carbons in the ester. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe a cyclopentene ring with an ester group. But that's getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, the structure could be something like methyl vinyl ester. Wait, no, that's a different arrangement.

But let's think about the mass spec. The fragment at 45. If the structure is an α,β-unsaturated ester, perhaps the McLafferty rearrangement occurs. In McLafferty, a gamma hydrogen (relative to the carbonyl) is abstracted, forming a new double bond and releasing a molecule of hydrocarbon. For example, in an ester with a conjugated double bond, the rearrangement leads to a fragment that could be the acyl group plus some hydrogen shift. But I'm not exactly sure how that would produce a 45 fragment.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester group breaks. For example, in an ester RCOOR', the RCOO group could break off as a fragment. Let's see: RCOO would have a molecular weight of RCOO's weight. If R is a methyl group (COOCH3), that's 45? Wait, COOCH3 is 12 (C) + 16*2 (O) + 3 (CH3) = 12 +32 +3=47. Not 45.

Hmm, perhaps the fragment is the acetyl group, which is 43 (CH3CO). But the mass is 45, so close but not exact. Alternatively, the fragment could be something else.

Wait, another idea: the fragment at m/z=45 could be a (CH3)2O+ ion. Let's calculate that. (CH3)2O is (2*12) + (6*1) + 16=24 +6 +16=46. So that's 46, not 45. So that can't be it. Alternatively, maybe a CH2O group ( formaldehyde ), which is 30. Not 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a CH2=CH-O+ group. That's (12*2)+(4)+(16)=24+4+16=44. Close, but not 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a ketone. For example, if the molecule is a cyclic ketone with a vinyl group, perhaps the ring opens and a fragment breaks off. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: let's think about the possible structures for each option and see which ones can give a fragment of 45.

Option A: C6H12O2. Assuming it's an ester with a ring, like a cyclic ester (lactone). For example, a six-membered ring lactone. The molecular formula would be C6H10O2. Oh wait, that's option C. So option A is C6H12O2. That would imply a structure like a diol ester, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but let me think about the ester. For example, if it's methyl cyclopentene carboxylate. The structure would be O=C-OCH3 attached to a cyclopentene ring. But the molecular formula would be C7H10O2, which is bigger than our options.

Hmm, perhaps option C is the right one. Let's imagine the structure is an α,β-unsaturated ester. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3. But that's seven carbons. No, the formula is C6H10O2.

Wait, perhaps the structure is methyl acrylate. Acrylic acid's ester. Let's see: methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. Its formula is C4H6O2. But our options are C6H10O2. So perhaps a longer chain. Like, perhaps, butyl acrylate or something. Wait, but butyl acrylate would be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3, which is C7H10O2. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is an aromatic ester, but that would require more DoU.

Wait, maybe I should think about what the 45 fragment could be. Another possibility is that the fragment is a (CH2)2O group, which is 30. No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, a propyl group (39), but that's not 45.

Wait, another thought: maybe the fragment is a CH3COOH group. No, that's 60. Wait, methyl formate is HCOOCH3, which is 45+15=60. No, the molecular weight is 60. HCOO- is 45, so perhaps the fragment is the HCOO group.

So, if the compound is an ester where the acid part is formic acid (HCOO-), then the ester would be HCOOR. For example, HCOOCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 (hexyl formate). That would have the formula C7H14O2. But our options don't include that. Alternatively, perhaps the ester is a shorter chain.

Wait, but if the ester is ethyl formate (HCOOCH2CH3), the formula is C3H6O2, which is not matching any of the options except option C, which is C6H10O2. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the compound isn't an ester but a ketone with an adjacent double bond. So, for example, something like CH2=CHCOCH3 (methyl vinyl ketone). Its formula is C4H6O. But our options have more carbons.

Hmm, perhaps the compound is cyclohexene with a ketone group. But that would require more DoU.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a cyclic ether with a double bond and a carbonyl group, but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, think about the mass spec fragment. If the fragment is at 45, perhaps it's a (CH3)2O group, which is 46. But not 45. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2CH2O group (which is 30), but that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: the molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. The possible structure could be methyl cyclopentene carboxylate. So, the formula would be C6H10O2. If the ester breaks, perhaps the cyclopentene ring stays, and the ester part (COOCH3) breaks off. The COOCH3 group has a molecular weight of 45 +15=60? Wait, earlier I thought HCOOCH3 is 60. So perhaps the fragment is the COOCH3 part, which would be 60. But the mass is 45, so that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps the fragment is not from the ester part but from the vinyl group. If the molecule has a vinyl group, maybe the fragment is CH2=CH2 (ethylene), which is 28. No, that's not 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a CH2=CH-O group. Wait, that's 44. Still not 45.

Another angle: the IR peak at 1700 is strong, which suggests a carbonyl group, probably an ester or ketone. The 1650 peak could be a conjugated double bond. So the structure is likely an α,β-unsaturated ester.

In such structures, the ester carbonyl is conjugated with the double bond, leading to a shift in the carbonyl peak to around 1700, and the double bond's peak to around 1650.

Now, for the mass spec, the McLafferty rearrangement is common in such compounds. In the McLafferty rearrangement, a gamma hydrogen (two carbons away from the carbonyl) is abstracted, leading to the formation of a new double bond and releasing a small hydrocarbon as a fragment. The size of the fragment depends on where the rearrangement occurs.

If the structure is CH2=CHCOOR, the McLafferty rearrangement would form a new structure, possibly releasing a fragment like CH2=CH2 (ethylene, 28) or something else. But let's think: the McLafferty rearrangement in an α,β-unsaturated ester would break the ester into a ketene and an alkene. Wait, perhaps the fragment is the ketene (O=C=O), but that's 44 g/mol (16*2 +12=44). No, that's 44, not 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is the acylium ion (RCO+), which would have a mass equal to the acyl group. For example, if R is CH2=CH-, then RCO+ would be (12*2 + 4) +16= 28 +16=44. Hmm, not 45.

Wait, another approach: what if the fragment is a loss of a larger group. For example, if the ester group (O-CO-O-) breaks off, and the remaining part is a smaller molecule.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU is 2. So possible structures could be a cyclic ether with a double bond, or an ester with a ring. But without the O2, it's less likely to have an ester. Alternatively, a ketone with a double bond.

But the IR shows a broad peak, which suggests an -OH, so maybe it's a diol with a double bond. But then the IR would also have a peak for the carbonyl, which would require a DoU of 2. So that could fit.

But then, the mass spec fragment: if the structure is a diol with a double bond, maybe the fragment is a diol part. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if it's a cyclic ether with a double bond, like an epoxide, but epoxides are usually small rings and the DoU would be 3 (epoxide is a three-membered ether with a ring, which is a DoU of 1, plus the double bond for another DoU, so total 2).

But then, the FTIR would show peaks for the ether (but ether O-H is usually not that strong, unless it's an alcohol). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the FTIR broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is indicative of an -OH group, so the compound must have an alcohol. Then, looking at the options:

Option B: C6H10O → possible, like a diol with a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2 → more likely to have an ester group, but then where's the -OH? Unless it's an ester and an alcohol, but that would require more O's. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the broad peak comes from an alcohol. So the compound has an -OH group. Then, among the options, which have O in such a way that allows an -OH?

Options:

A) C6H12O2: could have two O-containing groups, like an ester and an alcohol.

B) C6H10O: an alcohol (one O), but then another DoU from a double bond.

C) C6H10O2: could have two O groups, like an ester and an alcohol, but that would require three O's, which isn't possible here. Wait, no, ester has two O's. So if it's an ester (two O's), then the compound can't have an -OH because that would require three O's. So perhaps the broad peak isn't from an -OH but from something else.

Wait, another possibility: the broad peak at 3000 could be from an N-H stretch, but the options don't include nitrogen. So that's out.

So, if the broad peak isn't an -OH, what else? Maybe it's an aromatic C-H stretch, but that's usually around 3000 cm⁻¹ but not that broad. Or an amine, but again, no N in options.

Wait, perhaps the peak is from an -O-H in a carboxylic acid. But then, the formula would need to have a COOH group. Let's see:

For a carboxylic acid, the formula would be RCOOH. So for a six-carbon acid, it would be C6H12O2. Wait, that's option A. Wait, but C6H12O2 has a DoU of 1. But a carboxylic acid has a carbonyl (DoU=1) and the rest would have to be a single bond. So the NMR would have peaks from the -COOH protons, but the question says the NMR has vinyl protons, which suggests a double bond. So that's conflicting.

So, perhaps the broad peak isn't from an -OH. Maybe it's from an amide, but that's not likely here.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from a conjugated diene. No, that's usually in the 1600s.

Wait, another thought: the broad peak at 3000 could be from an alkyne C-H stretch. But that's usually around 3300. Not sure.

Alternatively, the peak could be from an alcohol, but the formula needs to have an O. So, looking at the options:

Option B: C6H10O. It could be an alcohol with a double bond. So, say something like cyclohexene methanol. But the double bond would contribute to the DoU. So the structure would have an -OH and a double bond, giving two DoU, which matches.

In that case, the FTIR would show a broad peak for the -OH, a peak for the double bond (maybe around 1650), and the carbonyl peak at 1700 suggests a carbonyl group, which would require another DoU. But option B has only two DoU, so that's conflicting.

Wait, maybe the carbonyl isn't present. Then, why is there a peak at 1700? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak at 1700 is from an ester. So, the compound has an ester and a double bond, which would require two DoU. So that fits option C, which has C6H10O2.

But then, the broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ would have to be from something else. Maybe it's from an -O-H in an ester? No, because esters don't have free -OH groups. Wait, unless it's an alcohol and an ester. But that would require three O's, but option C has two O's. So that can't be.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to summarize:

- Broad peak at 3000: likely an -OH, but if it's an ester, then probably not. So perhaps the compound has an -OH group.

- Peaks at 1700 and 1650: carbonyl (likely ester or ketone) and conjugated double bond.

- NMR shows vinyl H: double bond present.

- Mass spec shows m/z=45: fragment could be an ester-related fragment.

So, putting this together, perhaps the structure is an ester with an adjacent double bond (α,β-unsaturated ester), which would have the conjugated carbonyl and double bond, explaining the IR peaks. The -OH in the structure is confusing me because the ester doesn't have an -OH, but the broad peak suggests an -OH. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the compound isn't an ester but a ketone with a conjugated double bond and an -OH group. So, for example, a dihydroxy ketone with a double bond. But that would require more O's.

Alternatively, perhaps the broad peak isn't from an -OH, but from something else. Maybe an alkyne C-H stretch. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the FTIR is misinterpreted, and the broad peak is from a different group. For example, maybe it's an amide, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the molecular formulas and see which could produce a fragment of 45.

Option C: C6H10O2. If the molecule is, say, an ester with a four-carbon acid and a two-carbon alcohol. For example, butyl propionate? No, that's longer. Or maybe methyl something. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, if the ester is a cyclic one, like a lactone. The lactone ring would have the ester functionality. If the ring breaks, perhaps a fragment of 45 is released. For example, a five-membered lactone would break into a three-carbon fragment. Wait, a five-membered lactone would have the structure O-CO-O in a ring. If the ring breaks, perhaps the fragment is the acyl part, which could be something like CH3COO- (which is 43), but that's 43, not 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a methyl group plus something else. But I'm not making progress here.

Wait, another thought: the molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. Possible structures include methyl cyclohex-2-ene carboxylate. The formula would be C7H10O2, which is not matching. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an aromatic ester, but that would require more DoU. So perhaps that's not the case.

Another angle: the 1H NMR has vinyl hydrogens. So, the molecule has a double bond. The IR has a carbonyl and a conjugated double bond. So, the structure is an α,β-unsaturated ester. So, the formula must be such that it has an ester group (O2) and a double bond (DoU=1), plus the conjugated double bond in the ester, but wait, that would make the DoU higher? No, because the conjugated double bond is part of the same system as the ester carbonyl. So, an α,β-unsaturated ester would have two DoU from the conjugated system (the ester's carbonyl is a double bond, and the adjacent alkene is another double bond. So that might require more DoU. Wait, no, an α,β-unsaturated ester has one DoU for the carbonyl and another for the double bond, but since they're conjugated, it's still two DoU. So that fits option C, which has two DoU.

So, if the structure is an α,β-unsaturated ester with the formula C6H10O2, then the IR peaks make sense: 1700 for the ester carbonyl, 1650 for the conjugated double bond.

The mass spec fragment at 45 could be from the ester group breaking off. For example, if the ester is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 (but that's seven carbons), but our formula is C6H10O2. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, that's C5H8O2, which isn't matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's methyl acrylate: CH2=CHCOOCH3. Formula is C4H6O2. Still not matching C6H10O2.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an ester with a six-membered ring. Like, for example, a cyclohexene ring with an ester substituent. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diester, but that would require more O's.

Another approach: the molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. The degrees of unsaturation is 2, so either two double bonds, two rings, or one of each.

If the structure is an ester with a double bond (so one ring or one double bond), but that would be two DoU. So that fits.

Now, considering the mass spec, if the ester group breaks off, what would be the fragment mass? Let's say the ester is RCOOR', and R' is something small, like methyl. Then, RCOOCH3 would have a molecular weight of RCOO + 45 (since CH3 is 15, but RCOO is RCOO's mass). Wait, RCOO has a mass of (12*(n) + 2*16 + any H's). For example, if R is CH2=CHCH2, then RCOO would be CH2=CHCH2COO, which is C5H8O2. The molecular weight would be (5*12) + (8*1) + (2*16) =60 +8 +32=100. So, RCOO would be 100, and R' is methyl (15). So the ester would be 100 +15=115. The molecular ion would be 115. Then, in the mass spec, losing the RCOO group (mass 100) would leave a fragment of 15, which is not 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester breaks into the R'COO group and the R part. If R' is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, then R'COO would be larger, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester breaks into the R group and the R'COO part. If R is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2CH3, then R is C5H10CH2=CH..., but this is getting too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is part of a larger molecule where the fragment comes from a different part.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the fragment at 45 is the methyl group attached to the oxygen in the ester. For example, in methyl formate (HCOOCH3), the CH3 group is 15, but that's not 45. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is the acylium ion (RCO+), which would have a mass of RCO's molecular weight.

If RCO is CH2=CHCO, then the mass is (12*3 +4 +16)=36+4+16=56. Not 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is the methylene group (CH2) with some charge. But CH2 would be 14, not 45.

Hmm, I'm stuck again. Let me try to think of which options could have a fragment at 45.

Option C: C6H10O2. Let's say the molecular formula is C6H10O2. If the molecular ion is 114, then a fragment of 45 would imply that the rest is 69. 69 is not a common mass, but perhaps it's a larger fragment.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester group is cleaved, releasing a fragment with a mass of 45. So, for example, the ester is RCOOR', and RCOO has a mass of 45. So RCOO would be 45. RCOO would be XCOO, where X is (45 - (12 +16*2)) =45 -44=1. So X=1. That would mean R is CH3. So RCOO would be CH3COO (45). So the ester would be CH3COO-R', where R' is C5H11. So the formula would be C7H14O2. But our option is C6H10O2, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps R' is C5H9, but that's getting too vague.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the fragment is the loss of a larger group. For example, if the molecule is an ester with a benzene ring, but that's not matching the options.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to make a decision based on the information I have.

FTIR suggests an -OH (broad peak), a carbonyl (1700), and a conjugated double bond (1650). NMR shows vinyl H's. Mass spec has a fragment at 45.

The -OH suggests an alcohol or carboxylic acid. But the options don't include a carboxylic acid (which would have O2 and a formula like C6H12O2 for a six-carbon acid). So option A is C6H12O2, but its DoU is 1, which doesn't fit the two DoU needed for the carbonyl and double bond.

Option C (C6H10O2) has DoU=2, which fits the two DoU needed. If the structure is an α,β-unsaturated ester, that would explain the IR peaks. The NMR would show vinyl H's. The mass spec fragment at 45 could be from the ester group breaking off, like the RCOO part. If RCOO is 45, then R would be CH3 (since CH3COO is 45 +15=60, but I'm getting confused here).

Alternatively, another possibility is that the fragment is a ketene ion (O=C=O), which is 44. Close but not 45.

Wait, another Idea: if the ester is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. That's butyl acrylate. Its molecular formula is C6H10O2. Let's calculate:

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. Breaking that down:

CH2=CHCOO has 4 carbons (CH2-CH-COO-), and CH2CH3 is two carbons. So total 6 carbons. Hydrogens: CH2=CHCOO- has 2 (CH2) + 2 (CH) + 2 (COO) = 6 H's. CH2CH3 has 5 H's (CH2CH3: 2 +3). Wait, no. Let's count more carefully.

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3:

CH2=CH- has 2+2=4 H's (CH2 and CH).

COO has two O's, but H's: COO- has no H's attached.

OCH2CH3: CH2 has 2 H's, CH3 has 3. So OCH2CH3 contributes 5 H's.

Wait, the complete structure:

CH2=CH-C(O)O-CH2CH3.

So, CH2=CH-: 4 H's (CH2 has 2, CH has 1, but wait, CH2=CH is CH2-CH2? No, CH2=CH is CH2=CH-.

So, CH2=CH is CH2=CH-: CH2 has 2 H's, CH has 1 H (since it's double bonded to C=O? Wait, no, the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3.

So the structure is:

CH2=CH-COO-CH2CH3.

Each CH2 has 2 H's, CH has 1 H (since it's double bonded to C=O? Wait, no, the double bond is between CH2 and CH. So:

The structure is CH2=CH-COOCH2CH3.

So, CH2=CH- group: CH2 has 2 H's, CH has 1 H (since double bond is between C1 and C2, so C2 is CH-.

COOCH2CH3: COO has no H's, and CH2CH3 has 5 H's (CH2 has 2, CH3 has 3).

Wait, let's count all H's:

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3:

CH2=CH-: 3 H's (CH2 has 2, CH has 1? No, CH2=CH- is CH2=CH-: CH2 has 2 H's, CH has 1 H (since it's double bonded to C=O? No, the double bond is between C1 and C2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it:

Structure: CH2=CH-C-O-O-CH2CH3.

So, the molecule is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3.

The hydrogen count:

CH2=CH-: CH2 has 2 H's, CH has 1 H (since it's double bonded to C). So 3 H's.

COO: no H's.

OCH2CH3: CH2 has 2 H's, CH3 has 3. So 5 H's.

Wait, but what about the carbonyl group? The COO doesn't have any H's attached.

So total H's: 3 (from CH2=CH) + 5 (from OCH2CH3) =8 H's. But the formula is C6H10O2. So 10 H's are expected. Hmm, that doesn't match. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting.

Wait, CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3:

Each CH2 group has 2 H's.

CH2=CH: CH2 has 2 H's, CH has 1 H (since it's double bonded, so only one H attached).

COO: no H's.

OCH2CH3: O connected to CH2CH3. CH2 has 2 H's, CH3 has 3. So 5 H's.

Wait, but the COO has two oxygen atoms, but where are the H's?

Wait, the structure is:

CH2=CH-C(=O)-O-CH2CH3.

So, the carbonyl group is C=O, so no H's attached to it. The ester oxygen is O- attached to CH2CH3.

So, the total H's:

CH2=CH-: CH2 has 2 H's, CH has 1 H → 3 H's.

C(=O): no H's.

OCH2CH3: CH2 has 2 H's, CH3 has 3 → 5 H's.

So total H's: 3 +5=8. But the formula is C6H10O2, which has 10 H's. So this structure doesn't fit. So perhaps the structure is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has more H's. Let me try another approach.

The molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. So, 6 carbons, 10 H's, 2 O's. So, the structure could be an ester with a longer chain.

For example, the ester could be pentyl propionate: CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, but that's more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an α,β-unsaturated ester with a longer chain.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options again.

Option C: C6H10O2.

The mass spec fragment is 45. Let's think about possible fragments.

If the ester group is cleaved, maybe the fragment is the acyl part. For example, the acyl group is RCOO-, which has a molecular weight of RCOO.

If RCOO is 45, then R is CH3 (since CH3COO is 45 +15=60, but that doesn't fit). Wait, CH3COO is (12 +16*2 +1*3)= 12+32+3=47. No, that's 47.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is (CH2)2O, which is 46. Not 45. Alternatively, maybe a CH2=CH-O group, which is 44. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketone group. For example, the ester breaks into a ketone and an alcohol. If the ketone is CH3CO, which has a mass of 43, that's close to 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a CH3COO group, which is 45 +15=60. But that's not matching.

Wait, another Idea: the fragment at 45 could be the loss of a propyl group (C3H7), which has a mass of 57. That's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps it's the loss of a methyl group (15), but that would leave a larger fragment.

I'm stuck on this. Let me try to make a decision based on the other clues.

The broad IR peak suggests an -OH. The other IR peaks suggest a conjugated carbonyl and double bond, which fits an α,β-unsaturated ester. The NMR shows vinyl H's, which fits. The mass spec's fragment I'm not entirely sure about, but if the ester is an α,β-unsaturated ester, the McLafferty rearrangement would produce a fragment. The McLafferty rearrangement typically produces a fragment that's the acyl group plus a hydrogen shift. For example, in ethyl acrylate (CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3), the McLafferty rearrangement would form a new double bond and release a small fragment.

The McLafferty rearrangement of an α,β-unsaturated ester would lead to the formation of a gamma,delta-unsaturated ketone, and the loss of an alkene. The fragment lost would be a small alkene, like ethylene (28), but that doesn't match the 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment comes from the cleavage of the ester group, producing a fragment like the acyl group. If the acyl group is, say, CH2=CHCOO-, that's 72 (CH2=CHCOO-) + 15 (CH3) = 87, but that's not matching.

Wait, maybe the fragment is the loss of the acyl group, leaving behind a smaller fragment. For example, if the acyl group is 45, the remaining would be 114-45=69. 69 isn't a common mass, but perhaps it's a larger fragment.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is the acyl group itself. If the acyl group is 45, then the ester would be 45 + (R' part). But I'm not making progress here.

Given all this, I think the most likely option is C) C6H10O2. It has two DoU, which fit the IR and NMR data. The fragment at 45 could be from the ester group breaking off, though I'm not entirely certain. The presence of vinyl H's in NMR supports a double bond, and the IR supports a conjugated ester.

So, the answer is C.


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options provided are:

- **A) C6H12O2**  
- **B) C6H10O**  
- **C) C6H10O2**  
- **D) C6H12O**

### Key Analysis:

1. **FTIR Data**:  
   - A broad absorption peak at **3000 cm⁻¹** suggests the presence of an -OH group.  
   - Peaks at **1700 cm⁻¹** and **1650 cm⁻¹** indicate a carbonyl group (likely an ester or ketone) and a conjugated double bond, respectively.

2. **1H NMR Data**:  
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens suggest the presence of a double bond.

3. **Mass Spectrometry Data**:  
   - A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** is observed. This could correspond to a fragment such as a formate ion (HCOO⁻, 45), though the exact origin of this fragment is unclear.

4. **Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU)**:  
   - **Option A (C6H12O2)**: DoU = 1. This does not match the data, as the IR and NMR suggest two degrees of unsaturation (carbonyl and double bond).  
   - **Option B (C6H10O)**: DoU = 2. This matches the data, but the presence of an -OH group and a carbonyl suggests a more likely structure with two oxygen atoms.  
   - **Option C (C6H10O2)**: DoU = 2. This fits the data, as it accounts for both the carbonyl and the double bond.  
   - **Option D (C6H12O)**: DoU = 1. This does not match the data, as it lacks sufficient unsaturation.

5. **Structural Considerations**:  
   - The broad IR peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ suggests an -OH group, but the absence of a strong O-H peak in the IR spectrum of an alcohol or carboxylic acid complicates this interpretation.  
   - The IR peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ suggest an α,β-unsaturated ester, which would explain the conjugated carbonyl and double bond.  
   - The 1H NMR data supports the presence of a vinyl group, consistent with an α,β-unsaturated ester.

6. **Mass Spectrometry Fragment at m/z = 45**:  
   - This fragment could correspond to the loss of a formate ion (HCOO⁻, 45) during fragmentation. However, the exact origin of this fragment is unclear, and it does not definitively rule out any options.

### Conclusion:  
Based on the FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data, **Option C (C6H10O2)** is the most consistent with the observed spectroscopic features. It accounts for the two degrees of unsaturation, the presence of a carbonyl and conjugated double bond, and the structural features inferred from the data.

**Answer: C**
