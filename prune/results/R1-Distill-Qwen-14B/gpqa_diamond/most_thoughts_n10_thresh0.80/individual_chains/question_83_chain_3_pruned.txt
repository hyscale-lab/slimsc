Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, okay. So, let me break this down. First, I think I need to find out what the concentration of the acetic acid solution is after dilution. Because when you mix two volumes, the concentration changes.

Wait, the initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we're adding 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³, right? So the new concentration would be calculated using the dilution formula C1V1 = C2V2.

So, C1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So C2 = (0.05 M * 20) / 40. Let's calculate that. 0.05 times 20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, wait a second. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so when we dilute it, it dissociates more, but the concentration here is what's important for the initial step. So the initial concentration after dilution is 0.025 M.

Then, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base. The titration reaction would be the neutralization of acetic acid with NaOH. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

So, for the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added would be equal to the moles of acetic acid present in the diluted solution.

Wait, let me calculate the moles of acetic acid initially. After dilution, the volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L) times 0.025 M. So moles = M * V = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol. So, the solution has 0.001 moles of acetic acid.

The NaOH is 0.1 M. So, at equivalence point, moles of NaOH added would be 0.001 mol. The volume of NaOH required would be moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. But I'm not sure if I need that volume right now.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid is converted into acetate ions (CH3COO^-). So the solution becomes a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base. So sodium acetate will hydrolyze in water to produce a basic solution.

Wait, but I'm not asked about the equivalence point first. The question is about pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

So, first part: pH at 25% titration. So, 25% of the NaOH needed has been added. Since the equivalence point requires 10 cm³ of NaOH (as I calculated earlier), 25% of that is 2.5 cm³.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The volume of NaOH needed for equivalence is 10 cm³. So 25% titration would mean 2.5 cm³ added. So, how many moles of NaOH is
