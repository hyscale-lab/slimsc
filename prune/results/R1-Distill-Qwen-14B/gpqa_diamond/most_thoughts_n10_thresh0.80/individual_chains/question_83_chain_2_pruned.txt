Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again. 

We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Hmm. So first, I think I should find the initial concentration after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes. Oh right, dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. 

So the initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40 cm³. The initial concentration is 0.05 M. So the new concentration (M2) would be (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let me calculate that. 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So diluted to 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, but acetic acid is a weak acid, so when I titrate it with NaOH, a strong base, it should form acetate ions. The reaction would be CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

Now, the equivalence point: I think that's when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let's check the moles in the diluted solution. Volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L), concentration 0.025 M. Moles = M * V = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol. So at equivalence, moles of NaOH needed would be 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. But wait, the question isn't about the volume needed for equivalence; it's about the pH at equivalence and at 25% titration.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution will be a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water, making the solution basic.

How do I find the pH? Well, I need to calculate the concentration of acetate ions first. At equivalence, all the initial acetic acid is converted to acetate. The total volume will be the initial solution plus the added NaOH. Wait, the initial solution is 40 cm³, and if we added 10 cm³ at equivalence, then total volume is 50 cm³. So the concentration of acetate is moles divided by total volume.

Moles of acetate: 0.001 mol. Volume: 50 cm³ = 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will react with water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. The Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw / Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5, so Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, that's a very small Kb, so the hydrolysis won't produce a lot of OH- ions. So the pH should be on the basic side but not extremely high. Let's set up the ICE table.

Initial concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let x be the amount that reacts. At equilibrium:

CH3COO^-: 0.02 - x
H2O: negligible
CH3COOH: x
OH^-: x

The expression is Kb = (x^2)/(0.02 - x). Since Kb is small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 → x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 → x² = (5.405e-10)(0.02) = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6 M. 

So [OH^-] is 3.29e-6. pOH is -log(3.29e-6). Let me calculate that. Log(3.29)=0.517, so pOH≈5.483. Then pH=14 -5.483=8.517. So around 8.52. Looking at the options, option A says 8.52 at equivalence. But wait, option D's equivalence pH is 6.92, which is much lower. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, sodium acetate is a salt from a weak acid and strong base. So the solution should be basic, not acidic. So pH should be around 8.5 as I calculated. But looking at the options, option A's equivalence pH is 8.52, and option D's is 6.92 which is acidic. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, maybe I messed up the Kb. Let me recalculate. Ka is 1.85e-5 → so Kb is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approx 5.405e-10? Let me compute 1e-14 / 1.85e-5. 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10. That's correct. So Kb is correct. So my earlier calculation seems right. So the pH should be around 8.52.

Wait, but wait another thing. At equivalence, the solution is sodium acetate, which is a basic solution. The pH should be around 8.5, which matches option A (8.52) and option D is 6.92, which is acidic. So perhaps the correct equivalence pH is 8.52.

Now, what about the pH at 25% titration? 25% of the equivalence point. So how much NaOH is added?

At equivalence, 10 cm³ of NaOH is needed. So 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So we've added 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH.

Let me find the moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.000
