Okay, so I need to find the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, the nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number A is 3 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 6. Oh, so it's Li-6.

So the nucleus in question is a Li-6 nucleus. The problem is asking for the total energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. I remember that in relativity, when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, their relativistic mass increases, which affects their energy.

The formula for the total energy E of a particle is given by E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is calculated using the formula 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So v here is 0.96c.

Let me calculate gamma first. Plugging in v = 0.96c, so v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that calculation. Let me compute it step by step. So 0.96 squared is 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784. Hmm, 0.28 squared is 0.0784 exactly, so sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 divided by 0.28, which is approximately 3.57142857. Let me note that as about 3.5714.

Now, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is m0 * c². But I don't have the exact mass of Li-6. Wait, the mass of a nucleus can be found using the atomic mass. Li has an atomic mass of about 7 (since Li-7 is more common), but wait, Li-6 is lighter. Let me think about the atomic mass.

Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). Because Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so 6 nucleons, each about 1 u. But the actual mass of a nucleus is a bit less due to binding energy, but maybe the problem assumes using the rest mass as m = 6 u. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the exact mass using the atomic mass data.

Wait, I recall that 1 atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. And the speed of light c is about
