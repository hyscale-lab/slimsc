Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reaction mechanisms, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question is about synthesizing a specific compound: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents from the given options.

Let me start by breaking down the target molecule. The name is a bit complex, but I think I can parse it. The main structure is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group (aldehyde) attached. Then, there's a substituent on the cyclohexane ring: a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, that would be a CH2 group attached to both a hydroxyl (OH) and a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, wait, the substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, it's CH2-OH and CH2-cyclohexyl attached to the same carbon? Or is it a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2-OH group, which is then attached to the cyclohexane ring? Hmm, maybe I should try drawing it.

The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring. On one carbon (let's say position 1), there's a carbonyl group (the aldehyde). On another carbon (maybe adjacent?), there's a CH2 group that's connected to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. So, the structure is like:

The main ring is cyclohexane. At position 1: aldehyde group (CHO). At position 2 (or another position) maybe: CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl). Hmm, but the numbering might not matter as much as the functional groups and how they're formed.

So, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (triple bond). So, it's cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached.

I need to get from ethynylcyclohexane to this substituted aldehyde. Let's think about the possible reactions.

First, the ethynyl group is a triple bond, which is a good site for adding functional groups. One common approach is to do a hydroboration or similar to add groups. Alternatively, perhaps some sort of oxidation or reduction.

Wait, but looking at the options, the first reagent in all options is NaNH2 and some chloride or alcohol. So, NaNH2 is a strong base. When alkyne is treated with NaNH2, it's typically for deprotonation to form an alkyne anion, which can then undergo alkylation or other reactions.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is not an alkyne with acidic protons. Wait, the ethynyl group is -C≡CH. The alpha protons (on the sp-hybridized carbon) are acidic. So, in a solution with a strong base like NaN
