Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When you titrate a weak acid with a strong base, you get a buffer solution until the equivalence point, and then a solution of the conjugate base beyond that.

The problem says: we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then titrate with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, so first, let's figure out the initial concentration after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³ and concentration 0.05 M. Then, adding 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40 cm³. The moles of acetic acid would be 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then, when diluted to 0.04 L, the new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh wait, yeah that makes sense because diluting to double the volume halves the concentration. So 0.05/2 is 0.025 M.

Next, we're titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. So, let's think about the equivalence point. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equals moles of acetic acid. The moles of acetic acid are 0.001 (from before). So how much NaOH is needed?

Moles NaOH = moles acetic acid = 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So, at equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. The solution is a solution of sodium acetate. Sodium acetate dissociates completely in water, giving Na+ and acetate ions. The acetate will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate can be found from Ka of acetic acid. Since Kw = Ka * Kb, so Kb = Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, wait, let me compute that. 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5 is approximately 5.405e-10, yes.

The concentration of acetate at equivalence point: the volume is the total of acid + NaOH up to equivalence. Wait, but wait, the initial volume was 4
