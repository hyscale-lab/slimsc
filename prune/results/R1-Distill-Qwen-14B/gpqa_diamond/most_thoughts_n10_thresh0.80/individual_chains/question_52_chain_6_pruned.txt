Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

Alright, the problem is about a star that has spots on its surface. Without spots, the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, but when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find by what factor the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the distribution of atoms between energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels based on temperature and the energy difference between them.

The Boltzmann factor is (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, the problem mentions the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2. Let me denote n1 as the number in level 1 and n2 in level 2. The ratio is n1/n2. According to the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k*T) ). Alternatively, it's (g1/g2) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). So if E2 > E1, then the exponential term decreases as T decreases.

But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower (5500 K instead of 6000 K). And the ratio n1/n2 decreases. That means n1/n2 is lower when T is lower. Let's think about that.

The transition wavelength is 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet range. I think that corresponds to the ionization or excitation of Ti. But since we're talking about neutral Ti, it's about excitation between two energy levels.

The energy difference between the two levels can be found using the wavelength of the transition. The energy E corresponds to photon energy, E = hc/λ. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = let's calculate that.

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.
Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = approximately 1.372e-18 J.

Hmm, but I need E in terms of temperature, perhaps in eV. Since k (Boltzmann constant) is 1.38e-23 J/K. Let me convert E to eV for easier calculation. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J.

So E in eV: 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.56 eV.

Wait, that's a big energy difference. But wait, maybe I should double-check the wavelength. 1448 Å is about 0.1448 nm. Wait, that's actually in the near-ultraviolet, not X-ray. So perhaps it's for an ionization or excitation line. Alternatively, maybe I should
