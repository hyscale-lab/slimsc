Okay, so I've got this crystallography problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, right, interplanar distance relates to the spacing between crystal planes, which is important in X-ray diffraction and such.

Alright, the given data is: interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. Wait, wait. Wait a second. In a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice is rhombohedral, which means all edges are equal, and all angles are the same. So the unit cell is a rhombohedron, with a = b = c and alpha = beta = gamma. So that simplifies things a bit because it's a special case.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, wait, interatomic distance in a crystal could refer to the distance between adjacent atoms in the lattice. But in a rhombohedral structure, the atoms are at the vertices of the unit cell. So in a primitive rhombohedral structure, each atom is at a corner of the rhombohedron, so the interatomic distance would be the edge length a. So I think that the edge length a is 10 Angstroms. So a = 10 A.

We need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by the reciprocal of the magnitude of the structure factor vector divided by the unit cell parameter. Wait, the formula I remember is d_hkl = a/(sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ )) ), but wait, wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) * (1/a²) * (1 - 2 cos α * cos β * cos γ + cos² α + cos² β + cos² γ) )) ), but that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should recall that for a rhombohedral system, especially when a = b = c, the formula simplifies.

Wait, no, another approach: the general formula
