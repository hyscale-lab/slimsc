Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's see if I can work through this step by step.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. The speed of light is c.

Wait, right. In a regular, non-relativistic harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is given by v_max = sqrt(kA/m). But this is a relativistic case, so things are different because of special relativity. The relativistic effects come into play when speeds approach c.

So in the non-relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². But when speeds get significant compared to c, we need to use the relativistic expressions for energy.

Relativistic energy has two main forms: the total energy E is gamma times mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). And the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc².

In a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is shared between kinetic and potential. At maximum displacement (x = A), all energy is potential. At equilibrium (x=0), all is kinetic. But in relativistic cases, the potential energy isn't just (1/2)kA² anymore. Wait, actually, does the potential energy change in relativity? I think the potential is still (1/2)kx² because that's a result of the force law, F = -kx. So the potential is conservative and V(x) = ½kx², same as before.

So the total energy E = V(A) = ½kA². But wait, wait. No, because in relativity, the total energy includes rest mass energy. Wait, no: in the harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy. So when x = A, the kinetic energy is zero, and the potential is ½kA². So E = ½kA².

But wait, in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². So when the oscillator is at x=0, all energy is kinetic. So E = (gamma_max - 1)mc². But E is also ½kA², so:

½kA² = (gamma_max - 1) mc².

So gamma_max = 1 + (½ k A²) / (mc²).

Wait, let me write that:

gamma = 1 + ( (k A²) / (2 m c²) )

Because ½kA² is (kA²)/(2m) * m? Not sure, let me recheck.

Wait, E is the total energy, which in this case is the potential energy at maximum displacement, which is V = ½ k A². This E must equal the kinetic energy at x=0, which is (gamma -1) mc².

So, ½ k A² = (gamma - 1) mc².

So gamma = 1 + ( (k A²) )/(2 m c² )

Hmm. But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). We can solve for v_max.

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c² ) as a term for simplicity. Let's call that term 'a' for a moment.

So gamma = 1 + a.

So gamma = 1 + a → 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + a.

Wait, square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + a)^2

So 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + a)^2

So v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2

So v_max^2 = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2 ]

Let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2. It's equal to [ (1 + a)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a)^2.

Expanding (1 + a)^2: 1 + 2a + a².

So numerator is (1 + 2a + a² - 1) = 2a + a².

So v_max^2 = c² (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2.

Wait, but a is (k A²)/(2 m c²), which is probably small if k A is not too large. But let's see if we can write it in terms of a.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to just substitute a back in.

So a = (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

So let's plug that into the expression for v_max.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write the expression in terms of gamma.

Wait, let's think about the expression for v_max.

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2)) )

Because from gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so 1 - v²/c² = 1/gamma² → v² = c² (1 - 1/gamma²) → v = c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma² )

So, gamma is 1 + a, so 1/gamma is 1/(1 + a).

So v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + a)^2 )

Hmm, let me compute that.

Wait, but I have 1 - 1/(1+a)^2 inside the square root.

Alternatively, is there another way to express this? Let's see.

Wait, 1 - 1/(1+a)^2 = [ (1 + a)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a)^2.

Which is (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2.

So v_max = c * sqrt( (2a + a²) ) / (1 + a)

But a is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm, but perhaps I can factor this expression. Let me compute 2a + a².

a² = (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

2a = (k A²)/(m c²).

So 2a + a² = (k A²)/(m c²) [ 2/(k A²/(2 m c²)) ) + 1 ]

Wait, maybe not. Let me try to factor.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to plug
