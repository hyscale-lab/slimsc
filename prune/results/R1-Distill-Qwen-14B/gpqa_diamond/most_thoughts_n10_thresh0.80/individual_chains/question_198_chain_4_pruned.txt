Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts yet. But I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, okay. So first, I remember that stability constants (formation constants) indicate how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form. Each β corresponds to a different complex. I think βn is for the complex with n SCN- ions attached.

Wait, the complexes are probably [Co(SCN)]^n−. So for β1, that would be [CoSCN]^+, β2 is [Co(SCN)₂]^3−, β3 is [Co(SCN)₃]^5−, and β4 is [Co(SCN)₄]^6−. But wait, I'm not exactly sure about the charges. Co²+ with four SCN- would have a charge of 2+ +4*(-1) = -2, so [Co(SCN)₄]^2−. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the charges wrong, but maybe the actual charges don't matter for this problem. Let me think.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think dithiocyanato would be the one with two SCN- ions. So that's the β2 complex, which has a β of 40.

The problem is to find the percentage of this [Co(SCN)₂] species among all the Co species. So I need to calculate the fraction of Co²+ that is in the form of [Co(SCN)₂]^something.

Wait, but the solution has a fixed [SCN-] concentration. Let me think about the equilibria involved. The formation of each complex is a stepwise process. The formation constants are given, so the overall formation constant for each complex can be calculated.

But wait, the β values given are for each step. So β1 is for the first association: Co²+ + SCN- ↔ [CoSCN]+ with β1=9. Then β2 is the second association, so [CoSCN]+ + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)₂]³−, with β2=40. Similarly, β3 is the third step, and β4 is the fourth.

Alternatively, sometimes β is given as the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands. I think in this problem, βn is the overall constant for the complex with n ligands. Wait, because for β1, if it's the first association, then the overall might be different. But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the stability constant, β, for a complex is the equilibrium constant
