Okay, so I've got this question about angular momentum operators and eigenvalues. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says that the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator A is represented by a 2x2 matrix Ay. The matrix is given as c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0 -i), and the second row is (i 0). So, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Wait, let me write down the matrix S first. So S is:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And c is h/(4π), so Ay = c * S. So substituting c, the matrix Ay is:

[ 0    -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))  0 ]

Hmm, okay. Now, to find the eigenvalues of Ay, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

So let's set up the matrix (Ay - a I):

[ -a       (-i h/(4π)) ]
[ (i h/(4π))  -a ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - ( (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) )
Which is a² - [ ( (-i)(i) ) * (h²/(16 π²)) ) ]

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i²) = -(-1) = 1. So the term becomes 1 * (h²/(16 π²)).

So the determinant equation is a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0. Therefore, a² = h²/(16 π²), so a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, that's interesting. So the eigenvalues are plus and minus h/(4π). Wait, but looking at the options, option A says the eigenvalues have real parts ± h/(4π) and imaginary parts ±2π h? No, that doesn't make sense because if the eigenvalues are real, their imaginary parts would be zero. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because S, the matrix, is a Hermitian matrix? Or maybe it's anti-Hermitian?

Wait, S is given as:

Row 1: 0, -i

Row 2: i, 0.

Wait, the conjugate transpose of S would be:

Row 1: 0, i

Row 2: -i, 0.

Which is not the same as S, so S is not Hermitian. Hmm. Oh wait, but in angular momentum operators, I think the components are Hermitian, so maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, no, maybe S is defined as an anti-Hermitian matrix. Because sometimes the angular momentum matrices have an i in them. Alternatively, perhaps the matrix S is actually (i times something). Let me think again.

Wait, the standard Pauli matrices are:
