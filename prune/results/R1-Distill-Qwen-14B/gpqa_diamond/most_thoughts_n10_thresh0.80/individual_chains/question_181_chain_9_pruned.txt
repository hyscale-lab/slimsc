Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and how the flux changes when a certain reaction stops. Hmm, let me think about what I know so far.

The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh, right, that's the approximate light travel time from the Sun's core to Earth. So if something stops in the core, it takes about 8.5 minutes for the effects to reach us. But in this scenario, the change has already happened, so we're seeing the consequences now.

The neutrinos produced by the Sun are mainly from the proton-proton chain, I remember. The pp-III branch is one part of that chain. So if pp-III stops, what neutrinos are affected?

I think the pp-III branch produces high-energy neutrinos, maybe the highest energy ones. Because in the Sun's core, the dominant process is the proton-proton chain. The pp-I branch produces lower energy neutrinos, and the pp-II and pp-III produce higher ones. Oh wait, the pp-III branch is the dominant source of high-energy neutrinos. So when it stops, those high-energy neutrinos should decrease in flux.

The question is about the ratio of flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So band 1 is lower energy than band 2.

If the pp-III branch was stopped, how does that affect neutrinos in each band? Well, the pp-III branch is a main source of the higher-energy neutrinos. So if it stops, the flux in higher energy bands (like band 2) would drop, but maybe the lower bands (like band 1) are less affected because they might come from other processes.

Wait, but wait. The pp-III branch produces neutrinos with higher energies than the other branches. So band 2 (800-900 keV) would primarily come from pp-III. If pp-III stops, the flux in band 2 would drop a lot. Band 1, which is 700-800 keV, might get some neutrinos from other sources, maybe the pp-I or pp-II branches, which are still active. So the flux in band 1 wouldn't drop as much as band 2.

So the ratio is band1_flux / band2_flux. Before the pp-III stopped, both bands would have some flux, but band 2 would have more from pp-III. After pp-III stops, band 2's flux drops, so the ratio would increase or decrease?

Wait, let's think again. Before stopping, band1 and band2 might have some flux. If the pp-III is the main contributor to band2, then if pp-III stops, band2's flux would be much lower, while band1's flux remains roughly the same. So the ratio would go up.

But wait, what's the typical flux from each process? I'm a bit hazy on the exact neutrino energies. Let me recall. The Sun's main neutrino sources are the pp-1, pp-2, and pp-3 branches. The pp-1 produces lower energy neutrinos, like around 400 keV, I think. pp-2 and pp-3 produce higher energies. Oh wait, maybe the pp-3 is the highest, in the MeV range? Or maybe around 1-2 MeV? Hmm, not exactly sure, but the bands here are 700-800 and 800-900, so in the hundreds of keV to just under a MeV.

Wait, I think the main pp-III branch produces neutrinos around 1.4 MeV. So 700-800 is lower than that, perhaps in the range of pp-II or other processes. Or maybe some of the neutrinos from other reactions contribute to the lower bands.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III neutrinos are around 1.4 MeV, so in the 800-900 keV band, they're lower than that but perhaps not. Wait, 1.4 MeV is 1400 keV. So 800-900 keV is below that.

Hmm, maybe this is a bit more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are at higher energies than the pp-II, so if pp-III stops, the higher band (800-900) would have a lower flux compared to the 700-800 keV band.

Wait, but in the absence of pp-III, the only neutrinos would be from the other branches. Let me think about the expected distribution. Suppose that the majority of high-energy neutrinos come from pp-III. So without them, the flux in the higher band (band 2) would drop significantly, while the lower band (band 1) remains similar.

So the ratio band1/band2 would go up. Because if band2's flux drops, with band1 staying about the same, the ratio increases.

But by how much? The options are 10, 0.01, 1, 0.1.

If the pp-III neutrinos make up, say, 90% of the flux in band2, but maybe 10% in band1. Then if pp-III stops, band2 would have 90% less, so (assuming band1's flux remains same), the ratio would become (10%)/(90%) = 0.111, which is about 0.1. Wait, no. Wait, let me model this.

Assume that originally, band1 has some flux from other sources, and band2 has a lot from pp-III.

Suppose in band2, 90% comes from pp-III, and 10% from other sources. In band1, say, 50% comes from pp-III, and 50% from others. So when pp-III stops, band2's flux drops by 90%, so 10% remains. Band1's flux drops by 50%, so 50% remains.

Then the ratio would be (0.5 * original band1) / (0.1 * original band2) = (0.5 / 0.1) * (band1 / band2 original ratio). But wait, this is getting complicated.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as the pp-III contributes a certain fraction to each band. Let's say, band2 (800-900 keV) is dominated by pp-III, so without it, that band's flux drops.

Assuming that the pp-III neutrinos are all in band2 and none in band1 (which is probably not true, but let's make an approximation), then when pp-III stops, band2's flux drops to zero, while band1's flux remains the same. So band1_flux / band2_flux would be band1_flux / 0, which is undefined. But that's not feasible. So perhaps some of the neutrinos in band2 come from pp-III, and the rest from other branches.

Wait, maybe another approach. The pp-III branch produces neutrinos at higher energies than the other branches. So the majority of the higher band (band2) comes from pp-III. So when the pp-III stops, band2's flux drops to a small fraction of its original value. Band1's flux is only slightly affected because it's from lower-energy neutrinos, which are mostly from other sources.

So if band2 was, say, 90% from pp-III, and band1 was 10% from pp-III, then after stopping, band2's flux is 10% of original and band1's is 90% of original.

So the ratio would be (90% band1) / (10% band2) = 9 times original ratio.

Wait, but the original ratio would be (band1)/(band2) = (say) [10% from others + 10% from pp-III] / [90% from others + 90% from pp-III]. Hmm, maybe that's complicating it.

Alternatively, if the majority of band2 comes from pp-III, which stops. So band2's flux drops, band1's doesn't as much. So the ratio becomes higher.

If originally, band1 was, say, 100 units, and band2 was 100 units. But actually, band2 is much higher. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe I should think about the Sun's neutrino spectrum. The dominant neutrinos from the Sun come from the pp-1, pp-2, and pp-3 branches, each producing different energy neutrinos. The pp-1 produces lower energy (like ~400 keV), pp-2 produces higher (like ~1-2 MeV?), and pp-3 produces even higher (maybe around 1.4 MeV? Or is that the Beryllium neutrinos? Wait, the Be-7 neutrinos are around 0.8 MeV, are they part of the pp-III
