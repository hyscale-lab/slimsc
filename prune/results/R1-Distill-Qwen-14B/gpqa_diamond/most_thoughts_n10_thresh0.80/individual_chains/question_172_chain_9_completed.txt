Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. Two stars, star_1 and star_2. The iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, and the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The question is about finding the correct equation relating their effective temperatures T1 and T2, assuming LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium).

Right, so I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles in energy levels is described by the Boltzmann distribution. The equation is something like the ratio of populations in two states being proportional to the Boltzmann factor. So the formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference is given as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. So for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or another lower state) is determined by this equation. The population ratio between the two stars is given as n1/n2 = 2, since star_1 has twice as excited as star_2. Or wait, wait. The question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So the excitation level is higher in star_1. So n1/n2 = 2.

Assuming that the statistical weights (g) are the same for both stars since they're the same element (iron) and same energy levels, the ratio n1/n2 would be exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ) = exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ). Because when you divide the two Boltzmann factors, you subtract the exponents.

So setting this equal to 2, because n1 is twice n2, we have:

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2.

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

Wait, but wait: the ratio is n1/n2 = 2. So n1 = 2 n2. So the ratio [n1/(n2)] = 2. So according to the equation I wrote, it's exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ) = 2.

Taking ln on both sides:

(ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

Wait, let's arrange that. I can write this as (ΔE/k) ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )) ) = ln(2).

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So substituting that:

(ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

But wait, the question gives us the energy difference and the options don't involve ΔE or k. The options are equations between T1 and T2. So perhaps the equation simplifies to something involving T1 and T2 without the constants.

Wait, but in the options, the right-hand side is ln(2), and the left side is some function of T1 and T2. So from the equation I have:

(ΔE/(k)) ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2).

But the options don't include any terms with ΔE or k. So perhaps the question is simplifying it, perhaps assuming that the ratio (ΔE/(k)) is 1? Or maybe ΔE is known in terms of k*T, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. Hmm, 1.38 is close to Boltzmann's constant, which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So wait, k = 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE is exactly k times some value. Let me check: ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. So k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * 1 K. Because 1 K multiplied by k gives 1.38e-23 J.

So substituting ΔE = k * 1 K.

So then, (ΔE/k) = 1. So the equation becomes (1) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Which simplifies to (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see:

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Which is exactly what I have. So the equation matches option D.

So the correct equation is option D.


To determine the correct equation relating the effective temperatures of the two stars, we use the Boltzmann distribution under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann distribution states that the ratio of populations in two energy levels is proportional to the Boltzmann factor:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(n_i\) and \(n_j\) are the populations of the two energy levels, \(g_i\) and \(g_j\) are their statistical weights, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

For the two stars, the ratio of the populations of the excited state to the ground state is given as \(n_1 / n_2 = 2\), where \(n_1\) and \(n_2\) are the populations for star_1 and star_2, respectively. Assuming the statistical weights \(g_i\) and \(g_j\) are the same for both stars, the ratio simplifies to:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Substituting \(n_1 / n_2 = 2\), we get:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}\right).
\]

The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is given as \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), which is equal to \(k \cdot 1 \, \text{K}\) since \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\). Thus, \(\Delta E / k = 1\), and the equation simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
