Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a muon's operator along an arbitrary direction. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the operator given is P with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the spin operator for a spin-1/2 particle (like a muon) is usually represented by these Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. So, that makes sense.

The problem asks for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Wait, an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane—so the direction vector n has components (nx, 0, nz), right? Because it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero.

The general form of a spin operator along an arbitrary direction is P = (P_x nx + P_y ny + P_z nz). Since ny is zero here, we'll have P = nx P_x + nz P_z.

But I'm supposed to find the eigenvector for the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Wait, but for the spin operator, the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2. So, the operator we're considering is along direction n, and we're looking for the +ħ/2 eigenvalue.

So, first, I think I should express the operator P along n. Let me write that out.

P = nx P_x + nz P_z.

Given that P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], and P_z is (ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]]. So substituting:

P = (ħ/2) * [ nx * [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ].

Let me compute that matrix. Let's factor out (ħ/2):

P = (ħ/2) * [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ].

Because when you multiply the matrices, the (1,1) element is nz*1 + nx*0 = nz. (1,2) is nx*1 + nz*0 = nx. Similarly, (2,1) is nx*1 + nz*0 = nx, and (2,2) is 0*1 + (-nz)*1 = -nz. So the matrix becomes [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]] multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, but the eigenvector equation is P |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, no, actually, the eigenvalue is the eigenvalue, so more accurately, P |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, no, wait. The operator P is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]], right? So the eigenvalue equation is (P) |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The matrix for the operator P is (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrix [[nz, nx], [nx, -
