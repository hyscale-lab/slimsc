Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is asking which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—those are infinities that pop up in calculations which aren't physically meaningful. So the idea is that different theories might handle these divergences differently.

Wait, but wait. Which theories actually require regularization? I think that in quantum field theories, like QED and QCD, divergences are a common issue. So they often need regularization techniques like dimensional regularization or cutoff methods. But what about theories that are 'renormalizable'? I think renormalizable theories can handle these divergences by absorbing them into physical parameters, but they still need regularization as part of the process.

So, for each option: D is Classical Electrodynamics. Oh, right, classical theories don't have these divergences in the same way because they aren't quantized. Wait, but wait—classical theories can have infinities too, like the self-energy of a charge. But in reality, when you quantize them, you get into more trouble. But the question is about whether the theory requires regularization. Since regularization is a quantum field theory tool, maybe classical theories don't need it. So classical electrodynamics might not require regularization because it's not a quantum theory, so the infinities are handled differently or not at all in the same sense.

So, the other options: A is Superstring Theory. I'm a bit fuzzy on string theory. String theories are supposed to be background-independent and perhaps free from some divergences because they're higher-dimensional or something. Or do they still require regularization? I think string theories might have their own ways of handling things, like through the use of conformal field theories or other mechanisms, but I'm not entirely sure if they require regularization in the same way as QFTs. Alternatively, maybe because they are a form of quantum gravity, they might not have the same high-energy divergences that other QFTs do.

B is Quantum Chromodynamics. QCD is a quantum field theory, so it must deal with divergences. So it would require regularization. Same with C, Quantum Electrodynamics. QED is a renormalizable theory, so it uses regularization as part of the renormalization process.

So the question is which theory never requires regularization. So if I think about it, only a theory that doesn't have these divergences would never need regularization. So classical theories don't deal with these quantum divergences. So option D, Classical Electrodynamics, never needs regularization because it's not a quantum theory. But wait, wait—wait a second. The question is about high energies. Do classical theories have problems at high energies? Or does regularization come into play because of the quantum effects at high energies?

Wait, another angle: Regularization is a method used in quantum theories to deal with divergent integrals. So if a theory doesn't involve these divergent integrals, then it wouldn't need regularization. But in quantum theories, you get these divergences, hence regularization. So the only theory
