Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully and try to figure out what's going on.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH to form product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to form product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum.

Hmm. Let me break it down step by step.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the structure. When you treat a dibromide with KOH, especially in a dehydrohalogenation reaction, it usually forms an alkene via an E2 mechanism. Since there are two bromine atoms, it's likely a vicinal dihalide. Heating with KOH would eliminate HBr twice, forming a diene? Or maybe a mono-elimination?

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane... Wait, the structure of adamantane is a diamond-like structure, so the positions 1 and 3 are across the structure. So when KOH is used, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation. For vicinal dihalides, two elimination steps would form an alkene. But wait, with two bromides, perhaps one elimination gives a bromide leaving, but the other could too. Alternatively, maybe each Br leaves, but I'm not sure. Wait, in the first step, KOH is in excess, so it's likely an E2 elimination for each Br, leading to a diene? Or maybe a single elimination for each Br, but since there are two, perhaps a conjugated diene is formed.

Wait, but wait. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH. Since KOH is a strong base, it'll abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the elimination of Br- and forming a double bond. Since the starting material has two bromines, perhaps each Br can undergo elimination. But since it's 1,3-dibromo, the positions are such that elimination from each Br would lead to adjacent double bonds? Hmm, that might not be possible. Alternatively, maybe each Br is on adjacent carbons, so elimination would form a single double bond. Wait, but if it's 1,3, perhaps they are not adjacent. Wait, adamantane's structure is a bit complicated. Let me think. Adamantane has a structure like four cyclohexane rings connected. The 1 and 3 positions would be on adjacent carbons, perhaps. So, for 1,3-dibromo, when KOH is added, perhaps each Br leaves, but that's not possible in one step. Wait, no, each elimination would require a base abstracting a β-hydrogen. So maybe the first elimination forms a double bond between C1 and C2, and then the second elimination could form another double bond, but where?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diene, but I'm not sure. Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. KOH is a base, so likely an elimination. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would undergo two eliminations, each removing one Br and forming a double bond. So maybe it forms 1,3-diene? Wait, that's not possible because double bonds can't be too close. Or perhaps each Br is on the same face, leading to a conjugated diene.

Wait, but the IR spectrum of product 1 shows a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Hmm, wait, that's unexpected because elimination would form a double bond (C=C), which has a different IR peak, around 1650 cm-1 or so. So a carbonyl suggests maybe a ketone or ester or something else.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again. The product after KOH treatment is product 1. If the IR shows 1720, that suggests a carbonyl group. So perhaps the reaction isn't an elimination but something else. Wait, KOH could cause a substitution. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a vicinal dihalide, so perhaps it's a substitution reaction, but KOH is a base; more likely elimination. But if substitution occurs, perhaps they form a diol? Or maybe a gem-diol.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility is that the two bromide groups are on the same carbon, which would make it a geminal dihalide, but the name is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so they are on adjacent carbons (vicinal). So, if it's vicinal, KOH would cause elimination, forming a double bond. But that would not produce a carbonyl. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl. How? Wait, maybe an oxidation? But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, perhaps a Hofmann elimination, but that would form an amine, which doesn't fit the IR data. Hmm. Alternatively, could it be a benzil-type elimination where two adjacent dihalides form a carbonyl group? Oh, wait! There's a reaction where vicinal dihalides can undergo dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. Let me think: when a vicinal dihalide is treated with a strong base like KOH, it can form a ketone if the two adjacent carbons each have a leaving group (like Br) and a hydrogen. So, the base abstracts a β H, leading to the formation of a double bond, but if the structure allows for a carbonyl, that might happen. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Baeyer-Villiger type elimination, but that's usually for ketones and forms ketones, not the starting point.

Wait, maybe it's a case of the Vicarious Nucleophilic Substitution (VNS), but I think that’s more for aromatic systems. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination to form a carbonyl. For instance, if two adjacent dihalides lose two HBr molecules, forming a carbonyl group. Let me imagine the structure: if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, each having a hydrogen, then elimination of two HBr would form a C=O group. For example, if the structure is CH2Br-CBrH-..., eliminating two HBr would form O=C-.

So, product 1 would be adamantanone, a ketone. That would explain the IR peak at 1720 cm-1, which is typical for a ketone. So, product 1 is 1,3-adamantanedione? Or just a single ketone group? Wait, no, because 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Brs on adjacent carbons. So, eliminating two HBr would form a double bond between those carbons, but wait, that would be a double bond, not a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the initial structure is such that the two Brs are on the same carbon, but that's geminal. The name 1,3-dibromoadamantane suggests they're on different carbons. So maybe the reaction is not elimination but a substitution. But with KOH as a base, substitution is less likely unless perhaps it's a SN2 mechanism. But for a vicinal dihalide, SN2 is possible on each Br, but that would give a diol if both are substituted. Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid, and the IR suggests a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction isn't elimination but something else. Wait, another thought: heating with KOH could cause the formation of a peroxide if the starting material is a dihalide, but I don't think that's the case here. Alternatively, if it's a vicinal dihalide, perhaps under basic conditions, it forms a carbonyl via a Baeyer-Villiger-like cleavage. Wait, not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl. Wait, but I'm not recalling such a specific reaction. Maybe I should think about the product. The NMR of product 1 has peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Let me interpret that.

The 4.79 ppm peak is likely a methylene group (2H) near an oxygen, perhaps an ether or a carbonyl. Wait, 4.79 is a bit upfield for an ether CH2. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone with adjacent CH2 groups. Wait, but what's the structure?

Alternatively, let's think about the coupling. 4.79 (2H), perhaps as a singlet. Or maybe split into something else. Wait, but the 1.94 (2H) could be a methylene group attached to something, perhaps an oxygen or a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diketone. But wait, the IR would show two carbonyl peaks, but the question says a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm-1, implying perhaps a single carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclic ketone. Adamantane is a polycyclic structure, so the product could be a ketone within that structure.

Wait, perhaps the product is 1,3-diketone, but that would have two carbonyls. The IR would show two peaks, but the question says a 'characteristic absorbance' at 1720, which might just be one peak.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a mono-ketone. So, let's imagine that the initial 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon treatment with KOH, undergoes elimination of two HBr molecules to form a single ketone group. So, the two adjacent Br atoms are each eliminated with H, forming a C=O group. That would make the product a ketone.

If that's the case, then product 1 is a ketone, say, 1-adamantanone. Then the structure would have a carbonyl group.

Now, moving to the NMR data of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). Let me think about the possible assignments.

In adamantanone, the structure has a bridgehead. The carbonyl is at a bridgehead, so the adjacent carbons would have hydrogen(s) that are deshielded. But wait, in the NMR, the 4.79 ppm is a singlet (2H), maybe a CH2 next to the carbonyl. The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be another CH2 group, perhaps further away from the carbonyl.

But the 10H between 2.41 and 2.23 ppm suggests a set of equivalent protons, perhaps in a bridge structure. Maybe each bridge has some equivalent protons.

Wait, but in adamantane, the structure is such that each bridge has equivalent protons. So, the NMR would show signals for the equivalent protons. So, perhaps the 10H is a set of equivalent protons in the adamantane framework.

But I'm not entirely sure about the exact structure, but let's proceed.

Next step: product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. Since product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an acylium ion? Or maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation of another arene, but I don't have any aromatic rings in product 1. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diol. Because KOH could cause a substitution. Wait, but earlier I thought elimination was more likely. Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide. Wait, but the IR suggested a carbonyl, not an epoxide.

Wait, maybe I was wrong about the first step. Let's reevaluate. When 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps it's a double elimination leading to a conjugated diene, but then how does that explain the IR carbonyl peak?

Wait, unless the diene undergoes some kind of oxidation. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step forms an epoxide. But to form an epoxide from a dihalide, you need an oxidizing agent like a peracid, which isn't present here. So that's probably not it.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the KOH is causing a substitution reaction, such as a Williamson ether synthesis. But that would require an alkoxide and an alkyl halide. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromides, so maybe it's a vicinal dihalide, which could form an epoxide under certain conditions. But again, without an oxidizing agent, that's unlikely.

I'm stuck on the first step. Maybe I should move to the second step and see if that can give me a clue.

Product 1 is reacted with aluminum isopropoxide. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of acid-catalyzed reaction. For example, maybe it's forming an acylium ion, but I'm not seeing the purpose. Alternatively, maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but then product 2 would have an aromatic ring attached, but I don't know if product 1 has any aromatic rings.

Wait, product 1 is 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH. Maybe the product is a diol? If KOH caused substitution, each Br would be replaced by OH. So product 1 would be 1,3-diol. Then, when treated with a Lewis acid like Al(i-Pr)3, perhaps it undergoes an acid-catalyzed elimination, forming a carbonyl group. So, 1,3-diols can form a ketone via pinacol rearrangement. Wait, the pinacol rearrangement requires a 1,2-diol, but product 1 would be 1,3-diol. Hmm, that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol undergoes some kind of elimination to form a ketone. So, product 2 would be a ketone again. But from the step, product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide to form product 2. Maybe product 2 is an enol ether or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a vicinal diol, and in the presence of a Lewis acid, undergoes an elimination to form a carbonyl. Wait, if product 1 is a diol, perhaps it's a 1,3-diol. Then, under acid conditions, could it lose water to form a carbonyl group? But 1,3 diols losing two water molecules would form a triple bond, which isn't a ketone. So that doesn't fit with the IR data.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should think about the overall process. The first step forms product 1, which has a carbonyl. Then, product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Then, product 2 is ozonolysed to form product 3.

Wait, ozonolysis is used to cleave double bonds. So product 2 must have a double bond. Ozonolysis of a double bond would break it into fragments. So perhaps product 2 is an alkene.

But wait, if product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 is formed by doing something to that ketone. Alternatively, if product 1 is a diol, then product 2 is an alkene. Let me think: product 1 is a diol, then product 2 is an alkene formed via elimination. Then, ozonolysis would cleave that double bond into carbonyl groups.

Wait, let's go back. Let me try to reevaluate.

1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH. Perhaps each Br is eliminated with a hydrogen, forming a double bond. So product 1 would be a diene. But the IR shows a carbonyl. That doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: maybe each Br is replaced by an OH group, forming a diol. Then, when treated with a Lewis acid, it undergoes elimination, forming a double bond. So product 2 would have a double bond. Then, ozonolysis would break the double bond into carbonyl groups.

But let's think about the IR of product 1. If product 1 is a diol, the IR would show O-H stretches around 3200-3600 cm-1, but the question says the characteristic peak is at 1720 cm-1. So that's more like a carbonyl, not an O-H.

So perhaps my initial assumption about the first step is incorrect. Maybe I should look for another possibility.

Wait, another reaction with KOH: perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, each Br could be replaced by an O- group, leading to a diepoxide? No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH group, but then the IR would show O-H, which it doesn't.

Wait, maybe it's an elimination-addition reaction. So, perhaps each Br is eliminated, but forms a carbonyl group. So, the product is a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by treating this ketone with Al isopropoxide, which might facilitate some kind of enol formation or alkylation.

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 could be an enol ether or an acetal. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an acid chloride, but that would require a different reagent.

Alternatively, perhaps the treatment with Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst for some kind of Friedel-Crafts-like reaction. But without an aromatic ring, I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the NMR of product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange.

Looking at the options, the coupling patterns are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

So, the most deshielded proton in product 3 would likely be adjacent to multiple other protons, leading to a complex splitting pattern.

But to get that, I need to figure out what product 3 is.

Product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2, followed by workup with dimethylsulfide. Ozonolysis tends to cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 is an alkene, product 3 would have carbonyl groups at the break points.

So, let's imagine product 2 is an alkene, and product 3 is the ozonolysis product, which would be carbonyl compounds.

Now, the NMR of product 3 would show the carbonyl groups and any adjacent protons.

But what would the coupling pattern be like?

Suppose product 2 is a symmetric diene. Then, ozonolysis would form two ketones (or other carbonyl groups) that are symmetrical, leading to equivalent protons in product 3.

Alternatively, if product 2 is a monoene, ozonolysis would give two carbonyl groups connected by a chain.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a bridgehead diene in the adamantane structure. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups, possibly ketones.

But how would that affect the NMR?

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 has a structure where a CH2 group is adjacent to two carbonyl groups, leading to a triplet, or a more complex pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded proton is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, which is split by neighboring groups.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to outline the steps again.

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid, IR 1720 cm-1).

Product 1 likely has a carbonyl group. So, perhaps it's a ketone.

2. Product 1 + Al(i-Pr)3 → product 2.

Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is a enol ether or an acylium ion. Alternatively, maybe product 2 is an enolate or some other structure.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps product 1 is a diketone or a cyclic ketone. Then, product 2 could be an α,β-unsaturated ketone formed via an elimination reaction catalyzed by the Lewis acid.

But why would a ketone undergo elimination? Maybe if there's a β-hydrogen available, it could lose a water molecule under acid catalysis to form an enone.

Wait, so if product 1 is a diol (from substitution), and then treated with acid, it could eliminate water to form an alkene. But earlier I thought product 1 isn't a diol because the IR showed a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe I should think that product 1 is a diol, and upon treatment with Al(i-Pr)3, it loses two water molecules to form a triple bond, but that's less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a carbonyl, and product 2 is an enol ether formed via some mechanism. I'm not very clear on this step.

Let me think about the ozonolysis step. Product 2 is ozonolyzed to give product 3. Ozonolysis usually cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must contain a double bond.

So, if product 2 has a double bond, let's think about how it was formed from product 1.

Product 1 is a carbonyl, so product 2 must be an alkene derived from that carbonyl. For example, via a retro-aldol or some kind of elimination.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or an enone.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an enone (α,β-unsaturated ketone), formed by eliminating a water from product 1 under acid conditions.

If product 2 is an enone, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond, but wait, ozonolysis of an enone would yield different products. Alternatively, perhaps the enone is in a ring structure, and ozonolysis would break it into smaller fragments.

But I'm not making progress. Let me try to think about the possible structures.

Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on positions 1 and 3. When KOH is added, perhaps each Br is eliminated, leading to a double bond between C1 and C2, and another between C3 and C4? But that would create a conjugated diene. The IR would then show C=C peaks, not a carbonyl. So that can't be.

Wait, but perhaps the elimination leads to a single double bond, and the IR would show C=C. But the IR says 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl. So that suggests that product 1 is a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't an elimination but an oxidation. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the bromides are in positions that, upon elimination, form a carbonyl. For example, if they are on adjacent carbons each bearing a hydrogen, elimination would form a carbonyl group.

Wait, but wait, elimination of two HBr from adjacent carbons would lead to a double bond, not a carbonyl. Unless it's a peroxide, but no peroxide is mentioned.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of double elimination leading to a ketone. Let's imagine the structure: if both Br are on adjacent carbons, each with a hydrogen, then elimination of HBr from each would form a carbonyl group. So, for example, if the structure is CH2Br-CBrH-..., eliminating both HBr would form O=C-.

But how is that possible? That would require each CH2Br to lose H and Br, leading to a carbonyl. So product 1 would be a ketone, with the carbonyl at the bridgehead.

If that's the case, product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by treating with Al(i-Pr)3. How?

Aluminum isopropoxide is often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts reactions. But if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of alkylation or acylation.

Wait, another possibility: the ketone could undergo a Claisen-Schmidt condensation under acid catalysis to form an enone. So, product 2 would be an α,β-unsaturated ketone.

So, product 2 is an enone. Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

When you ozonolyse an enone, you typically break the double bond and form carbonyl groups. For example, if the enone is R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R', ozonolysis would break the double bond and form two carbonyls.

But in this case, product 2 is a bridgehead enone. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond, leading to two carbonyl groups attached to the adamantane structure.

Wait, but how does that affect the NMR of product 3?

Product 3 would have carbonyl groups, perhaps ketones, attached to the adamantane structure. The most deshielded hydrogen would be adjacent to these carbonyls.

In the NMR, the most deshielded proton would likely be a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. The coupling would depend on the neighboring protons.

Suppose the structure after ozonolysis is such that a CH2 group is next to two carbonyl groups. Then, each H on that CH2 would have neighboring Hs on adjacent carbons.

Wait, for example, if the structure is:

O=C-R-CH2-CO-O...

No, that's not likely. Alternatively, if the ozonolysis breaks a double bond into two carbonyls, perhaps each adjacent to a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps after ozonolysis and workup, product 3 has a structure where a CH2 group is between two carbonyls. So the CH2 would be next to two carbonyl groups.

In that case, each H on the CH2 would be next to protons on adjacent carbons. Suppose each CH2 is adjacent to two CH groups, each with two protons. Then, each H on the CH2 would be split by neighboring Hs.

Wait, but how many neighboring Hs would that be? Let me think of a specific example.

Imagine the structure after ozonolysis is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O...

No, but that's not correct. Ozonolysis of an enone would typically form two carbonyl groups, each attached to the adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps the enone in product 2 is part of a five-membered ring. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups, each connected to the same two carbons. So, perhaps the structure becomes a diketone.

But I'm not entirely sure about the exact structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the enone is part of the adamantane structure. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls, each attached to adjacent carbons in the adamantane.

The resulting product 3 would have two ketone groups where the double bond was.

So, the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would be the one adjacent to the carbonyl groups.

In the NMR, for each CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, the protons would be deshielded and would split based on neighboring protons.

If the CH2 is between two carbonyls, each proton on the CH2 would see protons on each adjacent carbon.

Wait, suppose the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-O... No, that can't be right. Alternatively, it's O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O... but that's not likely.

Wait, perhaps it's O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, but that would imply a four-carbon chain, which isn't in line with adamantane.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is between two carbonyls, such as O=C-CH2-CO.

In that structure, the CH2 would have each H adjacent to the carbonyl, and perhaps each H would also be adjacent to any Hs on the carbons next to the CH2.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 is part of a bridge in the adamantane structure. The CH2 would be adjacent to two carbonyl groups, and each H on the CH2 would have neighboring Hs on either side.

But the exact coupling pattern depends on the number of neighboring Hs and their splitting.

If the CH2 is next to two sets of Hs, each with two Hs, the coupling would result in a triplet of triplets or a more complex pattern.

Alternatively, each H on the CH2 is split by two neighboring Hs on each adjacent carbon. For example, if each adjacent carbon has a CH2 group, then each H on the central CH2 would be split by two Hs on each side. So, each H would be a doublet of doublets, but perhaps under some conditions, it could be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but in the options, there's a triplet of triplets (option B), a doublet of triplets (option C), a triplet (A), and a pentet (D).

Let's think: if a proton is adjacent to two different sets of neighboring Hs, each with two Hs, then the splitting would be a triplet for each, and the combination would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the proton is next to two Hs on one side and two on the other, but in a way that the splitting is more complex.

Wait, for example, if a CH2 group is between two CH2 groups, each on either side, each with two Hs. Then, each H on the central CH2 would be split by two Hs on each adjacent CH2. So, each H would have a coupling with two Hs on each side.

The splitting would be a doublet (from one neighbor) multiplied by another doublet (from the other neighbor), resulting in a doublet of doublets. But if each coupling is from two different sources, perhaps it's a triplet of triplets.

Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to model it. Let's imagine a structure where we have a central CH2 group (H a and H b) between two CH2 groups on either side (each with two Hs: H1, H2 on the left; H3, H4 on the right).

Each H on the central CH2 would be coupled with all the Hs on adjacent carbons. So, H a would be coupled with H1 and H2 (left) and H3 and H4 (right). But wait, in reality, each H would only be coupled with the adjacent Hs on the neighboring CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps each H on the central CH2 is adjacent to two Hs on each neighboring CH2. So, each H is split by two Hs on the left and two on the right. But in reality, the coupling would be with the neighboring Hs on the adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps the splitting is a result of coupling to two sets of protons, each with two equivalent Hs. Each set would cause a triplet, and the combination would be a triplet of triplets.

So, the most deshielded H (on the central CH2) would be split by two neighboring Hs on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, if each H is coupled with two Hs on one side and two on the other, it might lead to a quartet, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, another approach: in the ozonolysis product, perhaps the double bond is in a position that, upon cleavage, leaves a CH2 group between two carbonyl groups. Each CH2 proton would be adjacent to two carbonyl groups, and perhaps each is split by two neighboring Hs on each side.

Wait, but if the CH2 is at the end of a chain, next to a carbonyl and another CH2 group, then each H on that CH2 would see two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So, each H would be a triplet (coupled with two Hs), but that would be a triplet.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is between two CH groups, each with two Hs, then each H on the central CH2 would be split by two Hs on each side. So, the splitting would be a doublet of doublets, but that's not an option. Alternatively, if each adjacent group has two Hs, the splitting would be a triplet for each, so a triplet of triplets.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused, but looking at the options, the possible correct answer is a triplet of triplets (option B) or a pentet (D).

Wait, another possibility: the most deshielded H is on a CH group adjacent to two CH2 groups, each with two Hs. So, each H on the CH group would be split by four Hs (two on each adjacent CH2), leading to a quintet (pentet). So option D is a pentet.

But how would that happen? If the H is adjacent to two CH2 groups, each with two Hs, then each H would have coupling with four Hs. But in reality, each H on the CH would couple with each H on the adjacent CH2 groups. So, each H would be split into a quintet (n+1, where n=4). So, n=4 would give a quintet.

But wait, in reality, a CH group adjacent to two CH2 groups would have each H coupled with the four Hs (two on each CH2), but this is a coupling via multiple bonds or through space? Wait, coupling occurs through bonds, so each H is only coupled with Hs on adjacent carbons, not across the molecule.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the CH group is next to two CH2 groups, each with two Hs. For example:

R-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CO-R'

Wait, no, that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R'. Then, the central CH2-CH2 would have each CH2 next to a CO group. In that case, each H on the central CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the CH2 on either side. So, each H would be split by two Hs on each side, leading to a triplet from each coupling. So, a triplet of triplets.

But wait, let me think again: each H on the first CH2 is next to two Hs on the same CH2 and two on the next CH2. No, that's not possible because the same CH2's Hs are equivalent.

Wait, in a CH2 group, the two Hs are equivalent, so each H is only coupled with the Hs on the adjacent group.

So, for a CH2 group between two other CH2 groups, each H on the middle CH2 would be coupled with two Hs on each adjacent CH2. So, each H would have two neighboring Hs on each side.

This would cause each H to be split into a doublet of doublets. But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, if each coupling is with two Hs, the splitting would be a triplet for each coupling, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So, if the structure is such that the CH2 is between two other CH2 groups, each with two Hs, then each H on the central CH2 would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is next to a CH group with two Hs, making the coupling more complex.

Wait, I'm not entirely confident, but perhaps the correct answer is a triplet of triplets.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **First Reaction (1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH):**  
   The reaction with KOH likely involves elimination of two HBr molecules, forming a carbonyl group due to the structure of adamantane. This results in product 1, which is a ketone. The IR spectrum confirms the presence of a carbonyl group at 1720 cm⁻¹. The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41–2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests a ketone with specific hydrogen environments.

2. **Second Reaction (product 1 + Al(i-Pr)₃):**  
   Aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, likely facilitates an elimination reaction, forming an α,β-unsaturated ketone (enone). This enone structure (product 2) is confirmed by the subsequent ozonolysis step.

3. **Third Reaction (product 2 + Ozonolysis):**  
   Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in the enone, forming product 3, which contains carbonyl groups. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely part of a CH₂ group adjacent to carbonyl groups.

4. **Coupling Pattern of the Most Deshielded Hydrogen:**  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is on a CH₂ group between two carbonyl groups. Each hydrogen on this CH₂ group is coupled with two hydrogens on adjacent carbons, resulting in a triplet of triplets splitting pattern.

Critical analysis of the options:
- **A) Triplet:** This would occur if the hydrogen were coupled with two equivalent hydrogens, but the environment is more complex.  
- **B) Triplet of Triplets:** Matches the scenario where each hydrogen is coupled with two hydrogens on two different adjacent carbons.  
- **C) Doublet of Triplets:** This would require coupling with one hydrogen and two hydrogens on different carbons, which is not consistent with the structure.  
- **D) Pentet:** This would occur if the hydrogen were coupled with four equivalent hydrogens, which is not the case here.

The most consistent coupling pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.
