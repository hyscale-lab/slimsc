Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and their flux in different energy bands. Hmm, I need to figure out the ratio of flux between band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV) after the pp-III branch stops.

Wait, let me start by understanding what the pp-III branch is. I remember that the proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun. There are different branches: the pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Oh right! The pp-III branch involves the 3He generated in the pp-I and pp-II reactions. So, when the pp-III stops, the production of certain neutrinos would be affected.

Neutrinos are produced in various reactions. The main ones are the electron neutrinos (νe) from the fusion processes. The pp-III branch probably contributes to the high-energy neutrinos. So stopping it would reduce the number of high-energy neutrinos.

Wait, but the question says that the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Oh, that's the light travel time from the Sun's core to the surface, right? So, the photons would take about that time to reach us, but neutrinos move much faster, so they wouldn't be delayed. But in this scenario, the neutrino production stopped 8.5 minutes ago. So the neutrinos we detect now are from before the stop, but any produced after wouldn't reach us yet. Wait, but the question is about the flux reaching Earth now. So, if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos emitted since then wouldn't have arrived yet. So the current flux would be from the time when pp-III was still active.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The pp-III stopped, so all the neutrinos after that time won't be produced. So when we observe neutrinos now, we're seeing the ones that were emitted before the pp-III stopped. But how does that affect the flux? Because the pp-III was part of the ongoing process, stopping it would mean that any neutrinos from that process won't be present anymore.

Wait, no. The question is hypothetical. It says the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago. So, the neutrinos arriving now would have been emitted either before or after that time. But since the process stopped, any neutrinos emitted after that stop wouldn't be there anymore. But the neutrinos take time to reach Earth, so if the process stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos emitted since then are still on their way or haven't been emitted yet. So the neutrinos we detect now are from the time when pp-III was active, and maybe some emitted just before the stop. But this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe the key point is that the pp-III contributes to a certain energy range of neutrinos, and stopping it would reduce the flux in that range.

So, the main neutrino sources from the pp chain. The dominant neutrino species from the Sun are the νe from the decay of beryllium-7 in the pp-I and pp-II branches, I think. The pp-III branch involves 3He and might produce higher-energy neutrinos? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the pp-III branch is the part where two 3He nuclei fuse to form carbon-12. So, the initial steps are pp-I (p + p → 2H + e+ + νe), then pp-II (2H + p → 3He + γ), and then 3He can either undergo pp-III (3He + 3He → 4He + 2p) or another branch where it captures electrons to form 7Be. The capture of a 3He by another 3He would produce two protons and helium-4, and I believe this process contributes to the high-energy neutrinos.

Wait, when 3He captures a proton, it's part of the pp-III process? Or maybe the neutrinos come from the decay of 7Be, which is part of the pp-I and pp-II. So if the pp
