Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me take a deep breath and try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try my best.

The question is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A to D.

First, I need to analyze the spectral data given. Let's start with the IR. The IR peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates the presence of an alkyne (sp-hybridized carbon) because the C-H stretch in alkynes is around 3300 cm-1. Alternatively, it could be an amine or an alcohol, but the presence of other peaks might help clarify that.

Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl peak. Could it be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid? Another peak at 1610 cm-1 suggests a conjugated carbonyl group, like an aromatic ring with a substituent. The 1450 cm-1 peak might correspond to aromatic C-C stretching.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR. The peaks are at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H). That's a broad singlet, which often corresponds to an acidic proton, like an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but in this case, the IR showed 1720 cm-1. If it's a carboxylic acid, that would be around 1700 cm-1, and the O-H stretch would be broad, which is consistent with the 3400-2500 cm-1 region. But wait, the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a bit high for an aldehyde but fits a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic proton adjacent to an electronegative group, but that's probably not the case here.

Looking further, the 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggest an aromatic ring with two substituents that are in the para positions. The coupling patterns are doublets, which would make sense for a para-dis
