Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it carefully. Hmm, it's about an isolated system of particles with charge. Alright, let's break it down.

So, the problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, 2e, right, because e is the elementary charge. And their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about that. 

Out of these 13, 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I'm supposed to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given, but I'll try to figure it out step by step.

Wait, energy in an electrostatic system usually refers to the potential energy between charges. Since the system is isolated, I think I need to calculate the electrostatic potential energy. Yeah, because in such a scenario, the potential energy is the work done to assemble the charges in that configuration.

So, the setup is: one charge at point P, and 12 others fixed at a distance of 2 meters from P. But wait, the 12 are at 2 meters from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So, each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the charge at P.

I remember that the electrostatic potential energy between two point charges is given by U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant. But when there are multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. However, since all the charges are identical and placed symmetrically, I can compute the energy contributed by each of the 12 charges relative to the charge at P and then sum them all.

Wait, but wait a second. The charge at P is fixed, and the other 12 are fixed at 2m. So, each of the 12 charges contributes an energy term with the central charge. Plus, the 12 charges also contribute energy among themselves because they repel each other. Oh! So, I can't just calculate the energy between each of the 12 and the central one and be done. I also need to consider the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges. That's going to add to the total.

Wait, but wait again. The problem says the 12
