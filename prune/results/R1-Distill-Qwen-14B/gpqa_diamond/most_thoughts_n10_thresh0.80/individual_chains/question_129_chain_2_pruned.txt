Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's start by breaking down what the question is asking. The question involves a series of reactions leading from compound A to E, and we need to identify what E is based on the given information.

First, let me read through all the details carefully. 

The reaction steps are:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Then there are some hints provided.

Hint a says that compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. I remember that Wittig reactions form alkenes by reacting a ylide with an aldehyde or ketone. So compound A must be a carbonyl compound because it reacts with a ylide to form an alkene.

Looking at the product, 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The structure would have a cyclopentane ring with substituents. The propan-2-ylidene group is a CH2-C(CH3)= group attached to the cyclopentane ring. So the Wittig reaction would form a new double bond. The starting material A for the Wittig would have a carbonyl group that, when reacted, forms that substituent.

Wait, maybe A is a cyclopentanone derivative. Let me try to draw this. The product is a cyclopentane ring with two methyl groups on carbons 1 and 2, and a substituent at position 4, which is a propenyl group (propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)-). So the Wittig would have added a CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 group or something similar.

Wait, no. The ylide would have a structure like PR3+–CH2–CH(CH3)–, and when it reacts with a ketone, it would substitute the carbonyl oxygen to form an alkene. So if the product has a substituent like CH2–C(CH3)=, perhaps the carbonyl was at position 4. Let me think: if compound A is a ketone, say cyclopentanone with substituents.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane ring has methyl groups at positions 1 and 2. At position 4, it's connected to a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene would be (CH3)2C=CH–, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH2CH(CH3))– as a substituent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclopentane ring with substituents: at position 1 and 2,
