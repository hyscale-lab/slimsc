Okay, so I have this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I need to find out how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than planet #1's. Alright, let's think through what I remember about this.

So, the radial velocity method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. The star moves due to the planet's gravity, and this causes the spectral lines to shift periodically. The size of the shift depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period, I think.

Wait, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is something like K = (v * sin i) where v is the star's velocity. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Oh right, the formula relates the star's velocity to the planet's orbital parameters. The formula I remember is K = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (P)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/1) ) or something like that. Wait, maybe I should look up the exact expression.

Wait, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1/1)

But since M_p (planet mass) is much smaller than M_* (star mass), which is similar to the Sun, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, which is the mass of the Sun. So the formula simplifies. Let me write it down.

K = ( (G * M_p / M_*) )^(1/3) * (1 / P^(2/3)) ) * (1 / (1 + (M_p/M_* )^(1/3)) ) )

But wait, since M_p is much smaller than M_*, the denominator (1 + (M_p/M_* )^(1/3)) is approximately 1. So we can ignore it. So,

K ≈ (G * M_p )^(1/3) / ( (M_* )^(1/3) * P^(2/3) ) )

Or,

K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( M_* ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P )^(2/3) )

Wait, perhaps I should write the formula as:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) )^(1/3) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

Hmm, maybe another approach. Another version of the formula is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_*) * (1 AU) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the relation between K and P.

Given that both stars have the same mass (same as Sun), and the planets have similar masses as Neptune, so M_p1 ≈ M_p2 ≈ M Neptune. So their masses are same.

The question states that the stars
