Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think carefully.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvectors correspond to the possible states when the observable is measured. The eigenvalue gives the result of the measurement.

The operator given is P, which has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is given as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, P is a vector operator, and we're looking at it along direction n, which lies in the x-z plane.

Wait, the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So the operator we're interested in is P · n, right? Because the operator along an arbitrary direction is the dot product of the vector operator P with the unit vector n.

So the first step is to express the operator along n. Let me see. If n is in the x-z plane, it can be written as n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but wait, because in the x-z plane, the angle θ would be measured from the z-axis, right? So n has components (sinθ, 0, cosθ), with θ being the polar angle.

Wait, but wait, sometimes the notation varies. Alternatively, direction in x-z plane can be parametrized by angle φ, but I think in this case, since it's in the x-z plane, the angle is measured from the z-axis. So the components are (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle between n and the z-axis.

So the operator in the direction n is P · n. Let me write that out.

P · n = P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z

But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y = 0. So P · n simplifies to P_x * n_x + P_z * n_z.

Given that n is a unit vector, n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, where θ is the angle from the z-axis.

So substituting, P · n = (P_x * sinθ) + (P_z * cosθ).

Now, each component P_x, P_y, P_z is given as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let's note their matrix forms:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]

P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So let me compute each term.

First, P_x * sinθ:

(ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * sinθ

Similarly, P_z * cosθ:

(ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * cosθ

Adding these together gives the matrix for P · n.

So, the matrix for P · n is:

(ħ/2) [ [0 * sinθ + 1 * cosθ, 1 * sinθ + 0 * cosθ],
          [1 * sinθ + 0 * cosθ, 0 * sinθ + (-1) * cosθ ] ]

Wait, let me compute each element step by step. The matrix addition is straightforward. Each element is:

Top left: (P_x matrix top left * sinθ) + (P_z matrix top left * cosθ) = 0*(ħ/2) sinθ + 1*(ħ/2) cosθ → (ħ/2)(cosθ)

Top right: (0 * sinθ) + (0 * cosθ) from P_x and P_z? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, no, when you have P_x
