Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. They've given me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are four different distances, so I need to calculate which one is correct.

Wait, mesons are bosons, right, composed of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances are particles that exist for very short times because they decay quickly. The decay distance would depend on how long the particle lives before decaying, which is related to its lifetime.

I remember that the mean lifetime τ of a particle is inversely proportional to its decay width Γ. The relation is τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I think the width Γ is given in energy units, so when converting to time, I need to use Planck's constant appropriately.

Once I have the lifetime τ, the mean decay distance (L) would just be the speed of the particle multiplied by τ. But wait, since the particle is moving at relativistic speeds, I should consider its velocity. Alternatively, if the particle is at rest, the distance would just be cτ. But in this case, the meson is produced with a certain energy, so maybe it's moving. Oh, but wait, perhaps the decay happens quickly, so maybe the velocity can be approximated as c? Or maybe I need to calculate the velocity based on its energy.
