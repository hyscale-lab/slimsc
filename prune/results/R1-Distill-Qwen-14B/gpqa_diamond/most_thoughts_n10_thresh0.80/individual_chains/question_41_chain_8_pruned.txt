Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. So, a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. The question is, what is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab? The options are labeled A to D.

Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. I remember that when dealing with relative velocities, especially involving light, it's tricky because light's speed is constant in a vacuum according to Einstein's postulate. But here, the situation is in a medium, so the refractive index comes into play.

Wait, the glass is moving, but the light is moving through the glass. So, the glass has its own motion, and we need to find the speed of light as observed in the lab frame.

Let me recall some concepts. The speed of light in a medium is c/n, where c is the speed in a vacuum. But when the medium itself is moving, how does that affect the observed speed of the light?

I think this is a case where we can use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because when objects are moving relative to each other, their velocities don't just add up linearly. Instead, you have to consider the Lorentz transformations.

The velocity addition formula in special relativity is (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c²), where u is the velocity of the object in one frame, and v is the velocity of the frame relative to the first. But wait, I need to make sure I'm applying this correctly.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. Suppose in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed u = c/n. But the glass itself is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So, I need to find the speed of the light in the lab frame.

Wait, but light's speed isn't just additive. Because in relativity, you can't have velocities exceeding c. So the standard Galilean addition (where you just add velocities) doesn't hold. Instead, the relativistic formula applies.

But wait, another thought: the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. So from the lab's perspective, the light is moving through the moving glass. Hmm, but the glass has a refractive index n, so the light's speed within the glass is c/n relative to the glass. But when the glass itself is moving, how does that affect the speed observed in the lab?

Wait, maybe I should model this with two frames: the glass's rest frame and the lab frame.

In the glass's rest frame (S'), the light is moving at u' = c/n. Now, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame (S). So, we need to transform the velocity u' to the lab frame S.

Using the relativistic velocity transformation formula: u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/(c²)).

Wait, but wait. The direction matters. Let me clarify the directions. The glass is moving toward the observer in the lab. Oh wait, no. The problem says the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Wait, so the beam
