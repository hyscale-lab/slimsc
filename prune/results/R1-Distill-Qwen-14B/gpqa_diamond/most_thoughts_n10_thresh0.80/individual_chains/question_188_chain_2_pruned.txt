Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, right? I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a specific plane in a rhombohedral crystal. 

First, let me remember what a rhombohedral crystal structure is. I think it's one of the seven crystal systems, characterized by having all sides equal and all angles equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. So in this case, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms, and all the angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. Hmm, wait, wait. Oh wait, no—the rhombohedral system is a special case of the hexagonal system? Or is it a type of cubic system with distorted cubes? I'm a bit confused. Wait, no, rhombohedral is a separate system where a = b = c and α = β = γ, but all angles can be different. In this problem, all angles are 30 degrees. 

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. I remember that the interplanar distance formula is d = a / sqrt(l² + m² + n² + 2lm cos α + 2ln cos β + 2mn cos γ), but wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, I think it's d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl
