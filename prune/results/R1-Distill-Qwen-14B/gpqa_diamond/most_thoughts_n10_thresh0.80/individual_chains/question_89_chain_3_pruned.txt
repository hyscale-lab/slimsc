Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's break it down step by step. The question involves a series of reactions, and I need to figure out the structure of the final product, particularly looking at its NMR coupling pattern.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, right? So, 1,3-dibromo would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure.

Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination reaction. Since there are two bromines, perhaps a double elimination occurs. Wait, in the case of vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromoalkanes), treating with a strong base like KOH would typically lead to elimination, forming an alkene. But wait, adamantane is a cage structure, so maybe the elimination isn't straightforward.

Wait, but in this case, it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So, the two bromines are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure, like across a bridge? So, when KOH is used, it could abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. But wait, adamantane is pretty rigid. So, elimination would form a bridgehead double bond? But bridgehead double bonds are generally not allowed because of the Bredt's rule, which states that bridgehead double bonds are not stable in bicyclic structures (unless the ring is large enough, like in norbornene where it's possible).

Hmm, so maybe in this case, the reaction doesn't form a double bond but something else. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH leads to a substitution. But wait, KOH is a strong base, so substitution would require a good leaving group, which bromide is. But substitution would typically require a good leaving group and a nucleophile. Wait, but in KOH, the hydroxide is the nucleophile. So, maybe two substitution reactions occur.

Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid, and the NMR shows specific peaks. The IR spectrum has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O). So the product after KOH treatment must have a ketone group. How does that happen?

Oh, wait! Maybe the reaction is a double elimination (dehydrohalogenation) but that would form a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH group, but that would form a diol. But the IR shows a carbonyl, so maybe it's an epoxide? No, epoxide would have an O in the ring and maybe other peaks. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diketone, but that's less likely.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination to form a ketone. Wait, but how? Oh, wait, let me think. If it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH is used, perhaps it's a double dehydrohalogenation. So, two elimination steps occur, each removing H and Br, forming a double bond. But wait, forming a double bond in the adamantane structure might not be possible due to Bredt's rule.
