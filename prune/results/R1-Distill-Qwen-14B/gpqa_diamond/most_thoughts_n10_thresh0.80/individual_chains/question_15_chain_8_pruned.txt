Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should observe that one first. Let me break this down step by step because I'm a bit new to this.

Alright, the question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2 takes, say, 300 days, Planet_1 would take 100 days. But wait, the mass of the host stars is different. The star for Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's star. Oh, but both stars have the same radius because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. Interesting.

The main point here is about the probability of a transit. I remember that the chance of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the planet's orbital distance. The formula for transit probability is something like (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by the ratio of the star's distance to the cube of the orbital period... Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the probability is actually proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / R_s)^2, but wait, no, that's not right. Or maybe the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a^2)), no, not exactly. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, I think the transit probability (P) is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (a/(R_s)) ) / (something?), but maybe I should recall the formula correctly.

Wait, another approach: The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the planet's disk to the area of the star's disk, multiplied by the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. But I think the alignment factor is actually a function of the orbital distance and the star's radius.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The probability P is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s / a)^2 ), but that seems wrong because as a increases, the probability would decrease, which makes sense because the planet is further away, so less chance to pass in front. Wait, no, actually
