Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. I'm a bit rusty on my special relativity, but let's try to think it through.

The problem says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. I need to find the maximum speed v_max. The options are given, but I should work it out step by step.

In the classical case, for a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA² at maximum displacement, and all of that converts to kinetic energy at the equilibrium point (x=0). So the maximum speed would be sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C. But wait, this is a relativistic case. Oh right, so we can't use classical mechanics here because at high speeds, relativistic effects become significant.

In special relativity, the total energy includes rest mass energy. The total energy E is gamma*m*c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The kinetic energy in relativity is E - mc², which equals (gamma -1) mc². 

But wait, the oscillator's total energy at maximum displacement is the sum of potential and kinetic energy. At maximum amplitude A, the oscillator comes to rest, so all the energy is potential. Wait, no. Wait, in the harmonic oscillator, at maximum displacement, velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. Then, as it moves towards equilibrium, potential energy converts to kinetic. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. So the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy.

So the total mechanical energy E of the oscillator would be the same at all points. At maximum amplitude, E = potential energy, which is (1/2)kA². But wait, in relativity, the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², right? Because Hooke's law is F = -kx, which is non-relativistic. Hmm, maybe that's an approximation. But the problem states that it obeys Hooke's law, so perhaps we proceed with that.

So, at the equilibrium point (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. So E = (gamma) mc², because the kinetic energy is E - mc² = (gamma -1)
