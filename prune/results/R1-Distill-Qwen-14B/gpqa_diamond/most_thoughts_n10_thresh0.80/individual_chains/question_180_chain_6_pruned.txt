Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their masses are negligible, so I guess I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that—just the electrostatic potential energy. Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals, and the options are given.

Hmm, so I remember that the potential energy between point charges is given by Coulomb's law. The formula is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, about 8.988×10^9 N·m²/C². But wait, when there are multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair, right? So I need to calculate the potential energy for all the pairs in the system.

Let me think. There are 13 charges in total. The 13th is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are each at 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from the fixed charge at P. But also, each of those 12 could be influencing each other. Oh right, because the 12 charges are all at the same distance from P, but what about the distance between the 12 charges themselves? Wait, the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, but it doesn't say anything about their distance from each other. Hmm, that might complicate things. But for the minimum energy, perhaps we need to assume that the 12 charges are as close together as possible, but wait—no, because the 12 are at a fixed distance from P, but their mutual distances aren't specified. Oh wait, but if they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, that implies they are all at a point 2 m away. Wait, but if they're each 2 m away, but the problem says they're identical particles—so if they're all at 2 m from P, perhaps they're arranged in a spherical shell around P? Hmm, but for the purpose of potential energy
