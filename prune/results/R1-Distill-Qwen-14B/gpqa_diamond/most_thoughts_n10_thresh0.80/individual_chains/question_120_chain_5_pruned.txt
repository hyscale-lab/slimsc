Okay, so I've got this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh wait, parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. So, a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is 1 parsec away, right? So plx = 1/distance. That means as distance increases, parallax decreases.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed usually means that the number density is the same throughout space. But wait, when we observe them, how does this translate into the number we see with a certain parallax?

Let me think about volume. The number of stars in a given volume depends on the volume itself if the distribution is uniform. So if I consider a spherical shell at a certain distance, the volume of that shell would determine how many stars are in it. 

Wait, the volume of a spherical shell (like a thin layer around a sphere) is approximately the surface area of the sphere multiplied by the thickness of the shell. The surface area of a sphere is 4πr², and the thickness is dr. So the volume is 4πr² dr.

But wait, parallax plx is 1/r. So r = 1/plx. So, substituting that into the volume, let's see. r = 1/plx → dr = -d(1/plx) → let's compute that derivative. Let me compute dr in terms of d(plx). Hmm, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Because derivative of 1/plx with respect to plx is -1/plx². So, dr = -dplx / plx².

Wait, but when plx increases, r decreases, so for a small increase in plx (dplx), the corresponding dr is negative (since r decreases as plx increases). But for the volume, I'm interested in the positive volume element, so maybe I should take the absolute value.

So, the volume element in terms of plx is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx^2) ). Wait, because r is 1/plx, so r squared is 1/(plx squared). So the 4πr
