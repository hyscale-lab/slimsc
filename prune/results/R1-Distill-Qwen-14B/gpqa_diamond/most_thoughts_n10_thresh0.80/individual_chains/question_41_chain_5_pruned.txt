Okay, so I have this physics problem here about light moving through a moving glass. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light relative to the observer in the lab.

Wait, let me make sure I understand. The glass is moving, and the light is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the glass is moving toward the observer, but the light is moving with it as well. Wait, noâ€”the light is moving through the glass, but the glass is moving towards the observer. So the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, which is towards the observer. So the observer is ahead of the beam's direction, and the glass is moving towards the observer, carrying the light.

Wait, no, the beam is propagating through the glass, which is moving towards the observer. So the beam's direction is towards the observer because the glass is moving that way.

I remember that the speed of light in a medium is given by v_medium = c/n, where c is the vacuum speed. But that's the speed within the medium when the medium is stationary. Here, the medium is moving. So does the movement of the medium affect the speed of light in it? Or is it that the speed of light in the glass is still c/n regardless of the glass's motion?

Wait, but wait a second. In special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light. But the problem gives v as a constant velocity, but doesn't specify how fast. Hmm, but the options given are all in terms of n and v, so perhaps we can assume that the velocities are non-relativistic. But wait, the speed of light is always c in a vacuum, but in a medium, it's c/n. But if the medium is moving, do we add the velocities?

Alternatively, maybe it's a matter of frame of reference. The light's speed in the lab frame depends on the movement of the glass and the light's speed within the glass.

Wait, the speed of light in the glass (from the lab frame) would be the speed of the glass plus the speed of light relative to the glass. But wait, how does that work? Because in the glass's rest frame, light moves at c/n.
