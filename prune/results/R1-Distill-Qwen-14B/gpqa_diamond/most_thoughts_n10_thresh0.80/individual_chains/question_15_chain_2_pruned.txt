Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says that researchers are trying to detect transits of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They want to choose the one with the higher probability of transiting because they have limited observing time. Both planets have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so their minimum masses and orbital periods are known.

Wait, both planets have the same mass. But Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is orbiting much closer to its star. Also, both have circular orbits.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both host stars have the same radii because the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved but their radii are the same. Interesting. So even though Star_1 is more massive, they have the same radius.

I think the key here is figuring out the transit probability for each planet. The transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance, but more importantly, it's about the alignment. The probability of a transit is higher when the planet's orbit is edge-on relative to us. But wait, the probability formula for transits is something like (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by (a / (2π R_star)) ), but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, no, the transit probability (P) is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / (2 * R_s)) ), but wait, that's not exactly right. I think the transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s)) )? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach. The probability that a planet transits is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a / R_s)) ), but I'm not sure. I think actually, the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s)) ), but perhaps I should think in terms of orbital geometry.

The transit probability is the ratio of the size of the star to the size of the orbit, in some way. The formula I remember is P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a / R_s)). Wait, perhaps it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a). Because the orbital distance a is much larger than R_s, so the probability is small.

Wait, more accurately, the probability that a randomly oriented orbit would cause a transit is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a), but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a) * (something else). Or maybe (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s)) ) because a is the semi-major axis. But I'm not quite getting the exact formula.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to consider that the
