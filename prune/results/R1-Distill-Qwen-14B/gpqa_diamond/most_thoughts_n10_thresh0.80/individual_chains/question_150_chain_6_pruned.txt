Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying the final product after a series of reactions. The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO, and there's some NMR data provided. The reagents used are a bit tricky—NaNO2 and HCl, followed by H2O, and then aqueous KOH with heat. 

First, I need to figure out what the original compound looks like based on the NMR. Let's break down the NMR data. The protons are given in ppm and their multiplicities.

So, the NMR shows:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a triplet around 9.7. High upfield, so maybe an aldehyde proton? Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm as a singlet or a small multiplet. The triplet suggests coupling with two equivalent protons. Wait, but an aldehyde (RCHO) proton is usually a singlet because it's only coupled with one adjacent proton if it's in a propargyl situation, but maybe it's part of a conjugated system? Not sure yet.

- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet for two protons. This could be aromatic protons, maybe from a para-substituted benzene ring. The doublet suggests coupling with another set of two protons in a trans configuration. Wait, in a para-substituted ring, each proton has two adjacent Hs, but maybe this is part of a meta or ortho arrangement? Or perhaps this is from a vinyl group adjacent to an aromatic ring.

- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet for two protons. This might be the ortho protons relative to the substituent on the benzene. Like, if the ring has substituents in the para position, these could be the neighboring protons. But wait, the two doublets here could be from two different sets of aromatic protons.

- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet for two protons. Broad usually means exchange with something, like an -OH group, but integrating two H. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde adjacent to something else, but not sure. Or maybe it's a conjugated system with some coupling that's broadened.

- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet for two protons. This seems like a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, maybe an oxygen. Like an OCH2 group or perhaps a CH2 connected to a carbonyl. The doublet suggests each H is coupled with one other H, so maybe a -CH2- group next to an oxygen, such as in a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl.

Putting this together, let me think about the structure. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, X=0. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2= (10)/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation—could be a ring plus double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring (three degrees), a double bond (one), and an aldehyde (another double bond, but wait, aldehyde is a carbonyl, which counts as one). Let me recount: benzene (3), aldehyde (1), and one more double bond elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe an aromatic ring with substituents and some other rings or double bonds.

Looking at the NMR, the aldehyde proton is at 9.72. So the molecule likely contains an aldehyde group. Then, the aromatic signals: 6.98 and 6.51 as doublets. Maybe two para-substituted benzene rings? Or perhaps one benzene ring with substituents and another group attached.

The 3.66 ppm doublet for two H suggests a CH2 connected to something. Maybe OCH2, like a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen. So perhaps there is an ether linkage or a carbonyl group adjacent to CH2.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's think about possible structures. Maybe it's an aromatic aldehyde with substituents that include another aromatic ring. Let's say the main chain is a butyraldehyde (butanal) with substituents on the alpha and gamma positions.

Alternatively, maybe it's something like a benzaldehyde derivative with another benzene ring attached.

Wait, I've got the NMR data. Let me try to sketch possible structures.

The triplet at 9.72: aldehyde proton. If it's a triplet, maybe it's coupled with two H on adjacent C. So that would imply that the aldehyde is at the end and the adjacent carbon has two H. Like RCH2CHO. But wait, in that case, the aldehyde's H would be split by the adjacent CH2. So the aldehyde would be a triplet. That makes sense. So, the structure could be RCH2CHO.

Looking at the 3.66 ppm doublet (2H): that would be the CH2 next to the aldehyde. So R-CH2-CHO. The R group would be an aromatic substituent, perhaps.

So the molecule has a CH2CHO group and a benzene ring attached. Let's count the carbons. The main chain is 3 carbons (CH2-CHO is two, but wait, maybe more). Wait, molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's see: CH2CHO is 3 carbons (the CH2 and CHO). But the formula is C8, so the R group must be 5 carbons? Wait, no, the R is part of the molecule. Wait, let me think again.

Alternatively, the structure could be something like: benzaldehyde with another substituent. Let's see.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows two doublets in the aromatic region, which suggests maybe two different sets of aromatic protons. For example, two para-substituted benzene rings. But that would require more carbons.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me think about possible structures.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is a substituted benzaldehyde with a substituent that includes another benzene ring. For example, perhaps a dialdehyde or a ketone? No, because the NMR shows an aldehyde proton. Wait, but the aldehyde is usually only one.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a diaryl compound with an aldehyde group somewhere.

Alternatively, maybe it's a benzene ring attached to a side chain that has an aldehyde and some other substituents.

Wait, let's think about the H at 3.66 ppm. That's a CH2 group. If that's adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2CH2CHO, but that would be a longer chain.

Wait, but let's think of the possible reactions. The first reagent is NaNO2 and HCl, which is a typical nitrosation condition, especially under acidic conditions. That's usually for the formation of nitrous acid, which can lead to diazotization. But wait, the presence of HCl makes me think of the Sandmeyer reaction or diazotization of an aromatic amine. But wait, the molecular formula has an N. So the starting molecule might have an amino group, which is then converted to a diazonium salt.

But the starting formula is C8H9NO. That's 8 carbons, 9 H, 1 N, 1 O. Hmm, so possible groups: maybe a benzylamine derivative with an aldehyde and an aromatic ring.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any peaks that look like amines. Wait, unless it's a substituted aromatic ring with a substituent that's an amine. But in the NMR, I don't see any peaks around 1.5-3 ppm that would suggest CH2NH or something. Or maybe the amine is deprotonated under the conditions, but that's unlikely in D2O, but the NMR was probably recorded in CDCl3 or something.

Alternatively, maybe the N is part of an amide or nitro group, but the formula doesn't have enough O for that. Let's see: O is only one in the formula.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So that's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, 1 oxygen. So possible functional groups: aldehyde (O), and perhaps an amine (N) or an amide, but I think more likely an amine. Because amide would require another O.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any peaks that would correspond to NH protons. So maybe the amine is somewhere else, perhaps substituted with another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the N is part of a nitro group, but nitro groups typically don't have protons. Wait, but the formula has one N and one O. So maybe it's an amino group, but then where?

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a nitroso group or something else. But I'm not sure. Let me try another approach.

Looking at the NMR:

The triplet at 9.72 ppm is 1H, probably the aldehyde. The 6.98 and 6.51 ppm doublets (2H each) suggest two sets of aromatic protons. The 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to something else, but broad suggests maybe some exchange. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl proton adjacent to an oxygen, or perhaps an aromatic ring with substituents.

Wait, maybe the compound is a cinnamaldehyde derivative. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde with the structure Ph-CH2-CHO. But that's C9H8O. Wait, our compound is C8H9NO, which is different.

Wait, but if the starting compound has an amine group, perhaps as part of a substituent on the benzene ring. So maybe it's 4-aminobenzaldehyde with another substituent.

Wait, but 4-aminobenzaldehyde would have the formula C7H7NO. But our compound is C8H9NO, which is one more carbon and two more hydrogens. So maybe there's another substituent attached.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is a benzaldehyde with an amino group attached elsewhere. Let's think about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a diaryl compound with a side chain that includes the aldehyde and a CH2 group. For instance, maybe something like benzaldehyde attached to a benzene ring via a CH2 group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the triplet at 9.72 could be an aldehyde with adjacent H. So for
