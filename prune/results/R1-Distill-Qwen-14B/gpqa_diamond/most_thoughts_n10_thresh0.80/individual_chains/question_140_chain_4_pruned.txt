Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reactions, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question is about Substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated gives B. B's melting point is around 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. Hmm, that's just above freezing, so I'm thinking maybe B is something like ice? No, wait, water freezes at 273 K, so 277 is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe it's a solid at normal conditions, like room temperature.

The product of a keto acid reacting with Substance X contains two oxygen atoms. I'm not entirely sure about that part, but maybe that relates to the formula of Substance X.

Substance X uses a heavier isotope of one of its elements. And X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Oh, wait, common reagents in organic reactions include things like KMnO4, K2Cr2O7, or maybe even something like H2SO4. But wait, the problem says it's known for incorporating a heavier isotope, so maybe it's something like Cl in chlorides? Or perhaps something like sodium or potassium because of their isotopes.

Let me think about the reaction details. Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y. Common violent reactions include metals reacting with acids. For example, sodium reacting with water. Sodium (Na) reacts violently with water to produce sodium hydroxide, hydrogen gas, and heat. That makes me think that maybe Y is water, and X is a metal, like sodium.

So if X is sodium, then when it reacts with Y (water), it produces gas W. The gas from sodium and water is hydrogen, H2. Now, the problem says the molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hydrogen has one proton and one neutron? Wait, no. Hydrogen usually has one proton, but the neutron count depends on the isotope. But the gas W's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, wait, no, the molecule as a whole. So H2: each H has one proton. So the molecule has 2 protons, and each H has zero neutrons (if it's H1).
