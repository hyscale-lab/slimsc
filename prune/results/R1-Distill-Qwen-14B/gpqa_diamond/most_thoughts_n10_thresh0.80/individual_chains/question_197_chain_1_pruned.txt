Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically involved in the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, other reactions might be possible, but I think in this case, it's about a substitution reaction, maybe.

Looking at the IR data first. The IR shows strong bands around 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretching. But there's also a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Wait, but if the reaction is with HI and red phosphorus, maybe the starting compound has a nitrile group. Because nitriles can react with HI to form imidamide salts, which then hydrolyze. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the route here.

Wait, another thought: Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. So if the starting material is a nitrile, after reaction, it becomes a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution where the nitrile group is replaced.

Looking at the NMR data for Compound X. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, broad singlet, 1H. That's a strong sign of an aldehyde proton. But wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, but the integration is 1H. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton, like from a carboxylic acid, but then the carboxylic acid would be deprotonated if in DMSO or something, but the shift in NMR is at 10.5. Another possibility is an aldehyde, but let me think.

Wait, the IR has 3400-2500, which is a broad range. That might suggest O-H (like from a carboxylic acid or alcohol) or maybe an amine (but that's usually in a different range). Wait, another possibility is an aldehyde's O-H stretch? No, aldehydes don't have O-H. Wait, maybe it's an alcohol. But the 10.5 ppm in NMR is more likely an aldehyde or perhaps an acidic proton like a COOH. Wait, but if it's a COOH, the O-H would show up as a broad peak around 10-12, which the 10.5 matches. But the IR peak at 1720 could be a carbonyl. So maybe the compound is a carboxylic acid? But then why is the NMR showing an aldehyde H? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, looking again: The NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm (broad, singlet, 1H) which might be an aldehyde (RCHO). The IR has 1720, which is a carbonyl. So if the compound is an aldehyde
