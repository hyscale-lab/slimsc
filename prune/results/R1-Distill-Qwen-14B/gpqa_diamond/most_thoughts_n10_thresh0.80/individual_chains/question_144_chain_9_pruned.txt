Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data is production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances, so I need to calculate which one is correct.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like distance = velocity × lifetime. But how do I find those from the given parameters?

First, I think about the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time are related. Oh wait, the width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, does Γ include a factor of 2 or something? Or is Γ the total decay width, which is the energy uncertainty? I think Γ is the total decay width, which relates to the lifetime via τ = ħ/(Γ).

Wait no, I might be mixing things up. Let me think again. The line width Γ is the energy uncertainty, and the uncertainty principle says ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2. So Γ is approximately equal to ΔE, and τ is the mean lifetime. So, Γ ≈ ħ/(2τ). Or maybe Γ is the full width, so τ = ħ/(Γ). I'm a bit confused here. I think the correct relation is τ = ħ/(Γ). Let me double-check. Oh, right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the decay width by Γ = ħ/τ. So τ = ħ/(Γ). Yeah, that's right.

But wait, I also remember that the width Γ is often given as the total decay width, so this should be correct.

Next, the velocity. How do I find the velocity of the meson X? The meson is produced with energy E_X = 8 GeV and its rest mass m_X is 1.2 GeV. I need to find its velocity. So, relativistic energy comes into play here.

The total energy E is related to the momentum p and mass m by E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2. So, I can solve for p.

Let me write that down. E = 8
