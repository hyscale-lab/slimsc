Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major product when 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene reacts with maleic anhydride. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

First, I remember that maleic anhydride is a dienophile. Dienophiles are involved in Diels-Alder reactions, right? So this must be a Diels-Alder reaction. The diene would be the conjugated diene part of the molecule, and the dienophile is the maleic anhydride.

The compound given is 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene. Wait, cyclopenta-1,3-diene is a five-membered ring with double bonds at positions 1 and 3. So the structure is a cyclopentadiene. Now, 5-fluoro means there's a fluorine atom at position 5. Let me draw this ring. Positions 1, 3 are double bonds, so the ring has two double bonds, making it a conjugated diene.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, cyclopenta-1,3-diene has double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, right? So the structure looks like a five-membered ring with two double bonds. So the positions are 1-2 double bond and 3-4 double bond, with the ring positions numbered 1,2,3,4,5 in order. So the fluorine would be on position 5, which is adjacent to the 4 position.

Okay, so the diene is in the s-cis conformation for the Diels-Alder reaction. Wait, the diene needs to be conjugated and in the right conformation. But cyclopentadiene is a good diene for Diels-Alder, I think.

So when the Diels-Alder reaction occurs, the diene (cyclopentadiene) reacts with the dienophile (maleic anhydride) to form a six-membered ring. The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition. The maleic anhydride is a good dienophile because it's an electron-deficient molecule, with the electron-withdrawing groups (the anhydride) activating it for the reaction.

In the
