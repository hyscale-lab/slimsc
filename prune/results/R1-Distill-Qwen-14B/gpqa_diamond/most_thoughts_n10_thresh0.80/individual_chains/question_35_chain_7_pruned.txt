Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum operator of a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that the Y-component of the angular momentum operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix. The matrix is given as A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix A_y.

Wait, let me write down what these matrices look like. The matrix S is:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And since c is h/(4π), multiplying by that scalar will scale each element. So A_y = (h/(4π)) * S.

But to find the eigenvalues, maybe I can first find the eigenvalues of S and then scale them by c. Because if S has eigenvalues s, then A_y would have eigenvalues c*s.

So let's find the eigenvalues of S. The eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(S - λ I) = 0.

The matrix S - λ I would be:

[ -λ     -i    ]
[  i    -λ    ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (i)(i) = λ² - (i^2). But i squared is -1, so it's λ² - (-1) = λ² +1. Setting this equal to zero gives λ² +1 = 0 → λ = ±i.

Wait, so the eigenvalues of S are i and -i. Then, when we multiply by c = h/(4π), the eigenvalues of A_y would be (h/(4π)) * i and (h/(4π)) * (-i). So the eigenvalues are ±i*(h/(4π)).

But wait, the problem is asking which statement is correct regarding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Let me look at the options.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, real ±h/(4π). Hmm, that doesn't make sense because our eigenvalues are purely imaginary. So the real parts are zero, which isn't matching option A.

Option B: imag parts ±1/2, real ±1. Doesn't fit either because our eigenvalues are purely imaginary. Plus, the scaling factor is h/(4π), which would have to be considered.

Wait, maybe I should think about the actual values. Let me calculate i*(h/(4π)). Let's see, h is Planck's constant. So, i*(h/(4π)) is (i h)/(4π). But what is this in terms of the angular momentum unit?

Wait, I think I might be getting confused. The intrinsic angular momentum for a muon (which is a lepton, so it's spin-1/2) has S being the Pauli matrices scaled by some factor. Oh wait, wait, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. And the spin matrices are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. Because for spin-1/2
