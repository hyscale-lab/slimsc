Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and honestly, it's a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the situation is that there's a star with the same radius as the Sun. Half of its surface is covered in dark spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. They say that when you observe this star, the brightness variations due to rotation look like an exoplanet transiting the star. We need to find what the radius of such a planet would be relative to the star to produce the same brightness dip.

Hmm. Wait, but the problem says if the star wasn't covered by spots, what planet radius would do the same. So, the star's brightness variation from spots is being compared to the transit method, where a planet blocks some light.

But wait, no, because the spots change the brightness as the star rotates. So when the spots are facing us, the star appears dimmer. The overall effect is a periodic dip in brightness as the spots rotate into and out of view. The question is, how does this compare to a planet transiting the star?

I remember that the depth of a transit is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because when the planet blocks the starlight, the area blocked is the area of the planet's disk over the star's disk. So the fractional decrease in brightness is (Rp/Rs)^2.

But in this case, the star isn't being transited by a planet. Instead, it's the spots that cause the brightness change. So I need to compute the equivalent change in brightness as if it were a planet.

Wait, so what's the brightness variation caused by the spots? Let me think. The star's hemisphere with spots is cooler. When that hemisphere is facing us, the star appears a bit dimmer because a fraction of its light is coming from cooler regions.

The filling factor is 20%, which I think is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So the spots cover 0.2 of one hemisphere, which is half the star. So the total area of the spots is 0.2 * (Area of one hemisphere) = 0.2 * (4πR² / 2) → Wait, no, wait. The surface area of a sphere is 4πR², so half is
