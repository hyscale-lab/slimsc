Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem says there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and the same goes for their masses — Star_1 is 1.5 times more massive. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that's the peak wavelength, which I remember is related to the star's temperature. Also, their radial velocities are given: Star_1 has 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. But wait, how does radial velocity affect the wavelength they emit? Oh, right, Doppler shift! If a star is moving towards us, its light gets blueshifted; moving away, redshifted. But since the peak wavelengths are the same as observed, I think that must mean that their intrinsic temperatures are same, but maybe the observed wavelength is adjusted by the velocity. Hmm, not sure yet, but perhaps that's a detail to come back to.

The question is about their luminosities. They say the astronomers computed that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a certain factor, and we need to pick which option from A to D is correct.

I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So for two stars, L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4).

Given that R1 is 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. So R squared would be (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

Now, what about the temperatures T1 and T2? Oh, the peak wavelengths are the same. Wait, but the peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max observed is same for both stars, but wait, their velocities are different. So the observed wavelength is different from the rest wavelength.

Wait a second. Since Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s, its light is Doppler shifted. So the observed wavelengths could be different, but the problem says the observed wavelengths are the same. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think.

The peak wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So, the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. But the intrinsic λ_max (the rest frame) depends on their temperatures. So, because of the Doppler shift, maybe the observed λ_max is same, but their actual temperatures differ?

Wait, I think so. Let me model this. Let's say Star_1 is at rest (radial velocity 0), so its observed λ_max is λ1 = b / T1.

Star_2 is moving with velocity v =700 km/s. Wait, but Doppler shift depends on whether it's moving towards or away. The problem says Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s. But is it moving towards or away? The problem doesn't specify, but the radial velocity is positive or negative. Since the problem says the observed λ_max are the same, let's consider the Doppler effect.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Wait, or is it the other way around? Let me remember. If the source is moving towards the observer, the observed wavelength is shorter (blue shifted), so λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ). Alternatively, when the source is moving away, λ_obs is longer (redshifted).

Wait, another way to think: if the source is moving towards you, the observed frequency is higher, so wavelength is shorter. So, for a source moving towards observer with speed v:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/(c)) / (1 + v/(c)) )

But wait, velocity v is a significant fraction of c? Let's see, 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s. The speed of light is about 3e8 m/s, so 7e5 / 3e8 is about 0.0023, so v/c is about 0.0023, which is small. So perhaps for small v, we can approximate the Doppler shift as 1 + v/c (if moving away) or 1 - v/c (if moving towards). Hmm, but wait, the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So, perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed λ, but we can relate the intrinsic λ (from their temperatures) using the Doppler formula.

Let me denote:

For Star_1: observed λ_max = λ1_obs = λ1_rest.

Because Star_1's velocity is zero, so no Doppler shift. So λ1_rest = b / T1.

For Star_2: observed λ2_obs = λ1_obs (same as Star_1). But λ2_rest would be different.

What's λ2_rest? It's (b / T2) and is Doppler shifted to λ2_obs = λ2_rest * Doppler factor.

So:

λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Wait, wait. The Doppler shift formula depends on the direction of motion. If Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed wavelength would be blueshifted, so shorter. If moving away, redshifted, longer. Since Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s, but the question doesn't say direction, but the observed λ is same as Star_1's. So, let's suppose that Star_2 is moving away. Then the observed wavelength would be longer. Since the observed λ is same as Star_1's, which is at rest, so Star_2 must have its rest wavelength longer, but when moving away, the observed becomes same as Star_1's. Alternatively, if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed wavelength is shorter than its rest wavelength, which would have to be longer than Star_1's. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem says that both stars have the same observed λ_max, but Star_2 has a radial velocity. So, their rest wavelengths must be different, but due to Doppler shift, the observed is same.

So, for Star_1, no Doppler shift: λ1_obs = λ1_rest =
