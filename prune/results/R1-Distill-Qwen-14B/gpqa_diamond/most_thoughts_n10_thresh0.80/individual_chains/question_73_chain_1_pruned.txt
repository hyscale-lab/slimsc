Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. It's about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me think this through.

The problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively. Both are moving in the positive x-direction. Wait, but since they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed isn't just the difference of their speeds, right? Because that's only valid in classical mechanics. Oh right, in relativity, you can't just subtract velocities like that. I remember there's a formula for relativistic velocity addition.

The first part is finding the relative speed. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, from A's perspective, how fast is B moving? Or is it the other way around? Because the question says 'relative speed', which could be the speed of one as seen from the other. So I think I need to calculate the relative velocity between them.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), where u is the speed of one object in the other's frame. Wait, I might have that mixed up. Let me get the formula right. Oh right, when you're in a frame moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame, the speed u' of another object is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So in this case, let's say we're in the frame of the first astronaut (2m) moving at 0.6c. The second astronaut (3m) is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So from the first astronaut's frame, the second's speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

The numerator is (0.5 - 0.6)c = (-0.1)c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/0.7 = approximately -0.1428c. But since speed is a magnitude, it's 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So that would be the relative speed between them.

Wait, but the question asks for the relative speed. So that's around 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c. So now I can eliminate A, B, and maybe one of C or D.

Next, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma * mc². So for each one, I calculate their individual energies and then add them together.

First, for the 2m astronaut moving at 0.6c. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So v=0.6c, so v²=0.36c². 1 - 0.36 is 0.64. Square root of 0.64 is 0.8. So gamma is 1 / 0.8 = 1.25. So energy is 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Wait, wait. Because the mass is 2m, so plugging into E = gamma * m_total * c². So yeah, 2m *1.25 = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut is 3m at 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E = 1.1547 * 3m * c² = approximately 3.464 mc².

Adding both energies: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.9
