Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about figuring out the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as a star with spots. Hmm.

Alright, let's read the problem again. So, the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. They say that because of the spots, when the star rotates, the brightness changes, and this looks like an exoplanet transit. So we need to find what the planet's radius would have to be to cause the same change in brightness as the spots do.

Wait, I remember that when a planet transits a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of that dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. So Delta F over F is (R_planet / R_star)^2, right? Because the area is proportional to the square of the radius.

But in this case, the star has spots. So when the spots rotate into and out of view, the observed brightness changes. But the spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, the star appears dimmer. How does that work?

The filling factor is 20%, which I think is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So if the star's surface area is A, the spots cover 0.2*A. And each spot is cooler—1000K less than the star's 6000K. So each spot's temperature is 5000K.

Wait, the change in brightness would depend on how much less light the spots emit compared to the surrounding areas. So the star's total brightness without spots is L = 4πR²σTeff^4. But with spots, part of the surface is at a lower temperature.

So the normal (non-spotty) star emits L0 = 4πR²σ(6000)^4.

But the star with spots emits L = L0 * (1 - 0.2) + 0.2 * 4πR²σ(5000)^4.

Wait, no. Alternatively, the spots make up 20% of the surface area, and each spot has a lower temperature. So the total luminosity is the sum of the normal areas and the spotted areas.

So L = (0.8 * L_sun_normal) + (0.2 * L_spot). But wait, each spot isn't the same as the star's area. Let's think in terms of the star's total luminosity.

The star without spots emits L0 = 4π R² σ Teff^4.

When 20% of the surface is covered by spots, each spot has a temperature of 5000K. So the luminosity from the spots is 0.2 * 4π R² σ (5000)^4. The rest of the star (80%) emits at 6000K. So total luminosity is:

L = (0.8 * L0) + (0.2 * L_spot_part).

Wait, but L0 is 4π R² σ (6000)^4. So the non-spot part is 0.8 * L0. The spot part is 0.2 * 4π R² σ (5000)^4.

So L = 0.8 L0 + 0.2 * [4π R² σ (5000)^4 ].

But 4π R² σ is the same for both terms, so let's factor that out.

L = [0.8*(6000^4) + 0.2*(5000^4)] * (4π R² σ).

Let me compute the fraction of L relative to L0. The ratio L/L0 would be:

[0.8*(6000^4 / 6000^4) + 0.2*(5000^4 / 6000^4)] = 0.8 + 0.2*(5000/6000)^4.

Calculating that:

5000 is 5/6 of 6000, so (5/6)^4 is (625/1296). Let me compute that:

625 divided by 1296. Let me do 625 ÷ 1296. Let's see, 1296 is approximately 1300. 625 is about half of 1300, so about 0.48225. So 0.2 * 0.48225 is about 0.09645.

So total ratio is 0.8 + 0.09645 = 0.89645. So L is about 0.89645 * L0.

Wait, but that's the total luminosity of the star with spots. But when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. So when the star is viewed such that the spot area is on the near side, the observed luminosity would be less than when the spot is on the far side.

Wait, no. The star is rotating, and only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots contribute less light. When the other hemisphere (with no spots) is facing us, the spots are on the far side, so the total light is higher.

Wait, no, perhaps it's the
