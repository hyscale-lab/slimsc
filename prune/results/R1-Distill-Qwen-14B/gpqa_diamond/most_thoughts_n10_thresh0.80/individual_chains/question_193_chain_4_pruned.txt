Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx^5). And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance r. The options are various powers of r.

Hmm, right. I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Like, parallax plx is equal to 1 over distance in parsecs, right? So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, parallax is defined as the reciprocal of the distance in parsecs. So, plx (in arcseconds) = 1 / d (in parsecs). So if d increases, plx decreases.

So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx^5). Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N would be proportional to 1/( (1/d)^5 ), which simplifies to d^5.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me make sure. Let's say plx = 1/d. So 1/(plx^5) is 1/( (1/d)^5 ) = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. Oh right, so it's the number per unit distance. So dN/dr is the derivative of N with respect to d.

Wait, no. Wait, the question is phrased as "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)"? So it's the change in number per unit distance. So perhaps it's the derivative of N with respect to d.

So N = k * (1/(plx^5)), and plx = 1/d, so N = k * d^5. Then, the derivative dN/dd is 5k d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases with d^4. Wait, but waitâ€”no, because the number of stars is already given in a specific region. Wait, I might be misunderstanding the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the way the question is phrased refers to the number density
