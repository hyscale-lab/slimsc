Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons and protons are the same. Also, a precipitate G forms, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Then, there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to give a product with 2 oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog.

Hmm. I need to figure out what X is. Let's break it down.

First, the gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, for a molecule, the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. Let's think about which gases fit that. Well, one possibility is CO₂, but wait, CO₂ has 6 protons and 8 neutrons? No, wait, CO₂ is C (6 protons) and two O (each with 8 protons). But wait, the molecule as a whole... Or maybe it's a diatomic molecule like O₂ or N₂?

Wait, W is a gas, so maybe it's something like H₂O, but no, because H₂O is not a diatomic gas. Alternatively, maybe it's something like CO, but wait, CO has 1 C and 1 O. Let me think about the number of protons and neutrons in each atom.

Wait, the molecule as a whole has equal number of protons and neutrons. Or per atom in the molecule? The wording says "gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." Wait, the molecule as a whole? Or each atom in the molecule?

Hmm. Let's clarify. The molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So, for example, if the molecule is H₂O, the total protons are 2 (H) + 8 (O) = 10, and the total neutrons would be (each H is 1 neutron, assuming protium) 2*(1) + 8 (O's neutrons, since O is 16-8=8? Wait, no, O is 8 protons, so if
