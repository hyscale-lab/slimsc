Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal and all the angles equal as well. So in this case, the angles α, β, and γ are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance... I think that refers to the lattice parameter 'a'. So a = 10 Å.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Oh right, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by (a) divided by the square root of (h² + k² + l² - hk - hl - kl) multiplied by some factor depending on the angles. Wait, but in a cubic system, the formula is d = a/(sqrt(h² +k² +l²)). But rhombohedral is a bit different because the angles are not 90 degrees.

Wait, the formula for a rhombohedral system is a bit more complicated. I think it's d = (a) / sqrt( [h² +k² +l²] - [hk + hl + kl] * (cos θ)/(1 - cos θ) ) ), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal system.

Oh right, the general formula when the lattice is not cubic is:

1/d^2 = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (hk + hl + kl)/(a²) * (cos α / (1 - cos α) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's better to look up the formula for a rhombohedral lattice. Oh wait, I should recall that for a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell can be considered as a cube that's been skewed, so the angles between the axes are all equal to α (which is 30 degrees here).

The interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl) (cos α) ) )

Wait, is that correct? Because I'm trying to remember; I think that's the case when the angles are
