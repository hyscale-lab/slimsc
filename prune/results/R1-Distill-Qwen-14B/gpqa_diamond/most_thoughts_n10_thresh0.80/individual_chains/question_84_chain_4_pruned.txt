Okay, so I have this question about solving higher dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. The question is about the key factor that allows converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one, specifically mentioning the matrix exponential function being approximated by a fractional approximation.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with partial differential equations like the heat equation, especially in multiple dimensions, we often use numerical methods. Finite difference methods approximate the derivatives, and when it comes to solving the resulting system of equations, matrix operations are involved. The matrix exponential function is used in the context of solving these systems, maybe for time evolution or something like that.

The question is about parallel splitting. I think parallel algorithms often break down the problem into parts that can be computed simultaneously. So, the key here would be how the matrix exponential is approximated in a way that allows for parallel processing.

The options are A to D. Let me think about each one.

Option A: Stability analysis. That's about ensuring the numerical method doesn't blow up or become inaccurate. But how does stability relate to making the algorithm parallel? Stability is important for correctness, but I don't think it's the main factor in parallelism. So probably not A.

Option B: Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions. Nonlocal boundary conditions might complicate things, but how does that tie into parallelism? I'm not sure. Maybe if the boundary conditions are nonlocal, it affects how the matrix is structured, allowing for parallel computation. Not sure, but I'll keep it in mind.

Option C: Complex roots of fractional approximation. Fractional approximation methods, like Padé approximants, are used to approximate functions, here the matrix exponential. If the approximation has complex roots, that might affect the eigenvalues of the matrix. But how does that help in parallel algorithms? Maybe if the matrix can be diagonalized or decomposed into independent parts, each part can be processed in parallel. Wait, complex roots could lead to eigenvalues that are complex, which might mean the resulting system can be split into smaller, independent subproblems, each handled in parallel. That sounds plausible.

Option D: Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation. Partial fractions are a way to decompose a function into simpler fractions. If the approximation can be written as a sum of simpler terms, perhaps each term can be handled in parallel. For example, if the matrix exponential is written as a sum of exponentials of smaller matrices, each of which can be computed independently, then you could compute them in parallel and add the results. That would definitely allow parallelism because each term's computation is independent. So D sounds like a key factor.

So the question is, which one is the key factor for converting to a parallel algorithm. The process of splitting the matrix into parts that can be handled separately would require some form of decomposition, like partial fractions (option D) or perhaps having eigenvalues that allow for such a split (like complex roots, option C).

Wait, the question mentions 'fractional approximation', which I think refers to using a Padé approximant or similar. The Padé method approximates functions as a ratio of polynomials. If the approximation can be split into a partial fraction decomposition, each term would be a simpler function, perhaps leading to a diagonal matrix or something that can be computed in parallel.

Alternatively, the presence of complex roots in the approximation might allow for certain properties that make the matrix easier to handle in parallel. But the question is about the key factor in converting the algorithm to parallel, so perhaps it's about how the approximation can be broken down.

So, the options relate to the properties of the fractional approximation. The key factor is probably whether the approximation can be expressed as a sum of terms that can be computed in parallel.

Wait, the question says the matrix exponential is approximated by a fractional approximation. Then, the key factor in converting to a parallel algorithm is something about that approximation.

If the fractional approximation can be expressed as a sum of terms that can be evaluated independently, like partial fractions, then each term can be computed in parallel, which would make the overall algorithm parallel. So the linear partial fraction decomposition would enable this. Or, if the approximation allows the matrix to be split into blocks that can be handled in parallel.

Alternatively, complex roots might affect the stability and the nature of the approximation but not
