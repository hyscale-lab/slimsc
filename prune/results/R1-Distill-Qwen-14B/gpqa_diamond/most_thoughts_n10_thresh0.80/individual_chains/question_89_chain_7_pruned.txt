Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow and think it through.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, very rigid, with four cyclohexane rings fused together in a particular way. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions. 

Heating this compound with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and when it's heated with vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalides), it can cause elimination reactions, forming alkenes. Wait, but 1,3-dibromo might not be vicinal. Or wait, adamantane's structure might make the positions adjacent in some way. Because in adamantane derivatives, the numbering can be a bit tricky. For example, 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent carbons in the structure because of the way the rings are fused. So maybe they’re on adjacent carbons, making a vicinal dihalide. 

So the reaction would be dehydrohalogenation. KOH would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of an alkene. But since it's a vicinal dihalide, perhaps it's a double elimination? Or maybe each Br leaves in a double elimination, leading to an alkene. 

Looking at the product 1: they mention a light yellow solid. The 1H NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a singlet. That could be a -OH group, maybe from a diol? Wait, but when you eliminate, you form an alkene. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide? Because when vicinal dihalides are treated with a base, sometimes an epoxide can form. But wait, KOH is more for elimination, not necessarily epoxidation. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether, but I'm not sure. 

Wait, the IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which suggests a ketone or maybe an ester or aldehyde. But considering the reaction conditions with KOH, perhaps it's a ketone. How would that happen? Maybe the dihalide underwent a double elimination to form a ketone. Oh wait, wait—another possibility: when two adjacent dihalides eliminate, especially if they are vicinal, they can form an alkene. But the IR doesn't show a C=C peak (which is around 1650 cm^-1). So maybe the product isn't an alkene. 

Wait, perhaps the dihalide is treated with KOH in a way that it forms a carbonyl. Wait, another reaction I'm trying to recall: the solvolysis of dihalides, but maybe it's more about elimination. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think about the product. The NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a high chemical shift, possibly an O-H, but that's a broad peak usually. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like in an epoxide. Wait, but an epoxide's protons are usually around 3.5-4.5 ppm, a triplet or something. Alternatively, the singlet might be an acetal or something else. 

But wait, the IR shows 1720 cm^-1 which is a strong carbonyl. So the product has a carbonyl group. So perhaps the dihalide is undergoing a substitution reaction. But with KOH? That might not be the case. Wait, another possibility: when dihalides are treated with strong bases, especially in certain conditions, they can form ketones via elimination. Oh, wait! The Corey-Fuchs reaction? No, that's for different things. Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination where the two bromides leave, and the adjacent carbons form a carbonyl. Like, two eliminations to form a ketone. That would produce a diketone or a single ketone. Let me imagine the structure: 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules upon heating with KOH, so each Br is on adjacent carbons, so removing each Br and a hydrogen from each adjacent carbon, leading to the formation of a double bond between those carbons. Wait, but that would form an alkene, not a ketone. So maybe the reaction is different.

Wait, unless the elimination isn't just between the two bromine atoms. Maybe the structure is such that elimination leads to a carbonyl. Let me think. Suppose each Br is on adjacent carbons, and when they eliminate, each Br leaves, taking a hydrogen with them, which would form adjacent double bonds or something else. Or perhaps the two eliminations form a ketone. Oh wait! Wait a minute, maybe each Br is on a secondary carbon, and eliminating both would form a carbonyl. Let me think of the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the base causes an elimination where one Br leaves, and then the other, but I'm not exactly getting it. Maybe I should think about the product's NMR and IR. So the IR has a strong carbonyl at 1720, which is a ketone. So Product 1 is probably a ketone. Looking at the NMR, the 4.79 ppm (2H) might be a methylene group next to a carbonyl. Or maybe it's an oxygen-bearing group. Wait, maybe it's an alcohol, but that would be a broad peak, not a singlet. Alternatively, perhaps it's a geminal diol, but that's less likely. 

Wait, another possibility: the reaction forms an epoxide. When a dihalide is treated with a base, like KOH, it can form an epoxide. But the IR of an epoxide doesn't have a carbonyl. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is an adamantanol. But then the IR would show an -OH (broad), but in the NMR, the 4.79 (2H) could be an -OH, but that's not a singlet usually. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol, but again, the IR would show an -OH.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cycloketone. Because the IR shows a strong C=O, so maybe the two Brs were on adjacent carbons, and upon elimination, they form a carbonyl group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of the synthesis again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH (excess) at 240°C. The product is a solid with a carbonyl in IR. So maybe the reaction is a double elimination where each Br is eliminated with a hydrogen to form a carbonyl. So:

If two adjacent carbons each lose a Br and a hydrogen, perhaps forming a double bond between them. But that would be an alkene, which doesn't have a carbonyl. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe each Br is on a carbon that can deprotonate and eliminate, leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe each Br is on a carbon that is connected to another carbon. So for example, each Br is on a carbon that, when deprotonated and the Br leaves, the adjacent carbons each lose a hydrogen and a Br, leading to a carbonyl in the middle. For example, if you have two Brs on adjacent carbons, each losing Br and a hydrogen from the adjacent carbon, that could form a carbonyl.

Let me draw it mentally. Suppose the structure is:

Br
|
C - C
   |
   Br

Wait, no, because in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the positions are 1 and 3, which are not adjacent. Hmm, perhaps in adamantane, the 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent carbons. Let me think about the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so each carbon is connected in a way that 1 and 3 are across a ring. Hmm, perhaps they're not adjacent, which complicates the elimination.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen, leading to a carbocation, but that seems less likely because KOH is a strong base and a weak nucleophile. But with heat, maybe E2 mechanisms are favored.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane ring?
