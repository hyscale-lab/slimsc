Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also mention that the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The given formation constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex, is 5x10^10.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. So when EDTA binds Ca²+, it forms a complex. The formation constant, K, is a measure of the stability of that complex. The higher the K, the more stable the complex.

Wait, the problem gives the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. So I'm assuming that the complex is fully formed because the pH is ideal. So the concentration of the complex [CaY²-] is 0.02 M.

I think the next thing is to write the dissociation equation for the complex. The complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- (or Y^4-). The reaction would be:

CaY²- ⇌ Ca²+ + Y^4-

The formation constant K for this reaction would be the inverse of the dissociation constant. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formation constant, Kf, is for the formation of the complex from its ions. So the formation equation is:

Ca²+ + Y^4- ⇌ CaY²- ; Kf = 5x10^10.

So the dissociation would have a K equal to 1/Kf. Because K for dissociation is the inverse of the formation K. So Kd = 1/(Kf) = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Wait, but let me get this right. Formation constant Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So if the complex dissociates, the K for that reverse reaction would be 1/Kf. So yes, K for dissociation is 2e-11.

But wait, the problem is probably looking for the concentration of Ca²+ in solution. Since the complex is 0.02 M, we can set up the equilibrium expression.

Let me denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Since each mole of CaY²- dissociates into one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of Y^4-, the concentration of both Ca²+ and Y^4- would be x, assuming that the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M and that the dissociation is x.

Wait, but in reality, when the complex dissociates, the concentration of Ca²+ and Y^4- would be equal to x, and the concentration of the complex would be 0.02 - x. But if x is very small compared to 0.02, then 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. Since Kd is very small (2e-11), x will be very small, so we can approximate.

So the dissociation equilibrium expression is:

Kd = [Ca²+][Y^4-] / [CaY²-] 

Since Kd is 2e-11, and [CaY²-] is approximately 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [Y^4-] are both x.

So Kd ≈ (x)(x) / 0.02 = x² / 0.02.

Setting that equal to 2e-11:

x² / 0.02 = 2e-11

Multiply both sides by 0.02:

x² = 2e-11 * 0.02 = 4e-13

Taking the square root:

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) which is 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-13's square root is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7, but wait, 1e-13 is (1e-7)^2? Wait, no, 1e-6 squared is 1e-12, so 1e-13's square root is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7.

So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7 M. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's probably the answer.

Wait, let me double-check. Kd is 2e-11. The expression is x² / 0.02 = 2e-11 → x² = (2e-11)(0.02) = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 → Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, so 2e-6.5 is 2 * (1e-6.5) → which is about 6.32e-7, as I thought earlier. So yes, option C is correct.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we start by considering the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is the inverse of the formation constant \( K_f \), so:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

Let the concentration of dissociated \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{Y}^{4-}\) be \( x \). The equilibrium concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CaY}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{Y}^{4-}] = x.
\]

The dissociation equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}.
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
K_d = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = K_d \cdot 0.02 = (2 \times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions in solution is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
