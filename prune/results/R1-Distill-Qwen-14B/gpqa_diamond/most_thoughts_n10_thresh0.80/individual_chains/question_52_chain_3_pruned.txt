Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me read through it again and try to break it down. 

The question is about a star's properties when it has and doesn't have dark spots. Hmm. So the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main focus is on the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes—comparing when there are no spots to when there are spots.

Wait, let's think about the physics here. The ratio of atoms in two energy levels in LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium) is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio (n1/n2) is proportional to exp(ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

But wait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So when the star has spots, the average T is lower, 5500 K instead of 6000 K. 

The transition wavelength corresponds to approximately 1448 Å. Wait, what's the significance of that wavelength? Oh, right, that's in the ultraviolet range. Ti I (neutral Titanium) has a transition at around that wavelength. So we can find the energy difference ΔE using the wavelength. Alternatively, maybe we can use the relation between wavelength and energy.

So the energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. Oh, but wait, when an atom absorbs a photon, it transitions between energy levels. So the energy difference ΔE between levels 2 and 1 would be equal to the photon's energy. So level 2 is higher than level 1 if the atom is absorbing a photon of that wavelength.

Wait, but the transition is between two levels, so ΔE = hc/λ. Let me calculate that. 

h is Planck's constant, which is about 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. c is speed of light, 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. λ is 1448 Ångströms. Wait, converting that to meters. 1 Å is 1e-10 m, so 1448 Å is 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) 

Let me compute that: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25. Divided by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈
