Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, angular momentum... I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators are related to spin matrices. The question gives me some specific matrices and asks about their eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Let's try to break this down.

The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), right? And S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row (0, -i) and the second row (i, 0). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, the Pauli matrices. Specifically, that looks like the Y Pauli matrix, which is usually written as σy = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Wait, but let me think about the properties of Pauli matrices. The eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1. Because, for any Pauli matrix σ, the eigenvalues satisfy σ² = I, so the eigenvalues squared are 1, so eigenvalues are ±1.

So σy has eigenvalues ±1. Then Ay is c times σy, so its eigenvalues should be c*(±1). Let me compute that. c is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues a would be h/(4π) * 1 and h/(4π)* (-1). So a = ± h/(4π). Wait, but looking at the options, none of them directly say that. Let me check the options again.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2π h, real parts ±h/(4π). Wait, that can't be right because eigenvalues of Ay should be real, right? Because angular momentum components are Hermitian operators. Wait, is Ay Hermitian?

Wait, let's see. Ay is c*S. S is σy multiplied by c. σy is Hermitian because its conjugate transpose is the same. Because σy's elements are 0, -i, i, 0. The conjugate transpose would swap the off-diagonal elements and take complex conjugates: 0, i, -i, 0. But that's exactly the negative of σy. Wait, no, wait: σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], and its conjugate transpose is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. Which is -σy. Oh wait, so σy is anti-Hermitian? Because (σy)† = -σy. So σy is anti-Hermitian, which means that iσy is Hermitian. Hmm, wait, because (iσy)† = (-i)(σy)† = (-i)(-σy) = iσy. So yes, iσy is Hermitian.

But in our case, Ay is c * σy, where c is h/(4π). So if c is real, then Ay is anti-Hermitian, because (c σy)† = c* (σy)† = c * (-σy) = - (c σy). So Ay is anti-Hermitian. Wait, but wait, angular momentum operators are supposed to be Hermitian. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, the intrinsic angular momentum operator J is given by ħ times the Pauli matrices divided by 2, but wait, for spin-½ particles. Oh, wait, the muon is a spin-½ particle. But the given operator Ay is c times S, where S is σy.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that the standard spin matrices are S_x, S_y, S_z, each of which is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So S_y = (ħ/2) σy. So if in this problem, Ay is c * S, and S is σy, perhaps c is (ħ/2)? Wait, no, the problem says c is h/(4π). Let me compute that.
