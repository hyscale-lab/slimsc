Okay, so I've got this question about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let's try to think this through. So the setup is a glass with index of refraction n moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as a light beam. The light is moving toward an observer in the lab. And the question is asking what the speed of the light is relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is generally lower than in a vacuum. Oh right, the formula is v_medium = c / n. But wait, that's when the medium is at rest relative to the observer. But in this case, the glass medium itself is moving. So do I need to consider any sort of velocity addition here?

I think this relates to special relativity because we're dealing with velocities and the speed of light. Oh wait, but the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. So the light beam is propagating through the glass, which is itself moving. So I guess I have to calculate the speed of the light as observed from the lab frame, considering that the glass is moving.

Wait, but the glass is moving in the same direction as the light. So the light's speed relative to the glass is c/n, right? Because inside the medium, the speed is v = c/n. But the glass itself is moving at velocity v. So the observer in the lab will see the light moving at what speed?

In classical mechanics, you might just add the velocities. Like, if the medium is moving at v and the light is moving at v_medium in the same direction, then
