Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and break it down. So, the question is about detecting transits of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to pick the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited observing time.

Alright, both planets were detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. But their masses are the same. Oh, but the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So, Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period, meaning it's closer to its star, right?

Also, both have circular orbits. The stars they orbit have the same radii, but Planet_1's host is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Hmm, interesting. So, the host star of Planet_2 is slightly evolved but same radius as Planet_1's. I think that because more massive stars are usually larger, but in this case, maybe Planet_1's star is more massive but same radius as Planet_2's, perhaps because it's earlier in its life or something. But the radius being the same is key.

The question is about the probability of a transit. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbit. The formula for transit probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by something related to the orbital distance, maybe the eccentricity and inclination, but since both have circular orbits, that part is the same. Wait, the main factor is the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the size of the star's orbit in the sky, right?

Wait, no, the transit probability is actually proportional to (R_p / a)^2, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Or wait, I'm a bit hazy on that. Let me think. The transit probability depends on the ratio of the star's size to the planet's orbital distance. Oh, wait, more accurately, the probability is roughly (R_*/ a)^2, but that's not quite right. I think the formula is (R_p / a)^2, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. The planet will transit when the orbital plane is edge-on. The probability depends on how likely the planet's orbit is to be aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our perspective. The formula for the probability is (R_* + R_p) / a, where a is the semi-major axis. But since R_p is much smaller than R_*, it's approximately R_* / a. But wait, no, I think the correct probability is (R_*/a)^2 multiplied by a factor considering the inclination. Wait, I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, I remember that the probability P is given by (R_*/a)^2, where R_* is the radius of the star, and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Because a larger a (farther away) makes the transit less likely, as the apparent size of the star is smaller in the sky.

Wait, let me think again. The transit probability is the area of the star (π R_*/²) divided by the area swept by the planet's orbital plane. Or maybe it's the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's
