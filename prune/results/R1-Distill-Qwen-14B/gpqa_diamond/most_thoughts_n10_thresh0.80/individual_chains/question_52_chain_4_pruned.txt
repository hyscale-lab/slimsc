Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what's going on.

So the question is about a star that's being studied by astronomers. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—specifically, the ratio when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. And we can assume the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm, okay, so I remember that the ratio of populations in different energy levels in a star's atmosphere is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor tells us how the number of particles in a higher energy state compares to a lower one. The formula is something like n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k*T)), where g2 and g1 are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this case, the ratio is n1/n2. Because the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the Teff is lower. Let me think about how that affects the ratio.

So when the star doesn't have spots, the Teff is 6000 K. When it does have spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. Oh wait, but wait—does the Teff here refer to the entire star or the unspotted regions? Because when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the total effective temperature changes. I think the Teff given is the overall photospheric temperature, so it's an average that takes into account the spots.

But wait, in LTE, the photosphere is in local thermal equilibrium. So each region (spot or not) would have its own temperature. But the observed effective temperature is the average. Hmm, but the problem says that when 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So perhaps I should model the star as having two regions: 60% of the surface at 6000 K (unspotted) and 40% at a lower temperature (spots). But wait, that might complicate things because the overall Teff is a combination of these.

But maybe the question is assuming that the entire photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. So perhaps when spots are present, the effective temperature of the entire photosphere (as observed) is 5500 K, regardless of the actual temperature of the spots themselves. Because the spots are darker, they emit less, so the average would be lower.

Wait, the problem says when the star's surface is not covered by spots, its Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So, the observed Teff is lower when spots are present.

But how does this affect the ratio of Ti levels? The ratio is n1/n2, which depends on the temperature. Let me think about the Boltzmann equation again.

The Boltzmann factor is exponential in temperature. So, for a transition, the ratio (n1/n2) would be proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) times (g1/g2). Wait, wait, because n2/n1 = (g2/g
