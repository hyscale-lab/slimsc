Alright, so I have this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, okay, let's try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll think it through step by step.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the photosphere is the layer of a star where photosynthesis happens, but wait, no, photosynthesis is for plants. Oh wait, in stars, the photosphere is the outer layer where light is emitted. Right, and LTE stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, which I think means that in each small region, the gas behaves as if it's in thermal equilibrium. So the excitation states of atoms would follow the Boltzmann distribution.

The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I remember that the Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy states to temperature. The formula is something like the ratio of populations being equal to the exponential of the energy difference over (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant.

So, let me recall: the Boltzmann factor says that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy states (E1 and E2, where E2 > E1) is (n2/n1) = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). But wait, in this question, star_1 has twice as excited iron atoms as star_2. So perhaps I should model the excitation level as the population of a higher energy state compared to the ground state.

Wait, but the problem states that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So maybe the ratio of the excited states (E) to the ground states (G) is 2 for star_1 and something else for star_2. Or wait, perhaps it's the other way around. Let me think.

Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So maybe for a particular energy level, the excitation is higher. So perhaps the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (n_E) to the ground state (n_G) in star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Wait, actually, I think the term
