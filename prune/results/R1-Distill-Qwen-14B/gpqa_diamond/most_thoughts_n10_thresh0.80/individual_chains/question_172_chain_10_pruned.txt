Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let me think about what I know. The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh right, LTE stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, so I guess I can use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, Boltzmann distribution relates the populations of different energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium. The formula is something like the ratio of populations N_i over N_j equals exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(k T) ), right? So if the energy levels are E_i and E_j, and E_j is higher than E_i, then the higher level has less population.

In this problem, the energy difference is given, so let's call it ΔE = E_j - E_i = 1.38e-23 J. Now, the question states that the excitation in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2. So, the population of the excited state in star_1, N1, is twice that in star_2, N2. So, N1/N2 = 2.

Using the Boltzmann equation, N1/N2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) and similarly for star_2, N1/N2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )? Wait, no, wait. Maybe I should think more carefully.

Wait, in star_1, the ratio is N_i (excited) over N_j (ground state) equals exp(-ΔE/(k T1)). Similarly for star_2, it's N_i / N_j = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But in this case, the problem says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So, perhaps the ratio N1 (excited) / N2 (excited) = 2. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me rephrase.

Let me define N1 as the number of excited atoms in star_1, and N2 as the same in star_2. Then N1 = 2 N2. But wait, that might not be the right approach because the total number of atoms in each star's photosphere might be different. Alternatively, maybe
