Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about finding the normalization constant 'a' in the wave function of a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. But wait, the setup says that when measuring the position, the particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this interval, right?

Wait, actually, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. But they mention that particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. So maybe the wave function is non-zero only in that region. Or perhaps the given wave function is valid only for x between 1 and 3. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. But to proceed, I'll assume that the wave function is non-zero between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That seems to have a real part and an imaginary part. Oh wait, no, wait. Maybe I'm misreading it. Let me check: the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. So it's a complex function, but perhaps that's okay because wave functions can be complex. But when it comes to normalization, the integral of the absolute square of the
