Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I remember from my studies that mesons are subatomic particles, and a resonance usually refers to a particle that doesn't exist for very long. Decay distance... right, that's the average distance the particle travels before it decays.

The question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters.

Wait, I think the decay width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime. Oh right, the uncertainty principle! The product of the energy uncertainty (Γ) and the time uncertainty (τ) should be on the order of ħ. So Γ * τ ≈ ħ. That gives τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Then, the mean decay distance is the velocity of the particle multiplied by the lifetime τ.

But first, I need to find the velocity of the meson X. Since it's produced with energy E_X, which is higher than its rest mass, I should calculate its velocity using relativistic equations.

The rest mass energy is m_X c², which is 1.2 GeV. But E_X is 8 GeV. So the energy is much higher than the rest mass, meaning it's moving relativistically.

The relativistic energy equation is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So I can solve for p (momentum) first.

E_X = 8 GeV; m_X c² = 1.2 GeV. Let's plug in:

(8)^2 = (p c)^2 + (1.2)^2.

Calculating that: 64 = (p c)^2 + 1.44. So (p c)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 → p c ≈ sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV.

So p ≈ 7.91 GeV / c. Now, the velocity v can be found using the relation between momentum and mass-energy. Another formula I remember is β = v/c = (pc)/(E), so β = (7.91 GeV/c) / (8 GeV) ) → 7.91 / 8 ≈ 0.98875. So v ≈ 0.98875c.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 7.91 divided by 8 is 0.98875, so v is about 0.98875 times the speed of light, which is approximately 2.96e8 m/s.

Next, calculate the lifetime τ. Using Γ = 320 MeV. Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. But wait, I'm a bit confused. The width Γ is the total decay rate, so Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But I need to make sure about the units here. ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ is given in MeV, so I should convert that to GeV to match units.

Γ = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me calculate that again. 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s? No, because 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 → 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 s.

Now, the mean decay distance L is v * τ. So L = v * τ.

v is approximately 0.98875c. c is about 3e8 m/s. Let's compute v:

v ≈ 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.96625e8 m/s.

Wait, more accurately: 3e8 is 300,000,000 m/s. 0.98875 * 3e8 = 296,625,000 m/s.

Now, multiply v by τ: 2.96625e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute that: 2.96625e8 * 2.056875e-24 = ?

Calculating the exponents: 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16.

So 2.96625 * 2.056875 ≈ let's see. 3 * 2 =6, but more accurately:

2.96625 * 2.056875 → Let's compute 2.96625 * 2 = 5.9325. 2.96625 * 0.056875 → approximately 2.96625 * 0.05 is 0.14831, and 2.96625 * 0.006875 is about 0.02048. So total for the second part is about 0.16879. So total is 5.9325 + 0.16879 ≈ 6.1013.

So approximately 6.1013e-16 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 5.0223e-16 m, and D is 4.0655e-16 m. Hmm, perhaps my calculation is off. Maybe I made a mistake in the velocity or the lifetime.

Wait, perhaps I should use precise calculations instead of approximations.

Let me re-calculate the momentum:

E =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.

E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 → (8)^2 = (pc)^2 + (1.2)^2 → 64 = (pc)^2 + 1.44 → (pc)^2=62.56 → pc = sqrt(62.56) = 7.91 GeV.

So p = 7.91 GeV / c.

Then, β = (pc)/(E) = (7.91)/(8) = 0.98875.

So β = 0.98875 → v = 0.98875 c.

Now, let's compute gamma factor (Lorentz factor) gamma = E/(m c²) → 8/(1.2) = 6.666... So gamma is about 6.6667.

Wait, that's an important point because the mean lifetime is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime. Oh wait, no, wait. The lifetime as we calculated earlier is τ = ħ / Γ, which is the total lifetime, including relativistic effects. Wait, no, wait. Γ is the total decay width, which already accounts for the particle's energy. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let's think again.

The decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ via Γ = ħ / τ, regardless of the particle's energy. So the lifetime τ is the same in the lab frame as in its rest frame because the decay width in the rest frame is Γ_rest, but in the lab frame, it's Γ_lab. Wait, perhaps I should look more carefully.

Wait, the decay width Γ is the same in all frames because it's an invariant. No, wait, the decay width is actually frame-dependent. Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think of the mean lifetime in the particle's rest frame. Oh wait, no, because the width Γ in the lab frame is different from the rest frame. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the mean decay length is L = cτ * βγ. Because the lifetime in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime by a factor of gamma, and the velocity is beta times c.

Wait, I think the correct approach is to calculate the mean proper lifetime (tau_0) using tau_0 = ħ/(Γ), and then the lab frame lifetime is tau = gamma tau_0. Then, the mean decay length is L = v tau = beta c gamma tau_0.

So perhaps I missed the gamma factor in my initial calculation. Because if the particle is moving at a high gamma (6.6667), its lifetime in the lab frame is longer by that factor.

So let's redo the steps.

Compute tau_0 = ħ / Γ. But wait, Γ here is the total decay width, which in the rest frame is given by Γ_rest = ħ / tau_0. So in the lab frame, the width is Γ_lab = Γ_rest * gamma, because the particle is moving and the width broadens due to relativistic effects.

Wait, no, actually, the total decay width Γ is the same in all frames because it's an invariant. Or is it? I'm a bit confused about this. Alternatively, perhaps the width Γ in the lab frame is related to the width in the rest frame. Let me think.

The decay width in the
