Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question is about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, stability constants are something to do with how stable a complex is, right? So higher beta means the complex is more stable.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are beta1=9, beta2=40, beta3=63, beta4=16. Wait, wait, the numbering is a bit off. Does this mean that each subsequent beta corresponds to the next complex? Like, beta1 is for Co(SCN), beta2 for Co(SCN)_2, and so on up to beta4 being Co(SCN)_4?

The question is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands attached, right? So that's the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex.

So the plan is to calculate the fraction of all cobalt species that are the dithiocyanato (n=2) complex. That fraction multiplied by 100 will give the percentage.

Stability constants work in a way where each beta is the formation constant for the next complex. So, for example, the formation constant K1 for CoSCN^+ is beta1=9. K2 for Co(SCN)_2^2+ is beta2=40, but wait, actually, I think the overall formation constant for the n=2 complex would be the product of the stepwise constants up to that point. Or maybe each beta represents the stepwise constant for adding each SCN-.

Wait, in stability constants, beta_n is the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands. So the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) would have a stability constant beta_n. So in this case, beta1 is for [CoSCN]^+, beta2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+), beta3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^(3+), and beta4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^4+.

Wait, but the problem says the stability constants are beta1=9,
