Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, with the eigenvalue +ħ/2. We're given the components of the operator P (Px, Py, Pz) as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. We need to determine the elements of the normalized eigenvector.

Hmm, let's recap. The operator P is a vector operator, so it's composed of components P_x, P_y, P_z. The eigenvalue equation would be something like (P · n) |ψ> = (± ħ/2) |ψ>, where n is a unit vector in the x-z plane. Since the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2, we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to this value.

Wait, but how does the direction n come into play here? Oh, right, when you have an operator in the direction of an arbitrary unit vector n, the operator can be written as P·n, which is P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero. So n = (n_x, 0, n_z), and since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. The direction is arbitrary but in the x-z plane, so n can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but since it's in the x-z plane, maybe φ is zero? Or wait, no, φ could be any angle but confined to x-z plane. Hmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of θ where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Or wait, wait, usually θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, so in the x-z plane, φ is zero or not? Wait, φ is the azimuthal angle. If the vector is in the x-z plane, then φ=0 or φ=π, maybe, depending on direction. So perhaps, n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. But I'm not entirely sure; maybe I should proceed without assuming that, but just knowing that n has components (a, 0, b) with a² + b² = 1.

But, wait, the operator P is given as components. Let me look at the components:

Px is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
Py is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i],[i, 0]]
Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

These are the standard Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. So the operator P·n would be (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y = 0, so P·n = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).

So, the matrix for P·n would be (ħ/2) times [n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] + n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] ]

That simplifies to (ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

So we're looking for the eigenvectors of this matrix corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is (P·n - λ I)|v> = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue. So,

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] * (ħ/2) - λ I = 0.

But since λ is given as +ħ/2, let's substitute λ = ħ/2. So,

(ħ/2)[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] - (ħ/2) I = 0.

Factor out ħ/2:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z - 1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z - 1] ] = 0.

Since ħ/2 is not zero, the matrix must be zero:

[ n_z -1    n_x      ] = 0
[ n_x    -n_z -1 ]

So the equations are:

(n_z - 1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0
n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 =0

Let me write the first equation: (n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0.

From this, we can express v2 in terms of v1.

v2 = [ (1 - n_z) / n_x ] v1.

Wait, but we can also write the same equation from the second equation. Let's check:

n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 =0 → n_x v1 = (n_z +1) v2 → v2 = [n_x/(n_z +1)] v1.

So we have two expressions for v2:

From first equation: v2 = (1 - n_z)/n_x * v1
From second equation: v2 = n_x/(n_z +1) * v1

Set them equal:

(1 - n_z)/n_x = n_x/(n_z +1)

Multiply both sides by n_x (n_z +1):

(1 - n_z)(n_z +1) = n_x^2

Expand numerator:

(1)(n_z +1) - n_z (n_z +1) ) = 1 + n_z - n_z² -n_z = 1 - n_z²

So 1 - n_z² = n_x².

But since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² =1 → n_x² =1 - n_z².

So 1 - n_z² = n_x² → n_x² =1 -n_z² → which is true. So our earlier expressions are consistent.

So, from the first equation, v2 = (1 -n_z)/n_x * v1.

Let me denote v1 as a variable, say v1 = a.

Then v2 = [ (1 -n_z)/n_x ] a.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [1, (1-n_z)/n_x ]^T.

Now, let's normalize it.

The vector is [1, (1-n_z)/n_x ].

The squared norm is 1^2 + [ (1 -n_z)/n_x ]^2 = 1 + ( (1 - n_z)^2 )/(n_x^2 )

But since n_x² =1 -n_z² as before, substitute:

Denominator is (1 -n_z^2), so:

1 + (1 - 2 n_z + n_z^2 )/(1 -n_z^2 )

Factor numerator: (1 -n_z)^2 = 1 - 2n_z +n_z^2.

So,

1 + [ (1 -n_z)^2 ] / [ (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) ] ]

Simplify: (1 -n_z)^2 divided by (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) → (1 -n_z)/(1 +n_z)

So,

1 + (1-n_z)/(1+n_z) = [ (1+n_z) + (1 -n_z) ) ] / (1 +n_z )

= [ 2 ] / (1 +n_z )

So the squared norm is 2/(1 +n_z ). So the normalization factor is sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) )

Wait, because normalization is 1 = |a|^2 + |b|^2.

So, the normalized eigenvector is:

v1 = sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) * 1
v2 = sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) * [ (1 -n_z)/n_x ]

But wait, n_x is sqrt(1 -n_z^2) since n_x² =1 -n_z², and n_x is positive or negative? Well, because the direction is in the x-z plane, n_x can be positive or negative, depending on the direction. But in terms of the eigenvector, the sign might not matter because the eigenvector is defined up to a phase. So perhaps we can take n_x as positive.

So,

v1 = sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) 
v2 = [ (1 -n_z)/n_x ] * sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )

But (1 -n_z) is 2 sin²(theta/2), where theta is the angle from the z-axis. Wait, because for a unit vector making angle theta with the z-axis, n_z = cos(theta), right? Because in spherical coordinates, the z-component is cos(theta), where theta is the polar angle.

So, substituting n_z = cos(theta):

v1 = sqrt( (1 + cos(theta) ) / 2 ) 
v2 = [ (1 - cos(theta)) / sqrt(1 - cos^2(theta)) ] * sqrt( (1 + cos(theta) ) / 2 )

Wait, sqrt(1 - cos^2(theta)) is sin(theta). So,

v2 = [ (2 sin^2(theta/2) ) / ( 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ) ] * sqrt( (2 cos^2(theta/2)) ) / 2 )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to simplify.

(1 - cos(theta)) = 2 sin^2(theta/2)
(1 + cos(theta)) = 2 cos^2(theta/2)
sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)
n_x = sqrt(1 - cos^2(theta)) = sin(theta)

Wait, but if n is in the x-z plane and making an angle theta from z-axis, then n_x is positive if it's in the x direction. So n_x = sin(theta) for theta measured from the z-axis.

So, plugging back into v2:

v2 = [ (2 sin^2(theta/2)) / sin(theta) ] * sqrt( (2 cos^2(theta/2) ) / 2 )

Wait, the sqrt( (1 + cos(theta) ) / 2 ) is sqrt( (2 cos^2(theta/2) ) / 2 ) → sqrt( cos^2(theta/2) ) = |cos(theta/2)|. Assuming theta is between 0 and pi, cos(theta/2) is positive, so it's cos(theta/2).

So,

v2 = [ 2 sin^2(theta/2) / (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ) ] * cos(theta/2 )

Simplify numerator and denominator in the first term:

[ sin(theta/2) / cos(theta/2) ) ] = tan(theta/2)

So,

v2 = [ tan(theta/2) ) ] * cos(theta/2 )

Which is sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2) * cos(theta/2) → sin(theta/2)

So, putting it all together:

v1 = sqrt( (1 + cos(theta) ) / 2 ) = cos(theta/2)
v2 = sin(theta/2)

So the normalized eigenvector is:

( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Wait, wait, but that's the same as option C, which is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). So looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, I thought the eigenvector has components proportional to [1, (1-n_z)/n_x ].

Wait, let me double-check. Because, in our earlier substitution, we assumed n_x is positive. So, if the direction is in the x-z plane, the vector could point in the positive x and positive z direction, so n_x is positive.

So, the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Looking at the options, option C is exactly that.

But wait, going back to the problem statement, the operator is P, and the direction is arbitrary in x-z plane. The eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So, the options:
A) (√(2/3) ħ, √(1/3) ħ)
B) (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ)
C) (cosθ/2, sinθ/2)
D) (√(2/3) ħ cosθ/2, √(1/3) ħ sinθ/2)

But wait, the eigenvectors are spin-up states along the direction n. So, the general form is indeed (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)), but since in the x-z plane, phi is 0 (because it's in the x-z plane, so the angle phi around z is zero). So, phi is zero, so e^{i phi}=1. So the components are (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches option C.

But wait, looking at the options, option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is what we derived. So the answer would be option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices scaled by $\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is constructed as:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z \right),
\]

where $\vec{n} = (n_x, 0, n_z)$ is a unit vector in the x-z plane, satisfying $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$. Substituting the Pauli matrices, the operator becomes:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} 
\begin{bmatrix}
n_z & n_x \\
n_x & -n_z
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \frac{\hbar}{2} \right) |v\rangle = 0.
\]

Substituting $\lambda = +\hbar/2$, the matrix equation becomes:

\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} 
\begin{bmatrix}
n_z - 1 & n_x \\
n_x & -n_z - 1
\end{bmatrix}
= 0.
\]

This simplifies to the system of equations:

\[
(n_z - 1) v_1 + n_x v_2 = 0, \quad n_x v_1 + (-n_z - 1) v_2 = 0.
\]

From the first equation, we solve for $v_2$ in terms of $v_1$:

\[
v_2 = \frac{1 - n_z}{n_x} v_1.
\]

Substituting $n_x^2 = 1 - n_z^2$, we find that the normalized eigenvector is proportional to:

\[
v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{1 + n_z}{2}}, \quad v_2 = \sqrt{\frac{1 + n_z}{2}} \cdot \frac{1 - n_z}{n_x}.
\]

Using the parametrization $n_z = \cos\theta$ and $n_x = \sin\theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{n}$ and the z-axis, we simplify:

\[
v_1 = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \quad v_2 = \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right).
\]

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
\left( \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \right).
\]

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ does not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ is incorrect because the eigenvector depends on $\theta/2$, not $\theta$.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ matches the derived eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ introduces incorrect normalization factors.

The correct answer is **Option C**, as it matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
