Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about a light beam propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are A to D, and the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1.

Hmm, so light's speed in the glass is normally slower than in a vacuum, right? The usual formula is v = c/n, since the index of refraction n = c/v. But here, the glass is moving, so perhaps I need to consider relativistic effects or something about relative motion.

Wait, but I remember that according to Einstein's theory of relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, regardless of the motion of the source or the observer. So in the lab frame, the speed of light should still be c, right? But wait, that's in a vacuum. The problem is about light in glass, which has a different medium.

Wait, no. The glass is moving, but the light is inside the glass. So perhaps I should think about the speed of light in the moving glass from the lab frame's perspective.

Wait, another thought: the glass is moving, so maybe the speed of light in the glass (which is normally c/n) would be affected by the glass's motion? Or does the fact that the glass is moving not affect the speed of light in it because the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames?

Wait, but the glass is moving in the same direction as the light. So the light's speed relative to the lab would be different? Or is it the same because of relativity?

Let me think. In the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at speed v_light = c/n, in the same direction as the glass's motion. Now, from the lab frame, which sees the glass moving at velocity v, how do we compute the light's speed?

Wait, I think I should use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Because the glass is moving at speed v relative to the lab, and in the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed u' = c/n. So we need to find u, the speed of the light in the lab frame.

The velocity addition formula in special relativity is u = (u' +
