Okay, so I've got this question here about physical theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which of the given theories never needs regularization when dealing with high energies. The options are A to D. I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like infinite values that pop up in calculations. So, the idea is that some theories might inherently avoid these infinities or handle them without needing regularization.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is different from point particle theories because it's based on strings. Strings have a length scale, the string length, which is related to the Planck scale. At high energies (which correspond to short distances), string theories become well-behaved. They don't have the same kind of divergences as, say, quantum electrodynamics because the underlying structure is different. So maybe superstring theory doesn't require regularization. But wait, isn't string theory still a quantum theory? I thought they might have their own ways of handling things, perhaps through the string perturbation series which is different from usual Feynman diagrams. So maybe regularization isn't needed here.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that at high energies (or equivalently, at short distances), QCD becomes asymptotically free, meaning the coupling constant decreases, and the theory behaves more like a free theory. But wait, do QCD calculations still require regularization? I think that QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory and it's known to be a renormalizable theory. Renormalization involves handling divergences, which might require regularization techniques. So even though it's asymptotically free, it still probably needs regularization to handle loop diagrams and such. So B might require regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-established quantum field theory, and I remember that QED calculations (like in electron scattering) require regularization because of divergent integrals. For example, when calculating the electron self-energy or the vacuum polarization, you get divergences which are handled via regularization methods. So QED definitely requires regularization. So C isn't the correct answer.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Hmm, classical theories don't involve quantum effects. So they don't have the same kind of divergences as quantum field theories. For example, in classical electromagnetism, the fields are smooth and no infinities appear in the same way. So when you calculate things like the electric field of a point charge, you get an infinite charge density at r=0, but that's a classical problem. But in the context of regularization—since regularization is a quantum field theory technique—classical theories wouldn't require it. So D might be the correct answer because it never needs regularization at high energies.

Wait, but the question is about high energies. Do any of these classical theories have issues at high energies? Well, classical electromagnetism breaks down at very high energies because you reach the domain where quantum effects are significant. But the question is about whether the theory requires regularization. Since regularization is a quantum thing, classical theories don't need it. So for D, the answer would be that it doesn't require regularization because it's a classical theory.

So putting it together: A is a quantum theory but perhaps doesn't require regularization because of its structure. D is a classical theory, so it doesn't need regularization.

Wait, the question is which theory "never requires regularization at high energies." So if a theory doesn't have any divergences, it doesn't need regularization. 

But wait, superstring theory is a quantum theory, but maybe it's free from some divergences because of being a string theory. I remember that in string theory, some of the divergences that occur in point particle theories are tamed because the string's extended nature changes the behavior of the integrals. So perhaps it doesn't require regularization in the same way. Or maybe it does because it's still a quantum theory with loops and such.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is D because
