Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me about finding the eigenvector of a muon's operator along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and eigenvectors represent the states where the operator has a definite value.

The operator given is P, which is a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each component is given as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Wait, so for example, P_x is (ħ/2) times a matrix with rows [0 1] and [1 0]. That makes it the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times the Pauli Y matrix, which has elements [0 -i; i 0], and P_z is (ħ/2) times the Pauli Z matrix, which is diagonal [1, 0; 0, -1].

The question is about finding the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator P along a direction n in the x-z plane. So, the operator along an arbitrary direction would be the sum of the components multiplied by the direction vector. Since n lies in the x-z plane, it can be represented as (n_x, 0, n_z), where n_x² + n_z² = 1. Alternatively, it can also be expressed in spherical coordinates as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ). But wait, since it's in the x-z plane, φ would be 0 or 180, but perhaps θ is the angle from the z-axis, making n_x = sinθ cosφ and n_z = cosθ. Hmm, I think I should get that right.

Wait, no, for a direction in the x-z plane, the angle φ is 0 or π, but perhaps θ is measured from the x-axis towards the z-axis. Alternatively, maybe it's better to express the direction vector as n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. That makes sense because when θ=0, the direction is along z, and when θ=90 degrees, it's along x.

So the operator P along direction n is P · n. Which is P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P·n = P_x n_x + P_z n_z.

Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So let's write them out:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]
n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So the operator P·n would be (ħ/2)[ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute that matrix:

First, the sinθ term: sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] gives [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]].

The cosθ term: cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] gives [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]].

Adding them together:

[ [cosθ, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

Then multiplied by ħ/2, so the operator matrix is (ħ/2) multiplied by the above matrix.

So the matrix is:

(ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

We're looking for eigenvectors of this matrix with eigenvalue +ħ/2. Let's denote the eigenvalue as λ = +ħ/2.

The equation is (P·n - λ I) |v> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

So let's compute (P·n - λ I):

The matrix for P·n is (ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

Subtracting λ I, which is (ħ/2) * I since λ is ħ/2.

So,

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ - 1, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ]

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. P·n is (ħ/2) M, where M is the matrix [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]. The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So when we subtract λ I, which is (ħ/2) * I, because λ is ħ/2.

Wait no, perhaps not. Let me
