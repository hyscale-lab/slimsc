Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about stars with spots and how they affect photometric observations, and how that's similar to an exoplanet transiting in front of the star. Hmm, I remember that when a planet passes in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness that we can detect. Similarly, starspots can also cause brightness variations as the star rotates, and if the spots are cooler, they'll make the star appear dimmer when they're facing us.

The question is asking what the radius of an exoplanet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star. So, I need to find Rpl/Rstar such that the light curve amplitude is the same as the case with the spots.

Let me break down the given information:

- The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. Let's denote that as Rstar = R_sun. But since we're dealing with ratios, maybe the actual value doesn't matter. What matters is the relative size of the planet and the star.

- One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. So, 20% coverage means 0.2 of the star's surface is spots.

- The effective temperature of the star is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler, so spots are 5000K.

- The brightness variations are due to rotational modulation. So when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing changes in the observed brightness.

The problem states that this situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So, the idea is that the variation in brightness from the spots is similar to the variation caused by a planet transiting the star.

Wait, but when a planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's light. The dip in brightness depends on the area blocked. For the star with spots, the brightness variation isn't exactly the same as a planet transit because the spots are cooler, so the observed brightness decreases as spots come into view, but it's modulated as the star rotates. Oh, but the problem says that the situation can 'closely resemble' an exoplanet. So, maybe the approach is to model the brightness variation as if the spots are effectively causing a similar dip as a planet would, but perhaps the calculation is simpler.

Wait, but the question is: to produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve (if the star wasn't spotted), what would be the planet's radius. So, if the spots cause a certain dip in brightness, what planet size would cause the same dip.

So, I think I need to calculate the relative change in brightness (delta F) for both cases: the spotted star and the planet transit, and set them equal, then solve for Rpl.

Let's think about the star's brightness without spots first. Then, when the star has spots, the observed brightness is lower when spots are visible. But wait, the star's overall brightness is a function of its surface area and temperature. Oh, but when a spot is present, it's a cooler area, so that part contributes less flux.

Wait, but the star's total flux without spots is F0 = sigma * Teff^4
