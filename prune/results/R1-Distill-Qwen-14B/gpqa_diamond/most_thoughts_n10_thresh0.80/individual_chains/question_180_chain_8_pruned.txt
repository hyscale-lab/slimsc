Okay, so I have this physics problem here. It's about finding the minimum energy of a system with charges. Let me read it again.

Alright, the problem says: There's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their masses are negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, okay. So the system consists of 13 charges. 12 are at a distance of 2 meters from point P, and one is fixed at P. Each charge is 2e. So the question is about the potential energy of the system, I think. Because when you have charges arranged in a certain way, their potential energy contributes to the system's total energy. Since the system is isolated, all the energy is potential.

Wait, but in problems like this, when you're asked about the minimum energy, it's often when the system is in its most stable configuration, which usually means the charges are as close as possible. But in this case, 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P. So maybe their positions are fixed, and the 13th charge is placed at P. But wait, the 13th is fixed at P, so perhaps the others are in some arrangement around it.

Wait, no, the problem says 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the 12 charges are each located on a sphere of radius 2 meters around P. But the problem doesn't say anything about their arrangement on that sphere. So perhaps the minimum energy occurs when they are as close as possible to each other, but given that they are on a sphere, their mutual repulsion would push them apart, but the 13th charge at P is fixed.

Wait, but maybe the problem is simpler. The potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies contributed by each pair of charges. Since each charge is 2e, the total system's potential energy would be the sum of all the pairwise potential energies.

But since the system is isolated, the potential energy is calculated relative to a reference point, usually when all charges are infinitely far apart. But in this case, maybe we have to calculate the potential energy
