Okay, so I've got this question here about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question says to assume that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So, I guess that means the density of stars is the same everywhere. But wait, when we say uniform distribution, do we mean uniform in terms of spatial density, like the same number per cubic parsec everywhere? I think that's what it means.

The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, parallax is a measure of distance. Remember that parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So, plx = 1/distance. That means as distance increases, parallax decreases.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars per unit plx range depends on plx. So, like, if I pick a range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range?

Let me try to model this. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density n (number per unit volume) is constant. So, n = constant.

Let me think about the volume of space that has a parallax between plx and plx + dplx. Parallax is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So, if I have a range of plx from plx to plx + dplx, what does that correspond to in terms of distance?

The distance corresponding to plx is d = 1/plx. So, the range of distance when plx increases by dplx would be from d = 1/plx to d = 1/(plx + dplx). But wait, if I'm considering a small change in plx, dplx is small, so maybe I can approximate the change in distance.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of distances and then relate to parallax. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to write down the variables.

The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr is given by the number density n multiplied by the surface area of the shell (4πd²) multiplied by the thickness dr. So, N = n * 4π d² dr.

But wait, the parallax plx is 1/d.
