Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. So first, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When you titrate a weak acid with a strong base, the reaction produces the acetate ion, which is the conjugate base of acetic acid. 

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, let's start by calculating the initial concentration after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40 cm³. The initial moles of acetic acid would be Molarity × Volume. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Wait, because 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So after dilution, the concentration is moles divided by new volume. New volume is 0.04 L. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh wait, wait, wait. Wait, 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Diluted to 0.04 L, so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the concentration after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Then, when we titrate with 0.1 M NaOH. Let me think about the equivalence point. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is (0.001 mol) / (0.1 mol/L) = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. Wait, but the initial volume is 40
