Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal and all angles equal too. In this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the lattice parameter, right? So the lattice parameter a is 10 Angstroms.

The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I think the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is related to the reciprocal of the plane's indices and the lattice parameters. Oh right, the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + ... ), but wait, no, that's for cubic systems. Since this is a rhombohedral system, the formula might be a bit different because of the angles between the lattice vectors.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal system is d = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) (1/(a²)) ) * something involving the angles. Oh wait, no, more accurately, the formula for d in a general system is:

1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/(a²) * [ (1 - cos²α - cos²β - cos²γ + 2 cosα cosβ cosγ) ]

Wait, maybe I'm mixing that up. Another approach: For a rhombohedral system, the lattice is a cubic system with all sides equal and all angles equal. So the interplanar distance can be found using a formula that's similar to the cubic case but adjusted for the angles.

Wait, the general formula for d_hkl is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) )

But wait, in a rhombohedral system, all angles are equal, so α=β=γ=30 degrees. So that simplifies the equation.

So substituting the values for hkl as (1,1,1), let me write down the formula step by step.

d = a / sqrt( (1² + 1² + 1²) + 2*(1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 + 1*
