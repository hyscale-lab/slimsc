Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The problem is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. The operator is given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). 

Hmm, so I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators are represented by matrices. The intrinsic angular momentum for a muon, which is a lepton, would be similar to an electron, right? But maybe the specifics aren't too important here.

The first thing I think I should do is figure out what the matrix Ay looks like. Since Ay is c multiplied by S, let's compute that. The constant c is h/(4π). So, multiplying each element of S by c.

So S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[i    0 ]

So Ay would be c multiplied by that. So:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ 0   -i ]
                [i    0 ]

Which becomes:
[ 0    -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))  0 ]

Wait, but I think S is actually the Pauli matrices? No, the Pauli matrices are different. Oh wait, no. The Pauli matrices for sigma_y is [0 -i; i 0], so that's exactly S here. Oh, right! So S is sigma_y, the Pauli matrix for the y-component.

So Ay is proportional to sigma_y. Now, the eigenvalues of sigma matrices are known, right? For sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z, the eigenvalues are ±1. But wait, wait. No, wait. Let me think. The eigenvalues of sigma matrices are ±1 because they're 2x2 matrices with trace zero and determinant -1. Wait, what's the trace and determinant of sigma_y?

Trace is 0 (0 + 0). Determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (i^2) = -(-1) = 1. Hmm, wait, no. Let me compute that again. The determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i). (-i)(i) is -i^2 = -(-1) = 1. So determinant is 0 - 1 = -1. Wait, so the determinant of S is -1.

Wait, the eigenvalues λ satisfy λ^2 - trace(S) λ + det(S) = 0. Since trace is zero, the equation is λ^2 + det(S) = 0. Since det(S) is -1, the equation becomes λ^2 - (-1) = λ² +1 =0. So λ = ±i. Wait, that can't be right because that would make the eigenvalues imaginary. But wait, no, wait. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here because the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so their eigenvalues should be real. Hmm, wait, sigma_y isn't Hermitian? Wait, no, sigma matrices are Hermitian. Let me check.

Wait, sigma_y is:

[0   -i]
[i    0 ]

Is that matrix Hermitian? A Hermitian matrix equals its conjugate transpose. The conjugate transpose of sigma_y would be:

[0    i ]
[-i   0 ]

Which is the same as sigma_y, because the (1,2) element is -i, and its transpose is i, but conjugated, which is -i* becomes i, which matches. Wait, no. Wait, the original sigma_y is [0 -i; i 0]. The conjugate transpose would be [0 i; -i 0], which is the negative of sigma_y. Oh wait, so sigma_y is anti-Hermitian? Because (sigma_y)† = -sigma_y. Because the conjugate of -i is i, but in the transpose position, so the top right becomes i and the bottom left becomes -i. So sigma_y is anti-Hermitian. Because for a matrix to be Hermitian, it must equal its conjugate transpose. So sigma_y is actually anti-Hermitian, meaning (sigma_y)† = -sigma_y. So that would imply that sigma_y^2 = -I, because (sigma_y)^† = -sigma_y, so sigma_y^2 = (sigma_y)(sigma_y) = (sigma_y)† (sigma_y)^††? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should step back. Let's think about the eigenvalues of sigma_y. If sigma_y squared is I, because (sigma_y)^2 = [[ (-i)(i), ...], ...] Wait, let's compute sigma_y squared.

Compute sigma_y * sigma_y:

First row, first column: (0)(0) + (-i)(i) = 0 + (-i^2) = - (-1) )= 1.

First row, second column: (0)(-i) + (-i)(0) = 0 + 0 = 0.

Second row, first column: (i)(0) + (0)(i) = 0 + 0 =0.

Second row, second column: (i)(-i) + (0)(0) = -i^2 + 0 = 1.

So sigma_y squared is [[1 0],[0 1]], which is the identity matrix. So sigma_y squared equals I, which implies that its eigenvalues squared are 1. So the eigenvalues must be ±1. But wait, earlier calculation suggested λ^2 = -1, but that can't
