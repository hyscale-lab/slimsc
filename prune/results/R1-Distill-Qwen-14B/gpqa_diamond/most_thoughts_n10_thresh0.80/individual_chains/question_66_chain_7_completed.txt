Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to think this through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The possible choices are combinations of these.

First, I need to remember what each of these symmetries entails.

Lorentz Symmetry: This is the symmetry of spacetime under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. The laws of physics shouldn't change when you switch between different inertial frames. So SMEFT operators should respect this because, well, they're part of a relativistic theory.

Poincare Symmetry: This is a bigger symmetry group that includes Lorentz transformations plus translations. So it's like the full symmetry of Minkowski spacetime. If Poincare is a symmetry, then the theory must be invariant under translations (like moving the entire system somewhere else doesn't change the physics) and Lorentz transformations. So if Poincare is respected, Lorentz is too. But wait, does SMEFT necessarily have to respect Poincare symmetry?

Wait, SMEFT is an effective theory. I think it's based on the Standard Model, which is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry because it's an extension that maintains the same symmetries as the SM. But does it have to respect Poincare?

Wait, but Poincare includes both Lorentz and translations. The SM is Poincare invariant. So SMEFT should also respect Poincare symmetry because it's an effective field theory built from the same principles. So options 1 and 2 would both be correct.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. So if an operator doesn't respect Poincare, would that operator be part of SMEFT? I think not. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are required.

Next, CP symmetry. CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. Charge conjugation changes particles to their antiparticles, and Parity reflects spatial coordinates. CP symmetry implies that the laws of physics are the same when you swap particles with antiparticles and mirror them. But does SMEFT require all operators to be CP symmetric?

Wait, the SM itself doesn't have CP symmetry. For example, CP violation occurs in the weak interaction. So the SMEFT can include operators that violate CP. So operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to conserve CP. Therefore, option 3, CP, is not a symmetry that must be respected.

What about CPT symmetry? CPT is Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. The CPT theorem states that in any Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, the product of C, P, and T must be a symmetry. So if a theory respects Lorentz symmetry, it must respect CPT. So SMEFT, being a Lorentz-invariant theory, must respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 is correct.

So putting it together: which symmetries must all operators in SMEFT respect? They must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but wait. If Poincare is included, and Lorentz is part of Poincare, but the question lists them separately. So perhaps the correct answer includes both 1 and 2.

Wait, but wait again. Wait, Poincare is a larger symmetry. So if the theory respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. So does SMEFT need to respect both? Or is Poincare a subset of what's required?

Wait, SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars. So Lorentz symmetry must be respected. But Poincare symmetry includes translations. SMEFT is a field theory, so it must respect Poincare, because field theories are built on that. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

So which options are correct? 1,2,4.

Looking back at the options:

Option C) 1,2,4.

So the correct answer would be option C.


The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). To answer this, we analyze the four symmetries provided:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This symmetry applies to spacetime under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts). Since SMEFT is a relativistic effective field theory, it must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: This symmetry includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. As SMEFT is an effective field theory built on the principles of the Standard Model, which respects Poincaré symmetry, all operators in SMEFT must also respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry involves charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). However, the Standard Model already exhibits CP violation in certain interactions (e.g., the weak force). Since SMEFT is an extension of the Standard Model, it does not require all operators to conserve CP symmetry. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a strict requirement for SMEFT operators.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The CPT theorem states that in any Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, the product of charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T) must be a symmetry. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
