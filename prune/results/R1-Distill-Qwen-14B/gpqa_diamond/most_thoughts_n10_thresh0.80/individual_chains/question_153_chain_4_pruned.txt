Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but let me try to think through this step by step.

First, the question mentions three separate reactions, A, B, and C, and gives four options for the products. I need to figure out what each reaction produces and match them to the options.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). Hmm, I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound, typically a Michael acceptor (the electrophilic part) by a nucleophile, which is usually a conjugate base, like an enolate.

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form an enolate. Wait, no, wait. Wait, dimethyl malonate is a diester, right? So in basic conditions, like with NaOEt, it can deprotonate to form an enolate. The enolate will attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

So the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. Wait, no, wait: (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. Or wait, maybe it's CH2=C-O... No, wait, the substituents are at positions 3. Let me think: the acrylate is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group at the beta position. Wait, no, wait, maybe the structure is CH2=C(OCH3)-CH(p-tolyl). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the general structure for an alpha-beta unsaturated ester is R-C=C-O-R'. So for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Or wait, wait, the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. So the 3-position would have the p-tolyl group. So it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3, with the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and the p-tolyl on carbon 2. So the alpha-beta unsaturated ester is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3.

Wait, but the reaction is between dimethyl malonate and this acrylate. Dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH, right? So in basic conditions (NaOEt), the malonate will form an enolate. The enolate will attack the beta carbon of the acrylate
