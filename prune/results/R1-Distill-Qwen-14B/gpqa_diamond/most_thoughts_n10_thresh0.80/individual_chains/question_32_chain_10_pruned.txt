Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a certain nucleus to reach a speed of 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, let me understand the question. The nucleus in question is X, which is Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is element number 3, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, the isotope would be Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

The problem asks for the energy of RHIC so that the speed of this nucleus is 0.96c. So I need to calculate the relativistic energy of this ion moving at 0.96 times the speed of light.

I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle isn't just its rest mass energy, but increases with velocity because of the Lorentz factor. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the steps I need to take are:

1. Find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus.
2. Calculate gamma using v = 0.96c.
3. Multiply gamma by the rest mass energy to get the total energy.

Wait, but wait: the rest mass of the nucleus. Since it's a nucleus, the mass is the sum of the masses of the protons and neutrons, right? Or is it the atomic mass? Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass of a proton is approximately 938 MeV/c², same for a neutron. So the total rest mass m0 is (3 * proton mass) + (3 * neutron mass).

Wait, but I should be precise. Let me think. The exact mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So I'll use more precise numbers to get a better answer. Alternatively, maybe I can use the exact atomic mass, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the rest mass energy of the ion, which might be given by the atomic mass.

Wait, but I think I should calculate it. So for Li-6, each proton is about 938 MeV/c², but wait, no, wait. No, because the actual mass of a nucleus is a bit less than the sum of its nucleons due to binding energy. But wait, wait, when calculating the rest mass, for a nucleus, the mass is given by the sum of the masses of the individual nucleons minus the mass defect (binding energy). But wait, in this case, maybe the question expects me to take the mass as the sum of the individual nucleons because it's a heavy ion, and perhaps the binding energy is negligible compared to the rest mass for the purpose of this calculation.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem gives the mass of the nucleus as the atomic mass. Or perhaps the atomic mass includes electrons, but no, because we're dealing with a bare nucleus. Wait, for a nucleus, the mass is the sum of the protons and neutrons, but without the electrons. So for Li-6, which is a nucleus, the number of electrons is zero, so the rest mass is just the sum of the protons and neutrons.

Wait, but let me think: the atomic mass of Li-6 would be the mass of 3 protons, 3 neutrons, and 3 electrons (since Li has 3 electrons). But when the nucleus is ionized (like in an ion collider), it's missing the electrons. So in this case, the ion is Li^3+ because it has lost all three electrons. So the mass of the ion would be the mass of 3 protons, 3 neutrons, and no electrons. Wait, but the electrons contribute very little mass, so maybe it's negligible, but perhaps in the calculation, we should consider only protons and neutrons.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to look up the exact rest mass of a Li-6 nucleus. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the atomic mass and then adjust for the electrons. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe using the average mass of a nucleon, but I think the problem expects me to calculate it using the individual masses.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the mass of Li-6. Let me think. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0141 g/mol. But wait, that's for the atom, which includes electrons. Each Li atom has 3 electrons. So the mass of the nucleus would be the atomic mass minus the mass of the electrons.

Wait, but the electrons have a very small mass compared to the nucleus. The mass of an electron is about 0.00054858 amu. So for
