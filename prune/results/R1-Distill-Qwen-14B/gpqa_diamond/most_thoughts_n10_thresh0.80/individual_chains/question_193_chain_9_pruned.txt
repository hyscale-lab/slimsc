Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the formula is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, right. I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula connecting parallax and distance is plx = 1/distance, but wait, wait. No, more precisely, the parallax in arcseconds is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx (in arcsec) = 1 / d, where d is in parsecs.

So if I have d as distance, then plx = 1/d. That means plx is inversely proportional to distance. So d = 1/plx.

But the problem says the number of stars N varies with 1/plx^5. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the number varies as 1/(plx)^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that as N = k / (plx)^5, where k is some constant.

Since I want to find how N changes with distance, I should express N in terms of d. Because plx is 1/d, plx = 1/d. So plx^5 is (1/d)^5, which is 1/d^5.

So substituting into N: N = k / ( (1/d)^5 ) = k * d^5. Because 1 divided by (1/d)^5 is d^5.

Wait, wait, let me make sure. So N ∝ (1/plx)^5. Because 1/plx is d, right? So 1/plx is d. So (1/plx)^5 is d^5. Therefore, N is proportional to d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. It says, how does the number of stars change with distance per unit range of distance r. Oh, wait, they're asking about the change in N with distance, not the relation between N and d. So perhaps they're asking for the differential, like dN/dr.

Wait, let me think. Because if N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance. But how does the number change per unit distance?

Wait, the question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r?)"

Wait, so perhaps they are looking for dN/dr, the rate of change of the number of stars with distance. Because when you say something changes with X per unit Y, it's often the derivative.

So if N = C * r^5, then dN/dr = 5C r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^4.

Wait, but no, actually, wait. Let me think again. The number per unit distance would be dN/dr, which is the derivative of N with respect to r. So if N is proportional to r^5,
