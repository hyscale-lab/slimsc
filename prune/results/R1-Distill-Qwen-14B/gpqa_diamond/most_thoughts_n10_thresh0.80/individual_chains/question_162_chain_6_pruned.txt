Okay, so I've got this question in front of me about a metric and the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on general relativity, but let's try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. I remember that metrics can describe different kinds of geometries, and pseudospheres are like hyperbolic spaces or something. But wait, pseudosphere usually refers to a specific surface, maybe in 2D. Oh wait, maybe this is a 2-dimensional metric in some coordinate system.

So the question is asking for the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, wait, I'm a bit confused. Pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? But I'm trying to remember the area formula for such a shape. For a regular sphere, the area is 4πr². But for a pseudosphere, which is like a hyperbolic space, the area might be different.

Wait, but in 2D, the pseudosphere is an infinite surface. Because hyperbolic space is non-compact. So its area would be infinite. But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think about the metric provided.

The metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that denominator looks like 4 - (x² + y²). So as x² + y² approaches 4, the metric blows up. That suggests that the radius of curvature is related
