Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let me read the question carefully.

The question involves two reactions and asks which reagents (A and B) are suitable for each step. The reactions are:

1. Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile
2. 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different reagents for A and B.

First, I'll tackle the first reaction. So, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. Adding NaCN and some reagent A gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, let's look at the structure of that product.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- should be a nucleophilic addition. In ketones, the nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon. So, NaCN is providing the CN- nucleophile. But when I think about cyanide addition to ketones, I remember that it forms a cyanohydrin. The product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write the structure.

Butan-2-one is (CH2CH2)CO. Wait, no, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So, adding CN- would produce (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Hmm, wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's see, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methyl butanenitrile. So, the structure would be (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me draw it out.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When CN- adds to the carbonyl, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN, right? Which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Oh wait, butanenitrile is four carbons, so maybe the initial ketone is butan-2-one, which is (CH2CH2)C(O)CH3? No, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is propan-2-one, I think. Wait, but butan-2-one would have four carbons. Oh wait no, butan-2-one is (CH2)2CO, so the carbonyl is on C2 of a four-carbon chain. So, structure would be CH2CH2COCH3? No, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH3. Wait, no, butan-2-one is (CH2)2CO. So, the structure is CH2(CO)CH2CH3? No, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)CH2CO, which is actually propan-2-one? I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should just proceed with the reaction.

In any case, the addition of CN- to a ketone forms a cyanohydrin. But to get the product as 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, perhaps the reaction requires specific conditions. So, in the first step, the reagent A is needed along with NaCN to form the cyanohydrin.

Wait, I remember that for the formation of cyanohydrins from ketones, a strong acid is often used as a catalyst. Because the acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen,
