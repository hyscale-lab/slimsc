Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's going on.

The question is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K. So the spots are at 5000K. Because the star is rotating, these spots come into and out of view, causing the star's brightness to vary periodically. This is similar to how an exoplanet would cause a dip in brightness when it transits in front of the star.

The main point is that this situation can mimic an exoplanet's signal. So the question is asking: what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, assuming the star wasn't spotted (i.e., it's a blackbody and the spots don't affect the calculation)?

Hmm. So I need to find Rpl/Rstar such that the dip in brightness caused by the planet is equal in amplitude to the dip caused by the spots.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The star with spots has a variation due to the spots rotating in and out of view. The exoplanet would cause a dip when it blocks some of the star's light. So the amplitude of the brightness variation depends on the amount of light blocked.

Let me think about the star's brightness when it's unspotted. If the star were completely unspotted, it would emit at a certain luminosity. But with spots, the observed luminosity would vary because different parts of the star (spot vs non-spot) are visible as it rotates.

Wait, but the star's overall brightness when it's not spotted is a blackbody with Teff = 6000K. When it has spots, the spots are cooler, so when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the star emits less light. The variation in brightness is due to the changing area of spots visible as the star rotates.

So to find the amplitude of the brightness variation, we can model the change in flux.

Let's denote:

- F_total = total flux without any spots.

- F_spotted = flux when part of the star is covered by spots.

Wait, but the star is observed over time as it rotates, so the fraction of the star's surface covered
