Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I should start by understanding the problem step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a given matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix Ay.

Wait, so first, let me write down the matrix S. The first row is 0 -i, and the second is i 0. So S looks like:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i  0 ]

And then A_y is c multiplied by this matrix. Since c is h/(4π), but for the eigenvalues, the overall scaling might affect the values.

I remember that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - λI) = 0. So, let's compute the matrix A_y first.

A_y = (h/(4π)) * S. So the matrix becomes:

[ (h/(4π)) * 0   (h/(4π)) * (-i) ]
[ (h/(4π)) * i    (h/(4π)) * 0 ]

Which simplifies to:

[ 0    -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)  0 ]

So the matrix is:

0          -i h/(4π)
i h/(4π)    0

Now, to find the eigenvalues λ of A_y, I set up the equation det(A_y - λ I) = 0.

So the matrix (A_y - λ I) is:

[ -λ          -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)     -λ ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π)) (i h/(4π)) ] = λ² - [ (-i)(i) * (h²)/(16π²) ]

Wait, let's compute the second term. The product is (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the term is (h²/(16π²)) * 1.

So determinant equation becomes:

λ² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0

Solving for λ: λ² = h²/(16 π²), so λ = ± h/(4π)

Wait, no, because sqrt(h²/(16 π²)) is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). But wait, the options don't seem to match this exactly. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues I found are real, right? Because angular momentum components have real eigenvalues. Wait, no, wait. A_y is a Hermitian operator?

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Because S is a 2x2 matrix, but is it Hermitian? Let's see. The given S matrix is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. Its conjugate transpose is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is not the same as S. So S is anti-Hermitian. But when we multiply by c, which is real, because c = h/(4π), a real number. So A_y is c * S. So since S is anti-Hermitian (because S† = -S), then A_y is also anti-Hermitian.

Wait, but angular momentum operators are Hermitian. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. Because the intrinsic angular momentum operators (like Sx, Sy, Sz) are Hermitian. So maybe I got S wrong. Or perhaps the given S is the spin matrix for S_y?

Wait, let me think. For spin-1/2 particles, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. The spin matrices S are given by S = (ħ/2) σ. So for S_y, the matrix is (ħ/2) [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. So, the matrix S as given in the problem is (ħ/2) * σy.

But in the problem, c is h/(4π). Let me see.

Wait, h is Planck's constant. ħ is h/(2π). So, ħ = h/(2π). So, (ħ/2) would be h/(4π). So S in the problem is equal to (ħ/2) σy, which is correct.

So, the matrix for A_y is c * S, where c is h/(4π). So c is equal to (h/(4π)) = (ħ/2). So A_y = c * S = (h/(4π)) * (ħ/(2)) σy? Wait, no, wait. Wait, S is already (ħ/2)σy, and A_y is c * S, where c is h/(4π).

Wait, let me compute c * S. c = h/(4π) = (2ħ)/(4π) = ħ/(2π). Wait, no, wait, ħ is h/(2π). So h = 2π ħ. So h/(4π) = (2π ħ)/(4π) )= ħ/2. Oh! So c = ħ/2.

So A_y = (ħ/2) * S. But S is (ħ/2) σy. So A_y = (ħ/2) * (ħ/2) σy = ħ²/(4) σy.

Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recompute.

Wait, regardless, earlier I thought the eigenvalues would be lambda = ± h/(4π). But when I calculate the determinant, I found lambda² = (h^2)/(16 π²), so lambda is ± h/(4π). But wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, the matrix A_y is:

0    -i c
i c   0

So the determinant is:

(0 - λ)(-λ) - (-i c)(i c) = λ² - [ (-i)(i) c^2 ]

(-i)(i) = -i^2 = -(-1) = 1.

So determinant is λ² - (1)(c²) = 0 → λ² = c² → λ= ±c.

Since c = h/(4π), the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are real, and they are ± (h/(4π)).

Looking at the options, none of the options directly say this. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are ±2πh or –2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). That can't be, since the eigenvalues are purely real.

Option B: The imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. That doesn't match.

Option C: The eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm, A² would be (A_x² + A_y² + A_z²). The eigenfunctions of A² are the same as those for each component, because the total angular momentum squared commutes with each component. So for a single component (like A_y), the eigenfunctions of A_y would also be eigenfunctions of A^2. Wait, but in this case, we're dealing with the intrinsic spin, so A^2 would have eigenvalues s(s+1)ħ², but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the eigenfunctions of A_y can be eigenfunctions of A² because [A_y, A²] = 0. So option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. I'm not sure about that yet. Let's hold onto that thought.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, I'm not sure what this means. The basis functions of Ay? Maybe it's saying that the eigenvectors form a basis for the space. Since it's a 2x2 matrix, yes, the eigenvectors would form a basis. But wait, if the matrix is diagonalizable, which it is because it's a Pauli matrix multiplied by a scalar, then yes, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis. So statement D might be correct.

But first, let's look at the options again. The question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, the eigenvalues I found are real, so any option suggesting imaginary parts is incorrect. So options A and B are invalid since they suggest eigenvalues with imaginary parts.

So that leaves options C and D. Now, let's analyze option C and D.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

Wait, A² is the square of the total angular momentum. For spin-½ particles, A² would have eigenvalues ( (½)(½+1) ) ħ² = (3/4) ħ². So any eigenstate of A_y is also an eigenstate of A², because A² commutes with A_y. Because [A², A_y] = 0. So the eigenfunctions of A_y are also eigenfunctions of A², but not necessarily of Az. Because [A_y, Az] = iħ A_x, so they don't commute. Therefore, a state that's an eigenstate of A_y can't be an eigenstate of Az unless it's also an eigenstate of A_x, but that's only possible if A_x and A_z share eigenstates, which they don't (they are different components).

So option C is correct. Alternatively, wait, the option says 'can also be' implying that the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², which is correct. So C is correct. But what about D?

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm. The eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis for the vector space that the matrix acts on. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors form a basis for C^2. So D would be correct.

Wait, wait. So both C and D could be correct statements. But the question is which one is correct during the calculation. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, but the problem states that this is the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum. So perhaps the spin matrices are involved. The operator is proportional to S_y, so the eigenvectors would be eigenstates of S_y, which are also eigenstates of S², since S² commutes with S_y.

Therefore, C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct because A² is (S_x² + S_y² + S_z²), which commutes with S_y. So any eigenstate of S_y is also an eigenstate of S², which would be A². Therefore, C is correct.

But wait, option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator Ay. I'm not entirely sure what that means. The matrix operator's basis functions might refer to the eigenvectors. Since the eigenvectors form a basis, D is correct.

Wait, but looking back, the eigenvalues are real, so the matrix is diagonalizable, so the eigenvectors indeed form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but perhaps option C is incorrect regarding the Az component. Let's think: If a state is an eigenstate of A_y, can it be an eigenstate of Az as well?

In quantum mechanics, generally, the eigenstates of different components of angular momentum (like S_x, S_y, S_z) don't simultaneously have definite eigenvalues because these operators don't commute. So a state can be an eigenstate of S_y but not of S_z, unless it's a simultaneous eigenstate, which is only possible in specific cases, like for states with zero angular momentum, but for spin-½ particles, that's not the case.

So, the eigenfunctions of A_y can't be eigenfunctions of both A^2 and Az. Therefore, option C correctly states that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. So option C is correct.

Wait, but let me think again. The operator A² commutes with A_y, so any eigenstate of A_y is also an eigenstate of A². So C is correct. So the correct statements would be C and D?

Wait, but the options are presented as four choices, and the question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Let's see:

The eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which is real. So options A and B are out. Now, the eigenvectors are eigenfunctions of Ay, which are also eigenfunctions of A² (since [A², Ay] = 0), so option C is correct. Also, the eigenvectors form a basis for the 2x2 space, so option D is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's read them again.

Option D: "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above."

Hmm, the eigenfunctions form a basis. Since the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors will form a basis for C^2. So that's correct. So D is correct.

But the question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, the problem is multiple-choice, so I need to pick one correct option.

Wait, perhaps both C and D are correct. But since the options are mutually exclusive, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps option D is not correct. Let me think. The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Hmm, perhaps the operator's matrix is represented in a particular basis, and the eigenfunctions might not form that basis. Or perhaps the term is a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenfunctions are orthogonal and form a basis, making D correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement in D is correct.

Wait, but perhaps in this case, the matrix operator Ay is 2x2, and its eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

But looking at the options, the correct eigenvalues are real, so A and B are out. Now, between C and D.

Wait, the eigenfunctions are basis functions of Ay. So the eigenvectors are the basis for the space on which Ay acts. So, yes, they form a basis. So D is correct.

Hmm, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So during the calculation, when you're finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach. Let me compute the eigenvectors.

The matrix Ay is:

[ 0    -i c ]
[ i c    0 ]

where c = h/(4π). So c is a real number.

The eigenvalues are ±c.

For eigenvalue λ = c:

The matrix (Ay - c I) is:

[-c    -i c]
[i c    -c]

The equations are:

- c φ1 -i c φ2 = 0 → -φ1 -i φ2 = 0 → φ1 = -i φ2.

So the eigenvector is [ -i φ2, φ2 ]^T. Let's choose φ2 = 1, then the eigenvector is (-i, 1)^T. To make it a vector, perhaps normalize it.

Similarly, for λ = -c:

Matrix (Ay + c I) is:

[ c   -i c ]
[i c   c ]

Equations: c φ1 -i c φ2 = 0 → φ1 = (i φ2).

So eigenvector is [i, 1]^T.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to (-i, 1) and (i, 1). These are the eigenfunctions. Now, these are the basis functions for the operator Ay? Well, they form an orthogonal basis, so yes, they are a basis.

So option D is correct.

But then why is option C correct? Because the eigenfunctions also are eigenfunctions of A², which commutes with Ay. So the eigenvectors of Ay are eigenstates of A² as well.

So both C and D seem correct. But looking back at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the options are:

Option C) The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

Option D) The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

So which is correct?

Well, the problem is asking which statement is correct during the calculation.

If the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay, that's correct because the matrix is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

But the question is about the calculation process: which statement will you consider to be correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about which statement is correct in the context of the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct because the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

So I'm a bit torn between C and D.

Wait, but the question says which statement is correct during the calculation, which I think refers to the process of finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

In this process, which statement is correct.

Well, option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix Ay. Since the eigenvectors of a diagonalizable matrix form a basis, that's correct. So D is correct.

Option C is about the eigenfunctions being eigenfunctions of A² and not Az. But that is a separate consideration, not directly part of the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, perhaps when you calculate the eigenvalues, you find they're real, so any option implying imaginary parts is wrong, so options A and B are out. Then, among C and D, C is a correct statement about the eigenfunctions and their properties, and D is a correct statement about the basis.

But how do I choose between them?

Wait, the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps during the calculation, you consider whether the eigenfunctions form a basis, which they do. So the correct answer would be D.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, let's think of the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A² but not of Az.

Since A² and Ay commute, any eigenstate of Ay is an eigenstate of A². So C is correct.

And since Az and Ay don't commute, their eigenstates can't be the same. So a state eigenstate of Ay can't be an eigenstate of Az. So C is correct.

So then why would option D be incorrect? Because the statement is about the eigenfunctions being the basis functions of Ay. Well, the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, so D is correct.

Wait, but the correct answer among the options is which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, no, the options are presented as four, and only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think of another approach. Let me compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors again.

Wait, the eigenvalues are ±c, where c = h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are purely real. So options A and B are incorrect.

Then, the eigenvectors are in the form ( -i, 1 ) and ( i, 1 ) scaled.

So, any eigenfunction is a linear combination of these eigenvectors, which form a basis. So the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator Ay, making option D correct.

But option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Since [A², Ay] = 0, yes, they can. So option C is correct.

Wait, but in the problem, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, perhaps the answer is C. Because during the calculation, you find that the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. 

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to see which of the options is correct.

Another approach: Let's compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

We have found that the eigenvalues are ±c, where c = h/(4π). The eigenvectors are (-i,1) and (i,1).

So the eigenfunctions are of the form φ_+ = [ -i, 1 ] and φ_- = [ i, 1 ].

Now, option C says that these can also be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct because [A², Ay] = 0.

So eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Similarly, the eigenfunctions form a basis, so D is correct.

But the options are either/or.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Because the problem is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, another thought: If a matrix is diagonalizable, then its eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct if the matrix is diagonalizable.

In this case, since the eigenvalues are distinct (c and -c), the matrix is diagonalizable, so D is correct.

So, the correct statements are both C and D. But looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the options are:

A) incorrect (imaginary parts)

B) incorrect (imaginary parts)

C) correct

D) correct

So now I'm really confused because the question expects one answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C. Because the statement in option D says "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above."

Wait, perhaps 'basis functions' refers to Ay's matrix being expressed in terms of the eigenfunctions. But in this case, the eigenfunctions are the basis, so D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement in D is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis.

So considering all this, I think the correct answer is D.

Wait, but earlier I thought option C was correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

But earlier, when I considered the eigenvalues, I found they were ±h/(4π), which are real. So options A and B are incorrect.

So the only options left are C and D.

In the end, I think the correct answer is C.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Another approach: perhaps the eigenfunctions of A_y are not eigenfunctions of A_z.

Which is true, so option C is correct.


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix with the first row \( (0, -i) \) and the second row \( (i, 0) \). The task is to determine which statement about the eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and their properties is correct during the calculation.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   The matrix \( S \) is anti-Hermitian, and \( A_y \) is proportional to \( S \). The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - \lambda I) = 0 \). Substituting \( A_y \) into the equation and simplifying yields:
   \[
   \lambda^2 = c^2 \implies \lambda = \pm c = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
   \]
   The eigenvalues are purely real, so any option suggesting imaginary parts (e.g., options A and B) is incorrect.

2. **Eigenvectors of \( A_y \):**
   For \( \lambda = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the eigenvector is proportional to \( (-i, 1) \), and for \( \lambda = -\frac{h}{4\pi} \), the eigenvector is proportional to \( (i, 1) \). These eigenvectors form a basis for the \( 2 \times 2 \) space, meaning they can represent any vector in the space. Thus, option D is correct.

3. **Commutativity and Simultaneous Eigenfunctions:**
   The operator \( A_y \) commutes with \( A^2 \) (the square of the total angular momentum operator), so any eigenstate of \( A_y \) is also an eigenstate of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) does not commute with \( A_z \), meaning an eigenstate of \( A_y \) cannot be an eigenstate of \( A_z \). This makes option C correct.

4. **Comparison of Options C and D:**
   Both options C and D appear to be correct. However, the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. Option C focuses on the relationship between \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \), which is relevant during the analysis of the eigenfunctions' properties. Option D emphasizes the eigenvectors forming a basis, which is a general property of diagonalizable matrices. Since the question likely prioritizes the eigenfunctions' relationship with other operators, option C is the most appropriate choice.

### Conclusion:
Options A and B are incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real. Option D is correct, but option C better aligns with the context of the calculation, as it highlights the eigenfunctions' relationship with \( A^2 \) and \( A_z \).

ANSWER: C
