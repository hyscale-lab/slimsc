Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the lab? And the options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm. I remember that when dealing with light in moving media, special relativity might come into play. But wait, the glass is moving, and we're looking at the speed of light in the glass from the lab frame. Oh, right, the speed of light in a medium is c divided by the refractive index n. So normally, the speed is v_light = c/n. But wait, the glass is moving, so does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v. So the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the lab's frame, the glass is moving towards us while the light is also going through it in the same direction. Hmm, so how does the motion of the glass affect the observed speed of light?

I think this is a problem involving the addition of velocities, maybe using the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh wait, but the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. So wait a second, if the glass is moving, but the light is inside it, does that mean the light's speed relative to the lab is still c? Because according to Einstein's postulate, the speed of light in a vacuum is c in all frames, and in a medium, it's c/n, but when the medium is moving, does it change?

Wait, no, wait. The glass is a medium, and the light is inside it. So the speed of light in the medium is c/n, but when the medium itself is moving, how does that affect the lab's measurement?

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's start over. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. The light is moving through the glass, which is itself moving towards the observer. So the light's velocity in the glass is c/n in the direction of motion of the glass.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the glass is moving, so to find the speed of the light relative to the lab, I need to add
