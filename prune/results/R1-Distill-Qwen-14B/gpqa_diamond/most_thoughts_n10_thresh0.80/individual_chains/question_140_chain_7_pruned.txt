Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. 

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K, which is close to 0 degrees Celsius because 273 K is 0째C. So B is probably a solid at room temperature, maybe something like ice or maybe another substance with a melting point near that.

Wait, but melting point of B being 277 K is about 5째C. Hmm, what's a common substance that melts around there? Well, water freezes at 273 K, so that's 0째C. So 277 K is about 4째C. Maybe B is something like iodine? No, iodine's melting point is higher. Or maybe something else. Alternatively, perhaps B is a metal, but I'm not sure. Let me think more about the reaction.

Substance X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X has an element with a heavier isotope. That suggests that perhaps X contains an element that commonly has isotopes, like chlorine (which has Cl-35 and Cl-37) or maybe sulfur. Or perhaps it's something like deuterium, but that's more about hydrogen.

The reaction of X with Y produces gas W. Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So each molecule of W has equal protons and neutrons. Let me think about possible gases. For example, H2O: but the molecule would have 2 H (each with 1 proton and 1 neutron) and one O (8 protons, 8 neutrons typically). So total protons: 2 + 8 =10, neutrons: 2 +8=10. Oh wait, so H2O has 10 protons and 10 neutrons in total. So that's one possibility. Another could be CH4, but that's a gas, but protons would be 6 (C) + 4 (H) =10, and neutrons would be 6 (C's usual is 6, but wait, in CH4, C is
