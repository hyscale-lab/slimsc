Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is like a diamondoid structure, so it's pretty rigid. The molecule has two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons, probably in a bridge position.

First reaction: heated with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, probably leading to some elimination or substitution. Since it's dibromide, maybe dehydrohalogenation? Wait, two bromines on adjacent carbons would form a double bond when they eliminate. So, when heated, each Br leaves, and two hydroxide ions take H, leading to the formation of a double bond. So the product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene, but wait, adamantane doesn't have double bonds naturally. Oh, wait, no, the product would be the dehydrohalogenation product—so maybe 1,3-dibromoadamantane on elimination would lose two HBr molecules, forming a diene. Wait, but in an adamantane structure, I think the rings are fused, so elimination would form a double bond somewhere.

Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. The 1H NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a region where maybe there are hydroxyl groups, but wait, KOH is used, maybe it's an epoxide or a diol? Hmm, wait no, after elimination, perhaps it's an oxide. Wait, no, because 4.79 is more like an ether or an alcohol. Wait, but the IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl group. So maybe it's a ketone or an ester. Oh, wait, but if KOH is used in elimination, perhaps it's more likely a substitution. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some reaction.

Wait, another possibility: when dibromides are treated with KOH, they can form epoxides via an E2 mechanism. No, wait, epoxides usually come from dihalides with a base but in a cyclic ether formation. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating with KOH (excess). Maybe it's a double dehydrohalogenation, eliminating two HBr to form a diene. So product 1 is 1,3-adamantadiene? But then the NMR would have peaks from the double bonds. Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide, but I don't see the IR for that.

Wait, the IR shows 1720, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O). So product 1 has a carbonyl group. So perhaps the reaction is not elimination but substitution. But how?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the bromides undergo oxidation or some kind of nucleophilic attack. Oh, wait, KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. Maybe the dibromide undergoes an SN2 reaction, but with two leaving groups, maybe it's a double substitution. Hmm. But in an adamantane structure
