Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because titration and pH calculations are a bit tricky for me. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so maybe I can figure it out by calculating each part.

First, let's think about the initial solution after dilution. Acetic acid is a weak acid, CH3COOH, and when we mix it with water, the concentration decreases. To find the new concentration after dilution, I can use the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we're adding 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. The initial concentration is 0.05 M. Plugging into the formula:

M1 = 0.05 M, V1 = 20 cm³, V2 = 40 cm³.

So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40 = (1) /40 = 0.0125 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.0125 M.

Wait, let me double-check that. 0.05 M *20 cm³ is 1 mmol. Then divided by 40 cm³ gives 0.025 mmol per cm³, which is 0.0125 M. Yeah, that's correct.

Next, when we titrate this with NaOH. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O. So the mole ratio is 1:1.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equal moles of CH3COOH present. Let's calculate the moles of acetic acid after dilution.

Volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L), and concentration is 0.0125 M. Moles = M * V = 0.0125 * 0.04 = 0.0005 mol. So at equivalence, we need 0.0005 mol of NaOH.

But the NaOH solution is 0.1 M. So volume needed is moles / M = 0.0005 / 0.1 = 0.005 L = 5 cm³. So 5 cm³ of NaOH is needed to reach equivalence.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of 5 cm³ is 1.25 cm³ of NaOH added. So at this point, only a quarter of the acetic acid has been neutralized.

But wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps considering the total volume during titration
