Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino production, but let's see.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. All other reactions are the same. I need to find the ratio of the flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, flux(band1)/flux(band2) is what we're after.

Wait, first, what's the pp-III branch? I remember that the proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun, and there are different branches. The pp-I branch is the simplest, involving just two protons fusing into deuterium. But I think the pp-II and pp-III branches involve more steps and might produce different neutrino spectra.

Oh right! The pp-I branch is the dominant one, I think, producing mainly 1 MeV neutrinos. But wait, the pp-II and pp-III branches are minor, but they contribute to the neutrino flux in different energy ranges. PP-III might produce higher energy neutrinos, perhaps? Or lower?

Wait, the pp chain goes like this: in the first step, two protons fuse into deuterium, emitting a positron and a neutrino. But wait, actually, when two protons collide, one becomes a neutron, emitting a positron and a neutrino. That's the main process, right? So that's the pp-I branch. But when there are higher branches, like if a proton captures a deuteron, that's the pp-II branch. And then pp-III would be something else... I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

Wait, let me think. The pp-I branch is the most common, produces 1 MeV neutrinos. The pp-II branch, when a proton captures a deuterium nucleus (a deuteron), forming a triton, which then captures another proton to form helium-4. But wait, that might not be the pp-III. Alternatively, maybe pp-III is another side reaction, perhaps involving more captures.

Oh, right, the pp-III branch involves the process where a proton captures a helium-3 nucleus (triton?), but wait, maybe not. I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch is when a proton captures a helium-3 (a triton) to form carbon-12, but that's part of the CNO cycle, no? Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, I think the pp-III branch involves a different reaction path, maybe leading to higher-energy neutrinos.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The main proton-proton chain (pp-I) produces neutrinos around the 1 MeV mark. The other branches, pp-II and pp-III, are less significant but contribute to the neutrino flux in different energy ranges. Specifically, the pp-II branch emits lower-energy neutrinos, maybe around 0.4 MeV, and the pp-III branch emits higher-energy neutrinos, perhaps around 1.8 MeV or so. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, no
