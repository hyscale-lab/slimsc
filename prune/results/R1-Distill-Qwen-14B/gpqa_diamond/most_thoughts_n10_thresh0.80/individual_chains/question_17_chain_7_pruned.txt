Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions. In this case, it's forming a complex with calcium ions. The complex is Ca-EDTA, which I think is CaY²- when EDTA is deprotonated.

So the solution has 0.02 M of this complex. I'm trying to find the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²+], in this solution.

Wait, I think when a complex forms, the metal and the ligand combine, so the concentration of the complex is related to the concentrations of the metal and ligand. The formation constant K is given, which is 5e10. K is for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA²-.

Wait, no. Maybe the reaction is written as Ca²+ + Y^4- ↔ CaY²−, where Y^4- is the EDTA^4- ion. The formation constant Kf is [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]).

But wait, in solution, especially at a certain pH, the EDTA exists in various protonated forms. Oh, but the problem says the pH is ideal, so maybe we can assume that EDTA is in its Y^4- form, which is the fully deprotonated form. So the solution is buffered such that [Y^4-] is effectively constant, or perhaps we don't need to consider the other forms because they are negligible. Hmm, but I'm not exactly sure about that.

Wait, the problem gives K_Ca-EDTA as 5e10. I think that's the formation constant, which is Kf. So the equation is Kf = [CaY²−] / ([Ca²+][Y^4-]).

The concentration of the complex, [CaY²−], is 0.02 M as given. So substituting in, Kf = (0.02) / ([Ca²+][Y^4-]).

But wait, I don't know [Y^4-]. Hmm, but I think that in a 1:1 complex, the stoichiometry is 1:1, so the concentration of the complex is equal to the amount of Ca²+ and EDTA that reacted. But wait, if the solution is 0.02 M CaY²−, then the total concentration of Ca²+ and EDTA would be 0.02 M each, right? No, wait, that's assuming that all the Ca²+ and EDTA are in the complex. But if some of it dissociates, then the free [Ca²+] and [Y^4−] would be present as well.

Wait, but the problem states it's a "stochiometric" solution, which probably means
