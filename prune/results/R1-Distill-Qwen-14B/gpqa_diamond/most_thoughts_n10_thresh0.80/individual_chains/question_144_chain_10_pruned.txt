Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula I think is something like distance = velocity × lifetime. But wait, how do I get the velocity from the given data?

Alternatively, I recall that the mean lifetime τ is related to the decay width Γ. The decay width is related to the lifetime by τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But wait, units can get tricky here. I should make sure all the units are consistent.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about the relation between the decay width Γ and the lifetime. Oh, right, Γ is the total decay rate, so Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. That makes sense.

But then, the mean decay length L is given by L = βγ c τ, where β is the velocity over c, γ is the Lorentz factor, and c is the speed of light. So I need to calculate β and γ for this meson.

Wait, but how do I get the velocity from the energy and mass? Oh right, because the meson is produced with energy E_X, so we can find its momentum p from E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². Let me write that down.

E_X squared equals (p c) squared plus (m_X c squared) squared. So, E_X^2 = (p c)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2. Solving for p: p = sqrt( E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2 ) / c.

Wait, but I can plug in numbers. Let's compute p. E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV. Let me compute E in GeV, m in GeV as well.

So E_X = 8 GeV, m_X c² = 1.2 GeV (since c² is in units where GeV is considered appropriately). So,

p² c² = E_X^2 - (m_X c²)^2 = (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 GeV².

So p c = sqrt(62.56) GeV ≈ 7.91 GeV.

So p = 7.91 GeV / c.

Wait, but then the meson's momentum is p = 7.91 GeV/c.

Next, compute β and γ. Beta is v/c = p c / E_X. Because p c is in GeV, and E_X is 8 GeV. So beta = (7.91 GeV) / 8 GeV ≈ 0.98875. So approximately 0.9888.

Gamma is E_X / (m_X c²) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

So γ is about 6.6667, which is 20/3.

Now, the lifetime τ is ħ / Γ. Let me compute that. ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because 1 eV·s is about 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, no, wait. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x10^-34 J·s. But in terms of GeV and seconds, 1 GeV is 1.6e-10 J. So h = 6.626e-34 J·s = 6.626e-34 / (1.6e-10 J
