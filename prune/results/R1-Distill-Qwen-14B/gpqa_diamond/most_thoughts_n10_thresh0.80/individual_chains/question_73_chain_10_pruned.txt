Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says there are two astronauts. Their masses are 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait. So I remember that when things are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we can't just use classical mechanics. Relativistic effects come into play. Right, like length contraction and time dilation. But in this case, I think the question is about relative velocity and total energy, so maybe I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula for the relative speed and the relativistic energy formula for the total energy.

Let me break it down. First, the relative speed. So one astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the other at 0.5c, both in the same direction. Wait, but relative to each other? No, wait. If they're moving in the same direction, their relative speed isn't just the difference, because of relativity. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different.

The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Wait, no, let me get that right. I think it's (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Or is it (u + v)/(1 + uv/c²) when moving in opposite directions? No, wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up.

Wait, actually, the formula for the relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of one frame relative to another. But wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Suppose frame S sees object A moving at u and object B moving at v, both in the same direction. What is the speed of A as seen from B? Or vice versa.

I think the correct formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So for u=0.6c and v=0.5c, the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

Wait, numerator is 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's a clue.

Next, the total energy. The system's total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. Each astronaut's energy is gamma * m c², right? So for each
