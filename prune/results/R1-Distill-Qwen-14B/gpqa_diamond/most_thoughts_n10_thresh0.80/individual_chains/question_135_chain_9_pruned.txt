Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the allowed decay channels for this boson X. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f-bar ψf (y)(υ + X(y)) ψf(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that correctly. Oh wait, perhaps it's written as L(y) = -λ f f-bar ψf (y) (υ + X(y)) ψf(y). Hmm, maybe that's a typo or I'm misinterpreting the notation. Alternatively, perhaps it's written more clearly as something like L = -λ ψ_f^\dagger (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Because that would make sense for a Yukawa interaction term. The Yukawa coupling usually looks like ψ^\dagger φ ψ, where φ is the scalar field. In this case, the field is X, which is a boson.

So the interaction term is λ ψ_f^\dagger (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). But perhaps v is a constant, like the vacuum expectation value, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the term is written as (v + X(y)), which could mean X is a scalar field coupled to the fermion ψ_f.

Wait, the problem states that the interaction is given by that Lagrangian term. So the interaction term is between the boson X and the fermions. So the term would contribute to processes where the X boson is emitted or absorbed by fermions.

Now, the mass of the X boson is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order.

Kinematically allowed means that the decay products must have a combined mass less than or equal to the mass of X. So for each possible fermion-antifermion pair, their rest mass must be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

I need to list all possible fermions that are light enough so that when the X boson decays into a fermion-antifermion pair, their mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Wait, but in particle physics, the possible decay products of a boson would depend on which fermions are available and have a mass less than the boson's mass. So for each fermion f, the mass of
