Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about an acid-catalyzed reaction between 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A to form 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to find out what A and the catalyst B are from the given options.

First, let me think about the reaction. 3-methylpyrrolidine is a cyclic amine, right? It's a five-membered ring with four carbons and one nitrogen. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So looking at the product structure, there's a substituent added to the pyrrolidine ring.

Wait, the product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group attached. Cyclohexylidene means a cyclohexane ring with a double bond. So it's like a cyclohexene group attached via a methylene bridge. So the substituent is a cyclohexene ring connected by a CHâ‚‚ group.

I remember that reactions involving cyclic amines and aldehydes or ketones can form enamines. Enamine synthesis typically involves two steps: first, the formation of an imine by reacting an amine with a carbonyl compound, and then the removal of water to form the enamine, often using an acid catalyst.

So in the presence of an acid catalyst, the amine would react with a carbonyl compound. Let me think about what compound A could be. If the product has a cyclohexene group attached, maybe compound A is an aldehyde. Because when an aldehyde reacts with an amine, you can form an imine, which upon dehydration gives an enamine.

Wait, but wait. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl), which suggests that the substitution is on the pyrrolidine ring at position 1. So, the starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine, so positions 1, 2, 3, etc. So the substitution is at position 1.

So, when 3-methylpyrrolidine reacts with an aldehyde, perhaps cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (which is an aldehyde with a cyclohexyl group attached), the aldehyde would attack the amine. The first step would form an imine (Schiff base) which would then lose water to form the enamine under acidic conditions.

So, in the reaction, the 3-methylpyrrolidine would react with cyclohexanecarbaldehyde in the presence of an acid catalyst. The product would be the enamine, which is the 1-(cyclohexylidene) group attached to the pyrrolidine.

Looking at the options, option A says A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and B is TsOH. Option B is the same A with acetic acid as catalyst. Options C and D have vinylcyclohexane as A.

Wait, what's the difference between TsOH and acetic acid as catalysts? TsOH is p-toluenesulfonic acid, a strong acid catalyst. Acetic acid is a weaker acid but could also act as a catalyst in some reactions. For enamine formation, I think strong acids are often used because the dehydration step requires sufficient activation. So TsOH might be more suitable.

So if A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (which is an aldehyde), and the catalyst is TsOH, that would make sense. So option A is A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH.

Wait, but let me make sure. Are there any other possibilities? Could vinylcyclohexane be the right A? Vinylcyclohexane is an alkene, right? If A were an alkene, what reaction would happen with an amine under acid conditions?

Hmm, another possibility is some kind of addition reaction. Maybe a conjugate addition or something else. But I'm not sure, because the product is an enamine which suggests a carbonyl compound was involved.

Alternatively, could it be a Michael addition or something else? I'm not as familiar with that. But the enamine pathway seems more straightforward.

So, putting it together, compound A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and the catalyst is TsOH. So the correct option is A or B, depending on the catalyst.

Wait, the question says acid-catalyzed reaction. TsOH is a strong acid, acetic acid is a weaker acid but still an acid. Which is better for the reaction? Enamine formation usually uses strong acids for the dehydration step, so TsOH would be better. So option A is the right choice.

But let me double-check. Enamine synthesis steps: primary amine reacts with ketone or aldehyde to form imine. Then, acid catalysis leads to dehydration to form the enamine. So the reagents would be the aldehyde or ketone and acid.

So the correct answer is option A: A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and B is TsOH.


The reaction involves the acid-catalyzed formation of an enamine from 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A. The product, 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine, indicates that a cyclohexene group is attached to the pyrrolidine ring via a methylene bridge. This suggests that the reaction proceeds via the enamine synthesis pathway, which typically involves two steps: (1) the formation of an imine by reacting an amine with a carbonyl compound, and (2) dehydration of the imine to form the enamine, often using a strong acid catalyst.

Given the product structure, compound A must be an aldehyde, as aldehydes are commonly used in enamine synthesis. Among the options, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is the most suitable choice for A, as it provides the cyclohexene group in the product. The catalyst must facilitate the dehydration step, and TsOH (p-toluenesulfonic acid) is a strong acid commonly used for this purpose. Acetic acid, while acidic, is generally less effective for enamine formation compared to TsOH.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH. This is consistent with the reaction mechanism and the required conditions for enamine formation.
- **Option B**: A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = acetic acid. While cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is correct, acetic acid is a weaker acid and less suitable for the dehydration step.
- **Option C**: A = vinylcyclohexane, B = acetic acid. Vinylcyclohexane is an alkene and not a carbonyl compound, making it unsuitable for enamine formation.
- **Option D**: A = vinylcyclohexane, B = TsOH. Similar to Option C, vinylcyclohexane is not a carbonyl compound and cannot participate in enamine synthesis.

Thus, the correct choice is **Option A**, where A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and B is TsOH.

Answer: A
