Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break it down.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so it's quite a rigid molecule. When it's heated with KOH in excess, this is probably an elimination reaction. Since there are two bromine atoms, maybe it's a double elimination leading to a diene? Or perhaps a single elimination each, but I think elimination would form a double bond.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. From dibromide to something with KOH—maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation. So each Br is removed with a base, leading to the formation of a double bond. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two equivalents of HBr, forming 1,3-adamantadiene? Or maybe a cyclohexene-like structure? Hmm, but adamantane is a cage structure, so when two adjacent Brs are removed, perhaps it forms a double bond within the cage.

Looking at the NMR data for product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group. Wait, but wait—if it's an elimination, we should get an alkene, which wouldn't have a carbonyl. So maybe I'm wrong about the reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's not elimination but a substitution.

Wait, KOH is a strong base, but when heated with H2O or another nucleophile. Oh, wait! Maybe it's a hydrolysis. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane would need a nucleophilic substitution. However, since it's a di-substituted dibromide, perhaps it's undergoing an elimination to form a ketone? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or something else.

Wait, wait, the IR peak at 1720 is a strong carbonyl. So maybe the product is
