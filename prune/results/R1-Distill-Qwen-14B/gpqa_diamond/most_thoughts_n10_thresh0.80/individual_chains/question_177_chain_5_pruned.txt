Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I need to figure out by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. Hmm.

So, first, let's summarize what's given. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, M1 = 1.5 * M2. But wait, does mass affect luminosity directly? I think I remember that for stars, the luminosity isn't just about mass and radius but also about temperature. Oh wait, but the problem says to assume they radiate as black bodies. Oh right, so the luminosity of a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. So L depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power.

Wait, but the question mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, because for a black body, the peak wavelength is given by Wien's law: λ_max ≈ b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, then their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is same, then T is same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait! Wait, no. Because the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared* brightest are the same. So does that mean λ_max is the same, implying T1 = T2? If that's the case, then their temperatures are equal. So substituting into the luminosity equation, L is proportional to R² T⁴. Since T is same, L is proportional to R².

So, R1 is 1.5 R2. So R1² is (1.5)^2 = 2.25 times R2². So L1 would be 2.25 times L2. So the factor would be 2.25, which is option A.

But wait, let me think again. Are there any other factors I'm missing? The question also gives radial velocities. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s.
