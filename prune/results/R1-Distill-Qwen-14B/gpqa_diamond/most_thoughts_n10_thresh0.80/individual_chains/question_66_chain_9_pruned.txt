Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember from my studies that SMEFT is a framework that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries of the Standard Model. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are 1,2,3,4 with four possible combinations.

Let me think about each symmetry one by one. First, Lorentz Symmetry. I'm pretty sure that SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry because all the terms in the Standard Model do. Effective theories usually maintain the same symmetries as the underlying theory unless they're explicitly broken, but in SMEFT, the idea is to add terms that respect the SM's symmetries. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely a must.

Next, Poincaré symmetry. Wait, Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. I think all the SM terms respect Poincaré, so SMEFT operators should as well. But wait, in SMEFT, the terms are written in terms of the SM fields, so they should also include Poincaré symmetry. So does that mean both Lorentz and Poincaré are required? Or are they considered the same in this context? Because Lorentz is a subset of Poincaré. So the question is whether all operators must respect Poincaré symmetry. Since Poincaré includes translations, which are part of the spacetime symmetry. But I'm a bit confused. Wait, operators in the SMEFT are local, so I think Poincaré symmetry is automatically respected in the same way as Lorentz. So both 1 and 2 would be required. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, wait. Because the SM itself respects Poincaré symmetry. So SMEFT, which is a low-energy effective theory, should also respect that. So option 2, Poincaré symmetry, is part of what the operators must respect.

Wait, but let me think again. The Standard Model respects Poincaré symmetry, so the SMEFT operators are built from the SM fields, so they should also respect Poincaré. So 2 is correct.

Then, CP symmetry. Wait, does SMEFT require that all operators respect CP symmetry? I'm not sure. I know that the SM doesn't have a global CP symmetry; some processes violate CP. For example, in the electroweak theory, CP violation exists
