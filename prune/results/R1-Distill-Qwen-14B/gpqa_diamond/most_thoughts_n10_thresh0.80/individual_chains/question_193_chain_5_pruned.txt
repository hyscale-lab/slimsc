Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, with different exponents on r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax plx is the reciprocal of distance in parsecs, right? So plx (in arcseconds) equals 1 divided by distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/r, where r is in parsecs. Wait, wait, that might be important.

So if plx is 1/r, then r is 1/plx. So I can express r in terms of plx. But the problem gives the number of stars as varying with 1/plx^5. Let's write that equation.

So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since r = 1/plx, I can substitute that. So plx = 1/r, so plx^5 is (1/r)^5 = 1/(r^5). Therefore, 1/(plx^5) is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. Wait, but that's not considering the differential change with respect to distance.

Wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So, I think it's asking for the dependence of the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr, or maybe how the number of stars per unit volume or something like that.

Wait, the number of stars per unit volume would be the density. But if the number varies as 1/plx^5, which we've converted to r^5, then the number of stars in a region would depend on r^5. But how does that translate to the number per unit distance?

Wait, perhaps we should think in terms of the differential number of stars with respect to distance. Let me think about how N relates to r.

Wait, the number of stars in a region at distance r with a thin shell (like a spherical shell) of thickness dr. The volume of that shell is approximately 4πr² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the surface area (4πr²) times the thickness dr, but multiplied by the density at that radius.

Wait, but if the number of stars in the region is given as N ∝ 1/plx^5, which is r^5, then perhaps that's the total number of stars within a certain distance. Or maybe it's the number of stars per unit solid angle.

Wait, the problem says "in that region of the sky." So I think it's a specific direction, not a shell around the Earth. Hmm, perhaps it's a thin slice of the sky, but varying with distance.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the number of stars per unit area on the celestial sphere (since it's a region of the sky) as a function of distance.

Wait, wait, let me think about this more clearly. The number of stars would depend on the volume of space within a certain distance and the density of stars. But the problem says the number varies as
