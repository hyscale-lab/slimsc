Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the photosphere is the part of a star where light is emitted, and LTE stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, which probably means the conditions there follow the usual thermal physics laws, like the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for velocities and such.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I need to find the correct equation relating their effective temperatures, T1 and T2.

Wait, I think this involves the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann factor tells us the relative populations of energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium. The formula is something like the ratio of populations N_upper/N_lower = exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So for each star, the number of atoms in the excited state compared to the ground state would be given by the Boltzmann factor. Let me define the ratio for each star.

Let’s denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 = N1_upper / N1_lower. Similarly, for star_2, R2 = N2_upper / N2_lower. According to the problem, R1 is twice R2. So R1 = 2 * R2.

But wait, wait. Actually, the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. I think that means the ratio of excited to unexcited is twice in star_1 compared to star_2. So, R1 = 2 R2.

But the Boltzmann equation gives R = exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So for each star, R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) and R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)). So substituting, R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) and R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Given that R1 = 2 R2, that would give:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Let me take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify. 

So ln(exp(-ΔE/(k T1))) = ln(2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))).

Simplifying the left side: -ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + ln(exp(-ΔE/(k T2))).

The ln(exp(x)) is just x. So the right side becomes ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2).

So now the equation is:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2).

Let me rearrange terms. I'll move the terms involving ΔE to one side.

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2).

Factor out ΔE/(k), so:

ΔE/(k) [ (-1/T1) + (1/T2) ] = ln(2).

Wait, that's the same as:

ΔE/(k) [ (T2 - T1) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2).

So,

ΔE/(k) * (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Hmm, but wait. Let me think. T1 and T2 are the temperatures of star_1 and star_2, respectively. So if star_1 has higher temperature, it would have more excitation. Since R1 = 2 R2, and if T1 is higher, R1 would be higher. Wait, because higher temperature leads to more excitation. So if R1 is bigger than R2, that implies T1 is larger than T2.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Because the Boltzmann factor is exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So a higher T makes the exponent less negative, so the ratio is larger. So yes, higher T means higher R.

So in our equation, we have:

ΔE/(k) * (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Wait, but the left side is ΔE/(k) * ( (T2 - T1) ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

But wait, our equation after rearrangement is:

(ΔE/k) * ( (T2 - T1) )/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2).

But wait, the problem gives the energy difference as approximately 1.38e-23 J. Wait, 1.38e-23 is about k_B (Boltzmann's constant) multiplied by something. Because k_B is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K.
