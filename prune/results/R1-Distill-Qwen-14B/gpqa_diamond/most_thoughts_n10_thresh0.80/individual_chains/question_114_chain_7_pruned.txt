Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question to tackle. It's about selecting the right reagents for a couple of reactions. Let me see... I'll start by breaking down each reaction and think about what's happening.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? And the product looks like it's a cyanohydrin. So, the reaction must be the addition of cyanide to a ketone.

Wait, I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, it forms a cyanohydrin. The mechanism is probably via nucleophilic addition. I think the cyanide acts as a nucleophile attacking the carbonyl carbon. But wait, doesn't that require some acid catalysis? Oh right, the formation of the cyanohydrin typically uses an acid. Because the acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic for the CN- to attack.

So the reagent A must be something that provides H+ ions. Let me look at the options. Options A and B have A as H3O+ or NaHSO3. H3O+ is a strong acid, which would make sense for protonating the ketone. NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a source of H+ and also bisulfite ions. Wait, but in the presence of HCN, I think H+ is necessary for the formation of the cyanohydrin. So A is likely H3O+.

Wait another thing, sometimes when using NaCN, you might need to add an acid because NaCN is a weak base. So in the reaction, perhaps the solution is acidic to drive the reaction. So A being H3O+ would make sense. So that points towards options A or B for reagent A.

The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B in water to give a butanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Hmm, what reagents are used for that transformation?

Nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions. I remember that hydrolysis of nitriles can be done in acidic or basic conditions. In acidic conditions, it's typically using H2SO4 and heat, which would form the amide first and then the acid. Alternatively, in basic conditions, you might use HCl or another strong acid.

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid. So the hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid... what's the typical reagent? Oh right, when you treat a nitrile with H2O in the presence of HCl (like a HCl and H2O), or perhaps with other strong acids. Alternatively, in some cases, you use a strong acid like H2SO4 as a catalyst.

Looking at the options, reagent B is either HCl or CH3COOH (acetic acid). So if B is HCl, then the reaction would be hydrolyzing the nitrile to a carboxylic acid under acidic conditions. Alternatively, maybe using acetic acid as a weak acid might not be strong enough, but sometimes in the presence of heat, it can work.

Wait, but let's think about the conditions. The first step is the formation of the cyanohydrin, which requires acid. The second step is hydrolysis of the nitrile to the acid. So in the second reaction, reagent B is H2O, so the solvent is water. So the reagent B is likely an acid that provides H+ in water, enabling the hydrolysis.

Hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids usually requires strong acidic conditions. For example, using concentrated HCl with heat. Alternatively, another possibility is using H2SO4 as the acid. But looking at the options, I don't see H2SO4. The options for B are HCl (option A and C) or CH3COOH (option B and D).

Wait, but acetic acid is a weak acid. Maybe in some cases, but for nitrile hydrolysis, strong acid is needed. So B would be HCl, which is a strong acid. So looking at the options, which ones have B as HCl? Option A and C.

Earlier, for the first reaction, A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. We thought A is H3O+ for the first reaction, which points to option A or B.

Let me recap. First reaction:

Butan-2-one + NaCN + A â†’ 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

So the reagent A is H3O+ because the reaction is acid-catalyzed. So for A, option A has H3O+ (option A), and option B also has H3O+ for A.

Wait, the options are:

Option A: A = H3O+, B =
