Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about a star with certain characteristics and how spots on its surface affect the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that stars have things called starspots, which are cooler regions on their surface. These spots can affect the overall temperature of the star, which in turn affects the behavior of the atoms in the photosphere.

So, the star's parameters: 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. I think the effective temperature is the temperature we observe from the star, considering its size and luminosity.

The main point of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Ã…, which is in the near-ultraviolet range.

Wait, LTE means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, which is an assumption that each small region of the photosphere is in equilibrium, so the Saha equation and Boltzmann equation apply. So, for each region, the ionization and excitation can be treated locally.

So, the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

The problem says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower (5500 K). But wait, starspots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So, when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall observed Teff is lower. But what's the actual temperature of the spots? Or perhaps the problem is simplifying that the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is 5500 K when spots are present. Hmm, but I think starspots have their own lower temperature, but the problem says that when the surface isn't covered, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So perhaps the photosphere's effective T is now 5500 K when spots are present.

Wait, but when part of the surface is cooler, the overall luminosity decreases, which affects the effective temperature. So, the star as a whole appears cooler. But each region (spot and non-spot) has its own temperature. However, the problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps for the purpose of this problem, the effective temperature of the entire photosphere when spots are present is 5500 K.

Wait, no. Effective temperature is a measure derived from the total luminosity and radius. So, when spots cover part of the surface, they emit less, so the average T_eff would be lower. So, in this case, when 40% is spots (cooler), the overall T_eff is 5500 K. But each region (spot and non-spot) has its own temperature. But the problem says when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K.

Wait, but the problem is about the photosphere as a whole. So, when there are spots, the average T_eff is lower. So, for the entire photosphere, the effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K when they aren't.

But wait, the spots themselves are cooler. So, when 40% of the surface is spots, the overall T_eff is 5500 K. So, the photosphere is a mix of hotter and cooler regions, but the total luminosity gives T_eff of 5500 K.

But this might complicate the calculation because each region has its own temperature. But the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, so I think each region is treated in LTE, but when considering the entire star, the observed ratio is a mix of the contributions from the spotted and unspotted regions.

Wait, but the observed ratio is given as a decrease when the star has spots. So, perhaps the overall photosphere's average T is lower, so each region's T is lower, or perhaps the average T is lower.

Wait, but the problem says the ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So, the
