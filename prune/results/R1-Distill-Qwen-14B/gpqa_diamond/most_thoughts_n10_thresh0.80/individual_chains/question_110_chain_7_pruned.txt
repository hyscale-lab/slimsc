Alright, so I've got this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that both telescopes have different limits for how bright a star needs to be in the V magnitude to be observed. Wait, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, while HIRES can observe down to 16 mag. So a star needs to be brighter than 17 to be seen by ESPRESSO, and brighter than 16 for HIRES. Wait, no, wait. Wait, noâ€”brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So magnitude 17 is fainter than 16. So ESPRESSO can see stars up to 17, which is fainter than what HIRES can see up to 16. So any star that's brighter than 16 (which is brighter than 17) can be seen by both. Because if a star is, say, 15 mag, it's brighter than both limits. But if a star is 17 mag, ESPRESSO can see it but HIRES cannot, because HIRES's limit is 16. So the stars that can be seen by both must have apparent V magnitude less than 17 and also less than 16? No, wait. Wait, wait. Let me think again.

ESPRESSO: can observe stars with V mag
