Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again carefully.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. So, the setup is that we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the correct one is among A to D.

First, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When they react, the acid will neutralize the base until they reach the equivalence point, where moles of acid equal moles of base.

Let me break this down into two parts: the pH at 25% titration and the pH at equivalence point.

Starting with the initial solution after dilution. The volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³, and we add 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40.00 cm³, which is 0.04 liters.

The initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.05 M. Since we dilute it by adding the same volume of water, the new concentration should be half, right? Because concentration is inversely proportional to volume when moles are constant. So 0.05 M divided by 2 is 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid would be 0.05 M * 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters) = 0.001 moles. Diluting with 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water makes the total volume 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Yeah, that's correct.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, the first step is to calculate the equivalence point. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M. So moles of NaOH needed = moles of acetic acid = 0.001.

Volume of NaOH needed is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 liters, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But the first part of the question is about the pH at 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence point volume would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So at this point, only 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the equivalence point is 10 cm³, so 25% titration is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So let me calculate the moles of NaOH added here: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of acetic acid, the amount of acid neutralized is 0.00025 moles.

The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001, so the remaining moles of acetic acid are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And the moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed would be 0.00025 moles.

But wait, the total volume at this point is the initial 40 cm³ plus the 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So total volume is 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations would be [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M, and [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Wait, but wait, is the NaOH solution adding 2.5 cm³? Yes. So the total solution volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³.

Now, with these concentrations, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.

The Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is given by -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)).

Let me calculate that. 1.85e-5 is 1.85 x 10^-5. So the pKa is 4.735 approximately (since log(1.85)=0.267, so 5-0.267=4.733).

Wait, wait, let me compute it more accurately. Let's see, log(1.85) is about 0.267. So log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733, approximately 4.73.

So pH = 4.73 + log( (0.005882)/(0.017647) )

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is -0.4771. So pH ≈ 4.73 -0.4771 ≈4.2529, which is approximately 4.25.

Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 for the first pH.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Let me calculate the concentrations again.

Moles of CH3COOH after adding NaOH: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 mol.

Volume is 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

So [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

Ratio is 0.005882/0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

So log(0.333) is indeed about -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 -0.477 ≈4.25.

Hmm, option A has 4.26, which is very close.

Now, the second part: pH at the equivalence point.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water, which will hydrolyze to produce a basic solution.

The concentration of acetate ions at equivalence can be calculated.

Moles of acetate at equivalence: 0.001 mol (since all the acetic acid was neutralized).

Total volume is initial 40 mL + 10 mL of NaOH added, which is 50 mL (0.05 L).

Concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb =5.405e-10.

The initial concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

So setting up the ICE table:

Initial: [CH3COO^-] = 0.02, [CH3COOH]=0, [OH^-]=0.

Change: -x, +x, +x.

At equilibrium: [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x, [CH3COOH]=x, [OH^-]=x.

Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So Kb ≈ x^2 / 0.02 =5.405e-10.

x^2 = 0.02 *5.405e-10 =1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] =1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98.

So pH =14 -4.98≈9.02.

Wait, but none of the options have 9.02. Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Kb. Let me re-calculate Kb.

Ka is 1.85e-5, Kw is 1e-14. So Kb=1e-14/1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10.

Wait, that's correct. So the calculation seems right, but the pH at equivalence point is around 9.02. But looking at the options, none of them have a pH near 9. The options are:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17; 6.73

C)4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

Hmm, none of the equivalence points are close to 9. So perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, maybe I messed up the moles.

Wait, wait: the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol. At equivalence, all of that is converted to acetate.

But the total volume is 40 mL + 10 mL =50 mL, so 0.05 L.

Concentration of acetate is 0.001 /0.05=0.02 M. That part is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing: when you titrate a weak acid with a strong base, the equivalence point is in the basic region, so pH >7.

But the options don't have any pH above 8.52.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH more accurately.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the Ka value. Let me check the given data again: Ka is 1.85e-5. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute x more accurately.

x^2 = 0.02 *5.405e-10 =1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) = 1.04e-5 M.

pOH is -log(1.04e-5) = 4.98.

pH is 14-4.98=9.02.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I did something wrong earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH differently. Maybe I should consider the exact solution without the approximation.

Let me set up the equation without approximation.

The equation is Kb = x^2/(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

So x^2 =5.405e-10 * (0.02 -x).

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 -x ≈ 0.02, but perhaps it's better to solve it exactly.

But with such a small Kb, x is indeed negligible. So the previous calculation holds.

Hmm, but this suggests that the pH at equivalence is about 9.02, which isn't among the options. So maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait a minute, perhaps I messed up the moles. Let me calculate the moles again.

Wait, initial acetic acid is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. Moles =0.05 *0.02 =0.001 mol. Correct.

At equivalence, all 0.001 mol of acetic acid is neutralized, producing 0.001 mol acetate.

But wait, the volume is 40 +10=50 cm³. So 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.001 /0.05 = 0.02 M, correct.

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in using Kb. Let me recompute Kb.

Ka =1.85e-5 → Kb= 1e-14 / 1.85
