Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, let's read the problem again carefully. The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting the two speeds, right? Because at high speeds, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, I remember the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). So I need to calculate that.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the two astronauts are moving in the same direction. So their velocities are both in the same direction. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, what's B's speed? Or vice versa? Wait, but the problem says "relative speed"—I think it's asking for the speed of one as seen from the other. So which one is which?

Wait, the problem says "two astronauts" moving at those speeds. So perhaps we have to find the relative speed between them. So relative velocity, yes. So let's call astronaut 1 as the one moving at 0.6c, and astronaut 2 at 0.5c.

So the relative velocity v_rel would be (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Let's plug in the numbers.

v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c.

So numerator is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c.

Denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3 c² / c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Hmm, total energy in relativity includes the rest mass energy plus kinetic energy, but wait wait: when we talk about total energy, in the context of the system, I think we're considering the sum of their relativistic energies.

Each astronaut's energy is given by gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for each one, calculate their energy and add them together.

So for astronaut 1 (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E1 = Gamma1 * 2m c² = 1
