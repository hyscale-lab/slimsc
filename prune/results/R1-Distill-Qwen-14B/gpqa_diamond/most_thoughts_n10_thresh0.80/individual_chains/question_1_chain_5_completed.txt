Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see. The question is about the energy difference between two quantum states so that they can be clearly distinguished. Hmm.

So, the problem states that there are two states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. Wait, the lifetimes... I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle relates the energy of a particle to the precision of its measurement. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle! It says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of ħ/2, but often approximated as ΔEΔt ≈ ħ. 

So, the uncertainty in energy depends on the lifetime of the state because the lifetime is the time over which the energy is measured. The longer the lifetime, the more precisely the energy can be measured because there's more time to observe it, leading to a smaller uncertainty. Alternatively, a shorter lifetime means a larger uncertainty in energy.

The question is asking for the energy difference that allows us to clearly resolve the two states. That means the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state, right? Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, we wouldn't be able to distinguish them.

Wait, but each state has its own lifetime. So the uncertainty in energy for each state would be based on their respective lifetimes. Let me think: for state E1 with a lifetime τ1 = 1e-9 seconds, the uncertainty ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(τ1). Similarly, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(τ2), where τ2 is 1e-8 seconds.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So we need the difference |E2 - E1| to be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe each's uncertainty? Or maybe the maximum of the two uncertainties?

Alternatively, perhaps the energy resolution is determined by the shorter lifetime. Because the state with the shorter lifetime has a larger uncertainty. So if the difference is larger than the uncertainty of the state with the shorter lifetime, we can resolve them. Let me think more.

Suppose the two states have different uncertainties. The state with the shorter lifetime (E1) has a larger uncertainty (since ΔE ≈ ħ/τ, so shorter τ means larger ΔE). So if the energy difference is larger than the larger uncertainty, then the two states can be distinguished. Because even the state with the larger uncertainty would have a width that's less than the energy difference.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. If E1 has a larger uncertainty, then the energy levels are sort of spread out more. So to resolve them, the separation between E2 and E1 needs to be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, maybe. Or maybe larger than the largest uncertainty, because the sum could be too much.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty of the shorter-lived state. Because if the difference is bigger than that, the states can be resolved. Because the broader (shorter lifetime) state's uncertainty is larger.

So let me compute the uncertainties. Let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

I remember that ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But since the options are in eV, maybe I should use ħ in eV·s. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So, converting ħ to eV·s:

ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, for E1, τ1 = 1e-9 s. So ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 ≈ 6.582e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.582e-7 eV. That's 6.582e-7 eV.

For E2, τ2 = 1e-8 s. ΔE2 ≈ 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.

So, the energy difference between E2 and E1 needs to be larger than the maximum of these two uncertainties, I think. Because the uncertainty in each state would affect the ability to resolve the difference.

Wait, but what's the maximum of ΔE1 and ΔE2? ΔE1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, which is bigger than ΔE2 (6.58e-8 eV). So the larger uncertainty is from E1. So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than 6.58e-7 eV for them to be resolvable.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: 1e-9 eV → 0.001 eV? No, that's way smaller than 6.5e-7 eV.

Option B: 1e-11 eV → even smaller. No.

Option C: 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV? Wait, 1e-4 is 0.0001, which is 1e-4 eV. Hmm, 6.58e-7 is 0.000000658 eV. So 1e-4 is much larger than that. So the difference is much bigger than the maximum uncertainty. So this would be resolvable.

Option D: 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV. Wait, 6.5e-7 eV is 6.5e-7, which is larger than 1e-8. So 1e-8 is smaller than the required difference, so that wouldn't be enough.

So the only option that provides a difference larger than the maximum uncertainty (which is 6.58e-7 eV) is option C, 1e-4 eV.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) to the lifetime (\( \tau \)) of the state: 

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau}.
\]

Here, \( \hbar \) is approximately \( 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \). For the two states:

1. For \( E_1 \) with \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. For \( E_2 \) with \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the larger of the two uncertainties, \( \Delta E_1 \), which is \( 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

Now, we evaluate the options:

- **Option A (\( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is smaller than \( \Delta E_1 \), so the energy difference is insufficient to resolve the states.
- **Option B (\( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is even smaller than \( \Delta E_1 \), so it is also insufficient.
- **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is much larger than \( \Delta E_1 \), so the energy difference is sufficient to resolve the states.
- **Option D (\( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is smaller than \( \Delta E_1 \), so the energy difference is insufficient.

The only option that provides an energy difference large enough to clearly distinguish the two states is **Option C**.

Answer: C
