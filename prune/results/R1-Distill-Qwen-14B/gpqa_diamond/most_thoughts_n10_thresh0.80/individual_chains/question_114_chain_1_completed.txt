Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with different combinations for A and B. So, I need to figure out what A and B are.

Let me start with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. The reaction with NaCN and A gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, what's that structure? Let me draw it out.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN... Oh, wait, I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition. NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So, the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon. But then, what would happen after that?

Wait, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, it typically forms a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is where the cyanide adds to the carbonyl, and then a proton is added somewhere. So, the product would be a secondary alcohol with a cyano group attached.

Looking at the product: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure is CH2(CO2H)(CN)CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, butanenitrile suggests a four-carbon chain with a nitrile group. Wait, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? Hmm, maybe I should draw it as:

The starting ketone is (CH3)2CO. The cyanide adds here. So, the product would have the structure where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by a -OH and -CN group. So, the product would have the structure (CH3)2C(OH)CN, but wait, wait. Let me think.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- to the carbonyl carbon would give (CH3)2C(O-)CN. Then, perhaps protonation occurs. But what's the exact structure? Alternatively, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So, that's 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Yes, because butanenitrile has four carbons, with the nitrile on the first carbon. So, the structure would be:

CH2(CN)C(OH)(CH3)CH2? Wait, no. Wait, butane is four carbons. So, the nitrile is on the first carbon, and the hydroxyl and methyl are on the second. So, the structure would be CH2CN-C(OH)(CH3)2? No, wait, maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? That's more likely. So, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

So, the reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. To form a cyanohydrin, the ketone reacts with CN- in an acidic condition. Because the mechanism typically involves the attack of the nucleophile on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon, but the carbonyl oxygen is protonated to make it a better leaving group. So, perhaps in the presence of an acid catalyst.

So, what is reagent A? Looking at the options, in the first part, A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. H3O+ is a strong acid, which would protonate the carbonyl oxygen. NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate, which is also an acid, but perhaps a weaker one or providing H+ as well.

So, for the formation of the cyanohydrin, the reaction is typically done under acidic conditions. So, I think H3O+ (option A or B) is the right choice for A.

Wait, but what about NaHSO3? Sodium bisulfate is a source of H+ and SO3^2- ions. In some reactions, like in the hydroboration, but not sure here. Alternatively, maybe in the presence of a weak acid, but I think the cyanohydrin formation usually uses an acid catalyst like H2SO4 or HCl. But looking at the options, H3O+ is a possible choice.

So, for reagent A, choices are H3O+ or NaHSO3. I'll tentatively think that A is H3O+ since it's a strong acid, which would facilitate the protonation of the carbonyl oxygen, making the addition of CN- easier.

Now, moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So, the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid group. How does that happen? Typically, nitriles are oxidized to carboxylic acids under certain conditions.

Wait, oxidation of nitriles to carboxylic acids usually involves a strong oxidizing agent. Common reagents include KMnO4 under acidic conditions, or other strong oxidizing agents like K2Cr2O7 under acidic conditions. Alternatively, sometimes using H2O with an acid catalyst could be involved, but I think more likely, it's a strong oxidizing agent.

But in the second reaction, the reagent B is H2O. Wait, the problem states that in the second step, the reagent is B (H2O). Hmm, that's confusing. Let me read that again.

Wait, the second reaction is: compound + B (H2O) → product.

Wait, no, perhaps it's written as compound + B (which is H2O) → product. So, B is H2O, but that seems odd because H2O alone wouldn't do much. Alternatively, perhaps B is an acid catalyst in the presence of water.

Wait, maybe the reaction is hydrolysis. But nitriles hydrolyze under acidic or basic conditions. Let me think. Acidic hydrolysis of nitriles would typically use H2O with an acid catalyst, like H2SO4, to produce carboxylic acids. Alternatively, in basic conditions, you get a carboxylate.

So, the given product is a carboxylic acid, so it's likely that the nitrile underwent hydrolysis under acidic conditions.

So, the reaction would be nitrile → carboxylic acid via hydrolysis. The conditions for this are usually H2O with an acid catalyst, like H3O+ or H2SO4.

Looking at the options, reagent B is either HCl (option A or C) or CH3COOH (option B or D).

Wait, the second reaction uses B, which is H2O. So, perhaps the reagent is an acid. So, in the second reaction, the reagent is H2O, but the condition is acidic. So, the reagent B in the problem must be the acid.

Wait, the problem says: + B (H2O). Hmm, that's a bit unclear. Perhaps B is the acid, and H2O is the solvent.

Alternatively, maybe B is H2O, but that seems unlikely because H2O alone would not be enough for hydrolysis without an acid or base.

Wait, the problem lists the reagents as A and B. Let me see.

Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product.

Reaction 2: [compound] + B (H2O) → product.

Wait, perhaps in reaction 2, reagent B is the acid, and H2O is the solvent? Or maybe the reaction is in water with an acid catalyst.

So, for the second reaction, which is converting nitrile to carboxylic acid, the conditions are H2O with an acid. So, the acid would be the reagent B.

Looking at the options, B can be HCl or CH3COOH.

So, which acid is used for nitrile hydrolysis? Typically, strong acids like HCl or H2SO4 are used. So, for the second reaction, B would be HCl, perhaps.

Wait, but what about the other possibilities. Let's think about each option:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

So, reaction 1: H3O+ as the acid. Reaction 2: HCl as the acid.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl.

Option D: A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH.

So, in the second reaction, using HCl would provide the acidic conditions for hydrolysis of the nitrile.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. So, when it's hydrolyzed, it becomes a carboxylic acid. So, that's a typical acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.

So, the reagent B would be an acid, so either HCl or CH3COOH.

But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid. Could that be sufficient for this hydrolysis?

I think that for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid, you typically need more vigorous conditions. So, using a strong acid like HCl would be more effective.

So, if reagent B is HCl, then in option A, B is HCl. So, option A's B is HCl.

So, looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but let me think about the first reaction again. If A is H3O+, that would make the first reaction proceed via acid-catalyzed addition of CN-.

So, putting it together: first reaction uses H3O+ (A) for acid catalysis, and second reaction uses HCl (B) as the acid catalyst.

Looking at the options, option A has A=H3O+, B=HCl.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the first reaction uses H3O+ and the second reaction uses H2O with HCl as the acid.

Alternatively, could the second reaction use H2O with HCl as the acid. So, B would be HCl.

So, option A's B is HCl, which would fit.

But wait, another possibility: sometimes, nitriles are hydrolyzed using a mixture of H2O and an acid, like H2SO4. But if our options don't have H2SO4, then perhaps HCl is the next best.

So, if option A is the right choice, that would be A=H3O+ and B=HCl.

But let me check the other options. Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl.

So, would NaHSO3 work as a catalyst for the first reaction? NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and SO3^2-.

Wait, but in the first reaction, we have a ketone reacting with NaCN. The mechanism involves acid catalysis. So, using H3O+ (a strong acid) is more likely to protonate and facilitate the attack of CN-.

NaHSO3 is a weaker acid than H3O+. HSO3^- is a weaker acid than H3O+ (which is H+ in H3O+). So, perhaps H3O+ is a better choice for the first reaction.

So, I think option A is correct, with A=H3O+ and B=HCl.

Wait, but let's think about the second reaction again. The product is a carboxylic acid, so the nitrile must have been hydrolyzed under acidic conditions. So, B is HCl, which is a strong acid, so that would make sense.

But another possibility: sometimes, nitriles are hydrolyzed using H2O with H2SO4 as the acid. So, B could be H2SO4, but since it's not an option, HCl is the alternative.

So, putting it all together, the correct reagents would be A as H3O+ and B as HCl, which is option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. What's reagent A in the first reaction? The product is a cyanohydrin. The formation of cyanohydrin requires an acid catalyst. So, H3O+ is the right choice. So, option A's A is correct.

But looking at the options again, option D has A=NaHSO3 and B=CH3COOH.

Wait, could the first reaction use NaHSO3 as the catalyst? Hmm.

Sodium bisulfate (NaHSO3) is a source of H+ and bisulfate ions. In some reactions, like in the hydrolysis of esters under acidic conditions, or in some condensation reactions, NaHSO3 can act as a catalyst. But in the case of the cyanohydrin formation, which requires a strong acid to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, maybe H3O+ is better because it's a stronger acid.

So, the first reaction would proceed better with H3O+ rather than NaHSO3. Therefore, option A or B would be considered for A.

Wait, option B's A is H3O+ and B is CH3COOH.

But in the second reaction, CH3COOH is a weak acid. Would that be enough for the hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid?

I'm not so sure. Nitrile hydrolysis under acidic conditions typically requires a strong acid. So, using HCl (a strong acid) is more likely to work.

So, that would point towards option A (A=H3O+, B=HCl) being the correct choice.

Another angle: in the second reaction, the starting material is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, but wait no, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. When the nitrile is at a certain position, perhaps steric factors or other groups affect the reaction. But regardless, the reaction is nitrile to carboxylic acid, so the reagent is acid.

So, to recap:

Reaction 1: Uses A as H3O+ to form cyanohydrin.

Reaction 2: Uses B as HCl to hydrolyze nitrile to carboxylic acid.

So, option A is the correct one.


The problem involves determining the correct reagents for two reactions:

1. **Reaction 1**: Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction, where the ketone reacts with CN⁻ under acidic conditions. Acid catalysis is required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, facilitating the nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent for A, as it effectively provides the necessary acidic environment. NaHSO₃, while acidic, is less effective for this purpose compared to H₃O⁺.

2. **Reaction 2**: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (in the presence of H₂O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, which typically requires strong acidic conditions. HCl is a strong acid and is well-suited for this reaction, making it the appropriate choice for B. CH₃COOH, being a weak acid, is less likely to efficiently drive the reaction to completion.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This combination is suitable for both reactions, as H₃O⁺ provides the necessary acidic conditions for cyanohydrin formation, and HCl is effective for nitrile hydrolysis.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While H₃O⁺ is correct for Reaction 1, CH₃COOH is not strong enough for Reaction 2, making this option incorrect.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is less effective than H₃O⁺ for Reaction 1, so this option is incorrect.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Both reagents are unsuitable for their respective reactions, making this option incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, corresponding to **Option A**.
