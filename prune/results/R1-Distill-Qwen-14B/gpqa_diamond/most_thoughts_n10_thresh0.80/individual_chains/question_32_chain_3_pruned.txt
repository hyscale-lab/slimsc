Alright, so I've got this physics problem to solve. It's about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to figure out what the nucleus is. The question says it's nucleus X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Li usually has 3 protons. So, Li normally has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, that would make the mass number 3 + 3 = 6. So Li-6. Got it. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

Now, RHIC collides heavy ions, and the energy is related to the kinetic energy and the rest mass of the ions. But wait, what exactly are we calculating here? The question asks for the energy of RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. So I think they're referring to the total energy, which includes both kinetic and rest mass energy. Or maybe just the kinetic? Hmm, I need to be careful.

Wait, when particles are accelerated to a certain speed, their total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy. So gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the speed. So the total energy E is gamma * m0c², where m0 is the rest mass.

But wait, the question says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c." So probably, it's the kinetic energy that's being asked for, but not entirely sure. Alternatively, sometimes in these contexts, the energy is given as the kinetic energy. Hmm.

Wait, let me think. When physicists talk about the energy of a collider, they usually refer to the kinetic energy imparted to each beam. So each ion is accelerated to a certain kinetic energy. So the question is probably asking for the kinetic energy of the nucleus.

So, the steps I should take are:

1. Find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus.
2. Calculate the gamma factor for speed v = 0.96c.
3. Then, compute the kinetic energy as (gamma - 1) * m0c².

Alternatively, if the question is asking for the total energy, it's gamma * m0c².

Wait, the options are given in GeV, which is a unit of energy. So I think the question is asking for the kinetic energy because the total energy would be a lot higher when you include the rest mass. But wait, let's check.

Wait, the rest mass energy for a Li nucleus. Let's calculate that.

First, the atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.015 u (I think Li-6 has a mass of about 6.015 atomic mass units). Let me recall: for Li-6, the exact mass is about 6.0150866 u. So converting that to kg might be tricky, but perhaps it's easier to calculate in terms of MeV/c².

Wait, 1 u ≈ 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.015 u is 6.01
