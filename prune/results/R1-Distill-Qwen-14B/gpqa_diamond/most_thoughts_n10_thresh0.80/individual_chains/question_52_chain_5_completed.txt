Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and jot down the key points.

So the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The task is to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, right. So I remember that in stellar atmospheres under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor: (n1/n2) = exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where E2 and E1 are the energies of the two levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, are we looking at n1/n2 or n2/n1? Because the question says the ratio decreases when spots are present. So when there are spots, the overall Teff is lower, so the ratio is lower. Let me think: if the ratio n1/n2 is higher at higher temperatures, then a lower T would make the ratio smaller. So the ratio we're considering is n1/n2, and when T decreases, n1/n2 decreases.

Wait, no. Let's get this right. The Boltzmann factor is (n_i /n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if E2 is higher than E1, then the numerator is E2 - E1, which is positive. So (n1/n2) = exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ) = exp( (E1-E2)/(k T) ). So as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio increases. So higher T means higher n1/n2. That makes sense because higher energy levels are more populated at higher temperatures.

So when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower (5500 K compared to 6000 K when it's spotless). So the ratio n1/n2 is lower when the star has spots. The question says that when spots are present, the ratio is lower, which aligns with this.

The question asks for the factor by which this ratio changes. So we need to find (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Expressed mathematically, that's [ (n1/n2)_T=6000K ] / [ (n1/n2)_T=5500K ].

Using the Boltzmann equation, this would be [exp( (E1 - E2)/(k*6000) ) ] / [exp( (E1 - E2)/(k*5500) ) ].

Which simplifies to exp( (E1 - E2)/(k) [ 1/6000 - 1/5500 ] ).

Wait, let me compute that. Let's factor this:

(E1 - E2)/(k) is a constant, let's call it ΔE/(k). So,

1/6000 - 1/5500 = (5500 - 6000)/(6000*5500) ) = (-500)/(33,000,000) ) = -500 / 3.3e7.

Wait, let me compute that numerically. 6000 * 5500 is 33,000,000. So 5500 - 6000 is -500. So the numerator is -500, denominator 33e6. So the value is -500/(33e6) = -5/(33e4) ) approximately.

Wait, 33e6 is 33,000,000. So 500/33e6 is 500 / 33,000,000 = 5 / 330,000 = 1/(66,000) approximately.

Wait, let me compute it as a decimal. 500 / 33e6 = 5e2 / 3.3e7 = (5/3.3) * 1e-5 = approx 1.515 * 1e-5 ≈ 1.515e-5.

Wait, but the numerator was 5500 - 6000 = -500. So the entire term is (-500)/(33e6) = -5e2 /3.3e7 = -5/(3.3e5) )= approximately -1.515e-5.

So putting it all together, the exponent is ΔE/(k) * (-1.515e-5). So the ratio becomes exp( [ΔE/(k)] * (-1.515e-5) ) ).

Wait, but that's the exponent for the entire factor. So the factor is exp( [ (E1 - E2)/(k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) ] ) )

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me re-express 1/6000 - 1/5500.

Let me compute 1/6000 and 1/5500:

1/6000 = 0.000166667

1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818

So 0.000166667 - 0.000181818 = (approx) -0.000015151.

So 1/6000 - 1/5500 = -0.000015151.

So the exponent is (E1 - E2)/(k) * (-0.000015151). Let's compute that.

But I don't have the value of (E1 - E2). Oh wait, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. So the energy difference between the two levels is related to the photon energy. So the energy of the photon emitted when transitioning from level 2 to level 1 is E = hc/lambda.

So E2 - E1 = hc / lambda.

So (E1 - E2) = -hc/lambda.

So plugging this into the exponent:

(E1 - E2)/(k) * (-0.000015151) = [ -hc/lambda ] / k * (-0.000015151 )

Which equals (hc)/(lambda k) * 0.000015151.

So I can compute this term.

Let me compute each value:

h is Planck's constant: 6.62607015e-34 J·s

c is speed of light: 2.99792458e8 m/s

lambda is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

k is Boltzmann's constant: 1.380649e-23 J/K.

So let me compute hc/lambda k.

Compute hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = approx 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Wait, let's compute it precisely:

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s

c = 2.99792458e8 m/s

So hc = 6.62607015e-34 * 2.99792458e8 = let's compute that.

6.62607015e-34 * 3e8 is approx 1.9878e-25. Let me be precise:

6.62607015e-34 * 2.99792458e8 = ?

6.62607015 * 2.99792458 ≈ 19.8646...

So 19.8646e-34+8 = 19.8646e-26 = 1.98646e-25 J·m.

Now, lambda is 1448e-10 m. So hc/lambda = 1.98646e-25 / 1.448e-7 m.

Wait, 1448e-10 m is 1.448e-7 m. So:

1.98646e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.98646 / 1.448 )e-18 ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

Then, hc/(lambda k) = (1.372e-18 J ) / (1.380649e-23 J/K) ) ≈ 9.94e4 K.

Wait, let me compute that:

1.372e-18 / 1.380649e-23 = (1.372 / 1.380649) * 1e5 ≈ (approx 0.994) * 1e5 = 9.94e4 K.

So the exponent is (hc/(lambda k)) * 0.000015151.

Wait, (hc/(lambda k)) is about 9.94e4 K.

Multiply that by 0.000015151:

9.94e4 * 1.5151e-5 = ?

9.94e4 = 99400

1.5151e-5 = 0.000015151

So 99400 * 0.000015151 = let's compute.

99400 * 0.000015151 = 99400 * 1.5151e-5.

Compute 99400 * 1.5151e-5:

First, 1e5 is 100,000. 99400 is 0.994 * 1e5.

So 0.994 * 1e5 * 1.5151e-5 = 0.994 * 1.5151 = approx 1.506.

So the exponent is approximately 1.506.

So the factor is exp(1.506) ≈ e^1.506.

What is e^1.5? e^1 is 2.718..., e^1.5 is about 4.48. Let me compute 1.506.

e^1.506 = e^(1.5 + 0.006) = e^1.5 * e^0.006.

e^0.006 is approx 1 + 0.006 + (0.006)^2/2 = 1.006 + 0.000018 = ~1.006018.

So e^1.506 ≈4.48 * 1.006018 ≈ 4.48 * 1.006 ≈ 4.507.

So the factor is approximately 4.5, which is option C.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

A) ~1.1

B) ~7.8

C) ~4.5

D) ~2.9

So the factor is about 4.5, so the correct answer is C.


The problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when a star transitions from having no spots (effective temperature \( T = 6000 \, \text{K} \)) to having spots (\( T = 5500 \, \text{K} \)). This ratio is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \exp\left(\frac{E_1 - E_2}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) are the energies of the two levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T=6000}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T=5500}} = \exp\left(\frac{E_1 - E_2}{k} \left(\frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500}\right)\right).
\]

The energy difference \( E_2 - E_1 \) corresponds to the photon energy emitted during the transition, which is related to the wavelength \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \) by:

\[
E_2 - E_1 = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant and \( c \) is the speed of light. Substituting the values:

\[
h = 6.62607015 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}, \quad c = 2.99792458 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}, \quad \lambda = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m},
\]

we calculate:

\[
hc = 1.98646 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J·m}, \quad \frac{hc}{\lambda} = 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

The term \( \frac{E_1 - E_2}{k} \) becomes:

\[
\frac{E_1 - E_2}{k} = -\frac{hc}{\lambda k} = -\frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.380649 \times 10^{-23}} \approx -9.94 \times 10^4 \, \text{K}.
\]

Next, compute the temperature difference term:

\[
\frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500} = 0.000166667 - 0.000181818 = -0.000015151.
\]

Substituting into the exponent:

\[
\frac{E_1 - E_2}{k} \left(\frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500}\right) = (-9.94 \times 10^4)(-0.000015151) \approx 1.506.
\]

Thus, the factor is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.506) \approx 4.5.
\]

This corresponds to option **C**.
