Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) for a specific nucleus moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, but I'm a bit rusty on the exact formulas. Let's think through this step by step.

The question says the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. I know that lithium typically has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6 because 3 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion, probably a charged particle like a singly charged ion, so Z=3, but I'm not sure if that matters for the energy calculation here.

The speed is 0.96c, which is pretty high, so relativistic effects are definitely important. I think I'll need to use the relativistic energy equations here instead of the classical ones.

The energy in relativity is given by the total energy, which is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, in particle accelerators, the kinetic energy is often a significant part of the total energy, especially at high speeds. But I'm not sure if the question is asking for the total energy or just the kinetic. Let me read the question again. It says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." Hmm, I think RHIC's energy refers to the kinetic energy provided to the ions. Wait, no, sometimes accelerators' energy specifications refer to the total energy, including rest mass. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think: for a particle of mass m, moving at speed v, the total energy is gamma * m c², and the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c². So if the question is about the energy imparted by the collider, I think it's the kinetic energy. But maybe in this case, since it's a heavy ion, the rest mass is significant, so the total energy (gamma m c²) is what they're referring to. Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the problem states that the speed is 0.96c, so I can calculate gamma. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Plugging in v=0.96c,
