Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using a series of reagents. Let me break down what I know.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize its structure. I think it's a cyclohexane ring where one of the carbons is attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. Additionally, there's a carbonyl group (aldehyde) attached somewhere.

Wait, actually, I might be getting that wrong. Let me draw it mentally. The formula is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde—so a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group (CHO) attached. Then, at position 1 (which I assume is adjacent to the aldehyde), there's a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, the substituent is CH(OH) attached to the cyclohexane. Wait, perhaps more accurately: the substituent is a methyl group (CH2-) attached to the cyclohexane ring, where one of the H's on that CH2 is replaced by a hydroxyl group, and the other is attached to another cyclohexane ring. So, it's like a bridge between two cyclohexane rings, with a hydroxyl group on the bridge.

Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a CH group (since it's (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl). So the substituent is CH(OH-cyclohexyl) attached to the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the structure would have the aldehyde on the cyclohexane, and a CH group that's connected to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. That makes sense.

Now, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. I know ethynyl is an alkyne group, so that's a cyclohexane ring with a triple bond (C≡C-) attached. So, the structure is cyclohexane-C≡CH.

The reagents listed in the options involve several steps. Let's think about what each reagent does.

The target molecule has an aldehyde group, a hydroxyl group, and a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2. Hmm. Let me think about possible reactions.

Ethynylcyclohexane can be functionalized in various ways. One common approach is to perform a hydroxylation. Wait, but perhaps it's better to consider the steps needed to get the substituents in place.

Wait, the target has a carbonyl (aldehyde) group. Aldehydes can be formed via oxidation of alcohols, but starting from an alkyne? Alternatively, maybe via a Grignard reaction or some kind of addition.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis involves adding a substituent to the alky
