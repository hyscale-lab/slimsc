Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and how their flux changes when a certain reaction stops. Hmm, let's try to break this down.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stops about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is roughly the time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth, right? So if the pp-III stops, the neutrinos we detect on Earth now would be from the reactions that still happen, but without the pp-III contribution for that time.

Wait, but neutrinos move at nearly the speed of light, so if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos from that process would have already reached us. So, if the process stops, would that affect the current flux? Wait, no. Because the neutrinos from the current moment (now) would take 8.5 minutes to reach us. So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos from that process would have arrived before and are no longer being produced. So the current neutrinos we detect are from the reactions that have been happening in the last 8.5 minutes.

So, the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain in the Sun's core, right? The pp reactions produce neutrinos. The main branches are I, II, and III. I think pp-III is the dominant one for producing high-energy neutrinos. Wait, no, actually, the main source of solar neutrinos is the pp-I branch, which produces lower-energy neutrinos, and
