Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about a star with some spots and how that affects the brightness variations observed, similar to an exoplanet. The goal is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spotted star.

Alright, let's start by reading the problem again. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots, a filling factor of 20%. The effective temperature of the star is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. So, when the star rotates, these spots come into view and cause brightness changes. But if the star didn't have spots, what size exoplanet would cause the same brightness variation?

Wait, right. So the amplitude of the brightness change depends on the area blocked and the temperature differences. When a planet transits a star, it blocks some light, and the change in brightness is related to the planet's area relative to the star's area. But in this case, the spots make the star's brightness vary as it rotates, so when the spots are facing us, the brightness goes down a bit.

So the problem is comparing the effect of the spots (which cause a dip in brightness) to the effect of a planet transiting (which also causes a dip in brightness). We need to find the planet's radius such that the brightness dip is the same as the dip caused by the spots.

Wait, but wait, the star's spots are cooler, so when they're on the visible side, the total emitted light is less than when they're not visible. So the observed brightness drops when the spots are facing us. But the planet blocks some of the star's light, causing a drop too. So we need to find the planet's size so that the dip in brightness is the same as the dip caused by the spots.

But how do we calculate each effect?

First, let's model the brightness variation from the spots. The star's normal brightness is when all its surface is at 6000K. When the spots are on the visible hemisphere, that hemisphere has spots which are cooler. So the total emitted flux is the sum of the unspotted area and the spotted area.

The filling factor is 20%, so 0.2 of the hemisphere is spots. Each spot is cooler, at 6000K - 1000K = 5000K. Wait, no, the problem says the spots have a temperature difference of 1000K. So if the star's Teff is 6000K, the spots are at 5000K.

The star emits as a blackbody, so the flux from each area is σT^4 per unit area. The total flux when the spots are visible will be the sum of the unspotted and spotted areas.

Let me think about the star's surface. The star is a sphere, and we're considering one hemisphere. So the surface area is 2πR², and each hemisphere is πR². When the spots cover 20% of this hemisphere, the area of the spots is 0.2 * πR².

So the total flux from the star without any spots (assuming no spots and same temperature everywhere) would be F_total = σT_eff^4 * 4πR² / (4π) )? Wait, no. Wait, the total luminosity of the star is L = 4π R² σ T_eff^4. Oh right, because L is the total power, which is σ T^4 multiplied by the surface area (4π R²), assuming it's a blackbody.

Now, when the spots are present, part of the surface is at a lower temperature. So the total emitted flux when the spots are on the hemisphere we see is:

F_spotted = (1 - filling factor) * σ T_eff^4 + filling factor * σ (T_eff - ΔT)^4

Wait, no, the filling factor is 20%, so the fraction of the visible hemisphere that is spots is 0.2. So the unspotted part is 0.8 (since 1 - 0.2 = 0.8?), but wait the star's entire surface isn't being considered. Because only one hemisphere is spotty, right? Wait, the problem says "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So, for the entire star, half of it (the hemisphere) is spotty, and the other half is normal.

Wait, no, the star has two hemispheres: the one being observed (as it rotates) and the one not. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots are on the surface we observe, and when it's not, the spots are on the far side.

Wait no, the star's entire surface isn't spotty. Only one hemisphere is covered. So, when the star is viewed face-on (the spotty side towards us), the spots are in our line of sight. When the star rotates 180 degrees, the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, so no spots are visible.

So, the maximum area of spots that can be seen at any time is up to the entire hemisphere, but in this case, the filling factor is 20% on the spotty hemisphere. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, 20% of the visible area is spots. Otherwise, no spots are visible.

Wait, but the problem says that "only one hemisphere is spotty." So, the other hemisphere is spot-free. So, when the star rotates so that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, we see some spots; when it's the other hemisphere, none.

Hmm. So the variation in flux is between the time when the spotty hemisphere is visible and when it
