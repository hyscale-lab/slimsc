Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Hmm, it's about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking what the energy should be so that a nucleus X moves at 0.96c. Oh wait, X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Let me think about this.

First, I should figure out what nucleus X is. Li usually has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, then it's Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So X is a Li-6 nucleus.

Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. Oh right, because when particles are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, their energy isn't just kinetic; it's the total energy, including rest mass energy. 

The formula I remember for total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor. And the total energy E is gamma * m0c². So I need to find gamma first.

Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Given v is 0.96c, so let me compute that.

Let me plug in v = 0.96c into gamma. So 1 - (0.96)^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714... Wait, no, wait. 0.28 is 28/100, which is 7/25. So 1/(7/25) is 25/7, which is about 3.5714. Yeah, that's right.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the next thing is to find the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is m0c². The mass of Li-6 is needed. I remember that the atomic mass unit (u) is about 931.5 MeV/c². So I need the mass of Li-6 in u.

Li-6 has a mass number A of 6. So its mass in u is approximately 6.013 u (I think the exact value might be a bit more because of binding energy, but for the sake of this problem, perhaps we just use the approximate value. Wait, wait. Wait, the atomic mass for Li-6 is about 6.013 atomic mass units. Let me verify that. Oh wait, actually, the exact value might be 6.013... but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe I should look it up, but since I can't, I'll proceed with 6.013 u.

So converting that to kg: 1 u is about 1.6605e-27 kg. So 6.013 u is 6.013 * 1.6605e-27 kg. But wait, maybe I can work in terms of MeV/c². Because 1 u is 931.5 MeV/c², so 6.013 u is 6.013 * 931.5 MeV/c².

Calculating that: 6 * 931.5 is 5589, and 0.013 * 931.5 is approximately 12.11. So total is around 5601.11 MeV, which is about 5.601 GeV. So the rest mass energy is 5.601 GeV.

Wait, wait. Wait, wait a second. Let me double-check that calculation. 6.013 * 931.5 = ?

Let me compute 6 * 931.5 is 5589. Then 0.013 *931.5= 12.1095. So total is 5589 +12.1095= 5601.1095 MeV. Yes, which is 5.6011095 GeV.

So m0c² is approximately 5.6011 GeV.

Now, the total energy E is gamma multiplied by m0c². So E = 3.5714 * 5.6011 GeV.

Let me calculate that. 3.5714 *5 = 17.857, 3.5714 * 0.6011 is approximately 2.148. So total is about 17.857 +2.148 = 19.999 GeV, roughly 20 GeV.

Wait, but let me do a more precise calculation.

3.5714 *5.6011:

Let me compute 3.5714 *5 = 17.857.

3.5714 *0.6 = 2.14284.

3.5714 * 0.0011 = 0.00392854.

Adding those together: 17.857 + 2.14284 = 20. (17.857 +2.14284= 20.00084) plus 0.00392854 gives about 20.004768 GeV.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should do a precise multiplication.

3.5714 *5.6011.

Let me do it step by step:

3.5714 *5 = 17.857.

3.5714 *0.6 = 2.14284.

3.5714 *0.0011= 0.00392854.

Adding 17.857 + 2.14284 = 20. (17.857 +2.14284=20.000, almost exactly. Because 17.857 +2.143 is 20.000 (since 2.143 is 2.14284 rounded up). So the total is 20.000 plus about 0.00393 GeV. So approximately 20.00393 GeV.

Wait another thought: Maybe I should calculate gamma more accurately. Let me re-calculate gamma.

v =0.96c, so v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784.

So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈3.57142857.

So gamma is exactly 25/7, since 0.28 is 7/25. Because 25/7 is about 3.5714.

So gamma is exactly 25/7.

So now, let's compute E = (25/7)*m0c².

m0c² is 5.6011 GeV.

So 25/7 is approximately 3.57142857.

Let me compute 5.6011 *25/7.

Wait, 25/7 is approximately 3.57142857.

So 5.6011 *25 = 140.0275. Divided by 7: 140.0275 /7 is approximately 20.00392857 GeV. So about 20.004 GeV.

Looking at the
