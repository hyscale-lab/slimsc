Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let me think. The question says to assume stars are uniformly distributed. So, I guess that means the number of stars doesn't change with distance; they're spread out evenly, or something like that. But wait, how does that relate to parallax?

Parallax is something I remember relates to distance. Oh right, parallax (p) is inversely proportional to distance (d). The formula is p = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is 1 parsec away, and if another has 0.5 parsec parallax, it's twice as far, so 2 parsecs.

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So like, if I look at a range of parallaxes from, say, plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are in that range?

Wait, stars are uniformly distributed. So the number density is the same at all distances. But number per unit volume? Or per unit something else.

Wait, parallax is 1/distance. So as distance increases, parallax decreases. So a small change in parallax corresponds to a larger change in distance when plx is small.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit plx range. So for a given range Δplx, how does the number of stars (N) depend on plx?

Because stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a shell between d and d + Δd is proportional to the volume. Oh right, the volume of a spherical shell is 4πd²Δd. So N ∝ d² Δd.

But wait, the question is about per unit plx. Parallax p = 1/d, so d = 1/p. Let me express d in terms of p.

So d = 1/p, and Δd is the change in distance corresponding to a change in parallax Δp. Let me see, the derivative of d with respect to p is dd/dp = -1/p². So Δd ≈ - (1/p²) Δp. But since Δp is a small positive change (we're considering a range from p to p+Δp), and d decreases as p increases, so maybe I should take the absolute value. So Δd ≈ (1/p²) Δp.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me think in terms of differentials. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness Δd is proportional to 4πd² Δd. Since the distribution is uniform, N = n * 4πd² Δd, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume).

But we're interested in Δp, the change in parallax. Since p = 1/d, then Δp = - (1/d²) Δd. Wait, because d = 1/p, so dd = - (1/p²) dp. So Δd = -(1/p²) Δp.

So substituting into the N expression: N = n * 4π d² * (Δd) = n *4π (1/p²) * ( -(1/p²) Δp ). Wait, but
