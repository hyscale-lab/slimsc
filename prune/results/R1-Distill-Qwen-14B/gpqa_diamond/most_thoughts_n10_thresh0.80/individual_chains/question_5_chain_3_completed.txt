Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's read through the question carefully.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue we're interested in is +ħ/2. We're given the components of the operator P in terms of 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and their eigenvectors represent the states with definite values. So, the eigenvector here will be a state with a definite spin in the direction of n.

Wait, the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n can be broken down into components. Since it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So n would be something like (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. But I'm not sure if I need to find θ or φ or something else here. Maybe that comes into play when considering the operator components.

The operator P has X, Y, and Z components. Each component is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So, for example, P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0, 1], [1, 0]], which is the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by -i, or wait, let me think. The Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so that's exactly what P_y is. So P_y is (ħ/2) times the Pauli Y matrix.

And P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]], which is the Pauli Z matrix multiplied by (ħ/2). So that's the standard spin-½ operator setup.

The overall operator P along direction n would be the sum of the components multiplied by the direction vector. Since n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), the operator P is P = (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z). But wait, n is in the x-z plane, so n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but wait a second. The direction vector n is a unit vector, so n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. So P would be (sinθ) P_x + (cosθ) P_z.

So putting it all together, P = (sinθ)(ħ/2) σ_x + (cosθ)(ħ/2) σ_z, where σ_x and σ_z are the Pauli matrices.

But I need to find the eigenvector of this operator corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So I'll have to set up the eigenvalue equation: P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, no. Wait, eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So the equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Hmm, let me write P more explicitly. So,

P = (sinθ)(ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + (cosθ)(ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So combining these terms, the matrix for P would be:

P = (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
             [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, let me check that. The diagonal terms from P_z are cosθ*(ħ/2) multiplied by [1, -1], so in the matrix, those are (1,0) and (0,-1) times (ħ/2 cosθ). The off-diagonal terms from P_x are (0,1) and (1,0) times (ħ/2 sinθ). So combining, the matrix becomes:

[ [ (ħ/2 cosθ), (ħ/2 sinθ) ],
  [ (ħ/2 sinθ), ( - ħ/2 cosθ ) ] ]

So that's the operator P.

We need to solve P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, so (P - (ħ/2) I ) |ψ> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

So the matrix P - (ħ/2) I is:

[ (ħ/2 cosθ - ħ/2 ), (ħ/2 sinθ) ],
[ (ħ/2 sinθ), (- ħ/2 cosθ - ħ/2) ]

Which can be written as (ħ/2) times:

[ (cosθ - 1), sinθ ],
[ sinθ, (-cosθ -1) ]

So the matrix becomes (ħ/2) times:

[ (cosθ - 1)   sinθ        ]
[ sinθ         (-cosθ -1) ]

We can factor out (ħ/2), but since we're looking for eigenvectors, the scaling doesn't affect the direction. So the equation is:

[ (cosθ - 1)   sinθ        ] [a]   = 0
[ sinθ         (-cosθ -1) ] [b]

So the two equations are:

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Hmm, perhaps I can write these as ratios. Let's take the first equation:

(cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b

So,

a / b = [ - sinθ ] / [ (cosθ -1) ]

Let me compute that. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a non-trivial solution.

But wait, let's compute the determinant of the matrix P - (ħ/2) I. The determinant should be zero for non-trivial solutions. So the determinant is:

( (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1 ) ) - (sinθ)(sinθ ) = 0 ?

Let me compute:

(cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = - (cosθ -1)(cosθ +1 ) = -(cos²θ -1) = - ( (- sin²θ) ) = sin²θ.

Then, subtract (sinθ)^2, because the determinant is [ (cosθ-1)(-cosθ -1) ] - [ sinθ * sinθ ].

So:

sin²θ - sin²θ = 0. So determinant is zero, which makes sense because we're looking for an eigenvector.

So back to the equations. Let's take the first equation:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0

We can express a in terms of b.

a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

Let me compute [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ].

Multiply numerator and denominator by (cosθ +1) to rationalize the denominator.

So:

[ - sinθ (cosθ +1) ] / [ (cosθ -1)(cosθ +1) ] = [ - sinθ (cosθ +1) ] / (cos²θ -1 )

But cos²θ -1 = - sin²θ, so denominator is - sin²θ.

So,

[ - sinθ (cosθ +1) ] / ( - sin²θ ) = [ sinθ (cosθ +1) ] / sin²θ = (cosθ +1)/ sinθ.

So a = [ (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ ] * b.

So the ratio a/b is (cosθ +1)/ sinθ.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to write this as (1 + cosθ)/sinθ. Alternatively, using trigonometric identities, this ratio is cot(θ/2).

Because 1 + cosθ = 2 cos²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So,

(1 + cosθ)/sinθ = [2 cos²(θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] ] = [ cos(θ/2) ] / [ sin(θ/2) ] = cot(θ/2 )

So, a = cot(θ/2 ) * b.

So, the eigenvector can be written as |ψ> = [ a; b ] = b [ cot(θ/2), 1 ].

But we can choose b to be a normalization factor. Let's let b=1 for simplicity, then a = cot(θ/2). So the vector is [ cot(θ/2), 1 ].

But wait, this is up to a scalar multiple. To make it a unit vector, we need to normalize it.

So the vector is proportional to [ cot(θ/2), 1 ].

Wait, but cot(θ/2) can be written as cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2).

So, the vector is [ cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2), 1 ]

Which can be written as [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ] multiplied by 1/sin(θ/2).

So the normalized vector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ] because when you normalize, you have to divide by the norm.

Wait, let me compute the norm of [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

The norm squared is cos²(θ/2) + sin²(θ/2) = 1. So yes, it's already normalized.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but what about the phase? Because in quantum mechanics, the eigenvector can have a global phase factor, which doesn't affect the physical state. So perhaps the second component could have a phase factor, but in this question, the options don't seem to include any phase factors except option B, which has e^{i phi}.

Wait, but the problem says the operator is along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. So the eigenvector should depend on θ, the angle from the z-axis. So the correct expression would involve θ/2.

Looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)), which matches what I have. But wait, let me check the options again.

Option C is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)), which is a normalized vector.

Looking at the other options:

Option B is (cosθ, e^{i phi} sinθ), which looks like spherical harmonics but probably for l=1, m= something. But not quite what I have here.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), but I don't see any sqrt terms in my result.

Option A has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by hbar, but hbar is a unit of action, not dimensionless, so perhaps that's not correct.

Wait a minute, wait. Oh, wait, the question is for the eigenvector, which is a state vector. So the elements should be dimensionless, but in the options, some have hbar. That can't be right. So perhaps options A and D are incorrect because they have hbar factors, which are not dimensionless. Unless hbar is being used in a different way. Hmm, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are dimensionless, so the presence of hbar in options A and D would be a problem. So perhaps only options B and C are possible.

But wait, the way the problem is phrased, the eigenvector is for the operator P, which is expressed in terms of ħ/2. So maybe the state vectors in the options also have factors of ħ, but that seems unlikely. Because the state vectors are usually dimensionless, so perhaps options A and D are incorrect because they have ħ.

So, back to my result: the eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Looking at the options, that's exactly option C.

But wait, let me think again. The direction n is in the x-z plane, which affects the angle theta. So the operator is along (sin theta, 0, cos theta) in 3D space. The eigenvector is in the 2D Hilbert space for spin-1/2 particles. So the state is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, let me re-examine the setup. Another approach is to realize that the eigenstates of the spin operator along a direction n are the spin-up and spin-down states along that direction. The spin-up state has eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So, the eigenstate |+> along n is given by:

|+> = e^{-i phi/2} [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, but in spherical coordinates, the angles are usually defined such that phi is the azimuthal angle. But in this problem, the direction n is in the x-z plane, which implies that phi is zero. Because in the x-z plane, the angle phi (around the z-axis) is zero. So the state would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] multiplied by e^{-i 0} = 1.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I didn't have any phase factor. So the state is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking at the options, that's option C. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but why did I get to this conclusion? Let me double-check.

Alternative approach: the operator P along n is (n·σ) * ħ/2, where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices. So, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, and the eigenstates are the spin-up and spin-down along n.

The spin-up state for a direction n=(sinθ, 0, cosθ) is given by:

|+n> = e^{-i phi/2} [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

But since phi is zero (because n is in the x-z plane, phi=0), the state becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So that's exactly what I found earlier.

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but option B is (cos theta, e^{i phi} sin theta), which seems to involve the full theta, not theta/2. So that's different.

So, the correct eigenvector is option C.


To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator **P** corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\). The operator **P** is defined as:

\[
P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z
\]

where \(n = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)\) is the unit vector along the arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, and \(P_x\), \(P_y\), and \(P_z\) are the spin components given in terms of Pauli matrices. Substituting the components:

\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Since \(n_y = 0\), the operator simplifies to:

\[
P = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \, \sigma_x + \cos\theta \, \sigma_z \right),
\]

where \(\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\) and \(\sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}\). Explicitly, this becomes:

\[
P = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\), we solve the eigenvalue equation:

\[
P | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle.
\]

Subtracting \((\hbar/2)I\) from \(P\), the matrix equation becomes:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = 0.
\]

From the first row of the matrix equation:

\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
a = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} b.
\]

Using trigonometric identities, \((1 - \cos\theta) = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)\) and \(\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)\), we find:

\[
a = \cot(\theta/2) b.
\]

Thus, the eigenvector can be written as:

\[
| \psi \rangle = b \begin{bmatrix} \cot(\theta/2) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, we compute the norm:

\[
\| | \psi \rangle \|^2 = |\cot(\theta/2)|^2 + 1 = \frac{\cos^2(\theta/2)}{\sin^2(\theta/2)} + 1 = \frac{1}{\sin^2(\theta/2)}.
\]

Dividing by the norm, the normalized eigenvector becomes:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches option **C**. The other options are incorrect because:

- **A** and **D** include \(\hbar\), which is not dimensionless for a state vector.
- **B** involves \(\theta\) instead of \(\theta/2\), which does not match the derived result.
- **C** is consistent with the derived normalized eigenvector.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
