Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds to metal ions like calcium. The problem gives me the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K, is 5x10^10. The question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions.

Wait, right, the formation constant K represents the equilibrium between the metal ions and the EDTA. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. So the K is given by the concentration of the complex divided by the product of the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

But EDTA is usually in a form that's deprotonated. Oh wait, the problem states that the pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about the different forms of EDTA. That simplifies things. So at ideal pH, EDTA is fully deprotonated and available as Y^4-.

So the formula would be K = [CaEDTA²-] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ). Since the complex is 0.02 M, that's [CaEDTA²-]. But wait, the problem doesn't give me the concentration of EDTA. Wait, no, the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the moles of CaEDTA²- is 0.02 M. But EDTA is in excess, I think. Or is the solution made by adding, say, Ca²+ and EDTA in stoichiometric amounts?

Wait the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution of Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, so maybe the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA are in stoichiometric amounts, meaning that each mole of Ca²+ is matched by a mole of EDTA.

But when they form the complex, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So I think the initial concentrations are such that all the Ca²+ is complexed with EDTA, but that can't be because the problem is asking about the free Ca²+ concentration. Oh, wait, no, because in reality, some of the Ca²+ would dissociate from the complex. So the complex is at 0.02 M, but the free Ca²+
