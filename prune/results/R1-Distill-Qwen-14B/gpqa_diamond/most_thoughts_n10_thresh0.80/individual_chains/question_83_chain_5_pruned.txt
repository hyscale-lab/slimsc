Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I think I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so the reaction should be straightforward. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). I need to find the concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution. 

Wait, concentration is moles divided by volume. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. When we dilute it to 0.04 L, the new concentration M = moles/volume. So 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, we're titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. I think the first part of the question asks for the pH at 25% titration. Oh wait, wait—25% of what? I think it's 25% of the equivalence point. So I need to find the volume of NaOH added when we've reached 25% of the equivalence point.

Wait, what's the equivalence point here? The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.001 moles. So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is also 0.001 moles. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume V is moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

So 25% of that is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added to 40 cm³ of diluted acetic acid. Let's compute the moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. 

But wait, I should think about the reaction. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacts with NaOH (a strong base) in a 1:1 mole ratio. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. So each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of acetic acid, forming the acetate ion.

At 25% titration, 0.00025 moles of NaOH have been added. So the moles of acetic acid remaining and the moles of acetate formed would each be:

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001
