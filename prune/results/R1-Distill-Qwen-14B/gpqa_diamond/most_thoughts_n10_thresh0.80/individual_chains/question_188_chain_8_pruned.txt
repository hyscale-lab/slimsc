Okay, so I have this question about crystallography. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Let me remember what I know about rhombohedral crystals.

Rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal, right? So the lattice is a cube but with all angles equal to each other. Wait, wait. No, wait. Oh, right, in a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, which means all edges are of equal length, but the angles between them are equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. In this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. So it's a rhombohedral lattice with a=10 Angstrom, and all angles 30 degrees. 

The question asks for the interplanar distance d_{111}. I remember that the formula for interplanar distance is given by the d-spacing formula, which involves the reciprocal of the plane indices and the lattice parameters. The general formula is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) * [ (sin² α + sin² β + sin² gamma ) / (1 + 2 cos α cos β cos gamma - cos² α - cos² beta - cos² gamma) ) ] 

Wait, no, I think I might be mixing that up. Oh wait, I think I should recall that for a rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar spacing can be calculated using a different approach because the lattice isn't cubic.

Alternatively, since all the angles are the same (30 degrees), maybe there's a simplified formula. I remember that for a rhombohedral lattice, the relationship between the interplanar distance and the lattice constant can be found using a specific formula. 

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) / (1 + 2 cos α (h² + k² + l²)/a² ) )

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The general formula for a cubic system is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but rhombohedral isn't cubic. So I need a more general formula.
