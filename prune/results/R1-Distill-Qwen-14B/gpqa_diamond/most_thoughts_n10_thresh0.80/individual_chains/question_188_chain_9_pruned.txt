Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral structures are a type of crystal system where all the edges are equal, and the angles between them are the same. But wait, in a rhombohedral structure, can the angles all be 30 degrees? I think so, right? So the given angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Oh, right, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. The formula for calculating that is the interatomic distance divided by the square root of (h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ), but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the formula is more about the reciprocal space. Oh yeah, the general formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) multiplied by some factor involving the angles. Wait, maybe I should recall the exact formula.

Right, the formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos θ }}

Wait, wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell is defined by a single lattice parameter 'a' and angles α, β, γ. For an interplanar distance, the formula depends on the Miller indices (hkl) and the metric tensor. Alternatively, I think the formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk \cos γ + hk \cos β + kl \cos α) }} } 

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure factor or the reciprocal lattice. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is derived from the volume of the unit cell and the area of the planes. Alternatively, maybe the formula is d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{(h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk \cos α + hk \cos β + kl \cos γ)} }.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The general formula for a cubic system
