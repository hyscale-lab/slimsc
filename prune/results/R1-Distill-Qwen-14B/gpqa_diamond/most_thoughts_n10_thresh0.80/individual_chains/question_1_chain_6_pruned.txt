Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me. Hmm, let me try to think through it. The question is about two quantum states with different energies, E1 and E2, and their lifetimes. The lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly resolved. The options are A to D, each with different values.

Wait, I remember that the lifetime of an energy level is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The uncertainty in energy multiplied by the uncertainty in time is on the order of ħ/2, maybe? So the formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

Here, Δt would be the lifetime of the state, because that's the time it exists before decaying or something. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy ΔE is about ħ divided by (2 times the lifetime). But wait, since we have two different lifetimes, maybe each state has its own uncertainty.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. Let me think. So the energy levels have their own lifetimes. The energy difference must be sufficiently large so that the lines don't overlap when measured. How does the uncertainty in energy affect the ability to resolve them?

Oh, I think the idea is that if the energy difference between the two states is much larger than the uncertainties in their energies, then we can distinguish them. Otherwise, if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might blend together and we can't tell them apart.

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE_i = ħ/(2 τ_i), where τ_i is the lifetime of state i.

So for state 1, τ1 is 1e-9 seconds. Let me calculate ΔE1. And for state 2, τ2 is 1e-8 seconds, so ΔE2.

But wait, the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 would be E2 - E1. To resolve them, we need ΔE >> ΔE1 and ΔE >> ΔE2. Because if ΔE is much bigger than the uncertainties, the peaks won't overlap.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal required ΔE is the sum of the uncertainties, or maybe the larger uncertainty. Hmm, not sure. Let me think.

Alternatively, I remember that the natural line width is given by ΔE ≈ ħ/(τ), because the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime.

Wait, but in the context of this question, each state has its own line width. So for state 1, the line width (full width at half maximum) is proportional to 1/τ1, and for state 2, it's 1/tau2. Therefore, the energy resolution would need to be better than the sum or some combination of these.

Wait, perhaps the way to think about it is: the energy difference between the two states must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Otherwise, their energy levels might overlap, making it hard to distinguish.

So if the energy difference is much larger than the larger of the two uncertainties, then it's easier to distinguish. Alternatively, perhaps we can take the larger uncertainty as the critical factor.

Let me calculate the uncertainty for each state. Let me compute ħ/(2 τ) for each.

The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So for state 1: τ1 = 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1) ≈ (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) = (1.0545718e-34) / 2e-9 = approximately 5.27e-26 J.

Hmm, but wait, the options are given in eV. Oh right, I need to convert that to eV.

1 eV is approximately 1.60218e-19 J. So to convert from J to eV, divide by 1.60218e-19.

So for ΔE1:

5.27e-26 J / 1.60218e-19 J/eV ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

Wait, that's 0.329 nano-eV.

Similarly for state 2: τ2 = 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = ħ/(2 τ2) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-8) = (1.0545718e-34) / 2e-8 = approx 5.27e-27 J.

Convert that to eV:

5.27e-27 J / 1.60218e-19 J/eV ≈ 3.29e-8 eV, which is 0.0329 nano-eV.

So the uncertainties are ΔE1 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV and ΔE2 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.
