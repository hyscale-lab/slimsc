Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my QFT, but let's think through this.

The question is: Which of the following physical theories never requires regularization at high energies?

The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what do I know about regularization? Regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—like infinite terms that pop up in calculations. You need to regularize these infinities to make the theory workable. Oh right, regularization is a way to assign a finite value to these divergent integrals so that you can subtract them or renormalize.

So the question is asking which theory doesn't need this regularization when energies are high. Let's go through each option.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, that's the non-quantum version. Classical theories don't involve the same divergences as quantum field theories because they don't have the same mathematical structure. Like, in Maxwell's equations, you don't get the same kinds of infinities from loop diagrams or anything. So maybe classical E-D doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory.

But wait, wait. High energies in classical theories—could that cause issues? I'm not sure. Maybe in classical, you just have different kinds of problems, like maybe singularities in point charges, but that's more about point particles than high-energy behavior.

Now, the other options are quantum theories.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). I remember that QED is a renormalizable theory, but it still requires regularization when you calculate loop diagrams. Because when you do those integrals, you get divergences that need to be handled. So you need to regularize—like using a cutoff, dimensional regularization, whatever—before you renormalize.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong force. It's also a quantum field theory, and as such, it has divergences. So you'd need to regularize it too. But wait, at high energies, QCD becomes asymptotically free, meaning the coupling constant decreases, leading to perturbative methods working better. But that doesn't mean you don't need regularization; it just means calculations are manageable. So you still need regularization in QCD.

Option A:
