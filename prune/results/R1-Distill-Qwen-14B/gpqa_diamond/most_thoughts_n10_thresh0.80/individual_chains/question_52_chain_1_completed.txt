Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that astronomers are studying a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Then, when they look at the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere, this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

The options are A to D, with numbers ranging from about 1.1 to 7.8. So I need to calculate this factor.

Wait, the transition between these levels is at approximately 1448 Å. Hmm, that's in the ultraviolet range, I think. But why does that matter?

The question mentions that the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), so I can probably use the Boltzmann equation for this. The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two energy levels to the temperature. The formula is:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Where n is the number of atoms in each level, g is the statistical weight (or degeneracy), E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

But wait, the problem is about the ratio when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. Also, the overall Teff is given for both cases.

When the star doesn't have spots, Teff is 6000 K. When it does, it's 5500 K. But wait, dark spots have lower temperatures than the surrounding photosphere. So when spots cover 40% of the surface, the overall Teff drops. However, in the photosphere, the regions without spots are still at 6000 K, I think.

Wait, no, the problem says the overall Teff decreases. But I'm not sure. Let me think. When a star has spots, the total luminosity changes. Luminosity is proportional to the surface area times the temperature to the fourth power (Stefan-Boltzmann law). The star's total luminosity L is the sum of the spotted and unspotted regions.

So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, let's denote:

L_total = L_spots + L_unspotted

Each part is (area fraction) * sigma * T^4.

Wait, the total luminosity is (A_spots * T_spot^4 + A_unspotted * T_unspotted^4) * sigma.

But the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the effective temperature is the one that gives the same luminosity as the sum of the two areas.

Wait, the effective temperature is the temperature a blackbody of the same surface area and total luminosity would have. So the sum of the luminosity from the spots and the un-spots equals the luminosity of a blackbody at Teff (5500 K) with the same total surface area.

So the equation would be:

L_spots + L_unspotted = L_total = 4πR^2 σ T_eff^4

But when there are no spots, the entire surface has Teff =6000 K.

But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, which presumably have a lower temperature. Let me denote the spot temperature as T_spot, and the unspotted temperature as T_unspot. 

The unspotted surface is 60% of the total area. So:

0.4*A*(T_spot)^4 + 0.6*A*(T_unspot)^4 = A * σ (5500)^4

Divide both sides by A σ:

0.4 (T_spot^4) + 0.6 (T_unspot^4) = (5500)^4

But wait, the unspotted regions—what's their temperature? They should be the same as the original Teff without spots, right? Because the spots are cooler, but the rest of the surface is at 6000 K. So T_unspot = 6000 K.

So substituting that in:

0.4 (T_spot^4) + 0.6*(6000^4) = (5500)^4

Let me compute each term.

First, let me compute 5500^4, 6000^4, etc.

But perhaps instead of exact values, I can express as ratios.

Let me compute 5500^4 in terms of 6000^4.

But wait, let's see. Let me compute 5500 = 6000 * (11/12). Because 5500 /6000 =11/12.

So, 5500^4 = (11/12)^4 * 6000^4.

Similarly, 0.6*(6000^4) = 0.6 * 6000^4.

So the equation becomes:

0.4 (T_spot^4) + 0.6*(6000^4) = (11/12)^4 * 6000^4.

Let me subtract 0.6*(6000^4) from both sides:

0.4 (T_spot^4) = [ (11/12)^4 - 0.6 ] * 6000^4.

Compute the right-hand side.

Calculate (11/12)^4: 11^4=14641, 12^4=20736. So (11/12)^4 = 14641/20736 ≈ 0.7069.

0.7069 - 0.6 = 0.1069.

So:

0.4 (T_spot^4) = 0.1069 * 6000^4.

Multiply both sides by 1/0.4:

T_spot^4 = (0.1069 / 0.4) * 6000^4.

0.1069 /0.4 ≈ 0.26725.

So T_spot^4 = 0.26725 * 6000^4.

Take the fourth root to find T_spot.

T_spot = (0.26725)^(1/4) * 6000.

Compute 0.26725^(1/4). Let's think about it.

The fourth root of 0.25 is 0.7071 (since 0.7071^2 ≈ 0.5, square again gives 0.25).

0.26725 is slightly larger than 0.25. Let's compute it.

Let me compute log(0.26725) ≈ -0.572.

Divide by 4: -0.143.

Exponentiate: 10^(-0.143) ≈ 0.718.

So T_spot ≈ 0.718 *6000 = approximately 4308 K.

So the spots are about 4308 K.

Wait, but do I really need to know the exact T_spot? Hmm, let me think about the next part.

The question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. The ratio n2/n1 is given by the Boltzmann equation.

But here, when the star has spots, some regions are cooler (spots) and others are at 6000 K (unspotted, but wait, no, when the star has spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K, but the unspotted regions are still at 6000 K. So the photosphere is a mix of hotter and cooler regions.

But wait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. But the neutral Ti atoms in the photosphere—does their excitation depend on the local temperature or the effective temperature?

Wait, the problem says to assume the photosphere is in LTE, so each region's temperature would determine the excitation of the atoms in that region.

But when the star has spots, the photosphere has both the hot (6000 K) and cool (4308 K) regions. So the observed ratio of Ti atoms in two levels would be an average over the entire surface.

But since the regions with different temperatures contribute differently to the observed spectrum, we might have to consider the contribution from each region.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying by considering that the effective temperature of 5500 K is the temperature governing the ionization/excitation, but that doesn't seem right because the presence of spots changes the overall luminosity, but the individual regions have their own temperatures.

Wait, the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The Boltzmann ratio depends on the local temperature. So when the star has spots, the ratio is a mix of regions at 6000 K and 4308 K.

Wait, but how do the photons from each region combine to give the observed ratio? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, but the question says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So is the photosphere at 5500 K? That can't be, because the spots are cooler, but the unspotted regions are still at 6000 K.

Wait, perhaps the effective temperature is a measure of the average, but the actual excitation of the atoms depends on the local temperature. So for each region (spot and non-spot), the ratio n2/n1 is calculated with their respective temperatures.

But then the overall observed ratio would be a flux-weighted average of the two regions. Because the spots emit less flux, their contribution to the observed line ratio would be less.

So to model this, let's think about the flux from each region.

The flux from a region is proportional to its area times the blackbody emission at the region's temperature. The line ratio (n2/n1) in each region depends on the local temperature.

But wait, the line ratio itself doesn't directly depend on the flux. Because the line ratio is about the number of atoms in each state, which is determined by the local temperature. So for each region, we have a ratio of n2/n1 based on their T. The observed equivalent width or strength of the lines would depend on both the number of atoms and the local continuum (flux), but the ratio of the number of atoms in each level is independent of the flux.

Wait, that might not be correct. Let's think again.

The ratio of the number of atoms in two levels (n2/n1) is given by the Boltzmann equation. When you look at the spectrum, the line from level 2 to level1 (or vice versa) will have a strength that depends on the number of atoms in each level and the excitation/emission rates.

But if the photosphere is in LTE, then the ratio is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

But when the star has spots, the photosphere is a mix of two temperatures. Each area contributes its own n2/n1 ratio. The observed line ratio would then be a flux-weighted average of the two ratios.

Wait, because the flux from each region is what we observe, and the line strength depends on the number of atoms in each level (which depends on the local T) and the area. So for each region, the number of atoms in each level is proportional to the area times the Boltzmann factor.

Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to model the overall ratio as a weighted average of the ratios in each region, weighted by the flux from each region.

Wait, but flux is the energy per unit area per unit time, so the flux from each region is proportional to its area times the blackbody emission at that region's temperature.

The blackbody emission at a given wavelength is given by Planck's law. But since the transition is at 1448 Å, which is in the UV, and given that blackbody radiation peaks at longer wavelengths for lower temperatures, the flux from the cooler spots at this UV wavelength would be much lower than the flux from the hotter regions.

So the flux from spots is lower, so when we average the ratios, the contribution from the cooler spots is weighted less.

But wait, the line ratio is a measure of the number of atoms in each level. Each region contributes to the total line strength, but the line strength is the number of atoms times the transition probability.

Alternatively, perhaps the line strength from each region is proportional to n_i (number of atoms in level i) multiplied by the transition probability and the area.

Wait, let's model this more precisely.

Let me denote:

- A = total surface area.
- A1 = 0.4 A (area of spots), T1 = 4308 K.
- A2 = 0.6 A (unspotted area), T2 = 6000 K.

In each area, the ratio n2/n1 is given by:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( - ΔE/(k T) )

But the problem says that the ratio when the star has spots is lower than when it doesn't. Wait, when the star doesn't have spots, all the photosphere is at 6000 K. So the ratio is based on 6000 K.

When the star has spots, the ratio is a combination of two regions: spots at 4308 K and unspotted at 6000 K.

But how does this combination affect the overall observed ratio?

Hmm, perhaps the observed ratio is the average of the ratios from each region, weighted by their contribution to the observed line.

Wait, no, because the line strength depends on the number of atoms. The number of atoms in each level is n_i = (g_i / (g1 + g2)) * N, where N is the total number of atoms.

Wait, but each region has a different n2/n1 ratio.

Suppose that in region 1 (spots, T1), the ratio is R1 = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

In region 2 (unspotted, T2=6000 K), the ratio is R2 = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

The total number of atoms in level 1 and 2 across the entire star would be the sum of the contributions from each region.

Wait, but because the star emits light from all regions, the equivalent width of the line (or the line ratio) would be a sum of the contributions from each region.

But considering that the line strength is proportional to the number of atoms in each level multiplied by the area and the transition probability.

Let me denote the transition probability as A_ij, which is the same for both regions since it's a property of the transition.

So the line strength S is proportional to the sum over each region of (n_i * A_ij * area).

But n_i is the number density in level i, and the area is the surface area.

But the number density is in units of per unit area. Wait, perhaps I should model this in terms of the total number of atoms in each level across the entire photosphere.

Alternatively, perhaps the observed ratio of the number of atoms in the two levels is a weighted average of the two regions, weighted by the number of atoms in each region.

Wait, no. Because line strength depends on the number of absorbers. So if region 1 has a lower temperature, its n2/n1 is lower. But the number of atoms in each region depends on the area and the number of atoms per unit area.

Wait, perhaps the number of atoms in each region is proportional to the area of that region multiplied by the number of atoms per unit area.

In region 1 (spots), the number of atoms per unit area is proportional to the density, but assuming LTE and same pressure, the number density might scale with temperature. Hmm, this could complicate things, but maybe for simplicity, we can assume that the number of atoms per unit area is the same across the photosphere. Or perhaps it's more straightforward to consider that each region contributes a certain number of atoms in each level, weighted by their area.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed by considering the average ratio as a flux-weighted average, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe I can model the total number of atoms in each level as the sum of the contributions from each region.

Let me try that. Let me denote:

n1_total = n1_1 * A1 + n1_2 * A2

n2_total = n2_1 * A1 + n2_2 * A2

The observed ratio (n2_total / n1_total) would be the sum of the contributions.

But n2_1/n1_1 = R1, n2_2/n1_2 = R2.

So n2_1 = R1 * n1_1, n2_2 = R2 * n1_2.

But what is n1_1 and n1_2? Assuming that the majority of Ti is neutral and in some state, perhaps we can model the total number of Ti atoms as N. So n1_1 + n2_1 = N1 (number per unit area in region 1), and similarly for n1_2 + n2_2 = N2 in region 2.

Wait, if the same element is present in both regions, maybe N1 and N2 are the same across regions? Or perhaps the number density is the same because the same pressure applies, so N1 = N2 = N.

Assuming that, then in each region, n1 = N/(1 + R), n2 = R*N/(1 + R), where R is the local ratio.

So for region 1:

n1_1 = N / (1 + R1)
n2_1 = R1 N / (1 + R1)

Similarly, region 2:

n1_2 = N / (1 + R2)
n2_2 = R2 N / (1 + R2)

But wait, is N the same in both regions? It depends on whether the number of atoms is uniform across the surface. Assuming that the photosphere has a uniform density of Ti atoms, yes, N would be the same in each region.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps N varies, but without more information, perhaps we can assume N is the same. Let's proceed with that.

So the total n1_total = A1 * n1_1 + A2 * n1_2
= A1 * [N/(1+R1)] + A2 * [N/(1 + R2)]

Similarly, n2_total = A1 * [R1 N/(1+R1)] + A2 * [R2 N/(1+R2)]

The ratio (n2_total)/(n1_total) would then be:

[ A1 R1/(1+R1) + A2 R2/(1+R2) ] / [ A1/(1+R1) + A2/(1+R2) ) ]

Hmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps we can factor N out and simplify.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the ratio when the star has spots is a weighted average between the two regions.

But maybe a simpler approach is to compute the ratio as the average of R1 and R2, weighted by their contribution to the total number of atoms.

Wait, the spots cover 40% of the surface, so their contribution to the total number of atoms would be 40% of the total. Similarly, the unspotted regions contribute 60%.

But wait, because the number of atoms in each region depends on the area and the local ratio.

Wait, another approach: the ratio when the star has spots is a weighted average of the two ratios (R1 and R2), weighted by the fraction of the surface emitting from each region. But considering that the line strength depends on the number of atoms, which is proportional to the area and the local ratio. Because the number of atoms in level 2 is proportional to the area times the ratio of the number of atoms in level 2 to level 1 in that region.

Wait, perhaps the observed ratio is the sum of (n2 in each region) divided by the sum of (n1 in each region).

So:

(n2_total)/(n1_total) = [ (A1 * n2_1) + (A2 * n2_2) ] / [ (A1 * n1_1) + (A2 * n1_2) ]

But n2_1 = R1 * n1_1, and n2_2 = R2 * n1_2.

So:

= [ A1 R1 n1_1 + A2 R2 n1_2 ] / [ A1 n1_1 + A2 n1_2 ]

Factor n1_1 and n1_2:

= [ R1 (A1 n1_1) + R2 (A2 n1_2 ) ] / [ A1 n1_1 + A2 n1_2 ]

Let me denote S = A1 n1_1 + A2 n1_2.

Then numerator is R1 (A1 n1_1) + R2 (A2 n1_2 )

Denominator is S.

So the ratio becomes [ R1 (A1 n1_1) + R2 (A2 n1_2) ] / S.

But what's n1_1 and n1_2?

In each region, n1 = (g1 / (g1 + g2)) N, where N is the total number of Ti atoms per unit area in that region. So if N is the same across regions, then n1_1 = (g1 / (g1+g2)) N, n1_2 = same.

Wait, but no, because the excitation depends on temperature, so the population in each level depends on R, the ratio of n2/n1. So the total number of Ti atoms per unit area is n1 + n2 = (n1) (1 + R) ) = (N) (1 + R).

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the total number of Ti atoms per unit area is the same in both regions (same surface density). So N = n1 + n2.

Then, n1 = N/(1 + R), n2 = R N/(1 + R).

So, substituting back:

n1_1 = N / (1 + R1)
n1_2 = N / (1 + R2)

So:

A1 n1_1 = A1 * N/(1+R1)
A2 n1_2 = A2 * N/(1+R2)

Similarly, A1 n1_1 and A2 n1_2 are the contributions to n1_total.

So plugging back into the ratio:

[ R1 (A1 n1_1) + R2 (A2 n1_2 ) ] / [ A1 n1_1 + A2 n1_2 ]

= [ R1 (A1 N/(1+R1)) + R2 (A2 N/(1+R2)) ] / [ A1 N/(1+R1) + A2 N/(1+R2) ]

Factor out N:

= [ R1 A1/(1+R1) + R2 A2/(1+R2) ) ] / [ A1/(1+R1) + A2/(1+R2) )

Let me denote A1 = 0.4, A2=0.6.

So:

= [ R1 *0.4/(1+R1) + R2 *0.6/(1+R2) ] / [ 0.4/(1+R1) + 0.6/(1+R2) ]

Hmm, that's a bit complicated, but let's compute R1 and R2.

R1 is the ratio (n2/n1) in the spots, which is at T1=4308 K.

R2 is the ratio in the unspotted regions, T2=6000 K.

The transition wavelength is 1448 Å, which corresponds to a certain energy difference. Let me find ΔE.

The energy difference ΔE can be found from the relation:

ΔE = h c / λ

Where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, λ is wavelength.

h = 6.626e-34 J s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8 ) / (1.448e-7 )

Calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m:

ΔE ≈ 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So ΔE ≈ 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.57 eV.

Wait, that seems high because most transitions in stars are in the range of a few eV. Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, 1.448e-7 meters is 1448 Angstroms, which is 1448/10 = 144.8 nm? Wait, no, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 1448 Angstroms is 144.8 nm. Wait, no: 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 1448 Angstroms = 144.8 nm.

Wait, 1448 A = 144.8 nm.

The energy is higher for shorter wavelengths. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, let's compute ΔE in eV.

ΔE (eV) = 12400 eV nm / wavelength (nm).

Because 12400 eV nm is the product hc in eV nm.

So wavelength is 144.8 nm.

So ΔE = 12400 / 144.8 ≈ 85.7 eV.

Wait, that's way too high. That can't be right because atomic transitions don't have such high energies. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Ah, wait, 1448 Angstroms is 144.8 nm, right? So 144.8 nm is 1448 A.

Wait, 1 nm = 10 Angstroms, so 1448 A is 144.8 nm.

Wait, so using the formula:

Energy in eV = 12400 (eV·nm) / wavelength (nm)

So 12400 / 144.8 ≈ 85.7 eV.

That's extremely high. That can't be correct because typical atomic transitions are a few eV. Did I get the wavelength wrong?

Wait, 1448 Angstroms is 1448 A = 144.8 nm? Wait, no, wait 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. So 1448 Angstroms = 144.8 nm. Oh wait, no, 1 A = 0.1 nm, so 1448 A = 144.8 nm? No, wait 10 A = 1 nm, so 1448 A = 144.8 nm? No, 1000 A is 100 nm, so 1448 A is approximately 144.8 nm.

But wait, visible light is about 400-700 nm. UV is shorter than that, so 144.8 nm is in the extreme UV range.

But in stars, such high energy transitions are possible, perhaps in certain ions. But I'm not sure; maybe the problem statement has a typo.

Wait, but the problem says that the transition corresponds to approximately 1448 Angstroms. So it's in the UV, which is plausible for Ti lines.

But the energy seems high, but let's proceed.

So ΔE ≈ 85.7 eV.

Wait, that's about 8.57×10^4 eV per photon. That's a lot. But perhaps it's correct.

Wait, let me double-check my calculation.

12400 eV·nm / 144.8 nm.

12400 /144.8 ≈ let's compute 144.8 × 85 = 12268, so 85 gives 12400-12268=132. So 85 + 132/144.8 ≈ 85.9 eV.

Yes, about 85.9 eV.

Hmm, but in LTE, such a high energy would require very high temperatures. Wait, but T_spot is 4308 K, which is about 0.4 eV (since kT ≈ 0.025 eV per 1000 K. So 4300 K is 0.043 eV, which is way smaller than ΔE of 85 eV. So the exponent in the Boltzmann equation would be negative and huge in magnitude, making the ratio R = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

But wait, if ΔE is 85 eV and T is about 6000 K, then kT is about 0.06 eV (since 6000 K is 6 eV per 1000 K? Wait, no. Wait, k = 8.617e-5 eV/K. So kT at 6000 K is 8.617e-5 * 6000 ≈ 0.517 eV.

So ΔE/(k T) is 85 / 0.517 ≈ 164.3.

So exp(-164.3) is a very small number, approximately zero. So R would be (g2/g1) multiplied by a very small number, making R close to zero. Similarly for the spot temperature.

But wait, the problem states that the ratio R (n2/n1) decreases when the spots are present. So when the star has spots, R is lower than when it doesn't.

Wait, but when the star doesn't have spots, R is R2 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)), where T2=6000 K.

ΔE/(k T2) = 85 eV / 0.517 eV ≈ 164.3.

So exp(-164.3) is effectively zero. So R2 is (g2/g1) * 0 ≈ 0.

Wait, but that can't be right because the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio R decreases. If R is already nearly zero when the star doesn't have spots, it can't decrease further.

This suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in calculating ΔE. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units. Let me compute ΔE correctly.

The formula is ΔE = hc / λ.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J s (exact value)
c = 299792458 m/s (exact)
λ = 1448 A = 1448e-10 m.

So hc = 6.626e-34 * 2.998e8 ≈ 1.986e-25 J m.

Divide by λ =1.448e-7 m:

ΔE = (1.986e-25 J m) / (1.448e-7 m) ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So ΔE ≈ 1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.56 eV.

Ah, I see, I had a miscalculation earlier. So ΔE is about 8.56 eV, not 85 eV. Phew, that makes more sense.

So now, let's recompute.

ΔE =8.56 eV.

For T_spot =4308 K, k T_spot = 8.617e-5 eV/K *4308 K ≈ 0.370 eV.

So ΔE/(k T_spot) =8.56 / 0.370 ≈23.14.

Similarly, for T_unspot=6000 K, k T=8.617e-5 *6000 ≈ 0.517 eV.

ΔE/(k T_unspot)=8.56/0.517≈16.55.

So now the exponents are manageable.

So R1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-23.14) ≈ (g2/g1) * 5.5e-11.

Wait, exp(-23.14) is e^-23.14 ≈ 5.5e-11.

Similarly, R2= (g2/g1) * exp(-16.55) ≈ (g2/g1) * 8.6e-8.

Wait, but both of these are very small numbers, but R1 is much smaller than R2.

Wait, but the problem says that when the spots are present, the ratio R decreases. So when the star has spots, R = [flux weighted (R1 and R2)] is lower than R2 (which is when the star doesn't have spots). But wait, when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is R2, which is about 8.6e-8 * (g2/g1), which is a very small ratio. When the star has spots, the ratio is a weighted average between R1 (5.5e-11) and R2 (8.6e-8), weighted by their area fractions.

But 40% of the surface is spots, which have R1, and 60% unspotted, R2.

So the observed ratio when spots are present would be:

R_obs = (0.4 * R1 + 0.6 * R2) / (0.4 + 0.6) ) = 0.4 R1 + 0.6 R2.

Wait, no, because the denominator is 1, so R_obs = 0.4 R1 + 0.6 R2.

Wait, but since R1 is much smaller than R2, R_obs would be approximately 0.6 R2.

But wait, when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is R2. When the star has spots, it's 0.4 R1 + 0.6 R2 ≈ 0.6 R2 (since R1 is negligible compared to R2). So the ratio when the star has spots is approximately R2 *0.6.

Wait, but when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is R2.

Wait, but that would imply that when the star has spots, the ratio is lower (since 0.6 R2 < R2). So the ratio when the star has spots is 0.6 R2, and when it doesn't, it's R2. So the factor by which R changes is R2/R_obs = R2/(0.6 R2) ) = 1/0.6 ≈ 1.666. So the factor is approximately 1.67.

But none of the options are near 1.67. The options are A) 1.1, B)7.8, C)4.5, D)2.9.

Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe the ratio isn't a simple average but is weighted by the number of atoms in each region. Let me think again.

Wait, when the star has spots, the entire photosphere isn't at the same temperature. So the observed ratio is a weighted average based on the number of atoms in each level across the entire surface.

But perhaps the line ratio is dominated by the hotter regions because the transition is more probable there.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is dominated by the flux contribution. Because the line strength depends on the number of atoms in each level and the continuum emission.

Wait, the line's equivalent width is proportional to the number of absorbers, which is n * area. But the continuum is the flux from the region, which is proportional to the area and the blackbody emission at that region's temperature at the line wavelength.

So the line strength from a region is S = n * A * (line source function), and the continuum is C = A * B_lambda(T) * (some factor).

But in LTE, the line source function is proportional to the population of the lower level (n1) multiplied by the transition probability, and the upper level (n2) is determined by the Boltzmann factor.

Wait, perhaps the line strength is proportional to n2 * A * (area) * (transition probability), and the continuum is proportional to B_lambda(T) * A.

So the line strength is (n2 A) * transition probability, and the continuum is B_lambda(T) * A.

But when combining the contributions from each region, the equivalent width is the sum of (n2 A) / (B_lambda(T)) ) across all regions.

Wait, perhaps the observed ratio (n2/n1) is actually a weighted average where the weights are the contributions to the line strength.

But perhaps a better approach is to model the line ratio as the product of the ratio in each region and their respective contributions to the line.

Alternatively, perhaps the line ratio is dominated by the hotter regions because the lower temperature regions contribute less due to the lower number of atoms in the excited state. But with the numbers I have, the ratio when the star has spots is dominated by the higher R2, but the spot regions contribute less because their R1 is much smaller.

Wait, let me compute R1 and R2 more accurately.

Compute R1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-8.56 / (k*T1)).

k*T1 (in eV) = 8.617e-5 eV/K *4308 K ≈ 0.370 eV.

ΔE/(k T1) = 8.56 / 0.370 ≈23.14.

exp(-23.14)= e^-23.14.

e^23 is about 1e10, so e^-23 is 1e-10. But 23.14 is more precise.

Using a calculator: ln(2)=0.693, so ln(2^34)=34*0.693≈23.562. So e^23.562=2^34≈1.7e10. So e^-23.562≈5.87e-11.

But 23.14 is a bit less than 23.562, so e^-23.14≈7e-11.

Similarly, for R2:

ΔE/(k T2) =8.56 / (8.617e-5 *6000) ≈ 8.56 /0.517≈16.55.

exp(-16.55)= e^-16.55.

e^16 is about 8.88e6, so e^-16≈1.125e-7.

e^16.55 = e^16 * e^0.55 ≈8.88e6 *1.733≈1.53e7. So e^-16.55≈6.52e-8.

So R1 = (g2/g1) * 7e-11.

R2= (g2/g1) *6.5e-8.

But without knowing g2/g1, we can't compute the exact values, but we can compute the ratio when the star has spots compared to when it doesn't.

Wait, the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is R2. When it has spots, the ratio is R_obs.

We need to find R_obs / R2 = ?

Wait, no, the question is the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So the factor is R2 / R_obs, because when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher.

So, what is R_obs?

R_obs is the average of R1 and R2, weighted by the contribution from each region to the line strength.

Wait, perhaps the line strength from each region is proportional to (n2 * A) because the number of absorbers is n2 * A.

But n2 = R * n1, and n1 + n2 = N (per unit area). So n1 = N/(1+R), n2= R N/(1+R).

So line strength from region 1: S1 = (R1 N/(1+R1)) * A1.

Similarly, S2 = (R2 N/(1+R2)) * A2.

The total line strength is S_total = S1 + S2.

The total number of atoms in level 1 is n1_total = (N/(1+R1)) * A1 + (N/(1+R2)) * A2.

The ratio R_obs = (S_total) / (n1_total) * (1 + R1)(1 + R2) ????

Wait, I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the observed ratio R_obs is given by the sum of (n2_i * A_i) divided by the sum of (n1_i * A_i), where i=1,2.

So:

R_obs = [ (n2_1 A1) + (n2_2 A2) ] / [ (n1_1 A1) + (n1_2 A2) ]

But n2_i = R_i * n1_i.

So:

R_obs = [ R1 n1_1 A1 + R2 n1_2 A2 ] / [ n1_1 A1 + n1_2 A2 ]

Let me plug in the numbers.

n1_1 = N/(1 + R1)
n1_2 = N/(1 + R2)

So:

R_obs = [ R1 (N/(1+R1)) A1 + R2 (N/(1+R2)) A2 ] / [ (N/(1+R1)) A1 + (N/(1+R2)) A2 ]

Factor out N:

R_obs = [ R1 A1/(1+R1) + R2 A2/(1+R2) ) ] / [ A1/(1+R1) + A2/(1+R2) )

Now, substituting the values:

A1 = 0.4, A2=0.6.

R1 = (g2/g1) * 7e-11.

R2 = (g2/g1) *6.5e-8.

Let me denote K = (g2/g1), so R1=K *7e-11, R2=K *6.5e-8.

So:

Numerator = (K *7e-11 * 0.4)/(1 + K*7e-11) + (K*6.5e-8 *0.6)/(1 + K*6.5e-8 )

Denominator = (0.4)/(1 + K*7e-11) + (0.6)/(1 + K*6.5e-8 )

But given that K*7e-11 is extremely small (K is g2/g1, which is typically an integer, like 1, 2, etc.), so K*7e-11 is ~7e-11, which is negligible compared to 1. Similarly, K*6.5e-8 is small, but perhaps not as negligible.

So we can approximate the denominator as:

Denominator ≈ 0.4 + 0.6 = 1.

Similarly, the numerator:

≈ (7e-11 *0.4) + (6.5e-8 *0.6) = 2.8e-11 + 3.9e-8 ≈3.9e-8.

So R_obs ≈3.9e-8.

But R2 is K *6.5e-8, which is 6.5e-8 * K.

Wait, but in the numerator, we have (K *6.5e-8 *0.6) which is 0.6 *6.5e-8 * K.

Wait, without knowing K, how can we proceed?

Alternatively, perhaps the K terms can be factored out.

Wait, let me factor K from numerator and denominator.

Numerator:

K [ (7e-11 *0.4)/(1 + K*7e-11) + (6.5e-8 *0.6)/(1 + K*6.5e-8) ]

Denominator:

[0.4/(1 + K*7e-11) + 0.6/(1 + K*6.5e-8) ]

So R_obs = [ K * (terms) ] / [ terms2 ]

But this approach doesn't help much.

Wait, perhaps given that K is a positive number, and the terms are very small, we can approximate the denominator as 1, as I did before.

So R_obs ≈ [ K * (0.4 *7e-11 + 0.6 *6.5e-8) ] / 1.

= K * (2.8e-11 + 3.9e-8 ) ≈ K *3.9028e-8.

But R2 = K *6.5e-8.

So R_obs ≈ (3.9028e-8 /6.5e-8) * R2 ≈ (0.6) R2.

Thus, R_obs ≈0.6 R2.

So the factor is R2 / R_obs = R2 / (0.6 R2 ) ) = 1/0.6 ≈1.666.

But none of the options are near 1.67. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the line ratio is dominated by the hotter regions because the number of atoms in the excited state is much higher there. But with the numbers I have, R2 is much larger than R1, so the contribution from the unspotted regions is larger.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio R_obs is dominated by the unspotted regions, but the contribution from the spots is negligible. So when the star has spots, R_obs ≈ R2 * (0.6), leading to a factor of R2/R_obs=1/0.6≈1.67.

But this doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Maybe the problem is simpler and doesn't involve mixing regions but instead considering the change in effective temperature and how that affects the ratio.

Wait, the problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. So perhaps the entire photosphere is considered to be at 5500 K when calculating the ratio.

But that can't be right because the spots are cooler and the unspotted regions are hotter. But perhaps the question is approximating by considering that the average temperature is 5500 K, so the ratio R is calculated using 5500 K.

Wait, but the problem says when the star's surface isn't covered by spots, its Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, Teff drops to 5500 K.

But for the ratio, perhaps the question is assuming that the entire star's photosphere is at the effective temperature when calculating the ratio. So when the star has spots, the ratio is computed using T=5500 K, and when it doesn't, T=6000 K.

In that case, the ratio R when no spots is:

R1 = (g2/g1) exp(-8.56/(k *6000)).

And R2 = (g2/g1) exp(-8.56/(k *5500)).

But the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which would imply that R2 < R1, but 5500 K is a lower temperature than 6000 K.

Wait, no: wait, as temperature decreases, the exponent becomes more positive (since ΔE is positive and kT is smaller), so exp(-ΔE/(k T)) increases because the denominator is smaller.

Wait, wait: if T decreases, ΔE/(k T) increases, making exp(-ΔE/(k T)) smaller.

Wait, no: ΔE is 8.56 eV.

At T=6000 K, kT=0.517 eV.

So ΔE/(kT) =8.56/0.517≈16.55.

At T=5500 K, kT=5500 *8.617e-5 eV/K =0.470 eV.

ΔE/(kT)=8.56/0.470≈18.21.

So, as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, making R smaller.

So when the star has spots (Teff=5500 K), the ratio R is smaller than when it doesn't (Teff=6000 K).

So the factor by which the ratio changes is R_6000 / R_5500.

Compute this:

R_6000 = (g2/g1) exp(-16.55)

R_5500 = (g2/g1) exp(-18.21)

So R_6000 / R_5500 = exp( (18.21 -16.55) ) = exp(1.66) ≈5.28.

So the factor is approximately 5.28.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me compute exp(1.66).

e^1.6 is about 4.953. e^1.66 ≈ 5.28.

Hmm, but none of the options is close to 5.28. Option C is 4.5, which is close but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact values.

Wait, let me compute the exponent difference.

ΔE/(k T) for T=6000 K is 8.56 / (8.617e-5 *6000) =8.56 /0.51702 ≈16.55.

For T=5500 K: 8.56/(8.617e-5 *5500) =8.56/(0.473935)≈18.07.

So the exponent difference is 18.07 -16.55=1.52.

So the ratio R_6000/R_5500 = exp(1.52) ≈4.57.

Ah, that's approximately 4.57, which is close to option C (4.5).

So the factor is approximately 4.5.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does, we analyze the problem using the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(n_2/n_1\) is the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels, \(g_2/g_1\) is the statistical weight ratio, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Information:
1. **Transition Wavelength**: The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \(1448 \, \text{Å}\), which translates to an energy difference \(\Delta E = 8.56 \, \text{eV}\) using the relation \(\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\).
2. **Temperatures**:
   - When the star does not have spots, \(T = 6000 \, \text{K}\).
   - When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the effective temperature decreases to \(T = 5500 \, \text{K}\).
3. **Boltzmann Factor**:
   - For \(T = 6000 \, \text{K}\):  
     \[
     \frac{\Delta E}{kT} = \frac{8.56}{0.517} \approx 16.55, \quad \exp(-16.55) \approx 8.6 \times 10^{-8}.
     \]
   - For \(T = 5500 \, \text{K}\):  
     \[
     \frac{\Delta E}{kT} = \frac{8.56}{0.470} \approx 18.21, \quad \exp(-18.21) \approx 1.5 \times 10^{-8}.
     \]

### Ratio of Ratios:
The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{R_{6000}}{R_{5500}} = \frac{\exp(-16.55)}{\exp(-18.21)} = \exp(18.21 - 16.55) = \exp(1.66).
\]

Using \(\exp(1.66) \approx 5.28\), the factor is approximately \(5.28\). However, the problem's options suggest rounding to the nearest value, which is **4.5**.

### Conclusion:
The factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does is approximately **4.5**.
