Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, I need to figure out the ratio of flux between two energy bands after the pp-III branch stops. Let's think step by step.

First, what's the pp-III branch? I remember that the proton-proton chain is the main way the Sun fuses hydrogen into helium. There are different branches, like pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. I think pp-III involves reactions that produce higher energy neutrinos, maybe?

Oh wait, the pp-III branch produces neutrinos with higher energies compared to the other branches. Because the other branches, like pp-I and pp-II, might produce lower-energy neutrinos. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around? No, I'm pretty sure the pp-III branch is a side reaction that produces more high-energy neutrinos.

So if the pp-III suddenly stops, the flux of neutrinos from that branch would drop. But what about the other reactions? The question says all other reactions remain as they were, so the pp-I and pp-II are still happening normally.

Neutrinos are produced in different energy ranges based on the reactions. I think that the pp-III neutrinos are in a specific energy band. Like, maybe around 1-10 MeV? Or perhaps the specific bands mentioned are about 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. So we're looking at the lower end of the MeV range, since 1 MeV is 1000 keV.

Wait, if the pp-III branch is stopped, that would mean the high-energy neutrinos (from pp-III) are no longer being emitted. So band 1 and band 2: which one is affected?

Wait, the question is about the flux ratio between two bands. Band1 is 700-800 keV, Band2 is 800-900 keV. So both are in the lower MeV range, but band2 is a little higher.

But if the pp-III branch produces high-energy neutrinos, stopping it would reduce the number of high-energy neutrinos. So, neutrinos in higher energy bands would be less. But wait, which of these bands (700-800 or 800-900) are affected?

Wait, the pp-III branch emits neutrinos in higher energies than the main pp-I and pp-II. So if pp-III stops, the flux in higher energy bands (like 800-900 keV) would decrease more than the lower ones (700-800 keV). So the ratio (flux1/flux2) would be higher than before.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the main sources of neutrinos. The primary source is the pp chain, right? The main pp-I branch produces lower-energy neutrinos, and pp-III produces higher-energy ones. So when pp-III is stopped, the high-energy neutrinos from that branch are no longer present.

So in the bands, the higher energy band (800-900) would normally have a significant contribution from pp-III, but now without it, the flux in that band would drop.

But what about the 700-800 band? Are those primarily from pp-III or from other branches? Maybe the lower band is mostly from pp-I and pp-II, so their flux doesn't change. So, the flux in band1 (700-800) remains roughly the same, while the flux in band2 (800-900) drops because pp-III stops.

So the ratio flux1/flux2 would increase. Because flux2 was higher before, but now it's lower. So flux1 is same, flux2 is lower, so their ratio is higher.

But what was the original ratio? Before stopping, the flux in band2 is higher than band1 because pp-III contributes more to higher energies. So the original ratio (flux1/flux2) is less than one. After stopping pp-III, flux2 drops, so ratio goes up.

Wait, but how much does it decrease? Let's think about the neutrino energy spectra.

Wait, the main pp-I and pp-II produce lower-energy neutrinos, maybe up to like 200 keV or so. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the neutrinos from the main pp-I and pp-II are at lower energies, while the pp-III produces higher energies, perhaps in the MeV range.

But the bands given are 700-800 and 800-900 keV, which are in the MeV range. So if the pp-III branch is responsible for neutrinos in the higher end, then without pp-III, the higher energy bands would be dominated by other sources or would drop a lot.

Wait, no. Wait, the main pp-I and pp-II produce neutrinos with energies up to about 400 keV or so. I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch produces a specific kind of neutrino, like the 774 keV neutrinos. Oh, wait! I remember that the 774 keV line is a prominent feature in solar neutrino spectra. That comes from the pp-III branch. So the 774 keV is a line emission.

If the pp-III stops, that 774 keV line would stop. So the 700-800 keV band includes this line. So, in that case, the flux in band1 (700-800) would drop, because the line contributes a significant amount.

Wait, but the question says that the pp-III branch stops. So, let me see. The pp-III branch is responsible for producing neutrinos at 774 keV, which is in the 7
