Okay, so I've got this problem about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is a surface in geometry, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like a two-dimensional metric because it's in terms of dx and dy. But I'm supposed to find the area of a pseudosphere. Oh, wait, perhaps the metric is describing a pseudosphere? Or maybe it's part of a higher-dimensional space.

Wait, pseudospheres are usually considered in the context of hyperbolic geometry, right? And they have constant negative curvature. The metric for a pseudosphere, I think, is similar to the metric of hyperbolic space but expressed in terms of Poincaré coordinates or something like that.

Wait, the given metric is in two dimensions. Because it's only involving x and y. So perhaps this is a 2-dimensional surface with a certain curvature. Oh, but the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. So maybe the metric corresponds to a pseudosphere with radius 2.

I remember that the area of a pseudosphere can be calculated, but I'm a bit unsure about the formula. Let me think. In hyperbolic geometry, the area of a circle (which would be analogous to a sphere) is π r² (sinh(r) / r - 1), but wait, that's for a disk in hyperbolic space. Alternatively, maybe I'm
