Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see. The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The problem also gives me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. And the pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about that affecting the dissociation or anything. The temperature is 25°C, but I don't think that affects the calculation directly unless it's about the K value, which is already given.

Wait, what's the setup here? So, the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. EDTA usually has four carboxy groups, which are deprotonated. The formation constant K is very large, which means the complex is very stable. So, the complex doesn't dissociate much, meaning the concentration of free Ca²+ ions should be very low.

The formula for the formation constant, K, is [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, in a stoichiometric solution, the concentration of the complex is equal to the concentration of the metal and ligand when they first react. So, initially, if I have 0.02 M of Ca-EDTA, that's the concentration after the reaction. But since K is so large, the dissociation is minimal.

So, assuming that the dissociation is negligible, the concentration of Ca²+ would be approximately K times the concentration of the complex, but wait. No, let me think again. The K expression is [complex]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). But in this case, the solution is just the complex, so what about the EDTA concentration?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. In a solution where the only source of EDTA is the complex, then the concentration of free EDTA (EDTA^4-) would be equal to the concentration of free Ca²+ because each complex dissociates into one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

So, if the complex concentration is 0.02 M, and the dissociation is x, then:

[Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x. But since K is so large (5e10), x must be very small compared to 0.02, so we can approximate [Ca-EDTA] ≈ 0.02. Therefore, K ≈ 0.02 / (x^2) = 5e10.

So solving for x: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 2e-12 → x = sqrt(2e-12). Let me calculate that. Sqrt(2) is about 1.414, and sqrt(1e-12) is 1e-6. So 1.414e-6 M. Wait, but that's 1.414e-6, but looking at the options, option C is 6.3
