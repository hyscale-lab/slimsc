Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. Oh right, nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Lithium normally has 3 protons and 4 neutrons? Or is it 3 neutrons? I'm a bit confused, but maybe it doesn't matter for calculating the energy. Let me think.

Wait, the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. So, the atomic number is 3 for Lithium. The number of neutrons is 3, so the mass number A is 3 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 6. So it's Lithium-6. Got it.

So the first thing I need to do is find the rest mass of the Lithium nucleus. Or maybe I should think about the mass of the entire nucleus, including all protons and neutrons. Because the rest mass energy would be important for relativistic calculations.

I remember that the rest mass energy of a particle is given by E = mc². But when dealing with relativistic speeds, I need to consider the gamma factor, right? Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Since the speed v is 0.96c, I can calculate gamma first.

Let me write down the variables:

v = 0.96c
gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 )

Calculating (0.96)^2: 0.96 * 0.96 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Then sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, but let me be precise. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) exactly. Hmm, 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So yes, sqrt is 0.28. So gamma is approximately 3.57142857...

Wait, 1/0.28 is 3.57142857... which is 25/7. Let me confirm: 25 divided by 7 is approximately 3.5714, yes.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Next, the energy of the nucleus when moving at speed v is gamma times the rest mass energy. So E = gamma * m * c².

I need to find the rest mass of the Lithium-6 nucleus. So what's the mass of a Lithium-6 nucleus?

Hmm, I'm not exactly sure, but I remember that the mass of a nucleus can be found using the atomic mass. The molar mass of Li-6 is about 6 grams per mole. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look up the approximate mass of a Li nucleus.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of the atomic mass unit (u). One u is approximately 1.660539 × 10^-27 kg. The mass of a Li-6 nucleus would be approximately 6 * u. But wait, wait a minute: Lithium has an atomic number of 3, so each nucleus has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass of each proton is about 1.67262 × 10^-27 kg, and neutron is about 1.67492 × 10^-27 kg. So each nucleus would have 3*(1.67262 + 1.67492) × 10^-27 kg.

Wait, let me calculate that. 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So 3*(1.67262 + 1.67492) =
