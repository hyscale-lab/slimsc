Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem is asking for the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. They give me the components of the operator P in terms of matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So, I need to find the normalized eigenvector for this operator.

Wait, no. Wait, the operator is P, and it's along an arbitrary direction n. Hmm, but the operator P is given in terms of its X, Y, and Z components, each as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So, I think I need to construct the operator P along the direction n, which is in the x-z plane. That means the direction can be described using polar coordinates, say, with some angle θ from the z-axis and φ in the x-z plane, so φ=0 maybe? Or wait, no, if the direction is in the x-z plane, then the angle φ around the y-axis would be 0 or π, I suppose. But maybe it's easier to think in terms of a general direction without worrying about φ because in the x-z plane, φ is either 0 or π, but perhaps the eigenvector doesn't depend on the direction specifics. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe the operator in the arbitrary direction n is given by P · n. Since n is in the x-z plane, it can be represented as a unit vector (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but wait, no, in the x-z plane, φ is 0, so n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because in spherical coordinates, φ is the angle around the z-axis, so if it's in the x-z plane, φ is 0. So, n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) where θ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

Wait, but the direction is arbitrary, so maybe I can think of the operator along n as the dot product of the vector P and the direction vector n. So, the operator P_n would be P_x * n_x +
