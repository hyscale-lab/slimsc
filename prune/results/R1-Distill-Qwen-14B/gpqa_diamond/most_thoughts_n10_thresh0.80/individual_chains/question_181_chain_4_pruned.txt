Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun and their flux ratios. Hmm, let's try to think through this.

So, the question says that the pp-III branch stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So, if the pp-III reactions stopped, that means the neutrinos from that process wouldn't reach us yet. Because neutrinos usually move close to the speed of light, but maybe not exactly. So, if the process stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the Earth would just now be detecting the change in neutrino flux because the neutrinos take that long to reach us.

Wait, no, actually, the problem says that the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago. So, for that time, the Sun has been emitting neutrinos from other reactions. But the pp-III is a part of the proton-proton chain, right? So the pp reactions are the main source of solar energy, and the pp-III branch is one of the steps.

Neutrinos are produced in the Sun primarily through the proton-proton (pp) chain. I remember that the pp chain has a few branches, but the main one is the pp-I branch, and then there's pp-II and pp-III. The pp-III branch is when two protons fuse into a diproton, which then emits a positron and two neutrinos, right? Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Alternatively, the pp-
