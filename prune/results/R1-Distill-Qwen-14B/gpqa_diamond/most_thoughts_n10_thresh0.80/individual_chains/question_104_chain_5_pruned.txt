Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the Radial Velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let me think about what I remember. The RV method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's velocity towards or away from us.

The problem says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with Neptune-like mass. Both have circular orbits, so no eccentricity complications. 

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, but how does this shift relate to the orbital period of the planet? I think the shift amplitude depends on the mass of the planet and the star's velocity, which in turn depends on the planet's orbit.

The formula I remember for the RV semi-amplitude K is something like K = (V) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )) * ( (sin i) / ( (1 day)^(-1) ) ) * ( (P) )^( -1/3 ) )

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the relationship between the RV semi-amplitude (K) and the orbital period (P). Since both stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses, the key factors here would be the semi-amplitude and the period.

Wait, but the shift in wavelength (the Doppler shift) is directly related to the velocity of the star, right? So the semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity of the star due to the planet. Therefore, K is proportional to the Doppler shift observed.

So, K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( ( (M_star + M_p) )^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star ) )^(1/3) ) * (P)^( -1/3 )

Wait, maybe a better approach is to look at the formula for the RV semi-amplitude. The formula is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) * (1 / (c * P) )^(1/3 )

But since e is zero (circular orbit), and M_p is much smaller than M_star (since M_p is Neptune-like, much less than the Sun's mass), I can simplify this.

So, K ≈ ( (G * M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * ( P )^(1/3) ) ) * ( 2 pi / c )^(1/3 )

Wait, that's getting a bit messy. Maybe I can find a proportionality.

Since both stars have the same mass (M) and the planets have similar masses (m), let's assume m1 = m2 for simplicity. So the mass terms would be the same for both.

So, K1 is proportional to (
