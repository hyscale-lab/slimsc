Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. Hmm, the question is about stars and their effective temperature affecting the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Oh right, LTE means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, so we can use the Boltzmann equation for this.

Alright, let me read the problem again. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its Teff is 6000 K, but when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. They observed that the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels (level 1 and 2) decreases when the star has spots. The transition wavelength is about 1448 Ã…, which probably isn't directly needed here since we're dealing with the ratio of populations in energy levels.

The question is about the factor by which this ratio changes. When the star isn't spotted, the ratio is higher, and when it's spotted, it's lower. So we need to find the ratio of (n1/n2) when there are no spots compared to when there are spots.

Wait, no, the way the question is phrased: when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when comparing no spots to spots, the ratio is higher. So we need to find (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

But wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So (n1/n2)_with_spots < (n1/n2)_no_spots. So the factor is (no spots ratio) divided by (with spots ratio), which would be greater than 1. So the factor is how many times bigger the no spot ratio is compared to the spotted one.

So the main point is to calculate the ratio of the ratios.

The Boltzmann equation says that n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

In this case, when the temperature changes, the ratio of populations changes. Let's denote the energy levels as level 1 and level 2. Let's assume level 1 is higher than level 2 because the ratio decreases when temperature decreases. Or wait, maybe level 2 is lower than level 1. Wait, the higher energy level has higher E. So if a star is hotter, the population in higher energy levels increases.

Wait, when the star has spots, the effective temperature decreases. So in the photosphere when it's cooler, the lower energy level (level 2) would have a higher population compared to level 1, right? Because the thermal energy is lower, so lower energy states are more populated.

Wait, but the question says that the ratio n1/n2 decreases when the star has spots. So when T is lower, n1/n2 is lower. Let me think. Let's say level 1 is higher energy than level 2. So in a hotter star, more atoms are in higher energy levels. So n1/n2 would be higher when T is higher.

So when T decreases (with spots), n1/n2 decreases. Which matches the given observation. So the ratio n1/n2 depends on T as exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ). So when T is lower, the exponential term is larger (since denominator is smaller, so the exponent is more negative, making the exponential smaller).

Wait, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ) / [exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T_spot) ) ]

Wait no, wait. Let me think. When the star is hotter (no spots, T=6000 K), and cooler (spots, T=5500 K), so without spots, T is higher. So for each, we calculate n1/n2 at their respective temperatures.

Wait, but the star's overall Teff is 5500 K when spotted, but the star's surface
