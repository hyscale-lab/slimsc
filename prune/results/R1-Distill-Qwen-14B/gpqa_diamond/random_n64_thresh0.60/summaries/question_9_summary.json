Let us evaluate each option:\n\n### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone\nThis molecule consists of a triphenylene core fused to a trifuran system. The triphenylene part has a three-fold rotational axis due to its symmetric arrangement of three benzene rings. However, the trifuran system introduces asymmetry, and there is no clear horizontal mirror plane across the entire molecule. Thus, this molecule does not exhibit C\u2083h symmetry.\n\n### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone\nThis molecule features a benzene ring fused to a trifuran system. The benzo part introduces asymmetry, and the overall structure does not have a three-fold rotational axis or a horizontal mirror plane. Therefore, this molecule does not exhibit C\u2083h symmetry.\n\n### Option C: Triisopropyl borate\nTriisopropyl borate has a central boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups. The molecule is trigonal planar, with a three-fold rotational axis (C\u2083) perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. Additionally, there is a horizontal mirror plane (\u03c3h) that bisects the molecule. This combination of symmetry elements satisfies the criteria for **C\u2083h symmetry**.\n\n### Option D: Quinuclidine\nQuinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane structure with three equivalent bridges. It has a three-fold rotational axis (C\u2083) and multiple vertical mirror planes (\u03c3v). However, it does not have a horizontal mirror plane (\u03c3h). Therefore, it does not exhibit C\u2083h symmetry.\n\n### Conclusion\nAmong the given options, **triisopropyl borate (Option C)** is the only molecule that possesses both a three-fold rotational axis (C\u2083) and a horizontal mirror plane (\u03c3h), making it the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: C"
