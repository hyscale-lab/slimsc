Additionally, X reacts with a keto acid to form a product containing 2 oxygen atoms, and X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\n\n1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. CO\u2082 fits this description, as it has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. This suggests that the reaction between X and Y produces CO\u2082 gas.\n\n2. **Precipitate G**: When X reacts with liquid Y, a precipitate G forms. Upon heating, G releases B, a substance with a melting point close to 277 K (4\u00b0C). This melting point is consistent with water (H\u2082O), but further clarification is needed.\n\n3. **Reaction with a Keto Acid**: The product of the reaction between a keto acid and X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. This implies that the reaction likely involves a substitution or reduction process, where the oxygen count in the product is reduced to 2.\n\n4. **Substance X**: X is a reagent in organic chemistry and incorporates a heavier isotope. A plausible candidate is NaOD (sodium deuteride), where deuterium (D) is a heavier isotope of hydrogen. Sodium deuteride is used in organic chemistry as a reducing agent.\n\n5. **Atomic Masses**: The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X are calculated. For NaOD, the lightest element is deuterium (D, atomic mass ~2), and the heaviest is sodium (Na, atomic mass ~23). The sum of these atomic masses is approximately 25.\n\n6. **Verification of Options**: The options provided are 35, 25, 31, and 29. Based on the analysis, the sum of the atomic masses for NaOD aligns with option B (25).\n\nThus, the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X are best represented by option B.\n\nAnswer: B"
