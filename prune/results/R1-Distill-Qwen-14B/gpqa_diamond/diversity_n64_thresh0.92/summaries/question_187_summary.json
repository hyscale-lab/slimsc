The detectability depends on the apparent magnitude \\( m \\) of the star, which determines its brightness. The relationship between apparent magnitude and S/N is approximately given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{S/N} \\propto 10^{-0.4m} \\cdot \\sqrt{t},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( t \\) is the exposure time. For a 1-hour exposure (\\( t = 1 \\)), the S/N is proportional to \\( 10^{-0.4m} \\). A star is detectable if its S/N is at least 10. Based on the performance of ESPRESSO, it is reasonable to assume that stars with \\( m \\leq 12.9 \\) are detectable, as this corresponds to an S/N of approximately 10.\n\n### Analysis of Each Star:\n1. **Canopus (a)**: Canopus is a very bright star with an apparent magnitude \\( m \\approx -0.7 \\). Since \\( m \\ll 12.9 \\), it is detectable.\n2. **Polaris (b)**: Polaris has an apparent magnitude \\( m \\approx 2.0 \\). Since \\( m \\ll 12.9 \\), it is detectable.\n3. **Star c**: This star has an absolute magnitude \\( M = 15 \\) and is located at \\( d = 10 \\, \\text{pc} \\). Its apparent magnitude is:\n   \\[\n   m = 15 + 5 \\log_{10}(10/10) = 15.\n   \\]\n   Since \\( m = 15 > 12.9 \\), it is not detectable.\n4. **Star d**: This star has \\( M = 15 \\) and \\( d = 200 \\, \\text{pc} \\). Its apparent magnitude is:\n   \\[\n   m = 15 + 5 \\log_{10}(200/10) = 15 + 5 \\cdot 2.301 = 21.505.\n   \\]\n   Since \\( m = 21.5 > 12.9 \\), it is not detectable.\n5. **Star e**: This star has \\( M = 15 \\) and \\( d = 5 \\, \\text{pc} \\). Its apparent magnitude is:\n   \\[\n   m = 15 + 5 \\log_{10}(5/10) = 15 - 1.505 = 13.495.\n   \\]\n   Since \\( m = 13.5 > 12.9 \\), it is not detectable.\n6. **Star f**: This star has \\( M = 15 \\) and \\( d = 50 \\, \\text{pc} \\). Its apparent magnitude is:\n   \\[\n   m = 15 + 5 \\log_{10}(50/10) = 15 + 8.495 = 18.495.\n   \\]\n   Since \\( m = 18.5 > 12.9 \\), it is not detectable.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOnly Canopus (a) and Polaris (b) have apparent magnitudes \\( m \\leq 12.9 \\) and are detectable. The other stars are too faint to meet the S/N threshold. Therefore, the number of detectable stars is **2**.\n\nANSWER: A"
