Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I remember that in scattering experiments, the scattering amplitude is important. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

Wait, phase shifts... Oh right, in partial wave analysis, the scattering amplitude can be expressed in terms of these phase shifts. I think the formula is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l + 1)e^{iδ_l} sin(δ_l), where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number, and k is the wave number. But wait, that's the general form. Oh, and for the imaginary part, I'm only interested in the imaginary component of this.

The problem states to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, but it gives me five: δ0=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, δ4=13°. So I guess we consider up to l=4.

Wait, but in the formula, each term is (2l + 1) multiplied by sin(δ_l) because e^{iδ} is cos δ + i sin δ. So when you sum all the terms, the imaginary part comes from the sum of (2l+1) sin(δ_l) multiplied by 1/(2ik). But wait, actually, since f(θ) is the scattering amplitude, which is a complex quantity. The imaginary part would be the imaginary component of this sum
