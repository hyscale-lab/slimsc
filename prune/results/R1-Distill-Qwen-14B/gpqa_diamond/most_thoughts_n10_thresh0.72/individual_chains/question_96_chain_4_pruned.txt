Okay, so I'm trying to solve this black hole entropy problem. Hmm, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area, specifically the area of the event horizon. The formula I think is something like S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area, c is the speed of light, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, G is the gravitational constant, and k_B is Boltzmann's constant.

Wait, so the first thing I need to find is the area of the event horizon. The problem gives the angular size θ as 10^-17 degrees, and the distance d is 10^10 parsecs. Oh right, the formula for angular size is θ ≈ diameter / distance when θ is small. But wait, the event horizon's angular size would be θ ≈ (2r)/(d), where r is the radius of the event horizon.

Wait, the radius of a black hole's event horizon is given by the Schwarzschild radius, r = 2 G M / c^2. So maybe I can find M first, then find A.

But maybe I can find r from the angular size. Let's see: the angular size θ in radians is approximately equal to (diameter)/(distance). So θ (in radians) ≈ (2r)/d. Oh wait, but the given θ is in degrees, so I need to convert that. 

So first, let's convert θ from degrees to radians. Since 1 degree is π/180 radians, θ_rad = θ_deg * (π/180). Let's compute that. θ_deg is 1e-17, so θ_rad is 1e-17 * π/180 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Then, from θ_rad ≈ (2r)/d, we can solve for r: r ≈ (θ_rad * d)/2.

But wait, I should make sure that this approximation is valid since θ is very small, which it is (1e-17 degrees is super tiny), so the approximation holds.

So, d is 1e10 parsecs. Wait, how many meters is that? I remember 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.
