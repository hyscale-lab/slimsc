Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. The question is about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. The substances given are all substituted benzene rings, and I need to determine the order of their para-isomer yields from highest to lowest or something like that. Wait, no, the question says to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. Hmm, so the one with the least para yield comes first, then the next, up to the highest.

The substances are numbered 1 to 6, and each is a benzene ring with a substituent. Let's list them out:

1) C6H5-CH3 → Toluene (methyl group)
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 → Phenyl ester, maybe ethyl benzoate? The substituent is OCOEt (ester group)
3) C6H5-Cl → Chlorobenzene
4) C6H5-NO2 → Nitrobenzene
5) C6H5-C2H5 → Ethylbenzene (ethyl group)
6) C6H5-COOH → Benzoic acid (carboxylic acid group)

In electrophilic substitution reactions, the substituents on the benzene ring can be activating or deactivating, and they can direct incoming electrophiles to meta or para positions. Remember, activating groups (like -OCH3, -NH2, etc.) are electron-donating and direct substituents to the ortho and para positions. Deactivating groups (like -NO2, -COOH, -Cl, etc.) are electron-withdrawing and typically direct incoming groups to the meta position.

Wait, but in some cases, even deactivating groups might have some ortho/para-directing tendencies? Or maybe not. Let me think. I remember that nitro groups are strongly deactivating and meta-directing. Carboxylic acid groups are also deactivating, and I think they are meta-directing as well. Chlorine is deactivating because of its electronegativity, but it's ortho/para-directing due to its lone pairs (but more deactivating than activating). So chlorine is a bit tricky.

So, for each substituent, I need to determine whether it's activating or deactivating, and where it directs the incoming electrophile. Since bromine is the electrophile here, in an electrophilic substitution, the substituent will direct the bromine to certain positions.

The question is about the para-isomer's weight fraction. The more the substituent favors para substitution, the higher the yield of the para product. But wait, some substituents might lead to more para products, and others might lead to more ortho, leaving para in the middle.

Wait, but for meta-directing groups, the substituent would direct the incoming group to meta, so para would not form. So if a substituent is meta-directing, then the product would be primarily meta. So the para-isomer would be less in that case.

So let me make a list of each substituent and their directing effects:

1) Toluene (methyl): Activating, ortho/para-directing. So para is possible, but so is ortho. So for para, the substituent is okay.

2) Phenyl ester (O-CO-OEt): I think ester groups are deactivating because of the carbonyl. Wait, esters are electron-withdrawing via the carbonyl. So they are deactivating. So they would be meta-directing? Or do they have lone pairs that can direct? Wait, the ester group has an oxygen with lone pairs, but the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. So overall, the ester is deactivating and meta-directing. Or is it ortho/para? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think that esters are deactivating but meta-directing. Because the oxygen is attached to the carbonyl, which is electron-withdrawing, so the group is deactivating. So the ester group (like COOEt) would be meta-directing. So the incoming bromine would go meta to the ester group. So para would not form much.

3) Chlorobenzene: The Cl is deactivating because it's electronegative, but it's ortho/para-directing due to its lone pairs. So when Cl is present, the incoming substituent (bromine) can go to ortho, para, or even meta, but the major products are ortho and para. So in this case, para is a possible major product.

4) Nitrobenzene: NO2 is strongly deactivating and meta-directing. So the incoming bromine would go meta to the nitro group. So para would not form; the product would be meta, so para fraction is low.

5) Ethylbenzene: The ethyl group is an activating group (since it's an alkyl group, which donates electrons via induction), so it's ortho/para-directing. So para is a possible major product.

6) Benzoic acid: The COOH group is a strong deactivating group (because of the electronegative O and the electron-withdrawing effect of the carboxylic acid). So it's meta-directing. So the product would be meta, so the para fraction is low.

Wait, but wait. For each substituent, where does the bromine go? Let's consider each case.

In each case, the substituent on benzene is R, and the bromine adds to the ring. The directing determines the position.

So, the substituent directs the incoming electrophile (Br+) to certain positions.

For each substitution, the para product is the one where Br is opposite the substituent.

So, we need to find which substituents direct the Br to para position more.

If the substituent is ortho/para-directing, then Br can go to ortho or para.

If the substituent is meta-directing, Br goes to meta.

So, the substituents will have varying degrees of influence. For example, if a substituent is strongly activating and ortho/para-directing, then the para product may be a major product.

But in some cases, steric factors might influence whether ortho or para is more favorable. For example, bulky groups may lead to less ortho product because of steric hindrance, so para is favored. But for this question, I think we can assume that steric factors are not the main concern, and we're focusing on electronic effects.

So, let's process each substituent:

1) Toluene (CH3): Activating, ortho/para. So, para is possible, but so is ortho. Which is more? Well, for toluene, the ortho product is generally less favored than para due to steric hindrance from the methyl group in the ortho position. Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. In reality, toluene tends to undergo para substitution more than ortho, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the activating groups are more likely to have both ortho and para, but the substituent's structure may influence which is more dominant.

Alternatively, perhaps the activating groups are more likely to have ortho and para, but for steric reasons, the para is more favored. So for toluene, para is a major product.

But I'm not entirely sure. But let's proceed.

2) Phenyl ester (COOEt): Deactivating, meta-directing. So Br goes meta. So the para product is minimal.

3) Chlorobenzene: Deactivating, ortho/para-directing. So Br can go ortho or para. So para is a possible major product, but due to the deactivating nature, the reaction may be slower, but the question is about the distribution of para isomer.

But wait, the presence of Cl is deactivating. So the ring is less reactive, but the substituent directs. So in this case, para is a major product.

Wait, but for chlorobenzene, the major products are ortho and para. But how much of each?

I think that para is the major product because in some cases, steric factors (like the Cl being bulky) might make ortho less favored. Wait, Cl is a small substituent, so steric hindrance might not be a big factor. So perhaps for chlorobenzene, the ortho and para products are comparable, but maybe para is more? Or perhaps, for deactivating groups, the para product is more favored than ortho. Hmm, not sure, but perhaps I should think in terms of activating vs deactivating.

Wait, another approach: the substituent's activating nature affects the rate of substitution. So the more activating the substituent, the more reactive the ring is, so more products. But the question is about the amount of para isomer, regardless of the overall reactivity.

Wait, the question is about "the weight fraction of the para-isomer".

So, let's think of each substituent and the relative amount of para.

Substituent | Nature | Directing | Para fraction
--- | --- | --- | ---
1) CH3 | Activating | o/p | High (maybe higher than some others)
2) COOEt | Deactivating | meta | Low (para is minor)
3) Cl | Deactivating | o/p | Para is a major product (since o/p is possible, but which is more?)
4) NO2 | Deactivating | meta | Para is minor
5) C2H5 | Activating | o/p | Maybe higher para than CH3? Or same?
6) COOH | Deactivating | meta | Para is minor

Wait, but let me think:

For substituents that are activating and o/p-directing, the para product is a major product. For deactivating and o/p-directing, the para product is also major, but the reaction is slower.

So for substituents 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), 5 (C2H5), para is a major product. For substituents 2,4,6 (COOEt, NO2, COOH), para is a minor product.

So, among the substituents that are o/p-directing (1,3,5), which ones direct more to para?

Wait, but sometimes, steric factors influence the o/p ratio. For example, in toluene, the methyl group is small, so both ortho and para are possible. But in ethylbenzene, the ethyl group is bulkier, so ortho substitution may be hindered, leading to more para product.

So for substituent 5 (ethyl), the para product is more favored than the ortho, so higher weight fraction.

Similarly, for substituent 1 (methyl), the para product is the major, but perhaps more than ethyl? Or less?

Wait, I think that the bulkier the substituent, the more the para product dominates over ortho. So, substituent 5 (ethyl) is bulkier than substituent 1 (methyl), so substituent 5 would have a higher para fraction than substituent 1.

Similarly, substituent 3 (Cl) is smaller than methyl, but Cl is deactivating. So the para product for Cl would be significant, but perhaps less than the activating groups.

Wait, but let's think about each:

Substituent 1: CH3 is an activating group, so the ring is more reactive. The substituent is o/p-directing. So, the reaction is faster, and Br can go o or p. How much of each? For toluene, the para isomer is usually the major product. I think that for toluene, the para isomer is about 60% and ortho around 30%, with some meta, but wait, in reality, toluene tends to produce more para than ortho. Hmm, but I might be getting this mixed up. Let me recall: when you brominate toluene, the major product is para-bromotoluene, with ortho and some meta. So in that case, the para fraction is higher.

Substituent 3: Cl is deactivating, o/p-directing. So, the reaction is slower than toluene but faster than meta-directing groups. In chlorobenzene, the ortho and para products are formed. But due to steric hindrance of Cl in ortho, perhaps para is more favored. So, the para fraction could be higher than in toluene? Or lower? Because Cl is a better directing group, but deactivating.

Alternatively, perhaps the para fraction for Cl is less than that of CH3 and C2H5 because the ring is less reactive. But the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer, not the overall reactivity.

Wait, the question says that only one monobromo derivative is formed. Oh, wait no, the question says that each substance undergoes an electrophilic substitution reaction with excess bromine, and only one monobromo derivative is formed. Wait, that doesn't make sense because substitution reactions typically give more than one product. Unless under certain conditions, like presence of a strong activating group leading to high para selectivity, or perhaps when the substituent is such that mono-bromination leads to a single product. But that's probably not the case. Wait, perhaps the bromine is in excess and the reaction is such that it's a monobromination, but multiple products are possible. Hmm, this part is a bit confusing. But the question says to assume only one monobromo derivative is formed. So perhaps each substituent leads to a single product, which is either para or something else?

Wait, no, the question says that each undergoes an electrophilic substitution, but only one monobromo derivative is formed. So perhaps each reaction gives only one product, which must be the major product.

Wait, but that can't be the case. For example, toluene would give both para and ortho products. So perhaps the question is saying that for each substituent, only one mono-substituted product is formed, and we have to consider the likelihood of that product being para.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and it's about the distribution of para isomer in the mixture.

But regardless, the correct approach is to consider each substituent and determine the major product's position, then arrange them according to the para fraction.

So, let's try to rank the substituents based on the para product's weight fraction.

The substituents that are o/p-directing (activating or deactivating) would have higher para fractions. The meta-directing substituents would have lower para fractions.

So, first, let's separate the substituents into those that are o/p-directing and meta-directing.

o/p-directing substituents: 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), 5 (C2H5)
meta-directing substituents: 2 (COOEt), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH)

Now, among the o/p-directing groups, the para product's fraction depends on the substituent's directing strength and steric factors.

For toluene (1), the para product is major. For chlorobenzene (3), the para product is also major but perhaps less than toluene. Wait, no, chlorobenzene is deactivating, so the overall reaction is slower, but when it does react, the substituent directs to o/p. But the question is about the ratio of para in the product.

Wait, perhaps the para product's fraction depends on how much the substituent directs to para. For example, for substituents that are strongly o-directing, the para product may be a smaller fraction.

Wait, for substituents that are o/p-directing, the product distribution between ortho and para depends on the substituent's bulk.

If the substituent is bulky, the ortho position is more hindered, leading to more para products. If the substituent is small, ortho and para are both possible, but perhaps ortho is more favored.

So, substituent 5 (C2H5) is bulkier than 1 (CH3) and 3 (Cl), so substituent 5 would have a higher para fraction.

Substituent 1 (CH3) is less bulky than 5, so its para fraction would be lower than 5 but higher than 3 (Cl)?

Wait, but Cl is smaller than CH3. So, substituent 3 (Cl) would have lower steric hindrance in the ortho position, leading to higher ortho product, thus lower para fraction than substituent 1.

So, the order of para fractions for o/p-directing groups would be substituent 5 (highest), then 1, then 3 (lowest).

So substituent 5 has the highest para fraction among o/p groups.

Wait, no. If substituent 5 is bulkier, it leads to more para product. So substituent 5 (C2H5) would have a higher para fraction than 1 (CH3), which is less bulky. And substituent 3 (Cl) is the least bulky, so maybe it has the highest ortho fraction and hence lower para fraction among o/p groups.

Wait, but substituent 3 (Cl) is a deactivating group, so perhaps the para fraction is lower because the substituent is deactivating. No, the para fraction is about where the Br goes, not the reactivity. So, for directing, whether o/p or meta, the substituent's nature is what determines.

So, substituent 3 (Cl) is o/p-directing, so para is a possible product. But since Cl is a better director for o/p, perhaps the para product is significant.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach this differently.

I can make a list of the substituents and their directing effects and assess the para fraction.

Substituent | Directing | Para Fraction
--- | --- | ---
1) CH3 | o/p | High (bulkier than H, so more para than ortho)
2) COOEt | meta | Low
3) Cl | o/p | Moderate (less bulky than CH3 or C2H5; para is a major product)
4) NO2 | meta | Low
5) C2H5 | o/p | Highest (most bulky, so more para)
6) COOH | meta | Low

Wait, but substituent 3 (Cl) is o/p-directing, so the para product is a major product. But how does it compare to substituent 1 and 5?

I think that substituent 5 (ethyl) has the highest para fraction because it's bulky, leading to more para product. Substituent 1 (methyl) is less bulky, so its para fraction is lower than substituent 5 but higher than substituent 3 (Cl). Wait, no, wait. No, substituent 3 is Cl, which is smaller than methyl, so substituent 3 would have less steric hindrance, leading to a higher ortho product, making para fraction lower than that of substituent 1.

So, substituent 5 has the highest para fraction because the substituent is bulky, leading to more para substitution. Substituent 1 has a moderate para fraction. Substituent 3 has the lowest para fraction among o/p-directing groups because Cl is small, so ortho is more favored, making para lower.

So, order of para fraction for o/p groups: 5 > 1 > 3.

For meta-directing groups, the para fraction is low. Let's see:

Substituent 2 (COOEt): meta-directing → para is minor
Substituent 4 (NO2): meta-directing → para is minor
Substituent 6 (COOH): meta-directing → para is minor

Which of these meta-directing groups leads to the least para fraction? Well, all of them are meta-directing, so their para fractions are low. But perhaps among them, the most activating substituent (though all are deactivating) would have a different para fraction.

Wait, no, all meta-directing substituents have low para fraction. So, the meta-directing groups will have lower para fractions than the o/p-directing ones.

So, the overall order from lowest to highest para fraction is:

Substituents with meta-directing → their para fractions are low.

So, among the meta-directing substituents (2,4,6), which has the highest para fraction? Probably the one that's less deactivating and/or better at directing.

Wait, but all meta-directing groups direct to meta, so the para fractions for these are low. So the order among them may not matter as much as their position after the o/p groups. But I need to arrange all six substituents in order of increasing para fraction.

So, the meta-directing substituents (2,4,6) will have lower para fractions than the o/p-directing (1,3,5). So, the order will be:

Lowest para fractions: 2,4,6; then 3,1,5.

But I'm not exactly sure about the order among 2,4,6 or 1,3,5.

Wait, perhaps substituent 6 (COOH) is a stronger deactivating group than substituent 2 (COOEt). So, for substituent 6, the ring is less reactive, but the directing is meta, so para fraction is low. Similarly, substituent 4 (NO2) is even more deactivating, so perhaps its para fraction is even lower.

Wait, but the question is about the para fraction, not the reaction rate. So, regardless of reaction rate, substituents 2,4,6 are all meta-directing, so their para fractions are low. But which is the highest among them?

Wait, substituent 2 is an ester group, substituent 4 is nitro, substituent 6 is COOH. Which of these is less deactivating? Well, I think that the order of deactivating strength is: NO2 > COOH > COOEt (ester). So, substituent 4 is the strongest deactivating, followed by 6, then 2.

But in terms of directing, all are meta. So, for each, the para fraction is low. But perhaps the substituent with the least deactivating effect would have a higher para fraction?

Wait, no. Because para fraction is determined by the directing. No, regardless of how strong the deactivation is, the directing is meta, so para is minor. So, among meta-directing groups, the substituent which is less deactivating may have higher product yield for meta (but the question is about para).

Wait, but the question is about the para fraction. So, the para fraction is the same for all meta-directing groups as the main product is meta, so they have low para fractions. But perhaps substituents that are more activating (but still meta-directing) may have higher para fractions. But I can't think of any meta-directing groups that are activating. All meta-directing groups are deactivating.

So, maybe all meta-directing substituents have very low para fractions, but perhaps the substituent which is less deactivating (like COOEt) would have a higher para fraction than stronger deactivators (like NO2 and COOH).

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 (COOEt) is less deactivating than 4 (NO2) and 6 (COOH). So, substituent 2's para fraction is higher than 4 and 6. So, the order among meta-directing substituents would be 2 > 6 >4 in terms of para fraction.

So, the overall order from lowest to highest para fraction would be:

Substituents with meta-directing groups: 4 < 6 < 2. Then, substituents with o/p-directing groups:3 < 1 <5.

Wait, but substituent 3 is Cl, which is o/p-directing but less bulky than 1 and 5. So, substituent 3's para fraction is lower than 1 and 5 but higher than the meta-directing groups.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled up here. Let me try to make a list:

Substituent | Para Fraction Ranking
--- | ---
4 (NO2) | Lowest, because it's strongly deactivating and meta-directing.
6 (COOH) | Next lowest, because it's deactivating and meta-directing.
3 (Cl) | Lower than 1 and 5, since Cl is o/p-directing but less bulky.
2 (COOEt) | Higher than 4 and 6, but lower than 3,1,5.
1 (CH3) | Moderate para fraction, higher than 3?
Wait, no. Wait, substituent 5 (C2H5) is bulkier, so it has higher para fraction than 1.

So, substituent 5 has the highest para fraction, followed by 1, then 3 (Cl), then the meta-directing groups: 2 (COOEt), 6 (COOH), and 4 (NO2) with the lowest.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Wait, substituent 5 (C2H5) is o/p-directing, and due to its bulkiness, para is favored. So, substituent 5 has the highest para fraction.

Substituent 1 (CH3) is o/p-directing but less bulky than 5. So, substituent 1's para fraction is next.

Substituent 3 (Cl) is o/p-directing but smaller than CH3, so substituent 3's para fraction is lower than substituent 1 and 5, but higher than meta-directing groups.

Then, the meta-directing groups: substituent 4 (NO2) has the least para fraction, followed by 6 (COOH), then 2 (COOEt)?

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think. If substituent 2 is COOEt, which is an ester group, which is more deactivating than Cl but less than NO2 and COOH. So, substituent 2's para fraction would be lower than substituent 3 but higher than substituent 4 and 6.

So, putting it all together:

Lowest para fraction: 4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOEt) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5).

So the order from least to most para fraction is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3. Hmm, no, because substituent 3 (Cl) would have higher than substituent 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order. Let me re-express.

If substituent 3 (Cl) is o/p-directing, its para fraction is higher than the meta-directing groups (2,4,6). So, substituent 3's para fraction is higher than 2,4,6.

So the order would be:

4 < 6 < 2 <3 <1 <5.

Because substituent 5 has the highest, 1 next, 3 next, then 2 and 6, and 4 is the lowest.

Wait, but earlier I thought substituent 2's para fraction is higher than 6 and 4. So, substituting that, the order would be:

4 (NO2, lowest) <6 (COOH) <2 (COOEt) <3 (Cl) <1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5, highest).

So the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3. No, because 3 comes after 2 and before 1.

Option A) 4<2<6<3<1<5 → No.

Option B) 6<2<4<5<1<3 → No.

Option D) 3<5<1<6<2<4 → No.

Wait, none of the options match 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5. So perhaps I made a mistake in the ordering.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2's para fraction is higher than substituent 3's. Wait, but substituent 2 is meta-directing, so its para fraction is very low. No, substituent 2 is meta-directing, so its para fraction is lower than o/p-directing substituents.

Wait, no. The substituent 2 is meta-directing, so its para fraction is low. Substituent 3 is o/p-directing, so its para fraction is higher.

Wait, so substituent 3's para fraction is higher than substituent 2's. So the order should be: substituent 4 < substituent 6 < substituent 2 < substituent 3 < substituent 1 < substituent 5.

Looking at the options, none match this order. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option C: 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3 → No. Because substituent 3 would come before 1.

Option D: 3 <5 <1 <6 <2 <4 → No.

Option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5 → No.

Option B: 6<2<4<5<1<3 → No.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is substituent 4 < substituent 6 < substituent 2 < substituent 3 < substituent 1 < substituent 5.

But none of the options show this. So perhaps I have an error in my analysis.

Another approach: perhaps the order is based on the substituent's ability to direct to para.

The meta-directing substituents (2,4,6) have low para fractions, so the order among them is 4 <6 <2.

Then, the o/p-directing groups: substituent 3 (Cl) has lower para than substituent 1 (CH3), which has lower than substituent 5 (C2H5).

So overall order: 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But none of the options match exactly. Let me check the options again.

Looking at option C: 4<6<2<1<5<3 → No.

Option D: 3<5<1<6<2<4 → No.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the electronic effects and directing differently.

Wait, substituent 2 is COOEt. It's an electron-withdrawing group, so it's deactivating and meta-directing. So, for substituent 2, the bromine would go meta, leading to a low para fraction.

Substituent 4 is NO2, which is a strong deactivating group, meta-directing. So, para fraction is very low.

Substituent 6 is COOH, which is deactivating and meta-directing; para fraction is low.

Among substituents 2,4,6, substituent 2 is less deactivating than 4 and 6. So, perhaps substituent 2 has a higher para fraction than substituent 4 and 6.

So, the order is substituent 4 <6 <2.

Now, the o/p-directing substituents:

Substituent 3 (Cl): deactivating but o/p-directing. Para is a major product, but less than activating groups.

Substituent 1 (CH3): activating, o/p-directing. So, higher para fraction than substituent 3.

Substituent 5 (C2H5): activating, o/p-directing. Even higher para fraction than 1 and 3, since it's bulkier.

So, substituent 5 > substituent1 > substituent3.

Putting it all together:

The order from lowest to highest para fraction is:

4 (NO2) →6 (COOH) →2 (COOEt) →3 (Cl) →1 (CH3) →5 (C2H5).

Which is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3 → No.

So, none of the options match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering substituent 3 (Cl) as having a higher para fraction than substituent 2 (COOEt). But substituent 2 is meta-directing, so its para fraction is low, but substituent 3 is o/p-directing, so its para fraction is higher than substituent 2.

So, yes, substituent 3's para fraction is higher than 2's. So the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the correct option is not present, but that can't be. So maybe I made a mistake in the analysis.

Another approach: perhaps the substituent's activating nature affects the rate of para substitution. But the question is about the weight fraction, not the rate.

Wait, perhaps the order is based on the substituent's directing effect and whether para is the major product.

Substituents that are o/p-directing will have higher para fractions, regardless of activating or deactivating.

So, substituent 5 (C2H5) is o/p-directing and bulky → highest para.

Substituent 1 (CH3) is o/p-directing → high para.

Substituent 3 (Cl) is o/p-directing → high para.

Substituents 2,4,6: meta-directing → low para.

So, the order of para fraction from least to highest is:

meta-directing groups (2,4,6) < o/p-directing groups (3,1,5)

Now, among the meta-directing groups, substituent 2 (COOEt) is less deactivating than 4 (NO2) and 6 (COOH), so substituent 2's para fraction is higher than 4 and 6. So, the order is 4 <6 <2.

Among o/p-directing substituents, substituent 5 is bulkier, leading to higher para fraction than 1 and 3. So, 3 <1<5.

So overall order: 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But looking at the options, none match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the options have errors. Or perhaps I have the order of substituents 3 and 1 inverted.

Wait, substituent 1 is CH3, which is less bulky than substituent 5 (C2H5). So substituent 5 has higher para fraction than 1.

Substituent 3 (Cl) is less bulky than 1, so substituent 3's para fraction is lower than 1's.

Wait, no. If substituent 3 is Cl and substituent 1 is CH3, which is larger than Cl. So, substituent 3 is smaller, so substituent 3's ortho product is more favored than substituent 1's. So substituent 3's para fraction is lower than substituent 1's.

So substituent 3's para fraction is lower than 1's.

So the order is 3 <1 <5.

Putting it all together, the order is:

4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But the options don't include this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Looking at the options again:

Option C) 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3 → No, because substituent 3 is before 5.

Option A) 4<2<6<3<1<5 → No, because 2 comes before 6.

Option D) 3<5<1<6<2<4 → No.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made an error in the initial assessment.

An alternative approach is to look for the correct option based on substituent effects.

Let me think again about each substituent's para fraction:

Substituent 5 (C2H5) → very bulky, so para is major → highest.

Substituent 1 (CH3) → less bulky, para is major → next.

Substituent 3 (Cl) → less bulky than CH3, so ortho is major → para is lower than 1 and 5.

Substituent 2 (COOEt) → meta-directing → para is minor.

Substituent 4 (NO2) → meta-directing → para is minor.

Substituent 6 (COOH) → meta-directing → para is minor.

Now, among the meta-directing groups, which has the least para fraction? Probably substituent 4 (NO2) as it's the strongest deactivating and meta-directing.

Then, substituent 6 (COOH) is next in deactivating strength.

Substituent 2 (COOEt) is the least deactivating among meta-directing groups → higher para fraction than 4 and 6.

So, the order of meta groups:4 <6 <2.

Now, among o/p groups: substituent 3 (Cl) has lower para fraction than 1 and 5, so order 3 <1 <5.

Putting it all together, the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options, the correct one should be this order, but none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C: 4<6<2<1<5<3 → No, because substituent 3 comes after 2.

Option A:4<2<6<3<1<5 → No.

Option B:6<2<4<5<1<3 → No.

Option D:3<5<1<6<2<4 → No.

Hmm. Perhaps I should try a different approach.

Another approach: the higher the activating effect, the more the substituent directs to o/p, so the para fraction is higher. But for deactivating groups, the para fraction is lower.

So, the substituents can be ranked based on their activating or deactivating nature and directing.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's look for the correct option.

Given the options, the correct order is 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5, but that's in option A. No, option A is 4<2<6<3<1<5.

Wait, substituent 2 is COOEt, which is meta-directing, so its para fraction is low, but substituent 3 is Cl, which is o/p-directing and has a higher para fraction than substituent 2.

So option A would have substituent 3 after 2, which is correct. Because substituent 3 has higher para than 2.

So the order would be 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering substituent 6's para fraction. Substituent 6 is COOH, which is meta-directing. So, it's para fraction is low, lower than substituent 2.

Wait, substituent 2 is COOEt, which is meta-directing but less deactivating than COOH. So, substituent 2's para fraction is higher than substituent 6's. So 6 <2.

Putting it all together, the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But again, none of the options match. So perhaps I should consider that substituent 2's para fraction is higher than substituent 3's, which is impossible because substituent 3 is o/p-directing.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5, but the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct option is not present, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is option C: 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

But substituent 3 is o/p-directing, so it should come before substituent 1 and 5.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is 4<6<2<3<1<5, but none of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer is option C: 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

But substituent 3 (Cl) should come before substituent 1 (CH3) in the order because Cl is o/p-directing, but substituent 1 is also o/p-directing. Wait, perhaps substituent 3's para fraction is lower than substituent 1's.

So in the order, substituent 3 comes after substituent 1.

So, the order would be 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But no option matches. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, the options are:

A)4<2<6<3<1<5

B)6<2<4<5<1<3

C)4<6<2<1<5<3

D)3<5<1<6<2<4

So, the correct order according to my analysis is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5. But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of substituent 3 and substituent 2. Because substituent 3 is o/p-directing, its para fraction is higher than substituent 2's (which is meta, so lower). So substituent 3 comes after substituent 2.

So, the correct order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But this isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 (COOEt) is ortho/para-directing. Wait, no, wait. Wait, esters are deactivating and meta-directing. So I was wrong earlier; substituent 2 is meta-directing, so its para fraction is low.

So, the correct order would be as I thought earlier.

But given that, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but that's not matching. I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, as it groups substituent 3 after substituent 2, which is correct.

But I'm not confident. Given the time I've spent, I think the correct order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C.


The question involves determining the order of substances 1-6 based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during an electrophilic substitution reaction with bromine. The analysis hinges on the nature of the substituents (activating or deactivating) and their directing effects (ortho/para or meta).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Substituent Nature and Directing Effects**:
   - **Activating Groups**: These are electron-donating and ortho/para-directing. Substances 1 (CH₃), 3 (Cl), and 5 (C₂H₅) fall into this category.
   - **Deactivating Groups**: These are electron-withdrawing and meta-directing. Substances 2 (COOEt), 4 (NO₂), and 6 (COOH) fall into this category.

2. **Para Fraction Trends**:
   - **Meta-Directing Groups**: These groups (2, 4, 6) have low para fractions because they direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. Among these, the order of para fractions is **4 < 6 < 2**, as NO₂ is the strongest deactivator, followed by COOH, and then COOEt.
   - **Ortho/Para-Directing Groups**: These groups (1, 3, 5) have higher para fractions. The bulky ethyl group in 5 (C₂H₅) leads to the highest para fraction due to steric hindrance favoring para substitution. The methyl group in 1 (CH₃) has a moderate para fraction, while the chlorine in 3 (Cl) has the lowest para fraction among the ortho/para-directing groups.

3. **Final Order**:
   Combining the above trends, the order of increasing para fractions is:
   **4 < 6 < 2 < 3 < 1 < 5**.

4. **Matching with Options**:
   - Option A: 4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5 → Incorrect, as 6 should come before 2.
   - Option B: 6 < 2 < 4 < 5 < 1 < 3 → Incorrect, as 4 is the lowest.
   - Option C: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3 → Incorrect, as 3 should come before 1.
   - Option D: 3 < 5 < 1 < 6 < 2 < 4 → Incorrect, as 4 is the lowest.

None of the options match the derived order **4 < 6 < 2 < 3 < 1 < 5**. However, based on the closest alignment and potential errors in the options, **Option C** is selected as the best available choice, despite its inaccuracies.
