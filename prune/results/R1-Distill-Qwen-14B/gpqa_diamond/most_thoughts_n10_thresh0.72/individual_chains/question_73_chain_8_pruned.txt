Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there are two astronauts. Their masses are 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds: 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, with different values for v_rel and E.

Hmm. I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract the velocities like you would in classical mechanics because of the relativity of velocity addition. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in relativity is different. Also, the total energy would be the sum of their relativistic energies, I think.

Wait, let me start with the relative velocity. The formula for the relative speed when two objects are moving at v1 and v2 in the same direction is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem is about their relative speed. So which one is moving faster? The first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c. So from the perspective of the second astronaut, the first is moving at how much speed?

Wait, but I've heard that when you're finding the relative velocity, you have to use the velocity addition formula. So let me think. If astronaut A is moving at v1 = 0.6c in the same direction as astronaut B, who is moving at v2 = 0.5c, then the relative velocity u of A with respect to B would be (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, but wait, I think the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c² ). Wait, is that correct?

Alternatively, I sometimes get confused whether it's (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c² ) or (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c² ), but since v1 is larger than v2, the relative speed should be positive.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the relative
