Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each with two pH values.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when you titrate it with a strong base like NaOH, the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. The pH changes as the reaction proceeds.

First, let's figure out what's happening when we dilute the acetic acid. The initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. I think I need to calculate the new concentration after dilution.

Wait, yes, dilution. The formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 M * 20) /40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Wait, but let's calculate the moles. The initial volume of acetic acid after dilution is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So moles of acetic acid = M * V = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. So at equivalence, we need 0.001 moles of NaOH.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume V = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration. So that's 25% of the way to equivalence. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

So, let's first find the pH at 25% titration. At this point, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So, moles of CH3COOH initially: 0.001 mol. Moles of NaOH added: 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol.

So,
