Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

So, the setup is an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid-shaped, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. The question is about the radiated power per unit solid angle in the radiation zone. It says this power is a function f of λ and the angle θ measured from the z-axis.

The question asks for two things: what fraction of the maximum power A is radiated at θ=30 degrees, and what the possible form of f is.

The options are A to D, with different fractions and λ dependencies.

I remember that when a dipole radiates, the power per unit solid angle (like the radiation pattern) depends on the angle θ. For a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern is maximum along the equator, perpendicular to the axis. The formula for the radiation intensity (I think) is proportional to (sinθ)^2, but wait, no, that's the dipole radiation pattern. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the dipole's radiation pattern is maximum at θ=90 degrees, and it's zero along the poles (θ=0 and 180). So the intensity pattern for a dipole is actually proportional to sin²θ. So for θ=30 degrees, sinθ is 0.5, so sin²θ is 0.25. So the intensity at 30 degrees is 25% of the maximum.

Wait, but wait. Wait, maximum intensity for dipole is at θ=90 degrees. So the maximum value is when sinθ is 1, so sin²θ is 1. So the intensity at θ=30 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25, so 25% of the maximum.

But wait, the question is about the fraction of the maximum power A that's radiated at θ=30. So if the maximum is at θ=90, then at θ=30, we get 1/4 of the maximum. So the fraction is 1/4. So looking at options, let's see which options have 1/4 as the first part.

Options B and C have 1/4 as the first part.

Now, the second part is about the form of f, which is the power per unit solid angle as a function of λ and θ. The question says f is a function of λ and θ. So what's the dependence of the radiation intensity on wavelength?

Wait, for dipole radiation, the intensity is proportional to (ω² μ ε )^something. But more precisely, the power radiated by an oscillating dipole is given by certain formulas.

Wait, the power per unit solid angle (the radiation intensity) for a dipole is given by (I think) I = ( ( μ0 p0^2 ω^4 ) / (12π c^3) ) * sin²θ. Hmm, but how does this relate to the wavelength λ?

The angular frequency ω is 2π / λ times the speed of light? Wait, no, wait. The speed of light c is
