Okay, so I've got this question about immunology, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. 

The question involves rotavirus tagged with GFP. They delivered it to mice via oral gavage. Then, they observed some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid and some entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. They identified the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated the proliferating cells. Sequencing the variable heavy chain gene showed high variability. The question is about the process happening here.

Hmm, what do I know about rotavirus and the immune response? Rotavirus is a common cause of gastroenteritis. When it infects, it primarily affects the small intestine, and the immune response involves both innate and adaptive immunity. The Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are specialized for detecting pathogens in the gut.

So, when the GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins are given, some are destroyed by stomach acid. Stomach acid is strong, so it probably denatures some proteins. Those that make it through the stomach might get stuck in mucus in the intestines. But some do reach the Peyer patches, which are the sites where immune responses to these antigens are initiated.

Once in the Peyer patches, the antigens are taken up by antigen-presenting cells, like M cells or dendritic cells. Then, they activate B cells. The variable heavy chain gene sequencing shows high variability, which makes me think about how B cells diversify their antibodies.

Looking at the options:

A) Somatic hypermutation: This occurs in B cells after they've been activated. It's a process where mutations are introduced into the variable regions of the B cell receptor (BCR) genes, increasing the diversity of antibodies. This happens during the immune response, especially in secondary lymphoid organs like the Peyer patches.

B) Complement activation: This is part of the innate immune response, helping to eliminate pathogens. But it doesn't involve gene variability in B cells.

C) Class switching recombination: This is when B cells switch the class of antibody they produce (like from IgM to IgG). It involves recombination of the heavy chain constant regions but doesn't directly cause variability in the variable regions.

D) VDJ recombination: This is the process during B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J segments are joined to create the variable region of the BCR. But this happens early on, during the maturation of B cells, not necessarily in response to a specific antigen in the periphery.

In this scenario, the B cells are proliferating in the Peyer patches. Since the variable heavy chain gene has high variability, it's likely that the B cells are undergoing some form of diversification after antigen exposure. Somatic hypermutation occurs after the initial activation, leading to more diverse BCRs, which is part of the adaptive immune response. This would explain the high variability observed.

So, the process taking place is somatic hypermutation. That's option A.


The question involves rotavirus tagged with GFP, which is delivered to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, and some is entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the Peyer patches, a type of secondary lymphoid organ. In the Peyer patches, the fluorescently labeled antigens are taken up by antigen-presenting cells, activating B cells. Sequencing the variable heavy chain gene of the proliferating B cells reveals high variability, which suggests a process that diversifies the B cell receptor (BCR).

Analyzing the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process introduces mutations into the variable regions of BCR genes after antigen activation, increasing antibody diversity. It occurs in secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer patches and explains the observed variability in the variable heavy chain gene.
- **B) Complement activation**: This is part of the innate immune response and does not involve gene variability in B cells.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This involves switching the class of antibody produced but does not directly increase variability in the variable regions of the BCR.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow and establishes the initial variability of the BCR but does not explain the observed variability in response to antigen exposure.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain gene is best explained by somatic hypermutation, which occurs in response to antigen stimulation in secondary lymphoid organs like the Peyer patches. 

Answer: A
