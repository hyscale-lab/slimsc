Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let me start by breaking down the information given.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So that's like a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group. Esters typically have a carbonyl group (C=O), so that's a strong peak around 1700 cm^-1. But in the IR, it also has the ester's characteristic absorption, maybe the O-C-O stretching as well.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six signals. Let's see what they correspond to. Two signals are aromatic-H. That suggests maybe the substituents are in positions that give two distinct sets of aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted? No, wait, a di-substituted benzene can have different substitution patterns. For example, if the two substituents are in the para positions, the aromatic protons might split into two sets, maybe each as a doublet, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the aromatic H are two signals. So perhaps the substituents are in positions that lead to two different types of aromatic protons. Let me think. If it's a para substitution, the benzene might have two sets of equivalent H. For example, if it's 1,4-disubstituted, which would be para, the protons ortho to each substituent would be equivalent, and the meta would be another set. Wait, but in that case, how many signals would that give? Hmm, maybe two signals for the aromatic H because of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe it's a meta substitution, which would lead to more splitting, but perhaps in this case, the substituents are such that two sets are formed.

Then, the NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically those attached to a double bond, like in an ester group. Oh wait, because the IR shows an ester. So maybe the substituents include an ester group, which would have a structure like R-O-C-O-R. So perhaps one substituent is an ester group, say, like -O-CO-O-R? Or wait, an ester is usually R-O-CO-R, so maybe attached as a substituent on the benzene ring.

Wait, the substituent could be an ester group, such as -O-CO-O-R, but more likely, perhaps a propenoate ester or something with a double bond. Hmm, but let's think about the vinyl-H. They are split into a doublet and a doublet of quartets. So perhaps one set is next to a double bond and another group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group. For example, an allyl ester or something similar. Let me think. If the substituent has a vinyl group, such as an allyl group attached via an ester.

Wait, let's consider the structure. The aromatic ring has two substituents. One of
