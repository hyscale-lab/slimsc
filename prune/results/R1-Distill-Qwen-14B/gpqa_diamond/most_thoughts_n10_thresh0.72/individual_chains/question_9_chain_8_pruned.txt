Okay, so I've got this question about molecular symmetry, specifically which molecule has C3H symmetry. Hmm, I remember that symmetry in molecules is a big part of stereochemistry. Let's see, I need to figure out what C3H symmetry means.

Wait, symmetry elements... Oh right, C3H would imply a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Or wait, no, maybe it's that the molecule has a three-fold helical axis? Or maybe it's just a three-fold rotational symmetry. Wait, C3H symmetry... So, I think C3H refers to a molecule that has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Or wait, maybe H is for a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule can be rotated 120 degrees around the C3 axis and also have a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis. Or perhaps it's a cyclic three-fold axis with some other symmetry.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. C3H symmetry would be a type of molecular symmetry where there's a three-fold rotational axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (H). So the molecule would look the same after a 120-degree rotation about that axis and also have a mirror plane that's perpendicular to it. Or maybe it's just that the molecule has a three-fold axis and the H refers to the molecule being prochiral or something else? Hmm, maybe I should focus on the structures of the given molecules and see which one fits.

The options are four molecules: triisopropyl borate
