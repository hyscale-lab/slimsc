Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this nuclear decay question. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a decay process where two nucleons of flavor A convert into two of flavor B, and emit two lighter particles E and V. The reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. It's given that the E particles have a continuous energy spectrum with an endpoint Q.

Then there's a variant where instead of two V particles, one exotic, massless particle M is emitted. So the reaction becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M. The question is about how the energy spectrum of E particles changes in this variant compared to the original decay.

Hmm, I remember that in decay processes, the type of emitted particles affects the energy spectrum. For continuous spectra, like in beta decay, it's due to the conservation laws. Let me think about each part.

In the original decay, two E and two V are emitted. Since E and V are lighter, maybe V has some rest mass. The E's have a continuous spectrum, which suggests that their energies can vary up to some maximum Q. That maximum Q is probably the Q-value of the decay, considering the masses involved.

In the variant, two V particles are replaced by a single M. But wait, M is massless. So, M has zero mass, but maybe it's a boson or something. Since it's massless, its energy is equal to its momentum times c (E = pc for massless particles).

Wait, but when you change the products, how does that affect the possible energies of the E particles? Let's think about energy and momentum conservation.

In the original case, the decay products are E, E, V, V. Since all the particles are emitted, their energies and momenta must add up in a way that conserves both energy and momentum.

In the variant, instead of two V's, we have one M. So the products are E, E, and M. How does this change the possible energy sharing between E and M?

In the original decay, since both V and E are emitted, their energies are variable, leading to a continuous spectrum for E. But with the variant, perhaps the energy distribution changes because M is massless.

Wait, but in the original case, when you have multiple particles emitted, the E particles' energies are continuous because the other particles (V
