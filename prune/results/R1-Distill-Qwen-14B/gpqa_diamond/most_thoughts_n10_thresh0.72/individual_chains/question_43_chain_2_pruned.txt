Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of IUPAC nomenclature. But let's take it step by step. The question is about a benzene ring with several substituents, and I need to find the correct IUPAC name from the options provided.

First, let me try to visualize the structure based on the description. The benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group, a carbaldehyde group, and a cyano group, all meta to one another. Hmm, meta means each is separated by one carbon. Wait, but wait â€“ meta to one another. So they're each positioned at positions that are each two carbons apart? No, wait, meta in benzene means each substituent is at a position that is three apart because benzene is a six-membered ring. Wait, that's confusing. Let me think: in benzene, each substituent's position is numbered 1, 2, 3, etc. Two substituents that are meta would be at positions 1 and 3, right? So if all three substituents are meta to each other, that's tricky because each one needs to be meta to the others. Wait, that's impossible because on a benzene ring, each substituent can only have two meta positions. So maybe the question means that each substituent is meta to one of the others. Or perhaps it's arranged in such a way that all three are in meta positions relative to each other.

Wait, maybe I should draw
