Okay, so I have to calculate the enthalpy of formation of this compound. The compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, that's a bit complex. I remember that the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, I think I need to calculate the bond energies of all the bonds in the compound and then relate that to the elements' bond energies.

Wait, the given data includes enthalpy of atomization of carbon, which is 1000 kJ/mol. Oh right, the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break a bond in an element to form atoms. So for carbon, it's the bond energy of C-C, which is 200 kJ/mol. Because, for example, to break one mole of C-C bonds, you need 200 kJ, so the atomization would be 200 kJ/mol.

But wait, enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to completely convert a mole of the element into separate atoms. So for carbon in solid form, which is graphite, the bond energy is 200 kJ/mol, so the atomization energy would be 200 kJ/mol. Wait, that's confusing. Because bond energy is the energy to break a bond, but atomization is per mole of molecules, I think. Hmm, maybe I should look up what exactly the enthalpy of atomization is. Oh right, for carbon, which forms C-C bonds, the bond energy is 200 kJ per mole of bonds. But for graphite, each mole has 6.022e23 molecules, each with multiple bonds. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

The question gives the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. So maybe that's the energy needed to break all the bonds in a mole of carbon into individual atoms. So if each C-C bond is 200 kJ/mol, but in graphite, each carbon has four bonds, but in a structure, so maybe the atomization energy is calculated differently. Oh, perhaps the way to approach this is to consider that the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol, so each C atom has an enthalpy of 1000 kJ/mol divided by Avogadro's number? No, maybe not. Wait, perhaps it's simply given, so I don't need to calculate it. I just need to use the data provided.

So, the approach is to use Hess's Law, which allows us to calculate the enthalpy change by considering bond energies. The enthalpy of formation is the difference between the bond energies of the reactants and products.

The formula I think is: ΔHf° = [sum of bond energies of reactants] - [sum of bond energies of products]. Wait no, wait, actually, in bond enthalpy terms, the formation enthalpy is calculated by considering the bonds broken (reactants) and the bonds formed (products). So the formula is:

ΔHf = [sum of bond energies of bonds broken in reactants] - [sum of bond
