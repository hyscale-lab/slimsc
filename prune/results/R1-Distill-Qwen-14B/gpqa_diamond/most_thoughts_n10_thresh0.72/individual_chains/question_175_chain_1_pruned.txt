Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charge distributions and radiation. Hmm, I remember that when charges oscillate, they can emit electromagnetic radiation. The question is about the power radiated in the radiation zone, specifically looking at the function f which depends on lambda and theta, the angle with the z-axis.

Wait, the setup says the charge distribution is spheroid-shaped with the symmetry along the z-axis. So it's symmetric around the z-axis, which probably affects the radiation pattern. I think dipole radiation is usually considered in such cases. Oh right, a dipole antenna or something similar. So the radiation pattern for a dipole is a function of theta, the angle from the z-axis, which is the direction of the dipole.

The problem states that the maximum power radiated is A. We need to find the fraction of A radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and also determine the form of f, which is the power per unit solid angle as a function of lambda and theta.

I remember that the radiation pattern for a dipole is given by something like (sin(theta))^2, right? Because the dipole's radiation is maximum at the equator (theta = 90 degrees) and falls off towards the poles (theta=0 or 180). Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the dipole's radiation is maximum at 90 degrees, minimum at 0 and 180. So the intensity pattern is proportional to sin^2(theta). So at theta=30 degrees, sin(30) is 0.5, so sin^2 is 0.25. Oh wait, but wait, this is for the angular dependence. But wait, that's the angular dependence of the intensity. But the question is about the power per unit solid angle, which I think is the same as the intensity.

Wait, but the total power is the integral of the intensity over all solid angles. So the maximum intensity would be at theta=90 degrees, which would give sin^2(90)=1. So the maximum power per unit solid angle is A, or is A the total power?

Wait, no, the question says "the maximum power thus radiated is A." So A is the maximum power, I think. So the maximum occurs where the intensity is maximum, which is at theta=90 degrees. So the intensity at
