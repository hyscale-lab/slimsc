Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about electrophilic substitution reactions involving bromine, and it's looking at the para-isomer yield. We have six substances (1 to 6) which are all benzene derivatives. Each undergoes an electrophilic substitution with excess bromine, and only one monobromo derivative is formed. I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm. So each of these substituents on benzene will influence where the bromine adds. The directing effect of the substituents is key here. Remember that substituents can be activating or deactivating, and ortho/para or meta directors.

Let me list out the substituents for each compound:

1) C6H5-CH3: This is toluene. The CH3 group is an activating, ortho/para-directing substituent. So the bromine will tend to add in the para position, but also ortho. But since it's a activating group, the ring is more reactive, so the para would be a major product, but ortho could be a significant minor.

2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: This is ethyl benzoate. The COOEt group is a meta-directing, deactivating group because it's an electron-withdrawing group (the ester). So the substituent directs incoming electrophiles to the meta positions. So for substitution, the product is mainly meta, meaning the para-isomer would be less.

3) C6H5-Cl: This is chlorobenzene. Cl is an electron-withdrawing group (due to inductive effect), but it's ortho/para-directing because of the lone pairs (resonance). So the Cl directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. But since Cl is deactivating, the ring is less reactive, so the reaction might be slower, but when it does occur, the substituent directs where. So bromine addition would be para and ortho. But since it's a meta director? Wait no, Cl is ortho/para director. So the major products would be para and ortho. But which is more in para? I'm not sure.

4) C6H5-NO2: This is nitrobenzene. NO2 is a strong deactivating group and is meta-directing. So the substituent directs the incoming electrophile to the meta positions. So the para-isomer would not form; the product would be meta. So the para fraction here would be zero? Or very low.

5) C6H5-C2H5: This is ethylbenzene. The ethyl group is activating (since it's an electron-donating alkyl group) and ortho/para-directing. So the bromine will add mostly para, but also ortho. Since it's activating, the para should be a major product. So the para fraction is high here.

6) C6H5-COOH: This is benzoic acid. COOH is a strong deactivating group (electron-withdrawing) due to the -COOH group. It's also meta-directing. So the substituent directs to meta. Therefore, the para-isomer would be minimal.

Wait, but wait. I think I'm mixing up some facts. Let me go through each substituent again.

Substituents can be classified as activating or deactivating. Activating groups are electron-donating, which make the ring more reactive. These are typically ortho/para directors. Deactivating groups are electron-withdrawing, making the ring less reactive and are often meta directors, but some can be ortho/para directors (like nitro groups are meta, but Cl is ortho/para).

So for each substituent:

1. CH3: activating, ortho/para director. So substitution occurs at ortho and para. Since the ring is activated, the reaction is more favorable. So the product would have higher para yield compared to a deactivating group.

2. COOEt (ester): deactivating (due to the carbonyl group withdrawing electrons), meta director. So the substituent directs to meta positions. So the para isomer is not formed, or very low.

3. Cl: deactivating (inductive effect), but ortho/para director (due to lone pairs). So substitution occurs at ortho and para, but since the ring is less activated, the reaction is slower. But the para is a possible position.

4. NO2: deactivating, meta director. So substitution occurs at meta, so para is not formed. So para yield is low.

5. C2H5: activating (alkyl group), ortho/para director. So substitution favors para, so high para yield.

6. COOH: deactivating (electron-withdrawing), meta director. So substitution occurs at meta positions, so para is not formed. So para yield is low.

Wait, but I need to think about the orientation of each substituent and how that affects the para product. The key is the substituent's directing effect.

But wait, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each compound, how much of the para product is formed.

But in some cases, the substituent may not allow para substitution. For example, if the substituent is meta-directing, the bromine goes to the meta positions, so no para product. Or in cases where the substituent is ortho/para, the para is a possible site, but how much is it compared to ortho.

Wait, but the question says that only one monobromo derivative is formed. So for each substituent, there's only one product. That can't be right because for some substituents, like CH3, you can form ortho and para products. Hmm, but the question says only one monobromo derivative is formed. Oh wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps each substitution occurs in only one position, so each starting material gives a single substitution product.

Wait, that's conflicting. Electrophilic substitution typically has multiple products if the substituent is ortho/para directing. So perhaps the question is assuming that only a single product is formed, perhaps due to steric hindrance or other factors. Or maybe it's a trick. But the question states that only one monobromo derivative is formed, so each reaction produces a single product. That's confusing because for some substituents, like CH3, you can get multiple products.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read it again. "Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed)". Ah, so for each substance, the reaction produces only one product. So, perhaps each substituent directs the substitution to a single position (para or meta), but some substituents might have only one possible site.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because, for example, toluene (CH3) has two possible sites (ortho and para). If the reaction gives only one product, perhaps in some cases the substituent is such that only one position is possible. Or perhaps they all form a single product, but that depends on the substituent's directional effects.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction conditions or some other factors lead to only one product being formed. But I'm probably overcomplicating. The key is to determine, for each substituent, which position(s) bromine adds, and then determine the fraction of the para isomer.

Wait, but if each reaction gives only one product, perhaps the substituent is such that only one site is possible. For example, if the substituent is in a position that only allows substitution at the para position? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the substitution occurs in a specific position, and we have to determine whether that position is para or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the relative amounts of para isomer when multiple products are possible, but the question states only one product is formed. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read again: "only one monobromo derivative is formed". So for each starting compound, the bromine adds in one position only, giving one product. So each of the six reactions gives a single product, which is either the para-substituted or another position.

But some substituents can lead to only one possible product. For instance, if the substituent is such that substitution can only occur in one position. For example, if the substituent is meta-directing and in a position that the meta is the same as the para due to the substituent's position? That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is in a position where only one site is available for substitution. For example, if the substituent is in a position that when only one possible position is left for substitution, which could be either ortho, meta, or para.

Wait, perhaps considering the substituent's position relative to the ring. Let me think
