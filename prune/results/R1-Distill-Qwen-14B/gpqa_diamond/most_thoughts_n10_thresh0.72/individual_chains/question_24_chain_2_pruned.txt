Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because these multi-step problems can be tricky. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

The problem starts by talking about an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Hmm, I remember that substances which decolorize bromine water are usually alkenes or something that can react with bromine. So maybe mixture X contains compounds with double bonds, like alkenes or possibly something else like thiols, but I think alkenes are more common here.

Next, it says when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y. The reaction is a disproportionation, and Y is an equimolar mixture of two other liquids that don't decolorize bromine water. Disproportionation usually means a reaction where one element is both oxidized and reduced. For example, in the case of hydrogen peroxide decomposing into water and oxygen, O is both oxidized and reduced.

But wait, the starting materials are in a 1:1 ratio, and Y is also equimolar. So maybe the reaction isn't a simple disproportionation but perhaps a hydrogenation or dehydrogenation. Oh wait, the catalyst is platinum, which is used for hydrogenation reactions. Oh wait, but wait, the question says that when mixture X is treated with Pt and heated, a disproportionation occurs. So maybe it's a hydrogenation where one compound is getting hydrogenated and another is being dehydrogenated? Or perhaps it's a splitting reaction.

Wait, the product mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So if X's components did, Y's don't. So if X had alkenes, which decolorize bromine, then Y's products don't have alkenes. So maybe the alkenes in X are being hydrogenated, but that would lead to alkanes, which don't react with bromine. But wait, the problem says that mixture Y is formed via disproportionation. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the reactions.

Wait, no. Wait, the initial mixture X is treated with Pt when heated, and it undergoes a disproportionation reaction. So perhaps the starting materials are such that when hydrogenated (since Pt is a catalyst for hydrogenation) or maybe under some other conditions, they split into different products. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydro
