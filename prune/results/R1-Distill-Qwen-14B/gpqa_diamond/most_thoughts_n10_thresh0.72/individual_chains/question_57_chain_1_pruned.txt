Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it step by step.

The question gives me phase shifts δ0, δ1, δ2, δ3, and δ4, which are 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, and 13° respectively. They mention that I should ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so I guess I only use these five. The task is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, what do I remember about scattering amplitudes and phase shifts? Oh right, in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is related to the phase shifts. Specifically, for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 (along the incident direction), I think the formula involves the sum of the cotangents of the phase shifts multiplied by something else.

Right, the general formula for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * (2l + 1) * P_l(cosθ)

Where the sum is over all angular momentum states l, and P_l is the Legendre polynomial. But since we're interested in the imaginary part along the incident beam direction, θ=0. Also, for θ=0, P_l(1) is 1 for l=0, but 0 for all higher l because P_l(1)=1 for l=0 and 0 otherwise. So, that simplifies things a lot.

Wait, wait, no. I think I'm mixing something up. For θ=0, only the l=0 term contributes because higher l terms vanish. So, the amplitude at θ=0 is only from l=0. But wait, the given phase shifts include δ0, δ1, up to δ4. Hmm, that's confusing. Oh wait, no, the phase shifts are for each l. So δ0 is for l=0, δ1 for l=1, and so on up to l=4.

But when θ=0, the Legendre polynomial P_l(cosθ) is 1 for l=0, and zero for all other l. So when we sum over l, only the l=0 term contributes. So the amplitude at θ=0 is (1/(2ik)) * (e^{2iδ0} - 1) * 1.

But wait, the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So I need to compute Im[f(0)].

Wait, but I'm a bit shaky on the exact formula. Let me think again. The scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) (2l + 1) P_l(cosθ)

But for θ=0, P_l(1)=1 if l=0, else 0. So f(0, φ) = (1/(2ik)) (e^{2iδ_0} - 1
