Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition reaction, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem presents three different reactions, each involving the Michael addition. For each, I need to determine the major product. There are four options (A to D), each giving possible products for each reaction labeled A, B, and C.

Alright, let's break this down. The Michael addition is a 1,4-conjugate addition where a nucleophile (enolate) attacks the beta carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The product is a new carbon-carbon bond between the enolate's alpha carbon and the beta carbon of the Michael acceptor.

First, let's tackle each reaction one by one.

**Reaction (A): dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) â†’ A**

So dimethyl malonate is the enolate source. It's a good nucleophile because it's a diester, which makes the enolate more stable. The other component is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of this is: CH2=CH-C-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group attached to the CH2. Wait, no, let me think again. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. No, wait, the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the substituent at position 3? Hmm, maybe I should draw it. The acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. So the p-tolyl group is at the 3 position, meaning on the CH2 group. So the structure is CH2(p-tolyl)-CH2-CO-OCH3? Wait, no, E-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the CH2. So it's CH2(p-tolyl)=CH-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the CH2. So it's CH2(p-tolyl)-CH2-CO-OCH3? No, wait, that doesn't make sense because the double bond is between C1 and C2. So in (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Because the double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait, no, wait. The acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. So the substituent at position 3 would be on the CH2 next to the double bond. So it's CH2(p-tolyl)-CH2-CO-OCH3? No, that doesn't seem right because 3 would be the position of the acrylate. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=C(COOCH3)-p-tolyl. Wait, perhaps it's the CH2 group has the double bond, and the p-tolyl is on the next carbon. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the CH2, making it CH2(p-tolyl)=CHCOOCH3. Is that right? So the double bond is between the first and second carbons, with the p-tolyl on the first carbon. So the structure is p-tolyl-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3? Wait, no, that would be a single bond. So perhaps it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. That
