Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants are involved in calculating the distribution of different complexes in solution. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. Oh wait, wait, what's the blue one? I think the blue complex is the one with two SCN- ligands, so that's the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, which corresponds to β2=40? Or wait, sometimes the numbering might be different. Wait, stability constants are for successive ligand additions. So β1 is for the first ligand, β2 for the second, etc. So β2 would be the formation constant for Co(SCN)_2^2+ from Co(SCN)^+ and another SCN-.

Wait, let me get the structure right. The general formation for the complexes would be:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)^+ (β1)
Co(SCN)^+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_2^2+ (β2)
Co(SC
