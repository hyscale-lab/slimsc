Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about pericyclic reactions, specifically sigmatropic rearrangements. I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a sigma bond along with the movement of pi bonds. Cope and Claisen rearrangements are examples of these, so that's a clue.

The question has three separate reactions, and I need to figure out what each product is. Then, I'll match them to the options given (A, B, C, D). Let's take each reaction one by one.

Starting with the first reaction:
1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) â†’ A

Hmm. So the starting materials are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol, with H+ and heat. Wait, that sounds a bit like a Claisen or Cope rearrangement, but maybe it's an example of another sigmatropic reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hemiacetal or acetal formation, but with an amine involved.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is a structure where the amine is attached to two methoxy groups and a CH2 group. So the structure is like (CH3O)2CH-NH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be N-methyldimethoxyamine? Let me draw it: ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2, but 1,1-dimethoxy would replace the two Hs on the first carbon (the ethanamine is CH3CH2NH2, but 1,1-dimethoxy would be (CH3O)2CH2NH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. 1,1-dimethoxy would have two methoxy groups on the first carbon, so the structure is (CH2(OCH3)2)NH2, but that's hard to imagine. Alternatively, maybe it's dimethylamino with two methoxy groups on the same carbon.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the reaction involves adding H+ and heat. So maybe it's an acid-catalyzed rearrangement. But what's the other reactant? But-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2? Wait, no. But-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, but but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, maybe not. Let me think. But-3-en-2-ol: the structure is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait, but but-3-en-2-ol would have double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but but is four carbons. So but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? Oh wait, but but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3
