Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment. Hmm, I remember that spin is a form of angular momentum for particles, right? The question says the particle's magnetic moment mu is equal to gamma times Sz, where Sz is the spin component in the z-direction. 

So initially, the magnetic field is in the +Z direction, and the particle's moment is aligned with it. That probably means it's in an eigenstate of Sz. Then, suddenly the field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, same magnitude. Both fields have the same strength B. After that, the average z-component of the particle's moment starts oscillating, and we need to find the oscillation frequency.

Wait, so the magnetic field changes from along Z to Y. I think this is a problem involving the time evolution of a spin state when the Hamiltonian changes. Because the Hamiltonian depends on the magnetic field direction.

At first, when the field is along Z, the Hamiltonian is H_initial = -mu·B. Since mu = gamma Sz, H_initial would be proportional to Sz. The energy levels for spin-1/2 would be ± gamma B/2, I think. Because Sz can be ± ħ/2, but wait, mu is gamma Sz, then H_initial = -mu · B. Oh wait, more precisely, the Zeeman Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_z, assuming that the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. Wait, actually, mu is proportional to spin, so perhaps H = -mu·B. Hmm, maybe I should be careful.

Wait, the magnetic moment mu is given as mu = gamma S_z. So in the initial state, the Hamiltonian is H_initial = -mu · B. Since B is along +Z, H_initial = -gamma B S_z.

So the eigenstates are |+z> and |-z>, with energies E+ = -gamma B (gamma B S_z for |+z> would be gamma B (ħ/2) ? Wait, wait, no, S_z has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So mu = gamma S_z, so mu is gamma times that. So mu = gamma ( ± ħ/2 ). Oh wait, but in the Hamiltonian, H = -mu · B. So H_initial for |+z> would be -mu B. So H_initial |+z> = -gamma (ħ/
