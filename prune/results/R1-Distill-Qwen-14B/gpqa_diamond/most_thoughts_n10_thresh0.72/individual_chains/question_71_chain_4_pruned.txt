Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says that there are five exoplanets in a system, all with circular orbits and discovered via the TTV method. They're in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. I need to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, assuming they have the same albedo.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... I remember the formula for that. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by T = T₀ * sqrt(R/(2a)), where T₀ is the star's effective temperature, R is the star's radius, and 'a' is the planet's orbital semi-major axis. Or wait, another version I've heard is T = T_star * (L / (16πσ a²))^(1/4), but maybe that's more detailed. Alternatively, the simpler version is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)), assuming the star's luminosity is based on its radius and temperature. Oh right, because the star's luminosity L is proportional to R² T_star^4.

Wait, maybe the formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo)/sigma )^(1/4) ), but since the problem states they have the same albedo, that part cancels out. So for the ratio, albedo doesn't matter.

So the key is the ratio of their temperatures depends on the square root of (R/(2a)) for each planet. But actually, since the star's R and T are the same for both planets, the ratio will depend on the inverse square root of their semi-major axes. Because the formula for each planet's T is proportional to sqrt(R/(2a)).

Wait, let me think again. The equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ), right? So T is proportional to sqrt(1/a), because R and T_star are same for both. So the ratio T4/T2 would be sqrt(a2/a4), because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). Wait, because if T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), then T4/T2 = (1/sqrt(a4)) / (1/sqrt(a2)) ) = sqrt(a2
