Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question again.

The question says a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. Then, after some time, they checked using TLC and saw the reactant spot diminish with two new spots. So the product must be two compounds. I need to figure out which option is correct.

Hmm, I remember that when alkenes react with HBr, it's an addition reaction, typically following either an acid-catalyzed ionic mechanism (like with H2SO4) or a radical mechanism. Wait, but waitâ€”HBr is a strong acid, but for alkenes, I think the reaction is usually an acid-catalyzed addition. Let me think, when HBr adds to an alkene, it follows the mechanism where H+ adds first, creating a carbocation, and then Br- attacks.

Wait, but wait, the molecule here is a substituted benzene with an ether group. So the structure is O-benzene connected to a (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl) group. Let me draw that mentally. The butenyl group is CH2-CH(C(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2-O-benzene? Wait, no, butenyl would have a double bond. Let me clarify: the but-3-en-1-yl group is CH2CH2CH=CH-O-benzene? No, wait, but wait: but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH2CH2 but with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait no, butenyl is four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl would be from carbon 1: the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with the double bond starting at carbon 3. Wait, but that can't be. Oh wait, the correct structure for but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2-CH=CH2? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think: but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? Or maybe it's CH2-
