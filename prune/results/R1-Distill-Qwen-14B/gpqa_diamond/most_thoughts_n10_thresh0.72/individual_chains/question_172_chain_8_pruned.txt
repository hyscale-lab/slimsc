Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on my astrophysics, but I'll try to break it down.

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, so the excitation level is higher in star_1. And the energy difference between the two levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The problem states that the photospheres are in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. That probably means we can use the Boltzmann equation for this scenario.

Right, the Boltzmann distribution equation relates the population of different energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium. The formula is n_i / n_j = exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k T) ), where n_i and n_j are the number densities of the two energy levels, E_i and E_j are their energies, and k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature.

In this case, the energy difference Î”E is given as E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J. Let's assume that in star_1, the higher energy level is more populated relative to star_2. Wait, no: the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So I think that means the population of that energy level is higher in star_1. Let me clarify: if the energy levels are E1 and E2, with E1 > E2, and star_1 has more atoms in E1 than star_2, which would imply that star_1 is hotter since higher energy levels are populated more when temperatures are higher.

So, for star_1, n1 (excited state) is twice that of star_2's n2. So n1/n2 = 2. But wait, the Boltzmann equation is about the ratio of populations in two energy levels. Maybe I should write the ratio for each star.

Let me denote for star 1: n1_1
