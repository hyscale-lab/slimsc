Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. And I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, first, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when you break and reform carbon-carbon double bonds, right? Grubbs is typically a transition metal catalyst, like ruthenium-based, that facilitates this kind of reaction.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. So the molecule is chiral, and both the R and S configurations are present.

Let me draw the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)2? Wait no, wait. Wait, pentane has five carbons. So pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But wait, 3-methyl would mean a methyl group on C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2CH3? Hmm, no, wait. Wait, the formula would be CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)2? No, wait, wait. Let me count again.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But 3-methyl would add a methyl group on C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, that doesn't make sense because pent has five carbons. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So the positions are 1,2,3,4,5. But when we have 3-methyl, that would be a methyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, that would make it six carbons. Oh wait, no, maybe it's CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, that's not right. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me
