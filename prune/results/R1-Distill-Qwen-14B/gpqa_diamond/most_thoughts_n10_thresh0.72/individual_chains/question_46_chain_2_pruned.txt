Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, let me think. I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when you break and reform carbon-carbon double bonds, right? So it's like swapping the ends of the alkenes.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers, so both R and S configurations at the chiral center. But wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene structure: let me draw that. It's CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)2? No, wait, pent means five carbons. Let me number them. Carbon 1 has a double bond, so structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene: the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So it's CH2=CHCH2CH(CH3)2? Or maybe I got the substituents wrong. Let me think again. 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the structure CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, that can't be right. Wait, pent has five carbons. So the structure is: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? So the double bond is between C1 and C2
