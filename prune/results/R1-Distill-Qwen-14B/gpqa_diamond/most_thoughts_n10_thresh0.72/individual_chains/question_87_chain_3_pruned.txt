Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that someone has prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. Di-substituted means there are two substituents on the benzene ring. The total number of carbons is 8. Wait, benzene has 6 carbons, so the substituents must add 2 carbons in total. Hmm, but wait, wait. The ring is 6-membered, which I assume is a benzene ring, so 6 carbons. The compound has 8 carbons in total, so substituents add 2. So each substituent contributes one carbon, because two substituents make two carbons. Or maybe one substituent is -OCH3 (which is an O and a CH3, but that's three carbons... Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

The FTIR spectrum shows peaks indicating a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like -X, where X is Cl, Br, etc.). So the compound has both a carbonyl group and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring.

So the compound is a di-substituted benzene with substituents that include a carbonyl and a halogen. Wait, but wait, the substituents must add up to 2 carbons. Because benzene has 6, 6+2=8. So each substituent is one carbon. So the substituents are -X (which doesn't add a carbon) and perhaps a carbonyl group. Wait, but carbonyl is C=O, which is a substituent with one carbon. So maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group (like -CO-) but wait, that's two oxygen atoms. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aldehyde group, but aldehyde is RCHO, which is a substituent with a carbon.

Wait, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. Like, for example, one substituent is -COOR (like an ester), but that would add more than one carbon. Hmm, this might get confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a ketone (but
