Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember everything perfectly, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's start by reading the problem carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So, I need to figure out what each step does and then determine the NMR spectrum of the final product.

First reaction: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C gives a light yellow solid product 1. The 1H NMR of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR has a strong absorbance at 1720 cm-1.

Hmm, what does that IR peak indicate? I remember that around 1700-1750 cm-1 is usually a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So product 1 likely has a ketone group. So maybe it's an adamantanone derivative.

Wait, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. When dibromides react with KOH, especially under high heat, I think it's an elimination reaction. So, two vicinal bromides would eliminate two HBr molecules and form a double bond. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has bromines on adjacent carbons? No, wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so the positions are probably on adjacent carbons in the diamond structure.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane: the structure of adamantane is a diamondoid with four cyclohexane rings fused together. So the 1 and 3 positions are adjacent? Or perhaps on opposite ends? Wait, not sure about that, but when KOH is used, elimination occurs. But since it's 1,3-dibrom, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, which are usually more rigid.

Wait, but elimination usually occurs when there are adjacent leaving groups. If both Br are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond. But in adamantane, the bridgehead positions are generally not where double bonds form because of the structure's strain. So maybe the reaction isn't elimination but rather a substitution.

Wait, no, KOH is a strong base. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but that would make a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening, but that's unlikely here.

Wait, thinking again: The product has a carbonyl. So, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation leading to a ketone. Wait, if two adjacent Brs eliminate, maybe forming a carbonyl group. Wait, that doesn't quite add up. Or wait, maybe each Br is on a bridgehead carbon, and when eliminated, forms a ketone because of the ring structure.

Wait, let me think about the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings. So, bridgehead carbons are positions 1 and 3. When you have two Br atoms on bridgeheads, like 1 and 3 positions, perhaps they're on adjacent bridgeheads. So, when KOH is added, each Br is eliminated with a base, but wait, that would require two dehydrohalogenations. Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by an -O- group, but that would lead to an epoxide, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is substituted by an OH group, but that would form a diol, but the IR doesn't show O-H stretches. Wait, the IR here is 1720, which is a ketone.

Wait, maybe elimination occurs in a way that forms a ketone. Wait, for each Br, if we have a neighboring H, when eliminated, maybe each Br leaves with a base, but that can't form a carbonyl directly. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond, but then that wouldn't form a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm missing
