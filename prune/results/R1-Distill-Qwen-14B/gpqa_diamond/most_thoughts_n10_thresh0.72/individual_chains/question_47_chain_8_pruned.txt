Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. The question is about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data. The compound has the formula C9H11NO2. Let me see what the options are and the data provided.

First, the IR data. The peaks are at 3420 and 3325 cm-1, both medium to strong. Those are usually indicative of N-H or O-H stretches. But wait, the compound's formula has one N and two O's. Hmm. Also, a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a carbonyl, probably an ester or amide because 1720 is a typical region for those.

Looking at the NMR data next. The 1H NMR shows:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating for 3H. That's probably a methyl group attached to something, like an ethyl group. Because triplet with 3H suggests CH2CH3. So maybe an ethyl group somewhere.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): A broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests maybe an exchange with something, like an amine, but wait, the formula has an N. Or perhaps something else like an -OCH2 group? Not sure yet.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): A quartet integrating to 2H. Quartet usually comes from two neighboring groups. So like CH2 next to another CH2. Maybe an -OCH2CH2- group? Or perhaps part of an ester.

7.0 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet integrating to 2H. That's aromatic protons. Similarly, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): another doublet. So four aromatic protons in total, which suggests a para-substituted benzene ring because the doublets are likely from two sets of equivalent protons. So if it's para, like two substituents opposite each other on the benzene.

Putting this together, the aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene. So the substituents are probably at positions 4 and 1 (if the numbering is such), making it a para arrangement.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. So benzamide means a benzene ring with an amide group. The substituents would be ethoxy and amide. But wait, in 3-ethoxy, that's meta. So the substituents would be in meta positions, which would give different NMR signals. So the aromatic protons would not be a pair of doublets. So maybe this isn't the right option.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So formamide is HCONR2. Here, the benzene is at position 4, which is para to the ethoxy group. So substituents would be at para positions, which matches the NMR. But the formamide group would contribute a carbonyl. Let me think about the functional groups.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the benzene has an amino group and a propionate. But the amino would be in a position, and the propionate ester. Wait, but the IR has O-H? Or N-H? The IR has the 3420 and 3325, which are broad? If the compound has an amine, like 4-aminophenyl, then the N-H would show as broad peaks. But the NMR shows 4.0 ppm as a broad singlet for 2H. Wait, amines typically have protons around 1-5 ppm, but as broad signals. Also, in NH groups, but in the NMR, I don't see any peaks in that region except the 4.0 ppm, which is for 2H. Hmm, but 4.0 ppm is more likely an oxygen-bearing group, like OCH2.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So benzoate ester, with an ethyl group. The structure would be OEt (ester) attached to the benzene ring, which has an amino group at the para position. So the substituents on the ring are amino and ester groups.

Now let's break down the NMR for each option.

Starting with the IR: the strong peak at 1720 is a carbonyl. Ester and amide carbonyls are around there. So both options B (formamide) and D (ester) have carbonyls.

In option D, the ester would have a carbonyl at ~1720. The ethyl group would have a triplet at 1.20 ppm (CH2CH3). Then the ester oxygen would be attached to a CH2, which would be at around 4.0-4.5 ppm. Wait, in the NMR, there's a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H), which could be the OCH2 of the ester. Because in ethyl esters (like ethyl benzoate), the OCH2 is around 4.1-4.3 as a quartet. Hmm, but the quartet is at 4.5 here. That's a bit higher, but perhaps possible.

Looking at the NMR data: 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet (2H). Wait, maybe that's the amino group? If it's a secondary amine, like in aniline, but in the case of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the amino group would be NH2. But NH2 protons are usually broad and in the 1-5 ppm range. But in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet, which is 2H. Wait, maybe that's not the amino group. Alternatively, the OCH2CH2CH3 group? No, the ethyl ester would be OCH2CH3. Oh wait, no, the ethyl ester is OCH2CH3, so the OCH2 would be a quartet at around 4.1-4.3 ppm. But in the given NMR, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm, which is higher than expected. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm thinking about this wrong. Let's think about each option's possible NMR.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is OEt-O-C6H4-NH2.

Wait, no, wait: the structure is 4-aminobenzoate ester. So the benzene ring has NH2 and OCOOEt groups in para positions. So the substituents are NH2 and OCOOEt.

In NMR, the ethyl ester would give a triplet at 1.20 (CH2CH3), and the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.0-4.5. But the NMR shows 4.5 as a quartet (2H). So that could fit the OCH2.

But where is the NH2 group? The IR suggests N-H, but in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. That doesn't fit an NH2, which is usually a broad peak but integrating to 2H (if it's -NH2, but in this case, it would be two protons). Wait, but in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is integrating to 2H, which is a singlet and broad. That could be an NH2 if it's an aromatic amine. But aromatic amines have protons around 4-5 ppm. But the broadness suggests exchange. Alternatively, maybe it's an -NHOCH2- group or something else, but that's not matching any of the options.

Alternatively, maybe it's not an NH2. Let's think about another option.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is Ph-OCH2CH3 with a formamide group attached. Wait, no, formamide is HCONR2. So the structure would be Ph-NH-C(O)-H, but wait, no. Formamide is HCONHR, I think. Wait, no, formamide is HCONR2, where R is substituents. So in this case, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would have the structure where the formamide is attached to the benzene via the amine. So the structure is:

Ph-NH-C(O)-H, and the benzene has an ethoxy group in the para position. So the substituents are NH-C(O)H and OCH2CH3.

Now the NMR of this structure: The ethoxy group would give a triplet at 1.20 ppm (CH2CH3). The OCH2 would be around 4.0-4.5 as a quartet, but in the given NMR, there's a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H). So that could fit the OCH2CH3.

But what about the formamide group? The formamide is an amide, so the C=O is present. The NH would be present as a peak in the NMR. But the given NMR has a quartet and a singlet in that region. Let me think.

The 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): a broad singlet for 2H. Maybe that's the NH of the formamide. But formamide NH is usually around 8-9 ppm, but that's for the NH in amides. Wait, no, amides have NH protons around 6-8, but they can vary. Alternatively, maybe the NH is exchanging and not showing up in the NMR, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the 4.0 ppm could be an N-CH2 group. But formamide doesn't have that. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options again. Let's think about the molecular formula: C9H11NO2.

So for each option:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide would be C7H7NO2, and ethoxy is OCH2CH3, so the substituent adds 2 carbons, so overall formula would be C9H11NO2? Let me check: benzamide is C7H5NO2 (benzene ring with CONH2). Adding an ethoxy group (C2H5O) would make it C9H11NO2. Yes.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONR2. The benzene is C6H4, with ethoxy and formamide substituents. So C6H4(OCH2CH3)(NHCOH). Wait, no, formamide is HCONR2. So substituting on the benzene, the formula would be C6H4(OCH2CH3)(NHCOH). So that's C6 + (OCH2CH3 has 2C) + (NHCOH has 1C from formamide). So 6+2+1=9 C. Then H: benzene is 4H (due to
