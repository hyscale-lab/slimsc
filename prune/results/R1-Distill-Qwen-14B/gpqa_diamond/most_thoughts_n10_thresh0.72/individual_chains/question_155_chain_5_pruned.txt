Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z for a given quantum state. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x corresponding to eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). 

First, I need to remember how to calculate the uncertainty of an observable when the system is in a specific state. I think the formula is ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to compute the expectation values ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩.

But wait, the state given is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. That might complicate things because the state isn't necessarily an eigenstate of P_z. So the expectation values won't just be the eigenvalues; I'll have to compute them using the matrix of P_z and the given state vector.

So the first thing I need to do is write down the matrix for P_z. From the problem statement, P_z's matrix is:

[ ħ   0    0 ]
[ 0   0    0 ]
[ 0   0  -ħ ]

So that's a diagonal matrix. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which makes sense because P_z is diagonal in its own eigenbasis.

Now, the state vector is ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Wait, I should check if this vector is normalized. Let me compute the sum of the squares of its components.

(-1/2)^2 = 1/4, (1/√2)^2 = 1/2, and another (-1/2)^2 = 1/4. Adding them: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good, that's a relief.

Next, to find ⟨P_z⟩, I need to compute ψ† P_z ψ. Since P_z is diagonal, this should be straightforward. The expectation value is the sum of each component of ψ multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element of P_z and the conjugate of the component.

Wait, but the components of ψ are real, so the conjugate doesn't change anything. So, ⟨P_z⟩ = (-1/2)*ħ + (1/√2)*0 + (-1/2)*(-ħ). Let me compute that:

(-1/2) * ħ = -ħ/2
(1/√2)*0 = 0
(-1/2)*(-ħ) = ħ/2

Adding them together: (-ħ/2 + ħ/2) = 0. Oh, interesting. So the expectation value of P_z is zero.

Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩? That would be ψ† P_z² ψ. Since P_z squared is just each diagonal element squared, let's compute that
