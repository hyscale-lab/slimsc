Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

So, the problem is about particles being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are fast-decaying and are produced at a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of them reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. The options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28.

Hmm, Lorentz factor, right. I remember that the Lorentz factor is gamma, which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma equals 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). At ultra-relativistic velocities, gamma is approximately equal to the total energy divided by the rest mass energy, but maybe that's not directly needed here.

Wait, the key point is about how far the particles travel before decaying. Since they're moving at high speeds, their lifetime is dilated due to time dilation. So the time they take to reach the detector's inner walls depends on their velocity and the detector's radius. If a particle doesn't decay, it will reach the wall. But since some do decay, only a fraction make it.

So the initial situation is that at gamma =20, one third of the particles reach the wall. We need to find the gamma where two-thirds reach the wall.

I think the probability of a particle reaching the wall depends on the ratio of the proper lifetime (tau) to the dilated lifetime (gamma tau), but wait, actually, the proper lifetime is tau, and the time experienced by the particle is tau, but from the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau. So the time available for the particle to travel is the lab frame time, which is the time until it decays. So the distance it can travel is velocity multiplied by the time until decay, which is gamma tau * v.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is longer, so it can travel further. So the maximum distance it can go before decaying is v multiplied by gamma tau. If the detector's radius is R, then if v gamma tau is greater than R, the particle will reach the wall. Wait no, actually, the maximum distance is velocity multiplied by the decay time. So if the distance is equal to R, they just reach the wall. So the probability probably depends on whether the particle's decay time allows it to reach before decaying.

Alternatively, maybe the fraction of particles that reach the wall is determined by the ratio of the distance they can travel (v gamma tau) to the detector's radius R.

Wait, but actually, the decay process is a Poisson process. The probability that a particle does not decay during a certain time is exp(-
