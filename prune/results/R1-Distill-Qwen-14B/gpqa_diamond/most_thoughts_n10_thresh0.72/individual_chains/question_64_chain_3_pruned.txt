Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read through it carefully and figure out what's going on.

So, the problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighs 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without air, and this produces a mixture of gases. These gases are then passed through some tubes. Let's break down what's happening in each tube.

First, the gas goes through a tube filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant and can react with water vapor. The weight of this tube increased by 3.60 grams. So, the gas must have contained some water vapor because Mg(ClO4)2 would absorb it. That means the initial gas mixture has H2O.

Next, the gas moves to a Ca(OH)2 solution in the second tube. But the weight didn't change here. I think Ca(OH)2 reacts with CO2 to form CaCO3 and water. If the weight didn't change, maybe there was no CO2 in the gas. Or perhaps the amount of CO2 was zero, or maybe it was all absorbed but the solution's mass didn't change because it's a solution. Wait, no, when CO2 dissolves in Ca(OH)2, it forms a precipitate, so the solution's mass would increase. Since the weight didn't change, perhaps there's no CO2. Alternatively, maybe the amount of CO2 was negligible or zero.

Then, the gas goes into a red-hot copper tube. The weight increased by 0.80 grams, and CuO was formed. I know that CO reacts with CuO in the presence of heat to produce Cu and CO2. But wait, if the copper is red-hot, maybe the gas is CO reacting with Cu to form CuO. Wait, actually, when CO passes over hot Cu, it reacts: CO + Cu → CuO + C? Or is it that CO is oxidized? Hmm, maybe it's the other way around. Oh, right! When CO reacts with CuO under heat, it produces CO2 and copper metal. So the reaction is CO + CuO → Cu + CO2. But wait, in this setup, the copper is red-hot, so the gas is passing through it. So if the gas has CO, it would react with Cu to form CO2 and CuO. But in this case, the tube's weight increased by 0.80 grams. So that suggests that some CO was present. Because the reaction would produce CuO, which would increase the tube's mass.

After this, only 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP), which is 0°C and 1 atm. STP volume to moles conversion: 22.4 L/mol, so 2.24 L is 0.1 mol. So gas C is 0.1 moles.

Wait, let's think about the gases in the mixture. The initial heating of salts A and B (which are likely carbonates or something that decomposes upon heating) produces some gases. Let's think: when a carbonate is heated, it
