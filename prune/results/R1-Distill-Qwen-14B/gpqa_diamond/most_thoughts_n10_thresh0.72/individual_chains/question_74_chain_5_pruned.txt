Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, let me read it again. 

The question says we have an atom that has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So after 100 minutes, there's a 32% probability it has decayed. Wait, but probability... I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. So, the decay probability isn't linear with time. 

Wait, let me think about this. The decay constant λ is related to the half-life. But wait, the question gives a 32% probability over 100 minutes. So, I can use that to find the decay constant first. 

The formula for the probability of decay in a given time is P = 1 - e^(-λt). So in this case, when t is 100 minutes, P is 32%, or 0.32. So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100). 

Let me solve for λ. Rearranging the equation: e^(-λ*100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural log of both sides gives: -λ*100 = ln(0.68). 

What's ln(0.68)? Let me approximate. ln(1) is 0, ln(0.5) is about -0.693, ln(0.68) would be a bit higher than that. Let me calculate it properly. 

Wait, actually, 0.68 is e^(-0.405) because e^0.405 is approximately 1.498, so 1/1.498 is about 0.668. Hmm, maybe I should just compute it. Let me think: ln(0.68) ≈ ln(2/3) is about -0.405, but wait 2/3 is approximately 0.666, but 0.68 is a bit higher. Oh wait, using a calculator would give a more accurate value, but since I don't have one, maybe I can estimate it. Alternatively, I can proceed symbolically.

So, λ = (-ln(0.68)) / 100. Let's compute ln(0.6
