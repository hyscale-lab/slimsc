Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here about optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember optical isomerism has to do with the way molecules can rotate plane-polarized light. It's when a molecule has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. So if a molecule has such a center, it can have enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images, leading to optical activity.

The question lists four organic moieties and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are a bit tricky, but I'll go through each one by one.

Let's look at the first compound: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So, it's a biphenyl structure with substituents on both rings. The substituents are nitro groups at the 6 and 6' positions and carboxylate ester groups at the 2 and 2' positions. Wait, biphenyls can have different conformations, but for isomerism, especially optical, we need chiral centers. Are there any chiral centers here?

In this structure, each of the central carbons (the ones attached to the phenyl rings) would be connected to two ester groups and two phenyl groups. Wait, wait. No, wait. The biphenyl structure is connected via a single bond, so the two phenyl rings can rotate around that bond unless there's some hindrance. But the substituents are on positions 2 and 6, which are para to each other on each ring. So, each ring has two substituents: a nitro and a carboxylate ester. Let me think: each of those central carbons (the ones attached to the rings) would have what groups attached? 

Wait, each of the two central carbons (the ones in the biphenyl) is connected to two rings and two ester groups. No, wait, the substituents are on the rings, but the central carbon (like the ones in the biphenyl) would be connected to the rings and maybe other groups. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The structure is a 1,1'-biphenyl, so the two phenyl rings are connected at position 1 and 1'. Then, on each ring, at
