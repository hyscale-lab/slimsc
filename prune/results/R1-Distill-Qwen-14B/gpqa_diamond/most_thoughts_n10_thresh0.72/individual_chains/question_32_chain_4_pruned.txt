Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, like gold nuclei, but in this case, it's a different nucleus. Let me think about the details.

The nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, lithium has an atomic number of 3, right? So Li (lithium) has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6 isotope because 3 protons +3 neutrons =6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6.

I need to calculate the total energy of the ion when it's moving at 0.96c. Wait, the question is about the energy of the RHIC, which I think refers to the kinetic energy, but sometimes physicists use total energy (rest mass plus kinetic). Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Oh wait, the energy in particle physics terms is usually the total energy, including rest mass. But wait, wait, in colliders, the energy is typically the kinetic energy. No, wait, in accelerators, the energy is usually the kinetic energy added to the rest mass. Or wait, no, in high-energy physics, the energy given is the total energy (gamma * m c²). Or maybe it's the kinetic energy. I need to clarify that.

The problem states that the speed is 0.96c, so I can calculate gamma for that speed. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that. v is 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c². So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Let's see, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, because 0.28² is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. So 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, exactly. So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

Now, the energy of the nucleus would be gamma times m c squared. So I need the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately... Well, I think the mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c². Wait, the exact mass is about 938.272 MeV for a proton and 939.565 MeV for a neutron, but maybe for this problem, we can approximate each as about 938.5 MeV on average.

So
