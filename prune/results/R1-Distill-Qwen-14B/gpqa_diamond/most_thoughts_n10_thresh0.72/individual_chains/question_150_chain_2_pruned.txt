Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and the compound is reacted through a series of reagents. I need to find the final product from the options provided.

First, I should look at the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. The data is as follows:

1H-NMR (ppm):
- 9.72 (t, 1H)
- 6.98 (d, 2H)
- 6.51 (d, 2H)
- 6.27 (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 (d, 2H)

I remember that the integration tells me the number of protons for each signal. So, let's break it down.

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet (t) integrating to 1H. A triplet around 9-10 ppm usually suggests an aldehyde proton (RCHO), but wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 and typically as a singlet, but here it's a triplet. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, it could be an acidic proton, maybe from a phenol, but phenols are usually broader singlets around 5-7 ppm. Or maybe it's an enol proton? Or perhaps a carbonyl group somewhere else, but not an aldehyde.

Wait, another thought: the triplet at 9.72 ppm. Triplets usually come from coupling with two neighboring protons. So maybe it's an aldehyde adjacent to a CH2 group? No, because aldehydes are at the end. Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha proton to a carbonyl. For example, in a conjugated system like an enol or an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Or perhaps it's a vinylogous system.

Looking at the other signals: 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H). These look like two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H. This is typical of a para-substituted aromatic ring. The 6.98 and 6.51 could be two adjacent para-substituted benzene rings. Wait, or maybe one benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. Alternatively, maybe a di-substituted benzene, but I'm thinking it's more likely a biphenyl system, but let's not jump to conclusions yet.

The peak at 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2H. Broad singlet could be from an enol proton or maybe an aliphatic CH2 near an electronegative group. Alternatively, it might be a conjugated diene or a vinyl group.

The 3.66 ppm peak is a doublet (d) for 2H. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. A common group for this is a CH2 next to an electronegative atom, like O. Maybe an OCH2
