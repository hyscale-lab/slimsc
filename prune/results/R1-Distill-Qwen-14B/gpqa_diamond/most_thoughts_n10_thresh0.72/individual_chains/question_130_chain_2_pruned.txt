Okay, so I've got this question about redshift and detecting quasars with neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. We need to find the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Wait, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. But when it's absorbed, it creates a absorption line. Oh right, the Lyman-alpha forest is a series of absorption lines in the spectra of quasars due to intervening neutral hydrogen clouds.

But the thing is, optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet light because the atmosphere absorbs it. So if the Lyman alpha line is redshifted into the optical range, that's when we can detect it from the ground.

So the key here is the redshift z. The observed wavelength λ_obs is related to the rest wavelength λ_rest by 1 + z = λ_obs / λ_rest. Here, the rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. We want λ_obs to be in the optical range, which I think is about 400 to 700 nm or 4000 to 7000 Angstroms.

Wait, but optical telescopes can't observe everything in that range because of the atmosphere's opacity. Oh wait, the cutoff is around 300 nm, but ground-based telescopes can't observe below about 300 nm because of the ozone layer. So the Lyman alpha line has to be redshifted to above 300 nm to be visible from the ground.

Wait, no, that's not right. The atmospheric cutoff is around 300 nm (ultraviolet), so anything below that is absorbed. So for ground-based optical telescopes, the observable wavelengths are longer than ~300 nm. So the Lyman alpha absorption line must be redshifted to 300 nm or longer to be detectable. Because if it's at 300 nm, that's the limit.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The quasar emits light, but the hydrogen clouds absorb at their own rest frame, which is 1
