Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

First, the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an O-H stretch, maybe in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is around where a carbonyl (C=O) group would show up. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be aromatic C=C stretching. So maybe the compound has a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester or maybe a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the NMR data next. The 1H NMR shows:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, probably an O-H proton, likely from a carboxylic acid. If it were an alcohol, the peak would be broader and maybe lower, but 10 is typical for carboxylic acids.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): These are two protons as a doublet. In an aromatic ring, this could be para-substituted with two H's. Like in something like a para-substituted benzene with another substituent.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet with two protons. So maybe two sets of doublets in the aromatic region, which suggests a para-substituted benzene. Like two substituents in the para positions, but wait, no, that might not make sense. Wait, maybe it's a substituent with two H's on it. Or perhaps a single substituent that has two H's, making a coupling. Alternatively, maybe an ortho or meta substitution. Wait, no, the doublets could be from two sets of equivalent protons. So perhaps a para-substituted benzene with another group that has two H's, but not sure yet.

Then, the other signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, perhaps a CH group adjacent to something deshielded, like a carbonyl. Maybe a CH next to a ketone or ester.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Two protons as a multiplet. Maybe a CH2 group adjacent to something else, perhaps part of a chain.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of three H's as a doublet. Wait, no, a doublet (d) with 3H. That's probably a methyl group attached to something else, like maybe a CH(CH3) group. Wait, a doublet for a methyl group suggests that it's attached to a CH with two other protons. Oh wait, perhaps it's a tertiary structure. Like a CH(CH3)2 or something. Alternatively, maybe a geminal di-substitution.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet (maybe from coupling with a neighboring CH2) and three H's, so a terminal methyl group. Like a CH2CH3 at the end.

Putting this together, maybe the molecule is something like a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group, a chain, and some branching. Let me try to sketch this out.

The carboxylic acid at 10.5 ppm suggests a -COOH group. So the structure might have a benzene ring with a COOH substituent and another substituent with a chain. The IR at 1720 cm-1 supports the presence of a carbonyl, which in a carboxylic acid would be around that region.

Looking at the aromatic region, the two doublets suggest two sets of two equivalent protons. So maybe the benzene is para-substituted with two groups. Wait no, that's not possible. Oh, wait, maybe only one substituent is present on the benzene ring, and that substituent has a structure that leads to two sets of aromatic protons. Alternatively, the substituent itself has some coupling.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like a ketone or an ester. Let's think. For example, if the substituent is a propionyl group (CH2COOH), but that might not fit all the data.

Wait, the NMR shows a CH adjacent to a carbonyl. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH next to a carbonyl group, perhaps in a structure like CH2-CO-OH. Or maybe it's a CH connected to a ketone.

Alternatively, considering the substituent could
