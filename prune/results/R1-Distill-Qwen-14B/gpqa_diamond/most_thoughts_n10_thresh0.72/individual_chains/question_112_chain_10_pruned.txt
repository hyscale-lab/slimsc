Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question involves an electron state and some probability calculations, then finding an average value. Alright, let's break it down.

First, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, I think I'll need to normalize this state because probabilities must add up to 1. Wait, but wait. The question says it's proportional, so I guess the normalization factor is missing. So I'll need to compute the normalization constant first.

Let's compute the state vector. The state is (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>. So in vector form, if |up> is (1,0) and |down> is (0,1), then the vector would be [1+i, 2-i]. But wait, I need to find the normalization factor. The normalization condition is that the inner product of |alpha> with itself should be 1.

So, the inner product is (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i). Let me compute each term. 

First term: (1+i)(1-i) = 1 - i + i - i². Since i² is -1, this becomes 1 - (-1) = 2.

Second term: (2-i)(2+i) = 4 + 2i -2i -i² = 4 - (-1) = 5.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second, no, wait. Oh no, wait! Wait, no, because the inner product is the sum of the squares of the absolute values. For a vector (a, b), the norm squared is |a|² + |b|². So for a = (1+i), |a|² is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2, because (1+i) has real part 1 and imaginary part 1, so magnitude squared is 1^2 +1^2=2. Similarly, b is (2 -i), so |b|^2 is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5. So the total norm squared is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

So the state is normalized. Good.

Next part: The operator whose matrix representation is given by A_ij = hbar/2 if i ≠ j, else 0. So what is the matrix of this operator?

In a two-dimensional space, the operator matrix would be:

[ 0, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

Because when i and j are different, it's hbar/2, else 0. So the diagonal elements are 0, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the matrix is 2x2, indices i and j run from 1 to 2 (assuming |up> is 1, |down> is 2). So when i=1 and j=2, A_12 = hbar/2, and A_21 = hbar/2. So the matrix is:

[ 0, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

So this is a Pauli matrix, but scaled. Let me think; the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this matrix is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because (hbar/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] is exactly the matrix we have.

So the operator in question is (hbar/2) σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix.

Now, the problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator. Wait, the eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of the operator A. So, to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms
