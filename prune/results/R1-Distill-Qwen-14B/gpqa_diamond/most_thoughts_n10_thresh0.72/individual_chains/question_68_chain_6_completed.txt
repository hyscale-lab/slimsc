Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, I need to figure out the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment when the magnetic field changes. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says the particle has a magnetic moment mu equals gamma times Sz. So mu = γ S_z. Oh wait, right, gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio. Right, S_z is the spin operator in the z-direction. The particle is initially aligned with a magnetic field along +Z. So the initial state must be the spin-up state in the z-direction because that's the alignment for minimal energy.

Then, the magnetic field is suddenly turned off and another one is turned on along +Y. Both have the same magnitude B. When the field is switched, the direction of the magnetic field changes, which affects the Hamiltonian of the system. I remember that the Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -μ·B. So when the field changes, the Hamiltonian changes.

Wait, but in this case, the initial magnetic field was along Z. So the initial Hamiltonian was H_initial = -μ_z B_z. But when the field is turned off and another along Y is turned on, the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -μ_y B_y. Oh, but wait, mu is given as gamma S_z, so I think I need to express the magnetic moment in terms of the spin components.

Wait, actually, the magnetic moment mu is typically given as mu = gamma S, where S is the spin vector. Oh, so maybe mu = gamma (S_x, S_y, S_z). Because the spin is a vector. So when the field is along Z, the magnetic moment's z-component is what's involved. But when the field is along Y, the magnetic moment's y-component will be involved.

So the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. The initial state is |+z>, right? Because the field is along z, the particle is aligned, so it's in the eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue +ħ/2 (since spin 1/2). 

When the magnetic field is suddenly switched, the system's Hamiltonian changes. The new Hamiltonian is H = -μ · B. Since B is along Y, H = -γ S_y B. Because mu is gamma times S, so mu · B_y is gamma B S_y. So H = -gamma B S_y. 

But wait, the units might matter here. I think S has units of ħ times a dimensionless spin, so when calculating H, the units should be energy. Let me make sure. Gamma has units of (rad s^{-1} T^{-1}), because gamma is 2μ/(hbar), where μ is the magnetic moment. Hmm, maybe I don't need to get into the units right now. The main point is that the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y.

Now, the time evolution of the system is governed by this new Hamiltonian. The initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z. But the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, which doesn't commute with S_z. So the state will evolve under the new H, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

The question specifically asks about the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is ⟨mu_z⟩. But mu_z = gamma S_z. So the expectation value ⟨mu_z⟩ is gamma times ⟨S_z⟩.

Wait, but if the Hamiltonian is -gamma B S_y, then the time evolution of the state will cause the expectation value of S_z to oscillate. Hmm. Let me think about the energy levels and possible transitions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find the expectation value of S_z over time under the Hamiltonian H = -gamma B S_y. Let's model this. The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ). But since ħ is 1 in these units, it's exp(-i H t).

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the time dependence of the expectation value. The expectation value of an operator O in a state |ψ(t)⟩ is given by ⟨ψ(t)| O |ψ(t)⟩. The time derivative of this expectation value can be found using the Ehrenfest theorem, which involves the commutator of O with the Hamiltonian.

Wait, but maybe a better approach is to find the time evolution of the state |+z⟩ under the Hamiltonian H = -gamma B S_y.

The state |+z⟩ is an eigenstate of S_z, which commutes with H if H is proportional to S_y. Because [S_z, S_y] = iħ S_x. So H doesn't commute with S_z, so the state will not remain an eigenstate of S_z.

So the state will evolve, and the expectation values of S_x, S_y, S_z will change over time. But the question is about the oscillation frequency of ⟨mu_z⟩, which is gamma ⟨S_z⟩.

So let me model this. Let's first express the state as a function of time. The initial state is |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩. The time evolution is |ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-i H t) |+z⟩. 

H = - gamma B S_y. So H = -gamma B ( (ħ/2) sigma_y ), since S_y = ħ sigma_y / 2. Wait, no: S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y. So H = -gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y. Let me define H as ( -gamma B (ħ/2) ) sigma_y.

Alternatively, let me factor out the constants. Let me denote ω = gamma B. So H = - (gamma B) S_y = - (omega) S_y. But wait, S has units of ħ, so perhaps I should write H as H = - (gamma B) S_y = - (omega ħ) S_y / ħ, but maybe that's complicating it more. Let me proceed.

The energy eigenstates of H are the eigenstates of S_y. The eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2. So the eigenstates are |+y⟩ and |-y⟩, with energies E_+y = -gamma B (ħ/2), and E_-y = gamma B (ħ/2).

Wait, no: H = - gamma B S_y. So for |+y⟩, which has S_y = ħ/2, E = -gamma B (ħ/2). Similarly, |-y⟩ has S_y = -ħ/2, so E = gamma B (ħ/2).

The initial state |+z⟩ can be expressed as a linear combination of |+y⟩ and |-y⟩. Because |+z⟩ is not an eigenstate of S_y.

Expressing |+z⟩ in terms of |+y⟩ and |-y⟩. The transformation between the z and y bases can be found using rotation matrices. The states |+y⟩ and |-y⟩ are related to |+z⟩ and |−z⟩ via a rotation about the x-axis by 45 degrees, or something like that.

Alternatively, I can use the eigenstates of S_y. The state |+y⟩ can be written as (|+z⟩ + |-z⟩)/sqrt(2), and |−y⟩ as (|+z⟩ − |-z⟩)/sqrt(2). Wait, no, I think that's for the +x direction. Let me think again. To get |+y⟩, maybe it's a rotation about the x-axis by 90 degrees. Alternatively, it's a combination of |+z⟩ and |-z⟩.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the eigenstates of S_y are:

|+y⟩ = (|+z⟩ + i |−z⟩) / sqrt(2)
|-y⟩ = (|+z⟩ − i |−z⟩) / sqrt(2)

Wait, that's because rotating the spin-1/2 state by 90 degrees around the x-axis would take |+z⟩ to |+y⟩. Let me recall that the rotation operator around x by θ is R_x(θ) = exp(-i θ S_x / ħ ). For θ = π/2, R_x(π/2) would rotate |+z⟩ into |+y⟩.

Alternatively, the state |+y⟩ is (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩)/sqrt(2). Let me confirm that: because when you rotate around x by 90 degrees, the state |+z⟩ becomes (|+y⟩ + i |−y⟩)/sqrt(2)? Hmm, perhaps I should just write down the explicit forms.

Let me write |+z⟩ as a column vector (1, 0), and |+y⟩ as [0, 1] in the S_y basis. Wait, maybe it's easier to recall that the eigenstates of S_y are (1, i) and (1, -i), normalized. Because S_y is represented by a matrix with elements (iħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. The eigenvectors for S_y can be found by solving (S_y - (ħ/2) I ) |v⟩ = 0.

So, let me calculate S_y:

S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]

So for eigenvalue +ħ/2:
Equation: (S_y - (ħ/2) I ) |v⟩ = 0 →
( ( -ħ/2, ħ/2 ), ( ħ/2, -ħ/2 ) ) |v⟩ = 0

The equations are:
(-ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 = 0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvector is (v1, v1). Normalizing, (1,1)/sqrt(2).

Similarly, for eigenvalue -ħ/2, the eigenvector is (1, -1)/sqrt(2).

So |+y⟩ corresponds to (1, 1)/sqrt(2), and |-y⟩ is (1, -1)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait, that's in the computational basis where I'm representing the states as column vectors. So when expressed in the S_z basis (|+z⟩ and |-z⟩), |+y⟩ is (1/sqrt(2)) (|+z⟩ + |-z⟩ )? No, wait, because if S_y is the Pauli matrix times ħ/2, the eigenvectors would be different.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think about it again. The Pauli matrices are:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So S_x = ħ/2 σ_x, etc.

So the eigenstates of S_y must satisfy S_y |ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) σ_y |ψ⟩ = (eigenvalue) |ψ⟩.

Let me compute the eigenstates of σ_y. The matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. The eigenvalues are ±1.

The eigenvectors for eigenvalue +1 are solutions to (σ_y - I)|v⟩ = 0 → [ -1, -i; i, -1 ] |v⟩ = 0.

The equations are:
- v1 -i v2 = 0 → v1 = i v2.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to (i, 1). Normalizing gives (i, 1)/sqrt(2). But since we can multiply by a phase, this is equivalent to (1, -i)/sqrt(2), because i^2 is -1. Wait, let me see: (i,1) is the same as (i,1) multiplied by 1. If I factor out i from the first component, we get (1, -i) after normalization. Because (i,1) = i*(1, -i). So the normalized eigenvectors for σ_y are (i,1)/sqrt(2) = i*(1,-i)/sqrt(2). So |+y⟩ is (1, -i)/sqrt(2) in the S_z basis.

Wait, no. Wait, in the S_z basis, |+y⟩ would be (1, -i)/sqrt(2) multiplied by some phase? Or perhaps I need to think in terms of the spin states.

Wait, the state |+y⟩ can be written as (|+z⟩ + e^{i π/2} |-z⟩ ) / sqrt(2). Because a rotation about x by 90 degrees would take |+z⟩ to |+y⟩. The rotation operator R_x(θ) is given by exp( -i θ S_x / ħ ). For θ=π/2, R_x(π/2) |+z⟩ = |+y⟩.

Alternatively, perhaps |+y⟩ is (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩ ) / sqrt(2) ?

Let me compute R_x(π/2) applied to |+z⟩. The rotation operator R_x(θ) is:

R_x(θ) = cos(θ/2) I - i sin(θ/2) (σ_x)

For θ=π/2, cos(π/4)=sqrt(2)/2, sin(π/4)=sqrt(2)/2.

So R_x(pi/2) = (sqrt(2)/2) I - i (sqrt(2)/2) sigma_x.

sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so:

R_x(pi/2) = (1/√2) [ [1, -i], [ -i, 1 ] ]

Wait, no. Let me compute R_x(theta) correctly. R_x(theta) can be written as exp( -i theta S_x / ħ ). For spin 1/2, S_x = ħ/2 sigma_x. So theta in the exponent is theta S_x / ħ = (theta/2) sigma_x.

Thus, R_x(theta) = e^{ -i (theta/2) sigma_x }.

The expansion of this exponential for small theta is I - i (theta/2) sigma_x - (theta^2/8) sigma_x^2 + ... .

But for theta=pi/2, we can use the identity that e^{i theta N} where N^2=I, gives cos(theta) I + i sin(theta) N.

In this case, sigma_x^2 = I, so:

R_x(pi/2) = cos(pi/4) I - i sin(pi/4) sigma_x.

Which is (sqrt(2)/2) I - i (sqrt(2)/2) sigma_x.

So sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so:

R_x(pi/2) = sqrt(2)/2 * [[1, 0], [0, 1]] - i sqrt(2)/2 * [[0,1], [1,0]]

Which gives:

[[ sqrt(2)/2, -i sqrt(2)/2 ],
 [ -i sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2 ] ]

So applying R_x(pi/2) to |+z⟩ = [1, 0]^T.

The result is:

Top component: sqrt(2)/2 * 1 + (-i sqrt(2)/2 ) * 0 = sqrt(2)/2.

Bottom component: (-i sqrt(2)/2 ) * 1 + sqrt(2)/2 * 0 = -i sqrt(2)/2.

So the resulting vector is [ sqrt(2)/2 , -i sqrt(2)/2 ]^T.

We can factor out sqrt(2)/2, giving (1, -i)^T / sqrt(2).

So R_x(pi/2) |+z⟩ = (1 -i)/sqrt(2) |+y⟩ ?

Wait, no. Wait, the state |+y⟩ is the eigenstate of S_y with eigenvalue +1/2 ħ, right? So the resulting state after rotation is |+y⟩.

So |+y⟩ is (1, -i)/sqrt(2) in the S_z basis.

So in terms of |+z⟩ and |-z⟩, |+y⟩ = [1/sqrt(2)] ( |+z⟩ - i |-z⟩ ).

Similarly, |-y⟩ is [1/sqrt(2)] ( |+z⟩ + i |-z⟩ ).

So the initial state is |+z⟩. Let me express |+z⟩ in terms of |+y⟩ and |-y⟩.

Let me write |+z⟩ as a linear combination of |+y⟩ and |-y⟩.

So |+z⟩ = a |+y⟩ + b |-y⟩.

Substituting the expressions for |+y⟩ and |-y⟩.

|+y⟩ = (|+z⟩ -i |-z⟩ ) / sqrt(2)
|-y⟩ = (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩ ) / sqrt(2)

So:

|+z⟩ = a (|+z⟩ -i |-z⟩ ) / sqrt(2) + b ( |+z⟩ + i |-z⟩ ) / sqrt(2 )

Grouping terms:

|+z⟩ = [ a / sqrt(2) + b / sqrt(2) ] |+z⟩ + [ (-i a) / sqrt(2) + (i b) / sqrt(2) ] |-z⟩.

Since this must equal |+z⟩, which is 1|+z⟩ + 0 |-z⟩, the coefficients must satisfy:

a / sqrt(2) + b / sqrt(2) = 1
(-i a + i b ) / sqrt(2) = 0

From the second equation: (-i a + i b) =0 → -a + b =0 → b = a.

Substituting into the first equation: (a + a)/sqrt(2) = 1 → 2a/sqrt(2) =1 → a = sqrt(2)/2.

So a = b = sqrt(2)/2.

So |+z⟩ = (sqrt(2)/2) |+y⟩ + (sqrt(2)/2) |-y⟩.

Wait, but let's compute the coefficients again.

Wait, let me use |+z⟩ = a |+y⟩ + b |-y⟩.

Express |+y⟩ and |-y⟩ in terms of |+z⟩ and |-z⟩.

|+y⟩ = ( |+z⟩ - i |-z⟩ ) / sqrt(2)
|-y⟩ = ( |+z⟩ + i |-z⟩ ) / sqrt(2)

So |+z⟩ = a ( |+z⟩ -i |-z⟩ ) / sqrt(2) + b (|+z⟩ + i |-z⟩ ) / sqrt(2 )

= [ a ( |+z⟩ ) + b ( |+z⟩ ) ] / sqrt(2) + [ (-i a) (-z) + i b (|z⟩ ) ] ?

Wait, more carefully:

= [a/(sqrt(2)) ( |+z⟩ ) + a/(sqrt(2)) (-i) |−z⟩ ) ] 
+ [ b/(sqrt(2)) ( |+z⟩ ) + b/(sqrt(2)) (i) |−z⟩ ) ]

= [ (a + b)/(sqrt(2)) ) |+z⟩ ] 
+ [ ( -i a + i b )/(sqrt(2)) |−z⟩ ]

Since this must equal |+z⟩, which is 1 |+z⟩ + 0 |−z⟩.

So:

(a + b) / sqrt(2) = 1
( -i a + i b ) / sqrt(2) = 0

From the second equation: -i a + i b =0 → (-a + b) i =0 → -a + b=0 → b = a.

Substituting into the first equation:

( a + a ) / sqrt(2) = 1 → 2a / sqrt(2) =1 → a = sqrt(2)/2.

So |+z⟩ = (sqrt(2)/2) |+y⟩ + (sqrt(2)/2) |-y⟩.

Wait, that doesn't seem right, because when I substitute a = sqrt(2)/2, then |+z⟩ is ( |+y⟩ + |-y⟩ ) / sqrt(2) ?

Wait, no, because a = sqrt(2)/2, so |+z⟩ = a |+y⟩ + a |-y⟩ = [ |+y⟩ + |-y⟩ ] / sqrt(2).

Wait, but |+y⟩ and |-y⟩ are orthogonal. So |+z⟩ is their average. Hmm, but when you take the average of |+y⟩ and |-y⟩, you get a state that's equally in +y and -y, which would have zero expectation for S_y. But |+z⟩ has definite S_z, but zero S_x and S_y.

But according to the above, |+z⟩ is (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩ ) / sqrt(2). Hmm, but wait, when I expand |+y⟩ and |-y⟩ as ( |+z⟩ -i |−z⟩ ) / sqrt(2) and ( |+z⟩ +i |−z⟩ ) / sqrt(2), adding them gives [ ( |+z⟩ -i |−z⟩ ) + ( |+z⟩ + i |−z⟩ ) ] / sqrt(2) = [2 |+z⟩ ] / sqrt(2) → |+z⟩ = [ |+y⟩ + |-y⟩ ] / sqrt(2)

Yes, that's correct.

So the initial state |+z⟩ is written as ( |+y⟩ + |-y⟩ ) / sqrt(2).

Now, the time evolution under H = - gamma B S_y.

The energy eigenstates are |+y⟩ and |-y⟩, with energies E_+y = - gamma B (ħ/2) ?

Wait, no. H = - gamma B S_y. And S_y |+y⟩ = (ħ/2) |+y⟩. So H |+y⟩ = - gamma B * (ħ/2) |+y⟩. Thus, E_+y = - gamma B (ħ/2 )

Similarly, S_y |-y⟩ = - (ħ/2) |-y⟩ → E_-y = gamma B (ħ/2 )

So the time evolution for each state is:

|+y⟩ → exp( -i E_+y t / ħ ) |+y⟩ = exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) |+y⟩
Similarly, |-y⟩ → exp( -i E_-y t / ħ ) |-y⟩ = exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |-y⟩.

So the time-evolved state |psi(t)⟩ is:

( |+y⟩ e^{i gamma B t /2 } + |-y⟩ e^{ -i gamma B t /2 } ) / sqrt(2)

Now, let's express this back in the S_z basis.

We have |+y⟩ = ( |+z⟩ - i |−z⟩ ) / sqrt(2)
and |-y⟩ = ( |+z⟩ + i |−z⟩ ) / sqrt(2 )

So substitute these into |psi(t)⟩:

|psi(t)⟩ = [ ( |+z⟩ - i |−z⟩ ) / sqrt(2) * e^{i gamma B t /2 } 
+ ( |+z⟩ + i |−z⟩ ) / sqrt(2) * e^{ -i gamma B t /2 } ] / sqrt(2)

Simplify the denominator: 1/sqrt(2) * 1/sqrt(2) = 1/2.

So:

= [ (|+z⟩ -i |−z⟩) e^{i gamma B t/2} + (|+z⟩ + i |−z⟩) e^{-i gamma B t/2} ] / 2

Factor out |+z⟩ and |−z⟩:

= [ |+z⟩ (e^{i gamma B t/2} + e^{-i gamma B t/2}) ) 
+ |−z⟩ ( -i e^{i gamma B t/2} + i e^{-i gamma B t/2} ) ] / 2

We can write these exponentials using Euler's formula.

e^{iθ} + e^{-iθ} = 2 cosθ
e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ} = 2i sinθ.

So, for the |+z⟩ term:

e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta} = 2 cos(theta)
where theta is gamma B t /2.

For the |−z⟩ term:

- i (e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta}) ) = -i (2i sin theta) ) = 2 sin theta.

So putting it all together:

|psi(t)⟩ = [ |+z⟩ * 2 cos(theta) + |−z⟩ * 2 sin(theta) ] / 2

= |+z⟩ cos(theta) + |−z⟩ sin(theta)

where theta = (gamma B t ) / 2.

Now, the expectation value of S_z in this state is:

⟨S_z⟩ = ⟨+z | psi(t) ⟩ * (ħ/2) + ⟨−z | psi(t) ⟩ * (-ħ/2 )

Wait, no. Let me compute it correctly.

The state |psi(t)⟩ is a superposition of |+z⟩ and |−z⟩.

So the wavefunction is:

|psi(t)⟩ = cos(theta) |+z⟩ + sin(theta) |−z⟩

The expectation value ⟨S_z⟩ is:

⟨psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)⟩.

Since S_z |+z⟩ = (ħ/2) |+z⟩,
S_z |−z⟩ = (-ħ/2) |−z⟩.

So:

⟨S_z⟩ = [ cos(theta) ⟨+z | + sin(theta) ⟨−z | ] S_z [ cos(theta) |+z⟩ + sin(theta) |−z⟩ ]

= cos(theta)^2 (ħ/2) + sin(theta)^2 (-ħ/2 )

= [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ] (ħ/2 )
= (cos(2 theta)) ( ħ /2 )

So ⟨S_z⟩ = ( ħ /2 ) cos(2 theta )

But theta is (gamma B t ) / 2 → 2 theta = gamma B t.

So ⟨S_z⟩ = ( ħ/2 ) cos(gamma B t )

But wait, the question is about ⟨mu_z⟩, which is gamma times ⟨S_z⟩.

⟨mu_z⟩ = gamma * ⟨S_z⟩ = gamma * ( ħ/2 ) cos(gamma B t )

Wait, but that would make the oscillation frequency gamma B. Because the argument of the cosine is gamma B t, so the frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but wait, let me check.

The time dependence is cos( omega' t ), where omega' = gamma B.

So the oscillation frequency is omega' = gamma B.

Looking at the options, option B is gamma * B. So the frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculation.

In the expression for ⟨S_z⟩, we have:

⟨S_z⟩ = ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

So the oscillation is at frequency gamma B. So the average mu_z would be gamma times that, which is (gamma ħ/2 ) cos(gamma B t ), but the frequency of oscillation is gamma B.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the time evolution.

Wait, let's re-express theta. Earlier, I said theta = gamma B t / 2. So 2 theta = gamma B t.

But when I computed the expectation of S_z, the argument was 2 theta. So the frequency is gamma B, because cos(gamma B t ), meaning the function oscillates at frequency gamma B.

So the average of mu_z oscillates with frequency gamma B. So the answer should be option B, gamma B.

Alternatively, let's think about the energy levels and how the oscillations come from transitions between states. The energy difference between |+y⟩ and |-y⟩ is E_+y - E_-y = (-gamma B (ħ/2 )) - ( gamma B (ħ/2 )) ) = - gamma B ħ.

The energy difference is delta E = E_+y - E_-y = - gamma B ħ.

Wait, no, wait, E_+y = -gamma B (ħ/2 ), E_-y = gamma B ( ħ/2 ). So delta E = E_+y - E_-y = (-gamma B ħ/2 ) - (gamma B ħ/2 ) ) = - gamma B ħ.

The transition frequency between the two states would be delta E / ħ = (-gamma B ħ ) / ħ = - gamma B. The magnitude is gamma B, which would correspond to the oscillation frequency.

So the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which is option B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The magnetic field is then suddenly switched off and turned on along the $+y$ direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  
   - The initial state is $|+z\rangle$, an eigenstate of $S_z$.  
   - The magnetic moment is $\mu = \gamma S$, so the Hamiltonian in the $z$-direction is $H_z = -\mu_z B_z = -\gamma B S_z$.  
   - After the field is switched to the $+y$ direction, the new Hamiltonian is $H_y = -\gamma B S_y$.

2. **Time Evolution**:  
   - The initial state $|+z\rangle$ is not an eigenstate of $S_y$, so the Hamiltonian causes the state to evolve over time.  
   - The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$, with eigenvalues $\pm \hbar/2$. The initial state $|+z\rangle$ can be expressed as a superposition of $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$:  
     \[
     |+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+y\rangle + |-y\rangle \right).
     \]
   - Under the Hamiltonian $H_y = -\gamma B S_y$, the time evolution of the state is:  
     \[
     |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{-i\gamma B t / 2} |+y\rangle + e^{i\gamma B t / 2} |-y\rangle \right).
     \]

3. **Expectation Value of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$**:  
   - The $z$-component of the magnetic moment is $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$. The expectation value $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is proportional to $\langle S_z \rangle$.  
   - Substituting the time-evolved state into $\langle S_z \rangle$, it is found that:  
     \[
     \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
     \]
   - Therefore, $\langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\gamma \hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t)$.

4. **Oscillation Frequency**:  
   - The oscillation of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ arises from the $\cos(\gamma B t)$ term, which oscillates with angular frequency $\omega = \gamma B$.  
   - Thus, the oscillation frequency of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is $\gamma B$.

### Correct Option:
The oscillation frequency of the $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment is $\gamma B$. This corresponds to **option B**.

ANSWER: B
