Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit nervous because I'm still learning, but let's take it slow.

The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. Then, it's reacted through three steps with different reagents. I need to find out what the final product is from the options given.

First, let me break down the molecular formula. C8H9NO. That's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. The degree of unsaturation might help. Degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So X=0, N=1, O=1.

So plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be from a ring and some double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring (which has 3 degrees), and then some double bonds or a ring and some more.

Looking at the NMR data:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H). That's a triplet. A triplet with one proton. Could be an aldehyde proton, maybe. Because aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm.

Then, 6.98 (d, 2H). That looks like two protons as a doublet. Maybe part of a benzene ring. If it's a para-substituted ring, the ortho protons would be doublets. Wait, or maybe a substituted benzene where two protons are next to substituents.

6.51 (d, 2H): another doublet, two protons. This could be adjacent to substituents as well. Maybe this is a couple of aromatic protons in a di-substituted benzene.

6.27 (bs, 2H): broad singlet, two protons. Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like an -OH group nearby, or maybe some other situation. But two protons as a singlet. Could it be something like an allylic position or maybe vinyl protons in a conjugated system?

3.66 (d, 2H): a doublet of two protons. That's probably a CH2 group attached to something. Maybe an oxygen, like an ether or a carbonyl group. Or maybe adjacent to an oxygen, like in an enol.

Wait, putting this together. The triplet at 9.72 is probably an aldehyde. So the compound could have a CHO group.

The aromatic signals: 6.98 and 6.51 as two doublets. That sounds like a para-substituted benzene. Because in a para-substituted benzene, the two protons adjacent to the substituent would be a doublet. Wait, but two doublets each with two protons—maybe it's a di-substituted benzene, perhaps 1,4-disubstituted. So, two substituents in para positions.

Wait, let's think: for a benzene ring with substituents in para positions, each substituent would have adjacent protons. For example, in 4-substituted benzaldehyde, the ring protons would be at certain positions. Or if there are two substituents, say in the 1 and 4 positions.

Wait, looking at the NMR again. 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). So each is a doublet. So perhaps two substituents are present on the benzene ring, each causing their adjacent protons to be a doublet. So if the substituents are in the para positions, each substituent's adjacent protons would be doublets. So for a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, each substituent's adjacent Hs would be a doublet. So the 6.98 and 6.51 could be the two sets of adjacent Hs from substituents in para positions.

Wait, but then the substituents would cause each adjacent H to be a doublet. So perhaps each substituent is in a para position, and the ring has two substituents.

Alternatively, maybe it's a single substituent that's causing two sets of Hs. Hmm, not sure. Let's think about the other parts.

The 6.27 (bs, 2H) could be another set of protons. Maybe it's a vinyl group—like part of an enal or something. Because in an enal, the protons on the double bond can be a triplet or something else. Wait, but 6.27 is a singlet, broad. Broad could mean that it's exchanging, like an -OH group, but that's only two protons. Or maybe it's a conjugated system where the protons are on a chain adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, but the singlet could also be an aromatic ring with two protons, maybe in a position where they are not split by adjacent protons. But that's less likely. Alternatively, it could be an aliphatic system, like a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen or something.

Wait, the 3.66 (d, 2H) is a doublet, two protons. Maybe that's a methylene group attached to an oxygen. Like OCH2CH2... Or perhaps it's a CH2 next to a carbonyl group, like in a ketone or aldehyde.

Putting this all together, perhaps the structure is something like a benzaldehyde with substituents. Let's think about the molecular formula again: C8H9NO. Let's count the degrees of unsaturation again. 5, as I did before. So a benzene ring (3), plus a double bond (maybe the aldehyde's carbonyl, that's another one. So that would be four. So perhaps one more double bond, like an enal.

Wait, another double bond would add another degree. So maybe the molecule has a benzene ring, an aldehyde group, and a conjugated double bond.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is a di-substituted benzene with an aldehyde and an enol or something.

Wait, the reagents given are NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, then aq. KOH and heat. That's the procedure
