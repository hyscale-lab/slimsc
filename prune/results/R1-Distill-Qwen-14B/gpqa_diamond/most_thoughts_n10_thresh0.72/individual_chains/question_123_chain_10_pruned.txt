Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the motion of its ejecta. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, so that means in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s, right? Because in relative terms, if one frame sees the other moving at a certain speed, the other sees it moving at the same speed but in the opposite direction.

The problem asks: what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's reference frame? So I need to find the distance in the Galaxy's frame, but the time given is from the ejecta's perspective.

Hmm, I remember that time can dilate due to relativity when there's a relative motion between frames. Oh wait, but both are inertial frames, so special relativity applies here. So the key here is to use the time dilation formula to convert the time experienced in the ejecta's frame to the time experienced in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, but wait,
