Okay, so I've got this question in front of me about optical activity in different compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when a molecule has chirality, which means it has a stereogenic center or some kind of stereoisomerism that isn't due to a plane of symmetry or internal compensation.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to count how many are optically active. Each compound is different, so I'll tackle them one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
Hmm, okay. So the structure is a double bond between C1 and C2, with a chlorine on C1 and a methyl on C2. Wait, wait. For a molecule to have chirality, it needs a tetrahedral carbon with four different substituents. But in this case, the double bond is at position 1. Let me draw the structure.

Structure: Cl is on C1, which is double-bonded to C2 (CH2CH(CH3)), but wait, wait. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group). So C1 is Cl, double bond, C2 has CH(CH3), and then two more carbons (butene is four carbons, right?).

Wait, but the double bond is between
