Okay, I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about Klinefelter's syndrome and why its phenotypic consequences are less severe compared to Down's syndrome. Let me think this through step by step.

First, I remember that Klinefelter's syndrome occurs in males and is caused by an extra X chromosome, so the affected males have XXY instead of the usual XY. Down's syndrome, on the other hand, is caused by an extra chromosome 21, making it trisomy 21.

The question is asking why Klinefelter's syndrome has less prominent symptoms. The options are all about different molecular mechanisms. I need to figure out which mechanism underlies this difference.

I think about how these syndromes result from different types of chromosomal abnormalities. Klinefelter's is due to an extra sex chromosome, but since there are two X's in males (XXY), perhaps the presence of a normal Y chromosome might mitigate some effects. But wait, the question is about the molecular mechanism causing the less severe phenotype, not the presence of Y.

Hmm, another angle: maybe the way the chromosomes are distributed during meiosis affects the outcome. Klinefelter's is due to nondisjunction during meiosis, but so is Down's. So that's not it. Alternatively, maybe the number of chromosomes involved plays a role. Trisomy 21 is a single extra chromosome, while Klinefelter's involves two extra sex chromosomes.

Wait, in Kline
