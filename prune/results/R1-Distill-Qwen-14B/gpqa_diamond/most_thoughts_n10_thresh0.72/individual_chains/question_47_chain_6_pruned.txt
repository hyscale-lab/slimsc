Okay, so I have this problem where I need to identify a compound based on its spectral data. Let's see what I have here. The compound is C9H11NO2. The options are A, B, C, D, each a different organic compound. I'll need to analyze the IR and NMR data to figure out which structure fits.

First, the IR data. They mentioned bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are in the region for N-H or O-H stretches. Since the compound has an NO2 group, maybe it's an amide or something similar. Wait, but NO2 is a nitro group, which doesn't have N-H. Hmm, so maybe those peaks are from an amide's N-H. Amides typically show two N-H stretches, which would align with these two bands. The intensity is medium to strong, which makes sense for N-H.

Then there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's in the range for carbonyl groups, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or amide. Since there's an amide in the possible structures, maybe that's the carbonyl. Alternatively, an ester would also show around there. Let's see the options.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Benzamide has an amide group (so carbonyl), and an ethoxy group. So the IR would have N-H from the amide.

B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Formamide has a carbonyl and an N-H. The ethoxy would come from the substituent.

C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This would have an amine (N-H) and an ester (carbonyl). So the IR would show N-H and a strong carbonyl.

D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This has an ester group (so carbonyl) and an amine (N-H). So the IR would have N-H and a strong carbonyl.

Wait, the IR shows two N-H peaks. Amides typically have two peaks for N-H because of the two different hydrogen environments in the amide group. For example, in benzamide, the amide N-H would show two stretches. Alternatively, if it's a secondary amine, like in an amide, maybe that's what's happening.

But let me think about the NMR data now. The 1H NMR shows:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's a triplet, probably a CH3 group attached to something. Like an ethyl group. So maybe an ethyl ester or ethoxy group.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, 2H. Could be adjacent to an electronegative group. Maybe an OCH2 group, or maybe a methylene adjacent to an amide. Or perhaps an ethyl group attached to an oxygen, but maybe as part of an ester.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quadruplet, 2H. Quadruplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. So maybe a CH2 group next to another CH2. For example, in an ethyl ester, the CH2 attached to oxygen would be split by the adjacent CH3. Wait, but wait, in an ethyl ester, the structure is O(CH2CH3). So the OCH2 would be next to CH3, but that would typically be a triplet. Hmm, but here it's a quadruplet. Wait, maybe it's a different group. Wait, the 4.5 ppm is a quartet for 2H. So perhaps it's an OCH2 group next to another CH2 group.

Wait, another possibility: in an amide, the neighboring CH2. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl adjacent to a CH2. Let me think.

Looking at the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2
