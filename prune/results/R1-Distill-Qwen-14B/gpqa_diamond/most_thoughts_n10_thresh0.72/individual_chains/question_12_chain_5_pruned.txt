Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with particle physics yet. But I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). And the Pi(+) is at rest. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D, each giving two values which I assume are the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino.

Hmm, so I remember that in particle decays, especially when the parent is at rest, conservation of energy and momentum must hold. Also, because the neutrino is involved, which is very light, I think its rest mass is negligible compared to the others. Wait, actually, neutrinos do have mass, but in many problems, especially older ones, they might be considered massless. But I'm not sure if that applies here. Let me think.

The Pi(+) is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the products must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So, the muon and neutrino will move in opposite directions with equal magnitude of momentum. Let's denote the momentum of the muon as p and the neutrino's as p' (but since they're opposite, p' = -p). But for magnitude, they're the same.

Now, for energy: the total initial energy is the rest energy of the Pi(+) because it's stationary. So that would be m_pi * c². The rest energy of the muon is m_mu * c², and the neutrino's rest energy is negligible, so we can ignore it.

The total energy after decay is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ), and the neutrino's energy is just |p' c|, since for a massless particle, E = |p| c. But wait, neutrinos have tiny masses, but in this problem, since the Pi mass is given and the muon's, maybe the neutrino's mass is considered zero. Hmm, the problem says the rest mass of Pi and mu are given, but not for the neutrino. So perhaps for this problem, we can treat the neutrino as massless.

So the initial energy is m_pi c². The final energy is E_muon + E_neutrino.

But wait, the muon's energy is kinetic plus rest mass energy. So E_muon = K_mu + m_mu c². Similarly, E_neutrino would be its kinetic energy plus rest mass energy, but if we take rest mass as zero, then E_neutrino = K_nu.

So, putting it together: m_pi c² =
