Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, let me think. I remember from my studies that the mean decay distance of a particle is related to its lifetime and speed. Right, the formula should be something like distance = gamma * beta * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is the velocity relative to the speed of light, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, I think another approach is to calculate the mean lifetime using the particle's width. Oh right, the width Gamma is related to the lifetime by the uncertainty principle. The relation is Gamma ≈ ħ / tau, so tau ≈ ħ / Gamma. I think that's the right way to go here.

But then, since the particle is moving, we have to consider its speed. So the mean decay length is the proper lifetime multiplied by the particle's velocity and the Lorentz factor. So the formula would be L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Okay, let's break it down step by step. First, find the proper lifetime tau. Tau is hbar divided by Gamma. But wait, what's the value of Gamma here? The given width is 320 MeV. Oh, but units are important. I'll need to convert everything into compatible units.

Wait, hbar (reduced Planck constant) is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. Because when dealing with GeV units, it's convenient to use this value. So Gamma is given in MeV, so I should convert 320 MeV to GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So Gamma = 0.32 GeV. Then tau = hbar / Gamma. Let me plug the numbers in. So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV. Let me calculate that: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is about 2.056875e-24 s.

Next, I need to find beta and gamma. For that, I should find the velocity beta (v/c) and the Lorentz factor gamma. The Lorentz factor is gamma = E / (m c²), but since the energy is given as E_X = 8 GeV, and mass m_X = 1.2 GeV/c², we can compute gamma.

Wait, the mass is in GeV, but actually, when calculating gamma, I think it's E = gamma m c². So gamma = E/(m c²). But since we're working with units where c=1 in these energy terms, gamma is just E / m.

So E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.66666667. Approximately 6.6667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) because beta = v/c and beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)). So let me compute that. 1/gamma squared is (1/6.6667)^2 ≈ (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1
