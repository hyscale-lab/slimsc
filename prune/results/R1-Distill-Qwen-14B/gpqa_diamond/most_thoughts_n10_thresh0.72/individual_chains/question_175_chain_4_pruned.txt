Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electromagnetism, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that there's an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power radiated per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and the angle theta. The maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and also a possible form of f.

The options are A, B, C, D with different fractions and dependencies on lambda. Let me break this down.

First, I remember that when charges oscillate, they radiate electromagnetic waves. The radiation pattern depends on the symmetry of the charge distribution. Since this is a spheroid along the z-axis, it's probably dipole-like. Wait, a dipole antenna has a radiation pattern that's maximum in the plane perpendicular to the axis. So for a dipole, the radiation is strongest in the equatorial plane (theta = 90 degrees), and the intensity falls off as cos(theta)^2 or something like that.

Wait, no, the radiation pattern for a dipole is given by the formula. I think the power radiated per unit solid angle (the radiation intensity) for a dipole is proportional to (1/(lambda^2)) or something like that. Oh wait, the formula is usually I = ( (μ0 * p^2 ω^4 ) / ( 12 π c^3 ) ) * ( sin^2(theta) ) ), where p is the dipole moment. So the maximum occurs at theta = 90 degrees, where sin(theta) is 1. So the intensity is maximum there.

But wait, the question is about the fraction of the maximum power A that's radiated at theta=30 degrees. So, let's think about the angular dependence. The radiation pattern for a dipole is proportional to sin^2(theta). So the maximum is at 90 degrees, and the intensity decreases as theta approaches 0 or 180 degrees.

So for any theta, the fraction would be (sin^2(theta)) / (maximum sin^2(theta)). The maximum is when theta is 90, so sin(90)=1. So the fraction is sin^2(theta).

Wait, but the question is about the fraction of the maximum power A. So when theta is 30 degrees, sin(theta) is 0.5, so sin squared is 0.25. So the fraction is 0.25, which is 1/4. That would imply that the correct fraction is 1/4.

Wait, but wait. The question isn't about the intensity distribution but the power per unit solid angle. So the maximum at theta_max is A. So the power at theta is (sin^2(theta)) * A / (maximum). Since the maximum is 1, then at theta=30, the fraction is 1/4.

So the fraction is 1/4. Now, looking at the options, which ones have 1/4 as the fraction?

Option B: 1/4, lambda^-3
