Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Titanium (Ti) in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The task is to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Angstroms. And they assume the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm. Okay, let's break this down.

First, what's the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels? I remember that in LTE, the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2 - E1)/(k*T)), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, when the star has spots, the effective temperature decreases. So when the star has spots, Teff is 5500 K, whereas without spots, it's 6000 K. But wait, how exactly does the presence of spots affect the photospheric temperature? Oh, wait, the spots are cooler regions, so when 40% of the surface is covered, the overall effective temperature is lower. But how does that affect the photosphere as a whole?

Wait, but the question is about the photosphere. So when spots are present, the average temperature of the photosphere would be lower. So the problem is considering the photosphere's overall temperature when spots are present, not just the spots themselves.

Wait, but the star's photosphere is at a certain temperature,
