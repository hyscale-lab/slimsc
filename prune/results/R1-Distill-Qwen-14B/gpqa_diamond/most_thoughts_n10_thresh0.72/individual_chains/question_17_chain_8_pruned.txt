Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They've given me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The options are A to D, with various concentrations.

Hmm, okay. I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The formation constant (Kf) is a measure of the stability of the complex. The higher the Kf, the more stable the complex. So in this case, the Ca-EDTA complex is pretty stable since 5e10 is a huge number.

Wait, the problem says the solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But the question is about the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. Oh right, because EDTA binds to Ca²+ and forms a complex. So the free Ca²+ concentration would be really low if the complex is stable.

I think the formula I need is the one for the formation of a complex. The general equation for EDTA complexes is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The formation constant Kf is given by Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in this case, the solution is 0.02 M of Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M. Let's denote CaEDTA as C for simplicity. So [C] = 0.02 M.

The problem is to find [Ca²+], the concentration of free calcium ions.

The Kf equation is 5e10 = (0.02) / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in solution, EDTA exists in different protonated forms depending on the pH. However, the question says the pH is ideal, which I think means that almost all the EDTA is in the form that can bind to Ca²+. So maybe we can assume that all the EDTA is available as Y^4- (the deprotonated form), or perhaps that the concentration of Y^4- is much higher than other forms? Or wait, perhaps the solution is such that the fraction of EDTA that is Y^4- is 1, so alpha_Y is 1. I'm a bit confused about that, but maybe for this problem, we can ignore other forms and take [EDTA^4-] as the same as the free EDTA concentration.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The total EDTA in solution is the sum of all its forms, but the formation constant Kf depends on the concentration of Y^4- and the metal
