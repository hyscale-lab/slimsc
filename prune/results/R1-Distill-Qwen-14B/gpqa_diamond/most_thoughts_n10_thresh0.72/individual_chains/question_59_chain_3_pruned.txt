Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm just starting to learn about pH calculations. But let's take it step by step.

The problem is: I have a solution made by mixing three different solutions. I need to find the pH of the final mixture. The three solutions are:
1. 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (which is acetic acid, a weak acid)
2. 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid)
3. 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (a strong base)

I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. Also, since some are strong and others are weak, I need to think about how they react.

First, I should probably find out the total moles of H+ from the acids and the total moles of OH- from the base, then see what happens when they mix.

Let's start with each solution separately.

1. For CH3COOH:
Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 liters. Molarity is 0.1 M, so moles = M * V = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Since it's a weak acid, it won't dissociate completely, but I'll consider it as contributing 0.05 moles of H+ (though actually, it's a bit less because it's not fully ionized, but maybe in this case, since it's mixed with strong acids and bases, the weak acid's contribution might be negligible compared to the strong ones. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should account for it.)

Wait, no. Wait. Wait a minute. Wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it will completely dissociate, meaning all its H+ will be available. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will give OH- ions. So, the reactions between H+ and OH- will occur first, and then any excess H+ or OH- will determine the pH.

So maybe I should calculate the total H+ and OH- from all solutions, find out which is in excess, then compute the pH based on that.

Let me calculate each part.

First, HCl: 400 mL is 0.4 L. Molarity 0.2 M. Moles HCl = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. Since HCl is strong, it gives 0.08 moles of H+.

CH3COOH: 0.05 moles of CH3COOH. Since it's a weak acid, it's not going to contribute as much as HCl. But wait, when you mix all the solutions, the H+ from CH3COOH is going to react with OH- from the base? Or maybe the OH- will react with both the H+ from HCl and the CH3COOH. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

But wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it will give all H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it'll give all OH- ions.

So, let's compute the total H+ and OH-.

H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

H+ from CH3COOH: Since it's a weak acid, the actual H+ it contributes is less than 0.05 moles. But when mixed with a strong base, the OH- will react with the H+ from all sources. So maybe I need to consider the total H+ from all sources and the OH- from the base.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the total moles of H+ and the total moles of OH-, then see which is in excess. The remaining H+ or OH- will determine the pH.

So, let's compute all H+ and OH-:

Total H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. HCl gives 0
