Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these acid-base calculations. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about determining the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂. Oh boy, that sounds like a lot, but I think I can handle it.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So maybe I should figure out the total moles of H+ and OH- ions in the mixture. Because if they have a neutralization reaction, it'll affect the pH.

Let me write down each component's contribution. 

Starting with the acetic acid (CH3COOH). It's a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. But for this problem, I think I need to find the total moles of H+ it contributes. Wait, no, maybe it's better to think in moles, considering the volume and concentration.

So for each solution:

1. For CH3COOH:
Molarity (M) = moles/volume(L)
Moles = M * volume(L)
Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. So moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

2. For HCl:
HCl is a strong acid, so it will fully dissociate into H+ and Cl- ions. The volume is 400 mL = 0.4 L. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. Since each HCl gives one H+, that's 0.08 moles of H+.

3. For Ba(OH)₂:
Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba²+ and 2 OH⁻ ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)₂ gives 2 moles of OH-.
Volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)₂. So OH- moles = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but wait a second. When you mix an acid and a base, they'll react. So the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base.

So total H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid. So the H+ from it won't all be available for neutralization. Hmm, that complicates things. Because when we mix the solutions, the strong acid and strong base will react first, and then the weak acid might contribute.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to calculate the total H+ and OH- in the mixture before considering the neutralization.

Wait, but no. Let me think again. The strong acid (HCl) will donate H+ ions, the strong base (
