Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these acid-base calculations. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about determining the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂. Oh boy, that sounds like a lot, but I think I can handle it.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So maybe I should figure out the total moles of H+ and OH- ions in the mixture. Because if they have a neutralization reaction, it'll affect the pH.

Let me write down each component's contribution. 

Starting with the acetic acid (CH3COOH). It's a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. But for this problem, I think I need to find the total moles of H+ it contributes. Wait, no, maybe it's better to think in moles, considering the volume and concentration.

So for each solution:

1. For CH3COOH:
Molarity (M) = moles/volume(L)
Moles = M * volume(L)
Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. So moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

2. For HCl:
HCl is a strong acid, so it will fully dissociate into H+ and Cl- ions. The volume is 400 mL = 0.4 L. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. Since each HCl gives one H+, that's 0.08 moles of H+.

3. For Ba(OH)₂:
Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba²+ and 2 OH⁻ ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)₂ gives 2 moles of OH-.
Volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)₂. So OH- moles = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but wait a second. When you mix an acid and a base, they'll react. So the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base.

So total H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid. So the H+ from it won't all be available for neutralization. Hmm, that complicates things. Because when we mix the solutions, the strong acid and strong base will react first, and then the weak acid might contribute.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to calculate the total H+ and OH- in the mixture before considering the neutralization.

Wait, but no. Let me think again. The strong acid (HCl) will donate H+ ions, the strong base (

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm just starting to learn about pH calculations. But let's take it step by step.

The problem is: I have a solution made by mixing three different solutions. I need to find the pH of the final mixture. The three solutions are:
1. 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (which is acetic acid, a weak acid)
2. 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid)
3. 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (a strong base)

I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. Also, since some are strong and others are weak, I need to think about how they react.

First, I should probably find out the total moles of H+ from the acids and the total moles of OH- from the base, then see what happens when they mix.

Let's start with each solution separately.

1. For CH3COOH:
Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 liters. Molarity is 0.1 M, so moles = M * V = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Since it's a weak acid, it won't dissociate completely, but I'll consider it as contributing 0.05 moles of H+ (though actually, it's a bit less because it's not fully ionized, but maybe in this case, since it's mixed with strong acids and bases, the weak acid's contribution might be negligible compared to the strong ones. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should account for it.)

Wait, no. Wait. Wait a minute. Wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it will completely dissociate, meaning all its H+ will be available. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will give OH- ions. So, the reactions between H+ and OH- will occur first, and then any excess H+ or OH- will determine the pH.

So maybe I should calculate the total H+ and OH- from all solutions, find out which is in excess, then compute the pH based on that.

Let me calculate each part.

First, HCl: 400 mL is 0.4 L. Molarity 0.2 M. Moles HCl = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. Since HCl is strong, it gives 0.08 moles of H+.

CH3COOH: 0.05 moles of CH3COOH. Since it's a weak acid, it's not going to contribute as much as HCl. But wait, when you mix all the solutions, the H+ from CH3COOH is going to react with OH- from the base? Or maybe the OH- will react with both the H+ from HCl and the CH3COOH. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

But wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it will give all H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it'll give all OH- ions.

So, let's compute the total H+ and OH-.

H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

H+ from CH3COOH: Since it's a weak acid, the actual H+ it contributes is less than 0.05 moles. But when mixed with a strong base, the OH- will react with the H+ from all sources. So maybe I need to consider the total H+ from all sources and the OH- from the base.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the total moles of H+ and the total moles of OH-, then see which is in excess. The remaining H+ or OH- will determine the pH.

So, let's compute all H+ and OH-:

Total H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. HCl gives 0
