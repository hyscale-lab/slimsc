Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Let me break it down step by step. 

The question is about the operator P, which has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The direction is along an arbitrary unit vector n in the x-z plane. So, n would have components (n_x, 0, n_z), since it's in the x-z plane, meaning the y-component is zero.

Wait, the operator we're considering is the vector operator P, which is a vector made of these components. So the operator P would be P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z, since the y-component of n is zero. Because the eigenvector is for the operator along n, which is an arbitrary direction in x-z plane.

The eigenvalue given is +ħ/2. So, we're looking for the eigenvector |+> such that P |+> = (ħ/2)|+>.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the operator is P, which is a vector operator. So the operator in the direction n is P·n̂. So the operator is P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Let me write down each component matrix:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So the operator P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z (since n is in x-z, n_y=0). Substituting the matrices:

P·n = (ħ/2) [n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute that matrix. Let's see:

So each element will be:

Top-left: (n_x * 0) + (n_z * 1) = n_z

Top-right: (n_x * 1) + (n_z * 0) = n_x

Bottom-left: (n_x *1) + n_z *0 = n_x

Bottom-right: (n_x *0) + n_z * (-1) = -n_z

So the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

Hmm, okay, so the operator matrix is:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

We're looking for eigenvectors of this matrix corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue equation is:

( P·n ) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

So substituting the matrix, we have:

( (ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] ) * |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

I can factor out (ħ/2) from both sides. So:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] * |v> = |v>

So the matrix equation is:

n_z v_x + n_x v_y = v_x

n_x v_x - n_z v_y = v_y

Wait, because when you multiply the matrix by vector (v_x, v_y), you get components:

Top component: (n_z v_x) + (n_x v_y) = v_x

Bottom component: (n_x v_x) + (-n_z v_y) = v_y

So let me write these equations:

1. n_z v_x + n_x v_y = v_x

2. n_x v_x - n_z v_y = v_y

I'll rearrange each equation.

Equation 1: (n_z -1) v_x + n_x v_y = 0

Equation 2: n_x v_x + (-n_z -1) v_y = 0

So we have a system of two equations:

(n_z -1) v_x + n_x v_y = 0      ...(1)

n_x v_x + (-n_z -1) v_y = 0    ...(2)

We can write this in matrix form to find non-trivial solutions (since eigenvectors can't be zero).

| (n_z -1)   n_x        |   |v_x|   = 0
| n_x      (-n_z -1) |   |v_y|

The determinant of this matrix must be zero for non-trivial solutions.

So determinant D = (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) - (n_x)^2 = 0

Let me compute D:

(n_z -1)(-n_z -1) = (-n_z^2 -n_z + n_z +1) )= (-n_z^2 +1) 

So D = (-n_z^2 +1) - n_x^2 = 0

Which simplifies to: (1 - n_z² - n_x²) = 0

But since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² =1.

So 1 - n_z² - n_x² = 0 → 1 - (n_x² +n_z^2) )= 1-1=0 → D=0, which is consistent.

So we have an eigenvalue equation, and the eigenvectors can be found from the equations.

Let me solve equation (1):

(n_z -1) v_x + n_x v_y = 0 → v_y = [ (1 - n_z) / n_x ] v_x   [assuming n_x ≠ 0]

Wait, but n is a unit vector in x-z plane, so n_x can be zero (if direction is along z), but let me proceed.

So let's express v_y in terms of v_x.

v_y = [ (1 - n_z) / n_x ] v_x

Let me plug this into equation (2):

n_x v_x + (-n_z -1) v_y = 0

Substitute v_y:

n_x v_x + (-n_z -1) [ (1 - n_z)/n_x v_x ] = 0

Multiply both sides by n_x to eliminate denominator:

n_x² v_x + (-n_z -1)(1 - n_z) v_x = 0

Factor out v_x:

[ n_x^2 + (-n_z -1)(1 - n_z) ] v_x =0

Compute the term in brackets:

Expand (-n_z -1)(1 - n_z) = (-n_z)(1) + (-n_z)(-n_z) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(-n_z)

= -n_z + n_z² -1 + n_z

Simplify: (-n_z +n_z) cancels. So left with n_z² -1.

So term becomes: n_x^2 + (n_z^2 -1) 

But since n_x² +n_z^2=1, n_z^2 =1 -n_x^2.

Substituting:

n_x^2 + ( (1 -n_x^2) -1 ) = n_x^2 + ( -n_x^2 ) =0.

So the term is zero, so equation holds.

Thus, from equation (1), v_y = [ (1-n_z)/n_x ] v_x.

So the eigenvector is proportional to (v_x, (1-n_z)/n_x v_x )

Let me denote v_x = a, then v_y = [ (1-n_z)/n_x ] a.

So the eigenvector is a*(1, (1-n_z)/n_x )

But since it's a vector, I can write it as (1, (1-n_z)/n_x )

But since we're looking for the normalized eigenvector, I need to compute the normalization factor.

The normalization condition is |v_x|^2 + |v_y|^2 =1.

So |1|^2 + | (1-n_z)/n_x |^2 =1 + [(1-n_z)^2]/n_x^2 =1.

Wait, let's compute this:

1 + [(1-n_z)^2]/n_x^2 = [n_x^2 + (1-n_z)^2 ] /n_x^2 =1.

Wait, that implies [n_x^2 + (1-n_z)^2 ] = n_x^2 → (1 -n_z)^2=0 → n_z=1.

Hmm, that's only possible if n_z=1, which would be the +z direction. But since n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, that approach can't be right. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the normalization more carefully. Let me compute the normalization factor.

The vector is (v_x, v_y) = (a, (1-n_z)/n_x * a )

So the normalization is |a|^2 ( |v_x|^2 + |v_y|^2 ) = |a|^2 [1 + ( (1 -n_z)^2 ) / (n_x^2) ) ] =1.

So |a|^2 [ (n_x^2 + (1-n_z)^2 ) / n_x^2 ) ] =1.

So |a|^2 = [n_x^2 ] / [n_x^2 + (1 -n_z)^2 ]

Which can be written as |a|^2 = n_x^2 / D, where D is the denominator.

But since n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1, (1 -n_z)^2 = (1 - 2n_z + n_z^2 ) = (2(1 -n_z) - (n_x^2)) )

Wait, perhaps there's a better way. Let me compute D = n_x^2 + (1 -n_z)^2.

Which is n_x^2 + (1 - 2n_z +n_z^2 )

= (n_x^2 +n_z^2 ) +1 -2n_z 

= 1 +1 -2n_z = 2(1 -n_z )

Since n_x² +n_z² =1.

So D = 2(1 -n_z )

Thus, |a|^2 = n_x^2 / [2(1-n_z) ]

Wait, but (1 -n_z) is the same as (1 -n_z) = 2 sin²(theta/2), where theta is the polar angle from +z axis. But perhaps that's getting ahead of myself.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the normalized eigenvector. So:

The vector is (v_x, v_y) = (a, (1-n_z)/n_x *a )

The normalization factor is a = 1 / sqrt( 1 + [ (1-n_z)^2 /n_x^2 ] )

So, a = n_x / sqrt( n_x^2 + (1-n_z)^2 )

But since D = n_x^2 + (1-n_z)^2 =2(1-n_z), this becomes a =n_x / sqrt(2(1-n_z) )

So the normalized eigenvector is:

( n_x / sqrt(2(1-n_z)) , (1-n_z)/n_x * n_x / sqrt(2(1-n_z)) )

Simplify the second component: (1-n_z)/n_x * (n_x / sqrt(... )) → (1-n_z)/sqrt(2(1-n_z)) ) → sqrt( (1-n_z)/2 )

Wait, let me compute each component:

v_x = a = n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z) )

v_y = [ (1-n_z)/n_x ] * a → [ (1-n_z)/n_x ] * [n_x / sqrt(2(1-n_z)) ) ] = (1-n_z) / sqrt(2(1-n_z) )

Which simplifies to sqrt( (1-n_z)/2 ), because (1-n_z) / sqrt(2(1-n_z)) ) = sqrt( (1-n_z) ) * sqrt( (1-n_z) ) / sqrt(2(1-n_z)) ) → sqrt( (1-n_z)/2 )

So the normalized eigenvector is:

( n_x / sqrt(2(1-n_z)) , sqrt( (1-n_z)/2 ) )

Hmm, but what's the relation between n_x and n_z? Since n is a unit vector in x-z, n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1.

Let me express n_x in terms of an angle. Let's say that the direction n makes an angle theta from the +z axis. So, n_z = cos(theta), n_x = sin(theta).

Wait, wait. No, I think in spherical coordinates, usually theta is the angle from the +z axis, so n_z = cos(theta), n_x = sin(theta) cos(phi), n_y = sin(theta) sin(phi). But in this case, since n is in the x-z plane, phi is 0 or pi, because y-component is zero. So n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta).

Wait, more accurately, when in the x-z plane, the direction can be parameterized by theta, the angle from the +z axis. So n_z = cos(theta), n_x = sin(theta), and n_y=0.

So substituting n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta).

Let me plug these into the eigenvector components.

v_x = n_x / sqrt( 2(1 -n_z) )

= sin(theta) / sqrt( 2(1 - cos(theta)) )

1 - cos(theta) is 2 sin^2(theta/2), so:

= sin(theta) / sqrt( 2 * 2 sin^2(theta/2) )

= sin(theta) / sqrt(4 sin^2(theta/2) )

= sin(theta) / [ 2 sin(theta/2) ]

But sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2), so:

= [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [ 2 sin(theta/2) ]

= cos(theta/2 )

Similarly, the second component v_y is sqrt( (1-n_z)/2 )

= sqrt( (1 - cos(theta) ) / 2 )

= sqrt( 2 sin^2(theta/2) / 2 )

= sin(theta/2 )

So the normalized eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Wait, but wait. Let me check the signs. Because the eigenvector I found is for eigenvalue +ħ/2. What about the possible phase factors? Well, since the eigenvectors can be multiplied by a phase, but the problem asks for the elements, so we can write them in terms of theta.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), which matches what I've got. 

Wait, options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Yes, that's exactly what I have. So the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the spin-up state along z is usually (1,0), which corresponds to theta=0. So theta would be the polar angle from +z. So for spin-up along direction n, which is at angle theta from +z, the eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)} ), but since in our case, n is in x-z plane, phi=0. So the second component is sin(theta/2), not multiplied by e^{i phi}, because phi is zero.

Wait, but wait in the problem statement, the question says the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi=0 or pi, but since the eigenvector is for +hbar/2, perhaps phi doesn't matter. But for the given options, looking at option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which doesn't match. 

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I have, but without any phase.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the operator is given as P, which is the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. So the eigenvectors are spin-up and spin-down states along direction n. 

So the spin-up state along direction n (theta measured from +z) is (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ), but in our case, phi is zero because n is in x-z plane, so the second component is sin(theta/2). Thus, the eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

Wait, but looking again at the problem statement, the eigenvector is for the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So yes, that's correct.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each of which is a $2 \times 2$ matrix multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so it can be parameterized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{n}$ and the $+z$ axis.

### Step 1: Construct the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$
The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is given by:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z
\]
Substituting the given components of $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$:
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}
\]
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \right)
\]
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 2: Solve the eigenvalue equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \right) \begin{bmatrix} v_x \\ v_y \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} v_x \\ v_y \end{bmatrix}
\]
Substituting the matrix for $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$:
\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} v_x \\ v_y \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} v_x \\ v_y \end{bmatrix}
\]
Dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} v_x \\ v_y \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} v_x \\ v_y \end{bmatrix}
\]

This leads to the system of equations:
\[
\cos\theta \, v_x + \sin\theta \, v_y = v_x
\]
\[
\sin\theta \, v_x - \cos\theta \, v_y = v_y
\]

### Step 3: Solve for the eigenvector
From the first equation:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1) v_x + \sin\theta \, v_y = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad v_y = \frac{1 - \cos\theta}{\sin\theta} v_x
\]

Substituting $v_y$ into the second equation confirms consistency. The eigenvector is proportional to:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} v_x \\ v_y \end{bmatrix} = v_x \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \frac{1 - \cos\theta}{\sin\theta} \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 4: Normalize the eigenvector
The normalization condition is:
\[
|v_x|^2 + |v_y|^2 = 1
\]
Substituting $v_y = \frac{1 - \cos\theta}{\sin\theta} v_x$:
\[
|v_x|^2 \left( 1 + \left( \frac{1 - \cos\theta}{\sin\theta} \right)^2 \right) = 1
\]
Using the trigonometric identity $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$:
\[
1 + \left( \frac{2\sin^2(\theta/2)}{2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)} \right)^2 = 1 + \tan^2(\theta/2) = \sec^2(\theta/2)
\]
Thus:
\[
|v_x|^2 \sec^2(\theta/2) = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad |v_x| = \cos(\theta/2)
\]
\[
|v_y| = \sin(\theta/2)
\]

The normalized eigenvector is:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The normalized eigenvector matches **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.

Answer: C
