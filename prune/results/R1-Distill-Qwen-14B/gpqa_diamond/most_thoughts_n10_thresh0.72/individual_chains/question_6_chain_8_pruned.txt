Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a certain potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, right, so I need to analyze this and figure out what the energy levels look like.

Wait, I remember that in two-dimensional problems, especially with polar coordinates, the potential can sometimes be separable into radial and angular parts. Oh, right, because if the potential is a function of r and θ but doesn't mix them in a complicated way, you can separate the Schrödinger equation into radial and angular parts.

So let me think about how to approach this. The potential given is V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. I can factor out r²: V(r,θ) = kr² [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ]. Wait, 1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ. Let me compute that: 1/2 + 3/2 cos²θ = (1 + 3 cos²θ)/2. Oh, but wait, alternatively, I can see that 1/2 is 1/(2) and 3/2 cos²θ is another term. Maybe it's better to write it as V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ = kr² [ (1/2) + (3/2) cos²θ ].

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier if I write this as V(r) plus a term that depends on cos²θ. So V(r) would be (1/2)kr², and the other term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ.

Wait, but in terms of separation of variables, maybe I can treat this as a sum of two potentials. Or perhaps a sum of terms that are each separable. Let me think about the form of the potential.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this potential as a function of r and θ, but in a way that allows me to separate the variables. Since the potential has terms
