Okay, so I've got this problem about spins and the partition function. Hmm, let me try to think through this. Alright, the system consists of three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J (S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3). I need to find the partition function Z. 

Wait, the partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-β E), right? Oh wait, no, wait. The partition function Z is the sum of exp(-β E_i) for each state i. So I need to consider all possible configurations of the three spins and calculate E for each, then sum the exponentials.

But wait, with three spins each having two possible states, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. That's manageable. Let me list all possible S1, S2, S3 combinations and compute E for each. 

So each S can be +1 or -1. Let's make a table.

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
   E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J (3) = -3J

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
   E = -J [1*1 +1*(-1) +1*(-1)] = -J [1 -1 -1] = -J (-1) = J

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
   E = -J [1*(-1) +1*1 + (-1)*1 ] = -J [ -1 +1 -1 ] = -J (-1) = J

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
   E = -J [ (-1)(1) +1*(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [ -1 -1 +1 ] = -J (-1) = J

Wait, wait, let me recalculate that. No, S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

S1 S2 = (+1)(-1) = -1.

S1 S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1.

S2 S3 = (-1)(-1) = +1.

So sum is (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, no. Because E is negative J times the sum. Oh right, E = -J (sum of the products). So sum is (-1-1+1) = -1. Multiply by -J gives E = J.

Hmm.

Continuing:

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
   S1 S2 = (-1)(+1) = -1.

   S1 S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1.

   S2 S3 = (+1)(+1)= +1.

   Sum: (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.

   E = -J*(-1) = J.

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1
   S1 S2 = (-1)(+1) = -1.

   S1 S3 = (-1)(-1) = +1.

   S2 S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1.

   Sum: (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1.

   E = -J*(-1) = J.

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1
   S1 S2 = (-1)(-1)= +1.

   S1 S3 = (-1)(+1)= -1.

   S2 S3 = (-1)(+1)= -1.

   Sum: 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.

   E = -J*(-1) = J.

8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1
   S1 S2 = (+1), S1 S3= (+1), S2 S3= (+1). Sum is 3.

   E = -J*(3) = -3J.

Wait, so looking at all 8 states:

- How many have E = -3J? Only the all +1 and all -1 states. So two states.

- The other six states each have E = J.

So each of the two states contributes e^{β * (3J)} because E is -3J. So the exponential is exp(-β E) which would be exp(-β*(-3J)) = exp(3 J β).

Wait, wait, no. Because the
