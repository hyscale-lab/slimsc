Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying an unknown compound using its FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. Let me break down the information given and try to figure it out step by step.

First, the FTIR data: there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. But wait, another peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. That's a strong one, so maybe a carbonyl group. I think the 1700 region is typical for a carbonyl, like a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. But since there's a broad peak at 3000, that might suggest an -OH group as in a carboxylic acid. So the compound probably has a carboxylic acid functional group because that explains both the broad O-H stretch and the carbonyl peak.

Now, looking at the NMR data: the 1H NMR shows several peaks, none of which are vinyl hydrogens. So that means there are no double bonds or aromatic rings with adjacent hydrogens. So structures with any double bonds can probably be ruled out, but wait, looking at the options, I don't see any with double bonds. Hmm, maybe I got that right.

In the NMR, one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. That's a bit complicated. Let me think about splitting patterns. Each splitting indicates coupling with neighboring protons. So a doublet of triplets probably means that the proton is next to two different sets of equivalent protons. For example, maybe each adjacent group has a different number of Hs. Or maybe it's a more complex splitting due to being near multiple nonequivalent protons.

Wait, the splitting can also be due to vicinal coupling (J coupling between adjacent Hs). So if a proton is next to two different groups, each with their own J values, you could get more complex splitting. But I'm not entirely sure about that. Maybe I can think about the structure of the options and see which one fits.

Looking at the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
So the structure is something like CH3-C*(H)(C2H5)-C*(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So each C* has a CH and two ethyl groups attached. Then a CH2 and a COOH group.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
Here, the structure is CH3CH2-C*(H)(C2H5)-C*(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So each C* has a CH and one ethyl and maybe another ethyl?

Wait, maybe I should draw this out mentally. I'll imagine the molecular structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the two central carbons each have CH groups attached to two ethyl groups. Then, the CH2COOH is in some other position.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
So each C* has a CH and two methyl groups. Then, a CH2COOH.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH
So CH3CH2-C*(H)(CH3)-C*(H)(CH3)-COOH. So each C* has a CH and a methyl group.

Wait, the FTIR suggests a carboxylic acid, so all options have a COOH group. So the main difference is in the structure around that.

Now, the NMR: no vinyl Hs, so no problem there. The key is the splitting patterns.

In the NMR, each proton's environment determines its splitting.
