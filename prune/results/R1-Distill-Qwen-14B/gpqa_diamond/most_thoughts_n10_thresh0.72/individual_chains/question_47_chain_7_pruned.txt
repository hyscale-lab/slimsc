Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out which compound matches the given spectroscopic data. Let me take it step by step.

The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation first. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. So, substituting in: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2. So 20-11=9, plus 1 is 10. 10/2 is 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That usually corresponds to five rings or double bonds. Since it's a molecule, probably a benzene ring (which is three degrees), plus maybe some double bonds and an amide or ester group.

Now, looking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are likely N-H stretches, but wait, the amide N-H would be around 3300-3500. But given that the bands are medium to strong, maybe they're from more than one set of N-H groups. Wait, but in the options, I see amines and amides. Also, the strong band at 1720 cm-1 is a carbonyl group. Could be ester, amide, ketone, or maybe a conjugated carbonyl. But looking at the options, they have ester, amide, etc.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H: That's probably a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group attached to something. So maybe an ethyl ester or ethoxy group.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H: Hmm, broad singlet suggests maybe an NH group, but wait, 2H. Alternatively, it could be an OCH2 group, but then why would it be a singlet? Or maybe an NCH2 group? Or perhaps it's an -OCH2CO- group, like in an ester.

Wait, another thought: the broad singlet at 4.0 could be an NH2 group, but that's usually split into multiple peaks unless it's a singlet. Or perhaps it's an amide NH. Wait, but amide NH tends to be around 7-8 ppm, but in some cases, maybe not. Also, the 4.0 ppm region is more typical of OCH2 or maybe CH2 groups attached to electronegative atoms.

Wait, looking at the options. Let's check each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at the 3 position. Benzamide is PhCONH2. But the substituent is ethoxy, so the benzamide has OCH2CH3 attached at position 3. So the IR should show N-H stretch for the amide. The NMR would have the ethoxy group as triplet at 1.2 (as CH2CH3). Then, the amide NH would be... but in the NMR given, there's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm for 2H. Wait, maybe in this compound, the NH groups are present. But in benzamide, the NH2 is usually broad in the NMR, but in this case, the data shows a singlet at 4.0. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is at position 3, so in the NMR, the OCH2CH3 would be triplet around 1.20, and the neighboring CH2O would be quartet around 4.5? But in the NMR, I see 4.5 ppm as quartet with 2H. Let me think.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONHR, but here it's substituted. So the structure is CH3O-C6H4-NH-C(=O)-H. Wait, no, wait: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would be Ph-OCH2CH3 at 4 position, and the formamide group is HCONH-Ph-OCH2CH3. So the formamide has an NH group. The IR would have amide N-H stretch. The formamide's carbonyl would be around 1720, which matches. The ethoxy group would give triplet at 1.20, and the OCH2 would be a quartet at around 4.5? But in the NMR, I see 4.0 ppm (bs,
