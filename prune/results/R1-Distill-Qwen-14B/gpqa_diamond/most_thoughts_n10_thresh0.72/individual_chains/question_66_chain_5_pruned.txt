Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT (Standard Model Effective Field Theory). Hmm, let me think. I remember from my studies that SMEFT is a framework where you add higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model to account for beyond the Standard Model physics.

Wait, the question is about which symmetries all operators must respect. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. Let me break this down.

First, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetries? Lorentz symmetry includes rotations and boosts, while Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz plus translations (like spacetime translations). Oh right, so if an operator respects Poincare, it must also respect Lorentz symmetry because Poincare is a bigger symmetry group. So if an operator doesn't respect Lorentz, it won't respect Poincare either.

But wait, do all SMEFT operators respect Poincare? I think SMEFT is constructed in a way that maintains the symmetries of the Standard Model. The Standard Model has Poincare symmetry, so SMEFT operators should be built respecting that. So operators must respect Poincare, which implies they must respect Lorentz.

Next, what about CP and CPT symmetry? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. CP is Charge conjugation combined with Parity. CPT is Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. I remember that the Standard Model respects CPT symmetry, but not necessarily CP. For example, CP violation is observed in certain processes.

Wait, but in SMEFT, do the operators have to respect any of these? I think that depending on the operator, they might or might not. For instance, some operators could violate CP. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators.

In the Standard Model, CPT is a symmetry, so SMEFT should maintain that. Because you can't have a theory that doesn't respect CPT if the SM does. So all SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry. What about CP? Since the SM doesn't require CP to be conserved, SMEFT operators don't have to respect CP either. So not all operators must respect CP, but all must respect CPT.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if any symmetry isn't necessarily respected by all, then it's not a must. So CPT is a must, while CP is not.
