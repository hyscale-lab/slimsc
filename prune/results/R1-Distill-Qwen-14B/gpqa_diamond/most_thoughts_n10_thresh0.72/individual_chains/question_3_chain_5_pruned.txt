Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition of spin-up and spin-down states. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. The options are A) -1.4, B) 1.65, C) -0.7, D) 0.85.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd expect to measure if you measured that observable many times on the system in the given state. And for expectation values, I think you can break it down linearly, so the expectation of a sum is the sum of the expectations. So the expectation value of 10σz +5σx would be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That makes it easier because I can compute each expectation separately and then combine them.

First, I need to find ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ for the given state. 

The given state is ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (√3/2) |↓⟩. Wait, I should check if this is a valid quantum state. The coefficients squared should add up to one. So (0.5)^2 is 0.25, and (√3/2)^2 is (3/4) which is 0.75. Adding 0.25 + 0.75 gives 1, so yes, it's normalized. Good.

Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, I think that the expectation value of σz is just the coefficient of |↑⟩ squared minus the coefficient of |↓⟩ squared, multiplied by their respective eigenvalues. Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. Because σz has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, respectively. So the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is |a|^2 * (+1) + |b|^2 * (-1), where a is the coefficient for |↑⟩, and b is for |↓⟩.

So for this state, a is 0.5, so |a|^2 is 0.25, and b is sqrt(3)/2, so |b|^2 is 3/4, which is 0.75. So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. 

Wait, wait no. Wait, no, no, wait. Because |↑⟩ is an eigenstate of σz with eigenvalue +1, and |↓⟩ has eigenvalue -1. So the expectation is (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1) = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) =
