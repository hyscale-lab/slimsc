Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

The problem says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. New particles are produced, and these are fast-decaying, moving at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. 

The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. Hmm. So the current situation is 1/3 reach, and they want it to be 2/3. I guess that means we need a higher Lorentz factor because the particles are moving faster, so more of them would reach the walls before decaying.

Wait, but why does the Lorentz factor affect how many reach the walls? I think it's because the lifetime of the particles as observed in the lab frame is longer when the Lorentz factor is higher. Since they're moving at a high speed, their lifetime is dilated, allowing them to travel further before decaying.

So the key here is probably time dilation. The proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame) is multiplied by the Lorentz factor gamma to get the dilated lifetime in the lab frame. The distance the particle can travel before decaying is then velocity times the dilated lifetime. Since the particles are moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, their speed v is approximately c for ultra-relativistic particles.

So the maximum distance a particle can travel before decaying is v multiplied by gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime (v * gamma * tau). But wait, I'm not sure about the exact formula. Let me think again.

The mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime (tau_0). The average distance traveled is then v multiplied by gamma tau_0. Since v is approximately c, the distance is approximately c * gamma tau_0.

In the original case, with gamma = 20, one third of the particles reach the detector walls (radius 30 meters). So for those that reach the walls, the distance they travel is 30 meters. But not all of them reach because some decay before getting there.

The probability that a particle travels a distance D is given by the relation between D and the average distance L (which is c gamma tau_0). The probability P that a particle reaches distance D is roughly P = 1 - exp(-D/L), assuming an exponential decay.

Wait, so if the average distance L is such that when L is equal to the detector radius, then the probability of a particle reaching that distance is P = 1 - exp(-30/(c gamma tau_0)).

Wait, but in the first scenario, with gamma1 =20, the probability of reaching 30 meters is 1/3 (since one third reach the walls). So let's set up that equation.

Let me denote the probability as P =
