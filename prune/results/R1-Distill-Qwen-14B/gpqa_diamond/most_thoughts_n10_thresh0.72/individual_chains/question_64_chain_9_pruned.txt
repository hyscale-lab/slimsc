Okay, let's try to figure out this chemistry problem. Hmm, the problem is a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step.

So, the setup is that we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. The total mass is 7.20 grams. When heated to 200°C without air, they decompose to form a mixture of gases. These gases are then passed through several tubes. 

First, the gases go through tube 1, which contains anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. The weight of this tube increased by 3.60 grams. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a desiccant and absorbs water. So, maybe the gases had water vapor in them. So, the 3.60g increase could be water. 

Then, the gases go into tube 2, which is a Ca(OH)2 solution. The weight didn't change here. Wait, Ca(OH)2 is used to absorb CO2. If the weight didn't change, that suggests that there was no CO2 in the gases. Because if there was CO2, it would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water, increasing the mass. Since it didn't change, no CO2 was present, so the remaining gas after water absorption must be something else.

Next, the gases go into tube 3, which has red-hot copper. The weight increased by 0.80g, and CuO was formed. Red-hot copper would react with certain gases. The common ones are H2S or maybe CO. But wait, another possibility is that the gas is SO2, which would react with copper to form CuS. Or perhaps it's hydrogen sulfide, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, maybe the gas is a sulfur compound.

Wait, but after the first two tubes, the gas had water removed. So what's left? Let me think. The first tube absorbs water, so any H2O in the gases is gone. The second tube, which doesn't change, indicates no CO2. So the remaining gas must be something else that doesn't react with Ca(OH)2.

After that, the gas is passed through tube 3—red-hot copper. If the gas is H2S, then it would react with copper. The reaction is H2S + Cu → CuS + H2. Wait, but when H2S passes through hot copper, it might undergo a reaction. Alternatively, SO2 reacts with copper at high temps. Hmm, I'm not too sure about the specifics here.

So, from tube 3, 0.80g of CuO was formed. Let me think about the possible reaction. If the gas is SO2, the reaction with copper might be 2 SO2 + 2 Cu → 2 CuO + 2 S. But wait, how much mass would that produce? Let me calculate the moles involved.

The total gas after all treatments is 2.24 liters at standard temperature and pressure (STP), which is 0°C and 1 atm. One mole of gas at STP is 22.4 liters, so 2.24 L is 0.1
