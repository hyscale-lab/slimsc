Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, the state is given as |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N. Oh wait, right, the normalization factor N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha²)). 

The relative entropy measure is given as del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix and rho is the non-Gaussian state's. So I need to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) for phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

Wait, but how do I approach this? I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me think. So non-Gaussian states are those that can't be described by Gaussian statistics, like coherent states or squeezed states. The Schrödinger cat state is a superposition of two coherent states, which makes it non-Gaussian.

The relative entropy measure here is comparing the given state's entropy to that of a Gaussian reference state. The idea is that if the state is Gaussian, the entropy should match the reference, so the non-Gaussianity would be zero. But if it's non-Gaussian, this difference would be positive, indicating how non-Gaussian it is.

Wait, but how do I compute this? First, I need to find the density matrices rho and tau. Tau is a Gaussian state, but which one? Oh, perhaps the reference Gaussian state here
