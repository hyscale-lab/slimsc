Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what it's about.

The question says that a chemist did two reactions. Each reaction used a different reducing agent on two different unknown compounds, A and B. The products from both are enantiomers of each other. The product from A is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, and the product from B is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. I need to determine which starting materials A and B are from the given options.

Hmm, okay. So what's happening here? It looks like both reactions are reductions leading to the same compound but as enantiomers. That suggests that the starting materials A and B must have been epimers or perhaps diastereomers that upon reduction give enantiomers.

Wait, wait. Wait a minute. The products are 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let me draw that structure to visualize. Pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. The 2H-pyran-2-one part means the ring has a ketone at position 2 and a double bond in the ring. So the structure is a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar? Or maybe it's a cyclic ketone.

Wait, pyran-2-one is a cyclic ketone, right? So the ring is similar to a cyclic ether but with a ketone. The substituents are at position 4, which is ethyl. So the structure would have an ethyl group on the fourth carbon of the six-membered ring.

Now, how did these products form? The reactions used LiBH4 and BH3. Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used for reducing esters and ketones. BH3 is a milder reducing agent, often used for ketones but not esters. Wait, no, BH3 is usually used with other reagents, like in the BH3-THF complex for ketone reductions. Oh, but wait, LiBH4 is a stronger reductant and can reduce
