Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see, each compound given needs to be assessed for whether it's chiral and thus can exhibit optical activity. Remember, a compound is chiral if it has a chiral center, which is a carbon attached to four different groups. Alternatively, it might have another form of chirality, like a planar chirality or some kind of axial chirality.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
Alright, let's draw this structure. The formula is CH2=CH-C(Cl)(CH3). Wait, no, wait. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to the first carbon of a butene. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-... Wait, no, butene is four carbons. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. But here, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl on the first carbon (the same as the double bond), and a methyl on the second carbon. So the structure is Cl-C=CHCH2CH3? Wait, no: but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. So it's ClCH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-? Wait, no.

Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3
