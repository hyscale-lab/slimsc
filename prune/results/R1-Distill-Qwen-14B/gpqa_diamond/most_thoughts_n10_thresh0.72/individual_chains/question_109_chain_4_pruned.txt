Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particles emitted. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

The question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. Then, Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Oh wait, actually, the equation given is T = S + L + 1 mod 2. Wait, is that right? Or is it T = S + L + something else? Let me make sure I get that right.

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So we need to find which partial wave is not permitted. The options are various transitions with different angular momentum states for X.

First, let's understand the initial state. The initial state is 1S0. In the general term symbol, it's (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0 would mean S=0, L=0 (since it's S state), and J=0. Because 2S+1 =1, so it's a singlet state.

When the NN system emits a particle X, the final state of NN must have certain quantum numbers. Let me think about conservation laws here. Both angular momentum and parity must be conserved.

Wait, but when a particle is emitted, the total angular momentum and parity before emission should equal the total after. But I think for parity, the product of the parity of the emitted particle and the initial parity should equal the final parity.

But wait, the initial state is 1S0. What's its parity? The parity of a state is given by (-1)^(L), right? Because orbital angular momentum contributes a factor of (-1)^L. So L is 0 here, so parity is (-1)^0 = +1.

The initial parity is +1. After emission, the parity of the system (NN) plus the parity of X should equal the initial parity. Because parity is multiplicative. Hmm, wait, or is it additive? No, I think it's multiplicative because parity is a multiplicative quantum number.

Wait no, the parity of the initial state is P_initial = P_NN_initial * P_X_initial. Wait no, wait: the initial state is the NN system, and X is emitted, so perhaps the initial state is the NN system, and X is part of the final state.

Wait, perhaps I should model the process as NN (initial) â†’ NN (final) + X.

So the initial parity is P_initial = P_NN_initial * P_X_initial? Or is the initial state just the NN system, and X is emitted, so the initial state's parity is P_NN_initial, and the final state is P_NN_final * P_X.

Wait, yes. Because parity is a multiplicative quantum number. So the parity of the initial state (NN) is P_initial = (-1)^L_initial. Since the initial state is 1S0, L_initial
