Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which exoplanet has the highest density. The question gives me four options, a to d, each describing a planet with different characteristics. Hmm, let me think about how density relates to mass and radius.

Density is mass divided by volume. Oh wait, and volume depends on the radius. So for each planet, I need to calculate or compare their densities based on their given masses and radii or other info.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³. So this planet has the same density as Earth. That's a baseline. 

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but the question says 'density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³'. So it's explicitly given. So its density is the same as Earth. Oh wait, but wait—does the mass affect the density if the radius is different? Because density is mass over volume. If mass is 2 Earth masses, but what's the radius? If the density is 5.5, then I don't need to worry about radius—because the density is given. So for option b, the density is 5.5.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Same composition as Earth implies same density. Because composition determines density. So if Earth has 5.5, this planet would have the same density. Because density is a function of composition, not mass. Oh but wait, wait—does mass scaling affect density? For example, if a planet is more massive but same composition, does it have the same density? I think so because density is determined by the material, not the size. So if it's same composition, same density. So this planet's density is 5.5 as well.

Option d: A planet with same composition as Earth but half the mass. Same reasoning as c. Density should be same as Earth, 5.5. So options a, b, c, d all have the same density? That can't be right because the question is asking which has the highest. Hmm, maybe I missed something in the options.

Wait, let me read each option again.

Option a: Earth mass and radius. So Earth's density is 5.5.

Option b: 2 Earth
