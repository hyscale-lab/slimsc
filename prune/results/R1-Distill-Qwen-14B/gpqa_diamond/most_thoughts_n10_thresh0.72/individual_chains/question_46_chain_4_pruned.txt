Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again.

The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. They're asking how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene groups. Grubbs is particularly good for ring-closing metathesis, but it can also do other types, like ring-opening or cross metathesis.

Wait, racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. So, the starting material is a racemic mixture, meaning it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. But wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene... let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond starts at carbon 1. So, the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? No, wait, let's count. Pent means five carbons. So, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH
