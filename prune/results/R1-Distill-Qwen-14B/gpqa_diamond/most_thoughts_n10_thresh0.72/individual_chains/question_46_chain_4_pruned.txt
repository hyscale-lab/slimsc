Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst and figuring out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments, right?

First, I need to visualize the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw it out. Pent-1-ene means the double bond starts at the first carbon. So the structure is CH₂=CHCH(CH₂CH₃)CH₂CH₂. Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent is five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, that can't be right because the position of the substituents might matter.

Wait, another way: pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₂. But wait, pent has five carbons. So the structure is CH₂=CHCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, 3-methyl would mean a methyl group on the third carbon. Let's number from the double bond. So, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene as:

CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? But wait, that's six carbons. Oh wait, wait, no. Pent is five carbons, so 3-methylpent-1-ene is:

The structure should be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, that's six carbons. Oh wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me count. 1-ene is the first carbon. So, 3-methylpent-1-ene is:

Carbon 1: CH₂=CH-

Carbon 2: connected to carbon 3, which has a methyl group.

So, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, but that's five carbons in total. Because 1,2,3,4,5. So 1 is the double bond, 3 has the methyl. So, the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Wait, that would be
