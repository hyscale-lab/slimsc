Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a specific potential in two dimensions. Hmm, I remember that in such cases, the potential can often be broken down into parts that make the problem solvable.

The potential given is V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²(θ). Hmm, wait, so it's a function of r and θ. I think in polar coordinates, sometimes you can separate the potential into radial and angular parts. Let me think, if the potential can be expressed as a function of r plus a function of θ, then maybe the problem separates into radial and angular parts, allowing us to solve each part independently.

Wait, but in this case, both terms have r². The first term is (1/2)k r², which is like a harmonic oscillator potential but in two dimensions. The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, cos²θ can be written using a double-angle identity. Oh right, cos²θ = (1 + cos(2θ))/2. So substituting that in, the second term becomes (3/2)k r² [ (1 + cos(2θ))/2 ] = (3/4)k r² (1 + cos(2θ)).

So, putting it all together, V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos(2θ). Wait, simplifying the first two terms: (1/2 + 3/4) is 5/4. So V(r,θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos(2θ). 

Wait, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider whether the potential can be expressed in a way that allows the Schrödinger equation to separate into radial and angular parts. For that, the potential should be a sum of functions that depend only on r and θ respectively. But the term with cos²θ complicates things.

Another approach: in two dimensions, polar coordinates. The kinetic energy in polar
