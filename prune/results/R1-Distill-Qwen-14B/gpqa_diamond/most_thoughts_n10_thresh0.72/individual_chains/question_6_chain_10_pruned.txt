Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that a quantum mechanical particle of mass m is moving in two dimensions, and the potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. I need to find the energy spectrum, and there are four options to choose from.

Hmm, right. So first, I remember that in two-dimensional potentials, especially when the potential has some symmetry, we can separate the problem into radial and angular parts. But wait, in this case, the potential depends on r and θ, so it's not spherically symmetric. Oh wait, no, it's in two dimensions, so maybe polar coordinates are used here.

Wait, in two dimensions, the coordinates are usually (r, θ), where r is the radial distance and θ is the angle. So the potential is a function of r and θ, which suggests that the problem isn't spherically symmetric. Because in spherical symmetry, the potential would only depend on r, not θ.

So, the potential here is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me try to see if I can separate this into radial and angular parts. Oh, the first term is (1/2)k r², which is like a harmonic oscillator in the radial direction. The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm. So I can write each term as:

V(r,θ) = (k r²/2) [1 + 3 cos²θ].

Wait, that might help in separating variables. Because sometimes, when you have a potential that can be factored into functions of r and θ separately, you can separate the Schrödinger equation into radial and angular parts.

Wait, but in this case, the potential is V(r) * f(θ), where f(θ) is 1 + 3 cos²θ. So maybe the potential is separable. Let me think about this.

So the Hamiltonian for the particle is H = (p²)/(2m) + V(r,θ
