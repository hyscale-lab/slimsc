Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics and some spots on it. The scenario is that these spots cause brightness variations that can mimic an exoplanet's signal when observed through photometric time-series. The task is to find the radius of such an exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the spotted star. Hmm, sounds a bit tricky, but let's see.

First, I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light. The change in brightness, or the dip, depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. The formula for the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet's radius and Rstar is the star's radius. So that's the basis for the exoplanet's effect.

Now, the star in the problem has a radius equal to the Sun, so Rstar = R_sun. But wait, the star isn't just a uniform brightness. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. Oh, and the spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, so the spots must be at 5000 K, perhaps? Or wait, the temperature difference is 1000 K less. So spots are 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K.

Wait, but how does that affect the brightness variation? The spots are darker than the rest of the star, so when they rotate into and out of view, the total brightness of the star changes. But how does this translate into the observed brightness variation?

So the star is observed as it rotates. When spots are facing towards us, the area of the spots is contributing less light. The spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go away. The brightness variation comes from the spots' effect on the total flux.

I think the key here is to calculate the effective change in brightness due to the spots and then equate that to the dip caused by an exoplanet. So we can model the two scenarios and find the equivalent planet radius.

Let me think about the flux. The star emits flux F = σT^4 * (Area)/(4π), but when a part of it is cooler, the total flux is reduced. The spots are cooler, so each spot emits less flux.

Wait, but the problem mentions that the star's hemisphere has spots covering 20% of it. The filling factor is 20%—so the spots cover 0.2 of the hemisphere. So the total area covered by spots is (0.2) * (2π Rstar² / 2) ), since a hemisphere is half the sphere. Or wait, the area of a hemisphere is 2π R². Oh wait, no, the surface area of a sphere is 4π R², so a hemisphere is 2π R². But the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, so area of spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, no—wait, the star's entire surface is 4π R². One hemisphere is 2π R². The spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, so that's 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R² area.

Each spot has a temperature of 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K. So the flux from the spots is lower.

Let me think about the total flux when the star is not spotted, and when it is.

Wait, actually, the star without any spots would have a uniform flux. But with spots, the flux from the star varies as the spots rotate into view.

Wait, but from our point of view, when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of the visible hemisphere. So when the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is facing
