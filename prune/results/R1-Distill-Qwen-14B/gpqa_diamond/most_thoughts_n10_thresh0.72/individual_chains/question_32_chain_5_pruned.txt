Okay, I've got this physics problem in front of me about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmmm... Let me think about how to approach this.

So, first, I need to understand what the problem is asking. I know that RHIC collides heavy ions, and here the ion is called X, which is lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li normally has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, I think. Because Li has atomic number 3, so 3 protons, 3 neutrons gives mass number 6.

So the nucleus X is Li-6. I need to find the total energy the RHIC imparts to this nucleus so that its speed is 0.96c. 

I remember that in relativity, when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, their kinetic energy increases significantly. Oh right, the total energy is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma (γ) is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So since v is 0.96c, I can plug that in.

Let me calculate gamma first. Let's compute v²/c²: (0.96c)^2 / c² = 0.96² = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Then sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, but wait. Let me do the calculation more accurately. 0.96^2 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28 because 0.28 *0.28 is 0.0784. So yes, gamma is 1 divided by 0.28, which is 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

So gamma is about 3.5714.

Next, I need to find the total energy of the nucleus. That's gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy.

But wait, what's the rest mass energy of Li-6? Oh, the nucleus is a collection of protons and neutrons. The rest mass energy is the sum of the masses of the protons and neutrons minus any binding energy, but wait, binding energy is usually accounted for in the mass deficit. Oh, wait, but in reality, the mass of the nucleus is a little less than the sum of the individual nucleons because of the mass defect due to binding energy.

But wait, for the purpose of this problem, I think we can approximate the rest mass energy using the atomic mass of Li-6. So I need to find the rest mass energy of Li-6.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is
