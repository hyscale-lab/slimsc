Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's about sigmatropic rearrangements and some specific reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through each part carefully.

The problem has three parts, A, B, and C, each with different starting materials and reagents. I need to figure out the products and match them with the options given.

Starting with reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol in the presence of H+ and heat. The product is A.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine... That's like (CH3O)2CH-NH2? Or wait, ethan-1-amine is CH2CH2NH2? Wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. But 1,1-dimethoxy would be OMe groups on the same carbon as the amine. So structure would be OMe-CH2-NH2? Wait, no, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be (CH3O)2CHNH2? No, wait, ethan-1-amine is CH2NH2CH3? Or maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me visualize it. Ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxy would have two methoxy groups on the first carbon. So the structure is OMe-OCH2CH2NH2? No, wait, ethan-1-amine is CH2CH2NH2? No, perhaps it's CH3CH2NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxy would be (CH2(OCH3)2)NH2? No, wait, the formula is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. So the ethan means two carbons, and the amine is on the first carbon. So the structure is CH2(OCH3)2NH2. So the central carbon (first carbon) has two methoxy groups and the amine.

Then, reacting with but-3-en-2-ol. But-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CH-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, the double bond is between C3 and C2? Wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? Wait, but but has four carbons. Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4? So structure would be CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, but where is the double bond. Oh, but-3-en-2-ol has the double bond between C2 and C3, and the OH on C2. So structure is CH2=C(OH)-CH2CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3? So the structure would be CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait, no, the
