Okay, so I'm looking at this question about rotavirus and some experiments done with GFP-tagged proteins. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I remember that immunology questions often involve understanding what's happening with the immune response, especially when something is tagged and delivered to an organism.

So the setup is that they tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then they did in vivo imaging. From what I remember, the inner capsid proteins are probably part of the virus structure, and by tagging them, they can track where they go in the mouse's body.

The observation is that some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid. Wait, the stomach has a lot of acidâ€”gastric acid, right? So maybe the GFP was degraded there. But some made it through and ended up entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. Secondary lymphoid organs include places like the Peyer's patches, which are in the intestines. Oh, right, Peyer's patches are one of the sites where immune responses are initiated, especially for things ingested, since they're part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT).

They identified the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated the proliferating cells. So the GFP must have gotten into the Peyer's patches, which are where immune cells like dendritic cells, macrophages, and lymphocytes are present. The cells that are proliferating could be B cells or T cells, maybe.

They sequenced the variable heavy chain gene of these cells and found high variability. Oh, the variable heavy chain is part of the B cell receptor (BCR), right? High variability in the variable regions usually suggests that the B cells are undergoing some process that diversifies their receptors, like during an immune response.

Now, the question is asking which process is taking place. The options are somatic hypermutation, complement activation, class switching recombination, or VDJ recombination.

Let's think about each option:

A) Somatic hypermutation: This occurs in B cells during the immune response, particularly in the germinal centers. It introduces mutations in the variable regions of the BCR genes, increasing diversity. This process happens after the initial antigen recognition and during the maturation of B cells into plasma cells or memory cells.

B) Complement activation: This is part of the innate immune response. Complement proteins are activated by various means, including recognition by antibodies or other molecules, and they help in killing pathogens or recruiting immune cells. But in this context, the question is about the variable heavy chain gene, which isn't directly about complement proteins.

C) Class switching recombination: This is when a B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG), which involves recombination at the heavy chain locus. But class switching doesn't increase the diversity of the variable regions; it just changes the type of antibody produced. So the high variability in variable regions isn't explained by this.

D) VDJ recombination: This is the process during B cell and T cell development where the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments are combined to create the variable regions of the receptors. This happens during the maturation of B cells in the bone marrow and T cells in the thymus. But this is a one-time event during development, not during a response. So if they're seeing high variability after an immune response, it's likely not VDJ.

So the high variability in the variable heavy chain gene after immunization or exposure suggests that the B cells are undergoing somatic hypermutation. This process happens in the germinal centers, which are part of the secondary lymphoid organs like the Peyer patches. The proliferating cells would be the B cells that are activated and undergoing this mutation to increase the chances of producing a higher affinity antibody.

Therefore, the correct answer should be A) somatic hypermutation.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Fluorescence was observed in the Peyer patches, where secondary lymphoid tissue is located. The GFP-tagged proteins likely interacted with immune cells, leading to the isolation of a proliferating cell population. Sequencing the variable heavy chain gene of these cells revealed high variability, which suggests a process that diversifies the immune receptor repertoire.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs in B cells during the immune response, particularly in germinal centers, where mutations are introduced into the variable regions of BCR genes. This increases diversity and explains the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain gene. This is consistent with the context of an immune response to the GFP-tagged rotavirus proteins.
  
- **B) Complement activation**: This is part of the innate immune response and does not involve direct modification of the variable heavy chain gene. It is unrelated to the observed variability.

- **C) Class switching recombination**: This process changes the class of antibody produced by B cells (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not increase the diversity of the variable regions. It does not explain the high variability observed.

- **D) VDJ recombination**: This process occurs during B and T cell development in the bone marrow and thymus, respectively, and is a one-time event that establishes the initial diversity of immune receptors. It does not account for the variability observed after antigen exposure.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain gene is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs during the immune response in secondary lymphoid organs like the Peyer patches. This process diversifies the B cell receptor repertoire to enhance antigen recognition and antibody production.
