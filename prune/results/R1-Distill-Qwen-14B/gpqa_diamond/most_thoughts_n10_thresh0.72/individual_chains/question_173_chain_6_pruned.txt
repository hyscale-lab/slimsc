Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because uncertainty principles can be a bit tricky. Let me see, the question is about estimating the minimum uncertainty in the energy of an electron given the uncertainty in its position.

Alright, let's read the problem again. The electron is moving along the x-direction at a speed v = 2e8 m/s. The uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE. The options are A to D, each being an order of magnitude in joules.

Hmm, I remember that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle comes into play here. The principle states that you can't precisely know both the position and momentum of a particle simultaneously. The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh wait, right, that's the basic form. So the product of the uncertainties in position and momentum has to be at least ħ over 2. But when estimating the minimum uncertainty, I think we can just use Δx * Δp ≈ ħ/2, or maybe even take ħ as the product since sometimes the principle is approximated that way for order of magnitude estimates.

Wait, but in this problem, we're given Δx, and we need to find the uncertainty in energy, ΔE. So how does that connect? I think the key is to relate Δp to ΔE because energy is related to momentum. For a particle moving at non-relativistic speeds, the kinetic energy E is (p²)/(2m), where p is momentum and m is mass. So if we can find Δp, we can find ΔE.

Let me jot down the steps I think I need to take:

1. Calculate Δp using the uncertainty principle.
2. Relate Δp to ΔE, probably using the formula for kinetic energy.

So first, let's compute Δp. The uncertainty principle gives Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. But since we're looking for the minimum uncertainty, maybe I can take Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). Alternatively, sometimes it's approximated as Δp ≈ ħ/Δx, considering the factor of 2 as a constant. Hmm, but for the minimum, I think using the exact expression might be better. Let me just go with the equality for the minimum uncertainty.

Given that, I can compute Δp as approximately ħ / (2Δx). Wait, but sometimes people use ħ instead of h/2π, so let me make sure I have the right value. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, so ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So, substituting the numbers:

Δx is 0.1 nm. Wait, nanometers are 1e-9 meters, so 0.1 nm = 1e-10 meters.

So Δp ≈ ħ / (2 *
