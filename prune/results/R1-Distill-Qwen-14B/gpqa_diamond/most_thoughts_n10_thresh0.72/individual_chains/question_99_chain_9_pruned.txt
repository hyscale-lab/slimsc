Okay, I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I need to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

So, the question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options given are four different structures, and I need to choose the correct one based on the spectroscopic data.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The FTIR shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H stretching. Since it's very broad, it's likely an -OH group, maybe in a carboxylic acid because those have broad, strong O-H stretches. Also, there's a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. That's a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch. In a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is usually around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. So, this fits with a carboxylic acid group.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. It says that none of the peaks correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond (like in alkenes), so the molecule doesn't have any double bonds. That’s good to note because it rules out any structures with double bonds.

The NMR has a few signals. One is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complex, but let me think about splitting patterns. 

Let me look at the structures to see which ones fit. The options are:

A) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
B) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
C) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
D) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

Wait, let me parse these structures correctly. Each option has a structure where there's a central part with two substituents attached to a carbon chain, leading to a COOH group.

Looking at each option:

Option A: The structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So, the central part is two CH groups, each attached to a C2H5 group and another CH group. So, the structure is like (CH3)(C2H5)C-CH2COOH maybe? Wait, perhaps it's more like (CH2CH2CH3) groups attached?

Wait, maybe it's better to draw each structure mentally.

Wait, perhaps each of the options is a di-substituted compound. Let me think again.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So, the structure is CH2CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So, the central part is a geminal di-substitution on either side. Wait, no, the central carbon would be the one attached to the CH3 and the other group. Wait, perhaps it's a gem-dimethyl group. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think about the substituents.

Wait, each option has a central part where the central carbon is attached to two other groups. Like, for example, in option D, it's C(H)(CH3) on both sides. So, maybe it's a gem-dimethyl group on each of the two adjacent carbons?

Wait, perhaps another approach: all the structures have a COOH group at the end. So, the main chain is probably CH2-CH2-..., but with substituents.

Let me think about the NMR signals. The presence of a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets suggests that the
