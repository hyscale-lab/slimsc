Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The problem states that the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, so that's a two-component spinor, right? So the state vector is χ = [3i, 4]^T. I remember that spin states are represented as two-component vectors, like in the Pauli matrices formalism.

The question is asking for the expectation value of S_y, the spin operator along the y-direction. Oh right, the expectation value is given by the formula <S_y> = ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩. But wait, S_y is related to the Pauli matrix σ_y by the equation S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y. Oh right, because the spin operators are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices.

So first, I need to write down σ_y. The problem gives it in LaTeX, but I can remember that σ_y is the Pauli Y matrix:

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

So S_y would be (ħ/2) multiplied by this matrix. Now, the expectation value is the product of χ†, S_y, and χ. But wait, since S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, the expectation value becomes (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_y.

So let me write the steps:
