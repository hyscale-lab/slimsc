Okay, so I need to figure out how many loops the Feynman diagram has based on the given expression. Hmm, let me think. I remember that in quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram relates to the order of the process, which in turn affects the factors in the amplitude calculation.

The expression given is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. Let me break this down.

First, I remember that alpha (Î±) is the fine-structure constant, which is approximately 1/137. But more importantly, its presence in the amplitude can tell us about the order of the process. For example, alpha is usually associated with the electromagnetic interaction. So if the term is alpha^3, that suggests a higher-order process, perhaps a loop involving three vertices or more.

Wait, but each loop in a Feynman diagram typically introduces factors of the coupling constant. For example, a one-loop diagram would have a certain number of coupling constants, and higher loops would have more.

Alternatively, the number of loops can also be inferred from the superficial degree of divergence, but that might be more complicated. Alternatively, I remember that each loop brings in a factor of the coupling constant to some power. Let's think about the power of the coupling.

In the expression, we have alpha^3 and g^2. So alpha is a dimensionless coupling for electromagnetism, and g might be another coupling, say for a non-Abelian gauge theory like the strong force.

Wait, another approach: Each loop typically contributes a term involving the coupling constant (like alpha or g) raised to a certain power, and the number of loops is linked to the exponent. But wait, for each loop, you add a certain number of factors. Let's think about tree-level diagrams. A tree-level diagram (0 loops) has no factors from loops, but loop corrections add them.

But actually, the number of loops is not directly given by the exponents of the couplings. Because each vertex can contribute a coupling. For example, a Feynman diagram with V vertices would have a coupling factor of (coupling)^V. So if we have a diagram with, say, two vertices, each with a coupling g, then the amplitude would have g^2.

Wait, but that's for vertices
