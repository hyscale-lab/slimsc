Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about a peptidic compound that was chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum is mostly as expected except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. Those two peaks have similar chemical shifts and integrate to 1H total. And the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Then, the LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. So what's going on?

Alright, let's break this down. The NMR part: Two peaks for the same proton. Since they integrate to 1H, it's not splitting into two because of coupling with another spin. Wait, they ruled out spin-spin coupling, so maybe it's not like a doublet of doublets or anything like that. So why would the same proton show two peaks?

Another thought: maybe the compound is a mixture. Like, maybe it's not a single enantiomer but a racemic mixture. But wait, enantiomers have the same physical properties, so their NMR peaks would overlap. Unless... unless the alpha-proton is in a different environment in each enantiomer. No, wait, enantiomers are mirror images; the alpha protons would be equivalent. So racemic mixtures wouldn't cause two separate peaks for the same proton. So maybe option B is not it.

Then what else could cause two peaks for the same proton? Maybe diastereomers. Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images, so their environments are different. If there are diastereomers present, the same proton could have different chemical shifts. But wait, how would that work with the NMR? If the molecule has diastereomerism, the NMR would show different patterns. So if the compound is a mixture of diastereomers, the alpha protons might appear as separate peaks. But why two? Because there are two different diastereomers, each with a different environment for that proton. So the integral would add up to 1H total, since each peak is 1H but together they make 1H. Wait, no, the question says together they integrate to 1H. So each of the two peaks would have about 0.5H? That doesn't make sense because each proton is 1H. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the question says both peaks correspond to the same alpha-proton, but each has a similar shift and integral adds up to 1H. So maybe the sample isn't pure. Like, the same compound is present in two different forms, such as different tautomers or conformers. But conformers usually don't split peaks unless there's some exchange happening, which might cause a peak to broaden or split, but not two separate peaks. Hmm.

Another possibility is that the compound has undergone some kind of tautomerism, but I'm not sure how that would affect the NMR like this. Alternatively, maybe there's a byproduct or a side reaction. But the LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass. Wait, same mass but different retention times? No
