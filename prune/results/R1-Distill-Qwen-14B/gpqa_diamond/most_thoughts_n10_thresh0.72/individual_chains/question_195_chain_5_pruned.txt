Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question says that astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius. This planet is in a circular orbit around a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. Its orbital period is 3 days. Now, the question is about a second planet with a radius 2.5 times Earth's. We're supposed to find the maximum orbital period of this second planet such that both transit and occultation events occur. Both planets share the same orbital plane, and the second planet also has a circular orbit.

Hmm. So, transit and occultation... right. I remember that a transit is when a planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so we lose the planet's light (if it's a planet that emits or reflects a lot of light) from our view.

Wait, but in this case, the second planet is larger. So for both events to happen, the second planet must pass both in front of and behind the star relative to us. But wait, the first planet is already in a 3-day orbit. So the second planet must have an orbit that allows it to sometimes be in front and sometimes behind.

Wait, but how does the orbital period of the second planet relate to the first one? Oh, maybe they're in the same system, so their orbital periods are related in some way, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem states that the second planet must exhibit both transit and occultation events. Which means that the second planet's orbit must be such that it can sometimes pass in front of the star (transit) and sometimes behind (occultation). But wait, both of these events require that the planet's orbital plane is aligned so that it can pass in front and behind, which depends on the inclination of their orbits relative to us.

Wait, but the problem says both planets share the same orbital plane, so their orbital inclinations are the same. Therefore, if the first planet transits, the second planet must also transit. But wait, the first planet's transit impact parameter is 0.2, which means it doesn't pass directly in front of the star's center. So the planet's orbit is inclined at some angle that
