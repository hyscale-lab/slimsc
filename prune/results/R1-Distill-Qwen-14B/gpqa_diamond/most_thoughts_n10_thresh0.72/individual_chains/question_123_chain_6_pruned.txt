Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, let's try to wrap my head around it. The question is asking about the distance the ejecta travels from the galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. 

Wait, both the ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames. Oh right, that means no acceleration, just constant velocity. So this is a problem involving relative velocity and maybe time dilation because of special relativity.

The problem states that from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at the same speed, right? Because if one sees the other approaching at v, the other sees the first approaching at v as well, assuming no acceleration and both inertial.

Wait, no, wait. Oh, no. Because in relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. Oh wait, but the problem says both are inertial frames, so maybe we can just use the velocity addition formula. Or perhaps it's a straightforward length contraction or time dilation problem.

Wait, but the question is about distance traveled in the galaxy's frame when time passes in the ejecta's frame. Let me think. So in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. How much time passes in the galaxy's frame? Because time dilation would come into play here.

So, the key is to find the time in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame. Then, multiply that time by the velocity in the galaxy's frame to get the distance.

Wait, but let's be careful. The velocity between the two frames is v = 60,000 km/s. Let's convert that to meters per second for easier calculations, but wait, maybe we can work in km/s since the options are in km.

Wait, 60,000 km/s is 0.06c, since c is about 300,000 km/s. So v = 0.06c. So we're dealing with velocities a significant fraction of the speed of light, which suggests that relativistic effects might be important.

But wait, when dealing with time dilation
