Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem describes a series of reactions. The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. Next, C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Also, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

The question is asking about the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

Hmm, okay. I think I should start by figuring out what the compounds A, B, C, D, etc., might be. Let's break down each reaction.

First reaction: Solid A + 8 B → C (bright red). I'm thinking about what solid reacts with a gas in an 8:1 ratio to form a red product. 8 equivalents... Maybe A is a metal and B is a halogen? Or perhaps a nitride or something else.

Wait, bright red product... That makes me think of something like a metal oxide maybe. Or perhaps it's a sulfide? Or maybe a transition metal compound. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction involving sulfur or phosphorus.

Wait, another thought: 8 equivalents. So if B is a diatomic gas, say O2, then 8 moles would be 4 diatomic molecules. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if B is Cl2, 8 equivalents might mean 4 molecules per A.

Let me think. For example, sodium reacting with chlorine: 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. So that's 1:1. But here, it's 8 equivalents of B. So if B is Cl2, maybe A is something else. Wait, 8 equivalents could mean 8 moles of B per mole of A. So if B is O2, then perhaps A is something like sulfur? Let's consider sulfur reacting with oxygen. S8 + 8 O2 → 8 SO2. That's a possibility. Oh, but in that case, the product C would be SO2, but I'm not sure if that's bright red. Alternatively, if it's S8 reacting with something else.

Wait, but another possibility: maybe A is a metal, and B is a diatomic gas that combines in an octahedral fashion. So maybe A is Fe, and B is O2? But FeO is not bright red. Iron(III) oxide is reddish, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves transition metals. Maybe A is copper. Copper reacting with sulfur might form CuS, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction with chlorine. For example, 2 Cu + Cl2 → 2 CuCl. But I'm not sure about the color.

Wait, another angle: when C reacts with water, it reforms A and two acids F and G. So C plus H2O
