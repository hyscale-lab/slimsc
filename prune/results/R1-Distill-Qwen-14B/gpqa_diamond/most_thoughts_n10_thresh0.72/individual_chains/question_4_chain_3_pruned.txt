Okay, so I've got this physics question about Maxwell's equations in a universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both north and south poles; you can't isolate them. So this is a hypothetical scenario where that's not the case.

Maxwell's equations are four fundamental laws of electromagnetism, right? They describe how electric and magnetic fields propagate, interact, and behave. Normally, these equations are:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: The divergence of E equals the charge density over epsilon zero.
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: The divergence of B is zero.
3. Faraday's Law of Induction: The curl of E is negative the time derivative of B.
4. Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition: The curl of B is mu zero times the current plus epsilon zero times the displacement current.

In our universe, the second equation (Gauss's Law for Magnetism) says that there are no isolated magnetic charges, so the divergence of B is zero. But in this parallel universe, magnets can have single poles, so that equation must change. Because if there are isolated north or south poles, they would act like magnetic charges. So the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore; instead, it would be proportional to the magnetic charge density.

So looking at Maxwell's equations, which equations would be affected? The first equation deals with electric charges. The second equation is the one about the divergence of B. So equation 2 would change.

Wait, but the question is about which equations are different. The options are about which of these four equations are altered.

In our universe, equation 2 has divergence of B as zero. If magnetic monopoles exist, equation 2 would change to divergence B equals some term related to the magnetic charge density. So equation 2 is definitely different.

What about the other equations? Faraday's Law (equation 3) involves the curl of E. Normally, it's about the changing magnetic field. I don't think magnetic monopoles would affect that equation directly. Unless... Wait, no. Because Faraday's Law is about induced electric fields from changing B fields. If B can have sources (like magnetic charges), perhaps that's already accounted for in equation 2. I don't think equation 3 changes because of monopoles. 

Equation 4 is Ampère's Law with Maxwell's correction. That involves the curl of B and relates to current and displacement current. Magnetic monopoles wouldn't directly affect this equation because that's about how B is generated by currents and changing E fields. Unless... Hmm, wait. Ampère's Law in the presence of magnetic monopoles might change? Or not? Because Ampère's Law is about the curl of B being related to current density (conduction and displacement). If there are magnetic charges, they might affect the divergence of B but not the curl (equation 4). So Ampère's Law stays the same, or does it?

Wait, another thought. If magnetic monopoles exist, then the equations are symmetric between E and B fields to some extent. So in that case, Maxwell's equations would have a kind of symmetry where both Gauss's laws and both curl equations are similar. But in our universe, they aren't symmetric because there are no magnetic charges. So perhaps in that case, the other equations would change as well. 

Wait, let me think again. The four equations in our universe are:

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. ∇·B = 0
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. ∇×B = μ₀( J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t )

In a universe with magnetic monopoles, equation 2 becomes ∇·B = ρ_m / μ₀, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. So equation 2 is modified.

But what about equation 3? Well, in our universe, equation 3 is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. If there are magnetic charges, would there be an analogous term for the curl of B? Or would equation 4 change? 

Wait
