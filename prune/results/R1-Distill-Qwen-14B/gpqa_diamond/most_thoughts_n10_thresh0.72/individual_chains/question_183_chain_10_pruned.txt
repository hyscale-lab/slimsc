Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product obtained after a reaction. The reactant given is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. It's reacting with red phosphorus and excess HI. Hmm, what's that reaction?

I remember that when red phosphorus is used with HI, it's a deoxygenation reaction, like the Wittig reaction maybe? Wait, no, wait. Oh right, the phosphorus and HI are used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but wait, no, wait. Or maybe it's the hydrohalogenation? No, wait another thought. Oh, wait, when you have alkenes reacting with HI and P, it's usually a hydrohalogenation, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no, another reaction: the reaction of carbonyl groups with red phosphorus and HI. I think that's the Clemmensen reduction. Oh right, Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes. So, the reaction is:

R-C=O â†’ R-CH2 under Clemmensen conditions (using Zn(Hg)/HCl, but wait, red phosphorus and HI... oh wait, maybe that's a different variation. Alternatively, I think the Hofmann degradation uses PCl and NH3, but maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, the Clemmensen uses HCl and Zn(Hg), but another method for reducing ketones is using LiAlH4, but that's not what's here. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI could be in a different context. Oh wait, I think in the presence of red phosphorus, HI can act as a strong reducing agent. So perhaps it's a situation where carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes) are being reduced.

Wait, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, it's a cyclohexene ring (because of the 'cyclohex-3-ene' part). Also, the substituents are a formyl group (CHO) at position 2 and a vinyl group (CH2CH2?) at position 5, and a carboxylic acid group (COOH) at another position. Wait, maybe I should draw the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a cyclohexene ring with substituents. Let's break it down:

- The main ring is cyclohexene (so a six-membered ring with one double bond, in position 3, so between carbons 3 and 4).
- At position 2: a formyl group (CHO).
- At position 5: a vinyl group (CH2CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-). So the substituent at 5 is CH2=CH- attached to the ring, right?
- And another substituent is a carboxylic acid group. Wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is at position 1? Because in cyclic carboxylic acids, numbering starts from the COOH group as position 1. So the positions are 1 (COOH), 2 (CHO), 3 (double bond), and 5 (vinyl).

Wait, perhaps the structure is as follows: the cyclohexene ring has a double bond between C3 and C4. At C2, there's a formyl group (CHO). At C5, a vinyl group (CH2CH2?), but wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-. So at C5, the substituent is a vinyl group (CH2CH2- but with a double bond). Wait, no
