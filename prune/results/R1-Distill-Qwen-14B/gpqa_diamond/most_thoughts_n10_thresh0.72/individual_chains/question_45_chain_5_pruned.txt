Okay, so I've got this problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the energy levels are quantized. The energy for each particle is given by E_n = (n² * π² * ħ²) / (2mL²), right? And the problem simplifies that to E multiplied by some factor. Oh wait, the problem states E = π² ħ²/(2mL²), so each individual energy level is just E multiplied by n squared. So E_n = n² E.

But wait, the particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions. Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, so no two can occupy the same quantum state. So each state is defined by their quantum numbers and spin. In a 1D well, the quantum state is determined by the principal quantum number n and spin. Since they are spin-1/2, each can have two possible spin states: up or down.

So for each energy level n, there are two possible spin states. But since we have four particles, we need to fill these states according to the Pauli exclusion.

Let me think, the ground state would be the lowest energy. Each n can have two particles because of spin. So for n=1, we can have two particles (each with opposite spin). Then n=2 can take two more, right? So ground state would have two particles at n=1 and two at n=2. Wait, but wait, n can't be the same for all four. Wait, no, wait each particle is in a different state. So for four particles, we need to fill the lowest available n levels with their respective spin states.

Wait, maybe I should think of the ground
