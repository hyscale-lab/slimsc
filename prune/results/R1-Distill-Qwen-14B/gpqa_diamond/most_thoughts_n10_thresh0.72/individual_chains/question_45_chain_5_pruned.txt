Okay, so I've got this problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the energy levels are quantized. The energy for each particle is given by E_n = (n² * π² * ħ²) / (2mL²), right? And the problem simplifies that to E multiplied by some factor. Oh wait, the problem states E = π² ħ²/(2mL²), so each individual energy level is just E multiplied by n squared. So E_n = n² E.

But wait, the particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions. Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, so no two can occupy the same quantum state. So each state is defined by their quantum numbers and spin. In a 1D well, the quantum state is determined by the principal quantum number n and spin. Since they are spin-1/2, each can have two possible spin states: up or down.

So for each energy level n, there are two possible spin states. But since we have four particles, we need to fill these states according to the Pauli exclusion.

Let me think, the ground state would be the lowest energy. Each n can have two particles because of spin. So for n=1, we can have two particles (each with opposite spin). Then n=2 can take two more, right? So ground state would have two particles at n=1 and two at n=2. Wait, but wait, n can't be the same for all four. Wait, no, wait each particle is in a different state. So for four particles, we need to fill the lowest available n levels with their respective spin states.

Wait, maybe I should think of the ground

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, and the energy E is defined as E = π²ħ²/(2mL²). 

Hmm, I remember that in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy levels is E_n = (n² * π² ħ²) / (2mL²). So each particle's energy depends on its quantum number n. But wait, since these are identical particles, I guess they obey the Pauli exclusion principle because they're spin-1/2, which are fermions. So each quantum state can only be occupied by one particle.

Wait, spin-1/2 particles can have two possible spin states, right? So for each n, there are two possible states (spin-up and spin-down). So maybe each n can hold two particles. But wait, no, wait. Each quantum state is defined by both the spatial part (n) and the spin part. So for each n, you can have multiple particles as long as their spin states are different. But for identical particles in the same spatial state, their spins must be different. But since the particles are identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle: no two can occupy the same quantum state (same n and same spin).

But in this problem, we have four particles. So we need to arrange them in the lowest possible energy states, considering their spin.

Let me think about how the particles fill up the energy levels. The energy levels in the well are E_n = n² E, since E is given as the base unit.

In the ground state, the lowest energy is when the particles fill the lowest possible states. Since each spatial state can have two particles (two spins), the first few levels would be filled as follows:

n=1: can hold two particles (spin up and down). So two particles here.
n=2: can hold two particles as well. So two more here. But we have four particles, so after n=2, all four are placed.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Each energy level E_n can hold two particles because of the two possible spin
