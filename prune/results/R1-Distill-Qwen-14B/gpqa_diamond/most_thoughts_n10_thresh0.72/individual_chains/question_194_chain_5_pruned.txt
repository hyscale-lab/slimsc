Okay, so I'm trying to solve this statistical mechanics problem about partition functions for a system of three spins. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem says there are three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). Right, so each state contributes a term based on its energy.

Each spin has two possible states, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let me list all the possible combinations. But wait, maybe I can find a smarter way instead of enumerating all 8. Hmm.

Alternatively, the Hamiltonian is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ). Since each S is ±1, the terms S_i S_j will be +1 if the spins are aligned and -1 if anti-aligned. So each product is either +1 or -1.

Let me denote each term. Let me think of S1S2 as term A, S1S3 as term B, and S2S3 as term C. Then E = -J (A + B + C). Since each term A, B, C can be ±1, the sum can vary.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to compute the energy for each possible state. Each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3 being +1 or -1.

So I can list all 8 possibilities:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1:

Compute each product:
S1S2 = 1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. So E = -J * 3 = -3J.

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1:

S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is (1) + (-1) + (-1) = -1. E = -J*(-1) = J.

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1:

S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum is (-1)+(1)+(-1) = -1. E = J.

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1:

S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum is (-1)+(-1)+(1) = -1. E = J.

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1:

S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum is (-1)+(-1)+(1) =-1. E = J.

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1:

S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum is (-1)+(1)+(-1) =-1. E= J.

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1:

S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1 + (-1) + (-1) =-1. E= J.

8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1:

All products are 1. Sum is 3. E = -3J.

Wait, so looking at the energies: the first state has E=-3J, and each of the other 6 states has E=J, except I think I might have made a mistake here. Wait, let me check each case
