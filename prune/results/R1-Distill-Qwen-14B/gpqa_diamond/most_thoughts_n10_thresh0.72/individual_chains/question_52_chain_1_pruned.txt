Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully and break it down.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics and how spots on its surface affect the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that stars have something called effective temperature (Teff), and when parts of their surface are cooler (like spots), it can change the overall observed temperature. 

So the star's normal Teff is 6000 K without spots. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. That makes sense because the spots are cooler, so the average temperature goes down.

Now, the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet range. I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of different energy levels in a gas in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), as the question states.

The Boltzmann equation is: (n2 / n1) = (g2 / g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k*T) )

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the number densities of the two levels.
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy factors) of the levels.
- E2 and E1 are their energies.
- k is the Boltzmann constant.
- T is the temperature.

The ratio of n2/n1 depends exponentially on the temperature. So when the temperature changes (due to spots), the ratio changes.

Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when spots are present, the overall Teff is lower. So the ratio n2/n1 is lower when the star has spots. So the ratio when no spots (T=6000 K) compared to when spots (T=5500 K) would be higher. So the factor is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots. 

But wait, the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So it's (n2/n1)_no_spots divided by (n2/n1)_spots. 

Let me write the two ratios.

Without spots: T1 = 6000 K
With spots: T2 = 5500 K

The ratio (n2/n1) is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1. But wait, the transition is at 1448 Å. The energy difference can be found using the relation E = hc/λ.

So let's compute ΔE.

h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J·s), c is speed of light (3e8 m/s), λ is 1448 Å which is 1448e-10 meters.

E = hc/λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) 

Calculating that:
