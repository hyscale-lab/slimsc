Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length 'a'. When monochromatic light (wavelength λ) falls vertically on this aperture, it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Also, we can use the small angle approximation where tanθ ≈ θ.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts, creating a pattern of bright and dark fringes. The classic example is the single slit diffraction, where the minima (dark fringes) occur at specific angles.

Wait, but this isn't a single slit; it's an N-sided polygon. But when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because as the number of sides increases, the polygon approximates a circle. So maybe this problem reduces to the circular aperture diffraction case.

In the case of a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has a central bright spot (the Airy disk) surrounded by concentric dark rings. The minima in the diffraction pattern occur at specific angles determined by the Bessel function zeros. The first minimum is at a certain angle, and the second at another.

But wait, the problem is about a polygon with all apothems equal. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, the apothem (a) is related to the radius (R) of the circumscribed circle. The formula for apothem is a = R * cos(π/N), but as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, and the apothem would approach R. Because when N is very large, each side is very small, and the apothem is almost equal to the radius.

Wait, I might be getting confused. Let me think again. For a regular polygon, the relationship between the apothem (a) and the radius (R) is a = R * cos(π/N). So when N is large, π/N is small, and cos(π/N) ≈ 1 - (π²)/(2N²). So as N approaches infinity, a approaches R. So the apothem a is approximately equal to R when N is very
