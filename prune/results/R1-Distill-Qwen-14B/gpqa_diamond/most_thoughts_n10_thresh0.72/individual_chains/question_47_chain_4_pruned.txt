Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound corresponds to the given spectroscopic data. Let me take it step by step.

The compound has the formula C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation first. The formula is C9H11NO2. Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is 0 here. So substituting: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2. Let's compute that: (20-11+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be from a benzene ring (which is 3 DoU), a double bond or amide (another 1 or 2), and maybe an ester group which is another double bond. Hmm, benzamide derivatives perhaps.

Now, looking at the IR data. Strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are likely N-H stretches. For amines, those would be broad, but for amides, they are usually a bit less intense but could be in this range. But wait, the intensity is medium to strong, so maybe two different N-H groups? Or perhaps an amide and something else. Then there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which could be amide (around 1650-1700) or ester (higher, like 1720-1750). So this might be an ester. Or a ketone, but with the formula, probably more likely an ester or amide.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H: that's likely a CH3 group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ethyl ester. So maybe an ethyl group attached to an oxygen, like OCH2CH3. The triplet suggests two neighboring protons, so the ethyl is next to the O, which is split into a triplet.

- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H: a broad singlet suggests maybe an NH group. Two protons... so perhaps an NH2 group, but since it's a singlet, maybe it's an NH adjacent to something else. Or maybe it's an OCH2 group where the protons are exchanging, but that's less likely. Alternatively, it could be an N attached to something, like an amide. Wait, but amide protons usually are around 7-8 ppm, but here at 4.0, that's lower. Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. The 4.0 ppm is broad, which is common for amide NH groups, but their shifts are usually higher. Alternatively, maybe it's an NH adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, making it more deshielded. Or could it be an N adjacent to an oxygen, like in a morpholine ring
