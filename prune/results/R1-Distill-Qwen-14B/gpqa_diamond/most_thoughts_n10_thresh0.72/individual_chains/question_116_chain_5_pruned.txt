Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR spectrum with two signals. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Then, A undergoes monobromination to form B. B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C, which has two geometrical isomers. The cis-isomer of C reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to produce compound D. We need to identify D from the options given.

Alright, let's break this down.

First, let's focus on Compound A. The NMR signals give us some clues about its structure. A triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H suggests that these protons are likely equivalent and attached to a carbon adjacent to another set of protons. The 6H could be from two methyl groups (each CH3 has 3H), so maybe two CH2CH3 groups or something similar. The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H indicates another set of equivalent protons, perhaps a single CH2CH2 group or maybe two CH2 groups. Wait, wait, a quartet (which usually implies coupling with two neighboring sets of protons) and 4H—maybe it's a single CH2CH2 group? Or perhaps two CH2 groups adjacent to each other.

So, if I think about the triplet (6H) as two methyl groups attached to a CH2, like (CH2CH3)2CH2? Wait, no. Let me think again. A triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H could be two methyl groups (each with 3H) attached to a single central carbon. But if that's the case, the central carbon would have two CH3 groups and perhaps another CH2 group. Alternatively, maybe it's two CH2CH3 groups. Wait, but each CH2CH3 would have a triplet in the NMR if adjacent to a CH2. Alternatively, perhaps the 6H are from two methyl groups attached to a CH2 that's adjacent to another CH2 group, which accounts for the quartet.

Wait, maybe I should think about the splitting. A triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H: the triplet suggests that these protons are adjacent to a CH2 group. So, perhaps two CH2CH3 groups. Because each CH2CH3 group would have a triplet. But then, combining two such groups would give a triplet for 6H. Alternatively, maybe a single CH(CH2CH3)2 group. But that would give a triplet for the CH2CH3 protons. Let me think about that. If the CH group is attached to two CH2CH3 groups, each of those methyl groups would be split into a triplet because they're adjacent to the CH. So that would account for 6H as a triplet. Then, the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H—could that be the two CH2 groups attached to the central CH? So, the structure would be something like CH(CH2CH3)2. So, the CH would have two CH2CH3 groups attached. Then the adjacent CH2 groups would be split into a quartet because they are next to the CH, which has two H's. Wait, but each CH2 would have two H's, and perhaps they are next to another CH2 group, causing a quartet. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 group. Let me think about the integration. 6H and 4H. 6H likely from two CH3 groups. 4H from two CH2 groups. So, maybe the structure is CH2CH2(C(CH3)2). Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it's a diethyl group. Like diethyl something. Diethyl ether, for example, but that's O with two ethyl groups. Or
