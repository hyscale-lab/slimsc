Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, electrons and positrons colliding and annihilating into photons. I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, right? And since they're moving, conservation laws must apply here.

Alright, let's start by understanding the setup. There's an electron moving along the horizontal axis (let's say the x-axis) from the left. Its Lorentz factor is 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right, with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, but one is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Wait, Lorentz factor is the ratio of the object's speed to the speed of light. So the electron is moving to the right (since it's from the left), and the positron is moving to the left (from the right). But wait, no, wait. The problem says the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So if the electron is going from left to right, and the positron from right to left, their initial motion is towards each other. But wait, because the problem says 'horizontal axis from the left' and 'from the right'. So the electron's direction is to the right, and the positron's direction is to the left. So their velocities are in opposite directions.

When they annihilate, they produce two photons. So the initial total momentum must equal the total momentum of the two photons. Also, the total energy must be conserved.

Wait, but the electron and positron have the same mass, but opposite charges. So their rest masses are the same. But their velocities are different because their Lorentz factors are different.

The Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So for the electron, gamma_e =4, and for the positron, gamma_p=2.

Wait, but wait a second. Because the positron is moving opposite to the electron, so their velocities are in opposite directions. So their momentum vectors are opposite in direction.

But wait, let's think about the momentum. The electron has momentum p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. The positron has p_p = gamma_p * m_p * v_p.
