Okay, so I have this question about neutrino flux from the Sun, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. All other reactions are the same. We need to find the ratio of the flux between two bands: band 1 is 700-800 keV and band 2 is 800-900 keV. The options are A to D, with some numbers.

Hmm, okay. I remember that the pp chain is a major source of solar energy, and it produces neutrinos. The pp-III branch probably refers to a specific part of that chain. Wait, the pp chain starts with protons fusing into deuterium, then into helium-4, and there's a branch where maybe a proton captures a helium-3 nucleus, right?

Oh wait, the pp-I branch is the main one, leading to helium-4. Then pp-II and pp-III are maybe alternative branches. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves the capture of a proton by a helium-3 nucleus to form a helium-4, but that's part of the main process. Or wait, maybe pp-III is where three protons are involved in a different way. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details, but I think it's the dominant branch in the proton-proton chain.

So if the pp-III branch stops, what does that mean for neutrino production? Well, neutrinos are produced mainly
