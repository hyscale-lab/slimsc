Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens if a certain reaction in the Sun's core stops. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let's think this through.

The question says the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh right, that's the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So if something stops in the core, it would take that long for the effect to be noticed here on Earth in terms of neutrinos. Because neutrinos are produced in the core and can escape quickly, so their flux would change right away, but the light we see would only reflect the change after that delay.

But wait, the question is about the flux ratio of two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, the pp-III branch is responsible for producing those neutrinos. I remember that the pp chain is the proton-proton chain, which is the main fusion process in the Sun. The pp-I, II, and III branches are different steps in this chain.

The pp-III branch is probably a specific part of the chain. I think pp-I is the initial step where two protons fuse to form deuterium, emitting a positron and a neutrino. Then, pp-II and pp-III are subsequent steps leading up to helium-4. But I'm a little fuzzy on the details. Oh wait, pp-III involves the fusion of a proton with a carbon-13 nucleus, producing nitrogen-13, which then decays, emitting a positron and a neutrino. So, that's a source of neutrinos, specifically the so-called "carbon cycle" neutrinos.

If the pp-III branch stops, then the production of those particular neutrinos stops. But what about the other branches? The question says all other reactions remain as they were. So, other parts of the pp chain and other fusion processes (like the CNO cycle) are still happening.

Now, the solar neutrino flux comes from several sources: the main pp chain, the CNO cycle, and others. The dominant source is the pp chain, particularly the pp-I branch, which produces a lot of neutrinos. The pp-III branch produces a smaller fraction, I think.

But wait, the question is about the ratio
