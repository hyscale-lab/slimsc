Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm a bit new to this. The problem involves a series of reactions and NMR analysis, so I need to track each step carefully.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's a pretty rigid molecule. 1,3-dibromo would mean there are bromine atoms on two of the bridgehead carbons, specifically at positions 1 and 3.

First step: heating with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination or substitution reactions. Since we're heating, elimination is more likely. The product is a light yellow solid, which makes me think of an epoxide or maybe a diene. Wait, wait. Oh, wait, if it's an elimination, maybe it forms an alkene because dehydrohalogenation would produce that. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane... If each bromine is on adjacent bridgeheads, eliminating both would form a diene, but adamantane is already a fused structure. Alternatively, perhaps a single elimination happens, but with two bromines, maybe two eliminations occur. Wait, but how?

Wait, KOH could deprotonate and cause elimination. But in adamantane, the structure is such that each bridgehead is connected to three other carbons. So when KOH is present, each Br might leave, but perhaps in an E2 mechanism. Or wait, maybe it's a double elimination, leading to the formation of an epoxide? No, I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe it's a Dieckmann condensation, but that's for cyclic ketones, which we don't have here.

Wait, another thought: when two vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromo) undergo elimination with a strong base, they form an alkene. But in this case, the dihalide is 1,3-dibromo, so the two Brs are not on adjacent carbons but on 1 and 3 positions. So elimination would form a diene? Or maybe it's a conjugated diene. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the structure. Adamantane has four bridgehead carbons arranged in a way that each is connected to two bridges. So 1 and 3 are across from each other. So if each of those bridgeheads has a Br, heating with KOH would remove both Brs, perhaps forming a double bond between the 1 and 3 positions? But wait, in adamantane, 1 and 3 aren't adjacent. So maybe it's a [3,3] sigmatropic shift? Hmm, that's getting complicated.

Wait, the product after KOH is a light yellow solid. I think that when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromo) react with a base, they form alkenes. But for 1,3-dibromo, perhaps two eliminations
