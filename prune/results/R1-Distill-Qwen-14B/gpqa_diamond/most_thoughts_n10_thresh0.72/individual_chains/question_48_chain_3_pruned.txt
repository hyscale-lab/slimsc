Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to break it down.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. Right, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, a six-membered ring with a ketone group. So, its structure is a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group attached.

The first step is treating cyclohexanone with bromine, forming product 1. Wait, what reaction does bromine do to a ketone? Oh, I remember that ketones can undergo bromination via the haloform reaction under certain conditions, but wait, the haloform reaction is usually for methyl ketones. Cyclohexanone isn't a methyl ketone, so maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, another possibility is that the ketone is undergoing an addition reaction. Oh, wait, no, bromine (Br2) in a non-polar solvent typically does an addition reaction with alkenes, but we don't have an alkene here. Alternatively, maybe it's a dihydroxylation? Wait, no, that's with OsO4. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a bromination via some other mechanism. Oh wait, maybe it's the formation of a bromocyclohexanone. Alternatively, does bromine add to the carbonyl group? I think the carbonyl can react with bromine, but that would require specific conditions.

Wait, another thought: cyclohexanone can undergo ring-opening with bromine. Or perhaps it's a bromohydrination. Wait, no, that's when you have a ketone and you add water and bromine in a specific way, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again. Bromine as a reagent in a reaction with ketones... Oh wait, maybe it's a pinacol rearrangement? No, that's for diols. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: maybe the bromine is acting as an electrophilic reagent. The carbonyl oxygen is electron-withdrawing, so maybe the alpha carbons (the ones next to the carbonyl) are more susceptible. Oh, right! The alpha position can undergo electrophilic substitution if activated. So, perhaps bromine adds to the alpha position in an electrophilic substitution.

Wait, but cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. So, the
