Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem step by step. Hmm, the question involves the Cope rearrangement and another reaction. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to break it down.

So, the first part involves a compound reacting with BuLi followed by H+. The molecule is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. That looks a bit complex, but let's visualize it. The benzene ring has a substituent which is a methylene group (OCH2CH2?) Wait, no, wait. Wait, the structure is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let me draw this.

The substituent is OCH2CH2CH(CH3)CH2? No, wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. So the structure of that substituent is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-. Wait, but wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-? Wait, no. But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-. Wait, but but has four carbons. So but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, double bond between C2 and C3. So 1-yl would be the first carbon. So it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but that can't be right. Wait, maybe I should think of it as the substituent is attached at the 1 position, so it's CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-O-CH2-benzene? Wait, no, the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. Oh, wait, it's (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy connected to a methyl group attached to the benzene.

So the structure is benzene-O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Hmm, wait, the but-2-en-1-yl group would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but with a methyl at position
