Okay, so I'm trying to answer this neutrino flux question. Hmm, let me think. I remember that neutrinos are produced in the Sun through various nuclear reactions in the core. The question is about the pp-III branch suddenly stopping, and how that affects the neutrino flux in two specific energy bands.

Wait, the pp-III branch... I think the pp chain is the proton-proton chain, right? The main way the Sun fuses hydrogen into helium. Oh right, the pp-I branch is the initial reaction where two protons collide and produce deuterium, then another proton combines, and so on. The pp-II and pp-III are subsequent steps. Oh wait, no, maybe I'm mixing something up. Let me get this straight. The proton-proton chain has a few branches: the main one (pp-I), the pp-II, and pp-III. Each branch produces different particles, including neutrinos.

Oh, right! The pp-III branch produces a lot of neutrinos. Specifically, in the pp-III reaction, a boron-8 nucleus captures a proton to become carbon-9, which then emits positrons and neutrinos. Because this process is a significant source of neutrinos, right? So, if the pp-III branch stops, the number of neutrinos produced from that process would drop.

But wait, the question says that all other reactions remain as they were. So only the pp-III branch stops. So which neutrinos are affected? Neutrinos from the pp-III branch would be the ones with certain energies. The main neutrinos are the electron neutrinos from the beta decay steps in the pp chain. But wait, in the pp-III branch, when the carbon-9 decays, it emits a positron and a neutrino. So those are Î½_e.

But the question is about the flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. I think the neutrinos from the pp chain have a range of energies, but the higher energy neutrinos (like in the 800-900 keV range) are more likely to come from the pp-III branch. Because the pp-III reaction emits higher energy neutrinos compared to other branches.

So if the pp-III branch stops, the flux in the higher energy band (800-900 keV) would decrease more than the lower one (700-800 keV). But wait
