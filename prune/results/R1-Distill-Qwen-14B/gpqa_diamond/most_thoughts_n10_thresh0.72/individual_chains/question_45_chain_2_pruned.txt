Okay, so I have this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about finding the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for the system. The given energy E is defined as E = π²ħ²/(2mL²). Each particle is spin-1/2, which probably means they can have spin up or down, but since they're in a 1D well, maybe the spatial part is more important here.

Wait, but wait. For identical particles, especially fermions like electrons, the Pauli exclusion principle applies. So each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers. Oh, right, in a 1D infinite well, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²) / (2mL²), which is n² times E. So E_n = n² E, since E is given as the base case for n=1.

So four identical spin-1/2 particles would each have a different spatial wavefunction, but since they are fermions, their total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. But spin is part of that. Since each particle has spin-1/2, they can be in either spin-up or spin-down states.

Wait, but in a 1D well, the spatial part and spin part together make the total wavefunction. So for each particle, the spatial wavefunction could be the same as another if their spins are different. Or perhaps not, because the particles are identical and the wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the possible combinations of their quantum numbers.

Each of the four particles must have a unique set of quantum numbers, considering their spin. Let me think: each particle has a principal quantum number n. But wait, in a 1D infinite well, the quantum number is just n, because it's one-dimensional. So each state is characterized by n and spin.

Wait, no. Wait, no, in a 1D well, the quantum number is just n. Spin is an additional degree of freedom. So for each n, we can have two possible spin states: up or down. So each n can hold two particles with opposite spins.

Wait, but the particles are spin-1/2, so each can have spin up or down. So for each n level, we can have two particles. So for four particles, we'd need to fill up the lowest possible n's, ensuring each particle has a unique state.

Wait, the ground state would be the lowest possible energy
