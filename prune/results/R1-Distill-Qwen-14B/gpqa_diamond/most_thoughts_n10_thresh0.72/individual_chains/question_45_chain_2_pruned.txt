Okay, so I have this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about finding the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for the system. The given energy E is defined as E = π²ħ²/(2mL²). Each particle is spin-1/2, which probably means they can have spin up or down, but since they're in a 1D well, maybe the spatial part is more important here.

Wait, but wait. For identical particles, especially fermions like electrons, the Pauli exclusion principle applies. So each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers. Oh, right, in a 1D infinite well, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²) / (2mL²), which is n² times E. So E_n = n² E, since E is given as the base case for n=1.

So four identical spin-1/2 particles would each have a different spatial wavefunction, but since they are fermions, their total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. But spin is part of that. Since each particle has spin-1/2, they can be in either spin-up or spin-down states.

Wait, but in a 1D well, the spatial part and spin part together make the total wavefunction. So for each particle, the spatial wavefunction could be the same as another if their spins are different. Or perhaps not, because the particles are identical and the wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the possible combinations of their quantum numbers.

Each of the four particles must have a unique set of quantum numbers, considering their spin. Let me think: each particle has a principal quantum number n. But wait, in a 1D infinite well, the quantum number is just n, because it's one-dimensional. So each state is characterized by n and spin.

Wait, no. Wait, no, in a 1D well, the quantum number is just n. Spin is an additional degree of freedom. So for each n, we can have two possible spin states: up or down. So each n can hold two particles with opposite spins.

Wait, but the particles are spin-1/2, so each can have spin up or down. So for each n level, we can have two particles. So for four particles, we'd need to fill up the lowest possible n's, ensuring each particle has a unique state.

Wait, the ground state would be the lowest possible energy

Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. The question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. I need to calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of E, where E is given as pi squared hbar squared over 2mL squared. The options are A to D, each with different combinations of energies.

Hmm, I remember that in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy levels is E_n = (n² pi² ħ²) / (2mL²), right? So each particle's energy depends on the quantum number n. But wait, the particles are identical and spin-1/2, which means they're fermions. Oh right, fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, so no two can have the same set of quantum numbers.

So, in a potential well, each quantum state is characterized by n and spin. Since they're spin-1/2, each particle has two possible spin states: up and down. So for each n, we can have two particles with opposite spins.

Wait, but the particles are identical fermions, so they have to obey the antisymmetry of the wavefunction. But in this problem, since the well is one-dimensional and the particles are in separate energy levels, maybe the spatial part doesn't have to worry about symmetry because we're considering product states. Or perhaps each particle's state is independent in terms of their quantum numbers.

Wait, no, when considering the system as a whole, the total wavefunction is a product of spatial and spin parts. For fermions, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. But perhaps in this problem, since it's about the energy levels, we can treat each particle as being in a unique spatial quantum state, considering their spin. Or maybe it's easier to think about each particle having a unique combination of n and spin.

Wait, another approach: since each spin state is allowed for a particular n, for a given n, you can have two particles with opposite spins. So for each n, maximum two particles can occupy it.

But since there are four particles, we'll need to fill up the lowest available orbitals. Let's think about how that would proceed.

So in the ground state, the four particles will fill the lowest possible orbitals. Since each n can hold two particles (with opposite spins), the first two particles go into n=1 (each with spin up and down), the next two into n=2. So the ground state will have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2.

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because for four particles, each with spin 1/2, each n can hold two. So n=1: 2 particles, n=2: 2 particles. So that's the ground state.

But the question is about the energies of the system. So the total energy would be the sum of the energies of each particle.

Wait, no, each particle's energy is E_n, so for each n, all particles in that level contribute E_n. So in the ground state, two particles in n=1 (so 2 * E_1) and two in n=2 (
