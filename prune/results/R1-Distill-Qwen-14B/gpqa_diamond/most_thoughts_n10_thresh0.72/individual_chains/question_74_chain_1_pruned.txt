Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, and each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time. The question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet. We need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, wait. So, the decay is a Poisson process, right? The key thing is that the decay of an individual atom is memoryless. That means the probability of it decaying doesn't depend on how much time has already passed since its creation or since it was last undecayed. So, if it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, the fact that 50 minutes have passed doesn't change the probability for the future.

But wait, the given probability is 32% decay in 100 minutes. So, maybe I should find the decay constant first. Because that's probably how you approach it.

The formula I remember is the probability of decay, P, is given by P = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is the time. Or wait, sometimes it's represented as the number of undecayed nuclei N = N0 * e^(-λt). So, the decay probability would be 1 - e^(-λt).

Given that P is 32% (0.32) for t=100 minutes. So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100). Let's rearrange that.

e^(-λ*100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. So, taking the natural log on both sides: -λ*100 = ln(0.68). So, λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Calculating that, let's see. ln(0.68) is about ln(2/3) approximately, but I might need to compute it more accurately. Wait, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566. So λ is 0.38566 / 100 = approximately 0.0038566 per minute.

But wait, maybe I should keep it symbolic for now
