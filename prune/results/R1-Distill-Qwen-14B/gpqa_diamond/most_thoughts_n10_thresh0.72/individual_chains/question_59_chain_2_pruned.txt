Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. It's about finding the pH of a solution when you mix three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let's try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So maybe I should figure out how much of each is present and see what reacts first.

Wait, the problem gives me the volumes and concentrations of each solution. Let me jot those down.

1. 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
2. 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid)
3. 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide)

I think I need to calculate the moles of each acid and base first. Moles are calculated by Molarity multiplied by Volume in liters.

Starting with CH3COOH. Its molarity is 0.1 M, and volume is 500 mL. So 500 mL is 0.5 liters. 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Since acetic acid is a weak acid, it won't dissociate completely, but maybe I don't need that right now.

Next, HCl. 0.2 M and 400 mL. 400 mL is 0.4 liters. 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely into H+ and Cl-.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each formula unit gives 2 OH- ions. So I need to calculate the moles of OH- it provides. The molarity is 0.3 M, volume is 300 mL, which is 0.3 liters. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each mole gives 2 moles of OH-, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of OH-.

So, to recap, the moles are:
- CH3COOH: 0.05 mol
- HCl: 0.08 mol H+
- OH-: 0.18 mol

But wait, when you mix acids and bases, the H+ and OH- will react. The reaction is H+ + OH- â†’ H2O.

So I should calculate the net moles of H+ and OH- after mixing.

First, total H+ from HCl is 0.08 mol. Ba(OH)2 gives 0.18 mol OH-.

So the OH- will neutralize some of the H+.

The neutralization reaction is 1:1. So how much H+ is left after reacting with OH-?

The OH- is 0.18 mol, H+ is 0.08 mol.

Since H+ is less than OH-, all H+ will be neutralized, and there will be some OH- left.

So the OH- remaining is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

Wait, but acetic acid is also present. Oh right, CH3COOH is a weak acid. So after neutralizing the H+ from HCl, what about the CH3COOH? Let me think.

Wait, when OH- is added to a solution with CH3COOH, the OH- will react with the H+ from both CH3COOH and any other sources. But in this case, the H+ from HCl and the OH- from Ba(OH)2 are reacting first, and then any remaining OH- will react with the CH3COOH.

So, first, the OH- neutralizes the H+ from HCl.

After that, the remaining OH- (0.10
