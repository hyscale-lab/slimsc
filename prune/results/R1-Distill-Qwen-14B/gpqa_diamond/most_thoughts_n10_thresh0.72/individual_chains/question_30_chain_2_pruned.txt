Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about dyes and the colors they emit or absorb. Hmm, I remember that when something emits light, it's because it's releasing energy. Oh wait, wait, the question says the dye emits light with a certain energy. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes when electrons get excited, they emit light when they drop back down. Oh right, the energy of the emitted photon is related to the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state of the molecule.

So the question is asking what color is absorbed. Wait, no, the dye emits light, so the absorbed light must be related. Or wait, maybe it's about the complementary color? Because when a substance absorbs a certain color, it emits or reflects the complementary. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit mixed up here.

The energy given is 2.3393 eV. Oh, I remember that energy and wavelength are inversely related. The formula is E = hc/Î», where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light. So higher energy means shorter wavelength, right? Let me think: the visible spectrum ranges from violet (~400 nm) to red (~700 nm). Lower wavelength (violet) has higher energy, higher wavelength (red) has lower energy.

So 2.3393 eV is the energy of the emitted light. Wait, but the dye emits this energy when it drops from a higher energy state. So the energy difference corresponds to the photon emitted. That means the molecule absorbed a photon of higher energy, and when it relaxes, emits this lower energy photon? Or maybe the emitted light's energy is
