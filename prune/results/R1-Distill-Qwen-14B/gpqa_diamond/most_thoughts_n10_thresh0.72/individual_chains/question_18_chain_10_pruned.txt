Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about the elemental abundances of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the given data. Both stars have masses more than the Sun, but I'm not sure if that affects the calculation directly. The problem gives me some abundance ratios using the EW method under LTE. Let me list out the given information:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is provided as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = 7-12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5

Wait, that seems a bit low. Oh, but maybe that's correct. Let's remember those values.

The problem is asking for the ratio [Si/Star_1]/[Si/Star_2], or the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to that in Star_2.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So it's (n_Si1 / n_Si2) ? Or is it (n_Si1 / n_Si_sun) and (n_Si2 / n_Si_sun), then take their ratio?

Hmm, no. Because [X/Y] is log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So the [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio of their abundances relative to the Sun.

Wait, but the problem says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So that's (n_Si1)/(n_Si2). How to compute that?

I think I need to find the [Si/H] for each star, then compute the ratio of their Si/H values.

Because, [Si/H] for a star is log(n_Si/n_H) - log(n_Si/n_H)_sun. So [Si/H]_star = log(n_Si,n_H) - [Si/H]_sun.

Wait, but wait, [X/Y] is defined as log(n_X / n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So [Fe/H] is log(Fe/H) - log(Fe/H)_sun.

So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0. That means log(n_Fe1/n_H1) = log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun.

Same for Star_2: [Mg/H]_2 =0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun.

But wait, in the Sun's photosphere, n_Fe and n_Mg are given in terms of n_H.

Wait, the Sun's data: 12 + log(n_Fe/n_H) =7.5 → log(n_Fe/n_H)= -4.5 → n_Fe/n_H = 1e-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, 12 + log(n_Mg/n_H)=7 → log(n_Mg/n_H)= -5 → n_Mg/n_H = 1e-5.

So for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → log(n_Fe1/n_H1) = log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun =3.16e-5.

Wait, but wait: [Fe/H] is log(n_Fe/n_H) - log(n_Fe/n_H)_sun. So if [Fe/H] is 0, then the log of their ratio is zero, so n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun.

Same for Star_2: [Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun = 1e-5.

But I'm trying to find the ratio of silicon in Star_1 and Star_2. So I need [Si/H] for each star, then compute (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2) → which is (n_Si1/n_Si2) × (n_H2/n_H1).

Wait, but that's getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, n_Si1 = (n_Si1/n_H1) * n_H1. Similarly, n_Si2 = (n_Si2/n_H2) * n_H2. So the ratio (n_Si1)/(n_Si2) = (n_Si1/n_H1)/(n_Si2/n_H2) * (n_H1/n_H2).

But unless we know n_H1 and n_H2, this might not help. Wait, but the total number of hydrogen atoms in the photosphere would depend on the star's properties, but perhaps for the purpose of this question, we can consider that the hydrogen is the same in both stars as in the Sun? Or maybe not.
