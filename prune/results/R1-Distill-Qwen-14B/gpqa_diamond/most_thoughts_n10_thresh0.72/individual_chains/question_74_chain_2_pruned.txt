Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to remember what I know.

The question says that an atom's decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance it has decayed. Wait, no, wait. Decay probability usually refers to the probability that the atom decays in a certain time period. So, if the probability is 32% in 100 minutes, that relates to the decay constant or the half-life somehow.

But wait, radioactive decay is a Poisson process, right? Each atom has a certain probability of decaying in a given time interval, and the process is memoryless. That means the probability doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. Oh wait, but wait a second. So, the process is memoryless, so knowing that 50 minutes have passed without decay doesn't change the probability for the next time period. Hmm, but let me think again.

Wait, the decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%. So I think that relates to the decay constant lambda. The formula for the probability of decay in time t is P = 1 - e^(-λt). Or wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, the survival probability after time t is S(t) = e^(-λt). So the probability of decaying by time t is 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). So the given
