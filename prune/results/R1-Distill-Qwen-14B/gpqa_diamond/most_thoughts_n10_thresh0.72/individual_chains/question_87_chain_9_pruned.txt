Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to choose the correct 1H NMR data from the options A to D.

Hmm, let's break this down. So the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. Di-substituted means there are two substituents on the benzene ring. The ring itself has 6 carbons, but the compound has 8 carbons in total. So the two substituents add 2 carbons each? Or one substituent adds 2 carbons and the other adds none? Wait, di-substituted means two substituents, each attached to the ring.

Wait, benzene is C6H6. If it's di-substituted, maybe two groups replace two Hs. So the substituents add some carbons. The total is 8 carbons. So the benzene (6 carbons) plus substituents is 8, so substituents add 2 carbons in total. So each substituent could add 1 carbon, or maybe one adds 2 and the other adds none. Let me think: For example, if one substituent is a CH3 (adds 1 carbon) and the other is a CH2X (adds 2 carbons?), but wait, no, wait. Let's think about what substituents could have a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond.

Wait, the FTIR shows a carbonyl (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen (like Cl or Br attached to the ring). So, the substituents on the benzene are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. So one substituent is a carbonyl group, and the other is a halogen.

Wait, but wait. The carbonyl could be part of a substituent. Like, maybe a ketone, ester, or something. Let me think.

So, the substituents are a carbonyl group (like -CO-R) and a halogen (like -Cl or -Br). So let's imagine the structure. The benzene ring with two substituents: one is a carbonyl-containing group, the other is a halogen.

Wait, but what's the structure of a di-substituted benzene with a carbonyl and a halogen.

Wait, another possibility is that one substituent is a carbonyl group, like an acetyl group (COCH3), and the other substituent is a halogen, like Cl. So the molecule would be something like benzene with a Cl and a COCH3 group attached.

Wait, but let's count the carbons. Benzene (6 carbons) plus substituents: Cl is a substituent (0 carbons), and COCH3 is one substituent adding two carbons (the carbonyl is O, and the CH3 is 1 carbon). So total carbons would be 6 + 0 + 2 = 8. Wait, wait, COCH3 has two carbons in the substituent (the CO is O, not C). Wait, no. The substituent is -COCH3, which is a ketone. So that's a substituent with two carbons (the C from CO and the CH3). So 6 + 0 (Cl) + 2 (COCH3) = 8. That adds up.

So the structure would be a benzene ring with a Cl and a COCH3 group attached. Di-substituted, so the substituents are in some positions relative to each other.

Now, the NMR would show signals from the aromatic protons, the COCH3 group, and possibly any other groups.

Wait, but in the options, I see some signals which are for different groups. Let's think about the possible substituents.

But wait, another possibility is that one of the substituents is an alkoxy group with a carbonyl, but perhaps that's making it more complex.

Wait, another thought: A carbonyl could be part of an ester group. Like, OCOOR, but that would add more carbons. Let me calculate.

Wait, the molecule has 8 carbons in total. Benzene (6) plus substituents. Let's see: substituents could be a carbonyl group (like a ketone, which is -CO-) but that's just one substituent. Wait, but wait: if substituents are -Cl and -COCH2R, that could add up. Wait, but perhaps it's a simpler structure.

Wait, let me think about the substituents: one substituent is halogen (like Cl), and the other is a carbonyl group. So for example, let's consider the substituents are a Cl and an acetophenone group (PhCOCH3). So the structure would be benzene with Cl and COCH3 attached.

Wait, but let's count the carbons: benzene (6) + COCH3 (2 carbons) + Cl (0) = 8? Benzene has 6, substituents are Cl (no C) and COCH3 (2 C: the CO is O, the CH3 is 1 C. Wait, COCH3 is two carbons: the carbonyl C and the CH3 C. So yes, 6 + 0 + 2 =8.

So the substituents are Cl and COCH3.

Now, we need to think about the NMR spectrum.

In the 1H NMR, what signals would we expect?

The aromatic
