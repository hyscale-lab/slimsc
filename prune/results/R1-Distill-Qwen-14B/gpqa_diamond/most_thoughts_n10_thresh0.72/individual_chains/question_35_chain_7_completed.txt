Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says that the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A_y, is represented by a 2x2 matrix. It's given as A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). I remember that h is Planck's constant, and i is the imaginary unit.

So, first, I need to write out what the matrix A_y looks like. Since c is h/(4π), multiplying each element of S by c should give me A_y. Let me compute that. 

S matrix:
Row 1: 0, -i
Row 2: i, 0

So, A_y = c * S:
Row 1: 0 * c, (-i) * c → 0, -i*c
Row 2: i * c, 0 → i*c, 0

Since c = h/(4π), substituting that in gives:
A_y matrix:
[ 0, -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π)), 0 ]

Wait, I think it's better to factor out the h/(4π) for clarity. So, let me write A_y as (h/(4π)) multiplied by the matrix with entries [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ].

Now, the problem is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. So, I need to solve the equation A_y |φ> = a |φ>, where a is the eigenvalue.

In matrix terms, that means solving (A_y - a I) |φ> = 0, where I is the identity matrix. The eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0.

Let me compute the determinant. The matrix A_y - a I is:

[ -a, -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π)), -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i*(h/(4π)))(i*(h/(4π))) ].

Calculating each part: (-a)(-a) = a². The other term is [ (-i)(i) )*(h/(4π))² ].

Wait, (-i)*(i) is (-i²) which is -(i²) = -(-1) = 1. Because i^2 is -1. So the second term is (1)*(h²)/(16 π²).

Putting it all together, det = a² - [ (h²)/(16 π²) ) * 1 ].

Wait, no, the determinant is a² minus ( [(-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π))] ). Let's compute that:

Multiply the off-diagonal terms: (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So the product is (h/(4π))² *1. So the determinant is a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

So the equation is a² = h²/(16 π²).

Taking square roots: a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but wait a second. Because the matrix A is 2x2, and S is similar to the Pauli Y matrix? Oh, wait, the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], right? So S is the Pauli Y matrix, often denoted as σ_y.

So A_y is c * σ_y, with c = h/(4π).

The eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix σ_y are ±1. Because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So when multiplied by a constant c, the eigenvalues become ±c.

So A_y has eigenvalues ± (h/(4π)).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts of ±1/2 and real parts ±1. That doesn't make sense because our A_y has real and possibly imaginary components, but the eigenvalues could be complex? Wait, no. Wait, no, because A_y is a Hermitian operator? Oh wait, is it?

Hmm. Wait, let's think about whether A is Hermitian. Because angular momentum operators are Hermitian, so their eigenvalues are real. So, if A_y is Hermitian, then all the eigenvalues should be real.

So let's check if A_y is Hermitian. The matrix A_y is (h/(4π)) * σ_y. The Pauli Y matrix is Hermitian because σ_y† = σ_y. Because the first row is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. Taking the conjugate transpose, the first column becomes [0, i], and the second becomes [-i, 0], which is the original matrix. So yes, σ_y is Hermitian. Therefore, A_y is Hermitian, so its eigenvalues must be real.

So the eigenvalues a are real numbers, ± h/(4π). So the options that mention imaginary parts in eigenvalues are incorrect. Looking at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, which can't be right because the eigenvalues are real. Similarly, option B suggests imaginary parts, which is wrong.

So options A and B are out. Now, looking at option C: The eigenfunction φ can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component Az.

Hmm. In quantum mechanics, the angular momentum components don't commute, so knowing an eigenstate of A_y does not make it an eigenstate of A² or Az? Wait, no. Wait, A² is the square of the angular momentum operator, which commutes with all components (since it's rotationally invariant). So any eigenfunction of A² can be expressed in terms of eigenfunctions of any component, like Ay, Az, etc.

Wait, but in this case, the A operator is the Y-component. So, if |φ> is an eigenfunction of Ay, then it is also an eigenfunction of A² because A² commutes with Ay. So, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². But because [Ay, Az] ≠ 0, the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az.

So option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That sounds correct. So option C is a correct statement.

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. I'm not exactly sure what that means. Basis functions usually refer to a set of functions that form a basis for the vector space. The eigenfunctions of Ay form a basis for the space, but I'm not sure if this is what the option is saying. Alternatively, the basis functions of the matrix operator might refer to the eigenvectors being the basis vectors. Since the eigenvectors of a 2x2 matrix (when diagonalizable) form a basis, that's true. So option D could be correct. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation, i.e., which statements are true as part of the process of finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

So, looking back at the options:

Option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. As I thought, since [A², Ay] = 0, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², and since [Ay, Az] is non-zero, they are not eigenfunctions of Az. So option C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. I think this is also correct because, for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors (if the matrix is diagonalizable) form a basis. So if Ay is diagonalizable, its eigenvectors form a basis. But the question is about the correctness of the statements during the calculation.

So perhaps during the calculation, you would note that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for Ay, which is option D. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct interpretation.

Wait, let's think about the options again. The question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

So let's look again. The problem says that the matrix is 2x2, so it's a two-level system. The eigenfunctions are two-dimensional vectors, and they form a basis for the space. So the eigenfunctions φ are indeed the basis functions for the operator Ay. So option D is correct.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. So, which of C and D is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the eigenvectors can be a basis, but the statement in D is about the functions being the basis functions of the operator. Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the operator Ay is a 2x2 matrix. The eigenvectors are vectors in C². So the eigenvectors of Ay form a basis for C². So statement D is correct. But what about statement C? Since the operator is part of the angular momentum, which commutes with A², the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². So statement C is correct too.

Wait, but the options are such that only one can be correct. Let me reevaluate the options.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

So which of these is correct?

I think both statements could be correct, but perhaps only one is an option. Let me recheck the eigenvalue finding.

Wait, the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). So the options A and B are incorrect because their eigenvalues have imaginary parts. So the correct eigenvalues are real, so options A and B are wrong.

So between C and D, perhaps both are correct, but the question is which is a correct statement during the calculation. Let me think about the process.

When calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay, you find that the eigenvectors form a basis (so D is correct). Also, since A^2 commutes with Ay, any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A^2 (so C is correct). But the question is about which statement will I consider correct during the calculation.

Wait, but the question gives four options, and only one is correct. So I need to reevaluate.

Wait, in reality, the eigenfunctions of any spin component (like Ay) are eigenfunctions of A² because [A², Ay] = 0. So statement C is correct. So option C is correct.

So, of the options, C and D are possible correct, but perhaps D is incorrect because the basis functions are the eigenvectors, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the statement in D says that the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. I think that is correct because, for a diagonalizable matrix, the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space on which the operator acts. So the eigenfunctions φ form a basis.

So then both C and D are correct? But the options can't have two correct. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the statements.

Wait, statement C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Which is correct. So in the process of calculation, you would find that the eigenfunctions are shared with A² because A² commutes with Ay.

Statement D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Which is also correct, as eigenvectors form a basis.

Hmm, but the problem is in the context of a multiple-choice question, so only one option is correct. Let me think about the options again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the eigenvalues. Let me recheck. The matrix A_y is (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. The eigenvalues are found by det(A_y - a I) = 0.

So,

| -a        -i c         |
| i c       -a         |

determinant is a² - (i c)(i c) = a² - (i^2 c²) = a² + c². Because i squared is -1. So determinant is a² + c² = 0.

Wait, wait! Oh no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-calculate the determinant.

The matrix is:

Row 1: -a, -i c
Row 2: i c, -a

The determinant is:

(-a)*(-a) - (-i c)*(i c) = a^2 - [ (-i)(i) c^2 ]

Calculating (-i)(i) = -i^2 = -(-1) = 1. So the determinant is a² - (1 * c²) = a² - c² = 0.

So a² = c² → a = ± c.

So c is h/(4π), so a = ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). These are real numbers, so options A and B are incorrect because they mention imaginary parts.

So, moving on, the eigenvalues are real. So the operator is Hermitian, which makes sense because it's an observable (angular momentum component).

Now, for the eigenvectors. Let's take a as +h/(4π). Then the matrix (A_y - a I) is:

[
[-h/(4π), -i h/(4π) ],
[i h/(4π), -h/(4π) ]
]

To find the eigenvector, we can solve (A_y - a I) |φ> = 0.

Let me write the equations:

Row 1: (-a) φ₁ - (i c) φ₂ = 0 → (-a) φ₁ = i c φ₂ → φ₂ = (-a/(i c)) φ₁.

Since a = c (because a = h/(4π) and c = h/(4π)), so a = c. So φ₂ = (-c/(i c)) φ₁ = (-1/i) φ₁.

But -1/i = i (since multiplying numerator and denominator by i: (-1 *i)/(i^2) )= (-i)/(-1) = i).

So φ₂ = i φ₁.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [1; i], or any scalar multiple. Similarly, for a = -c, the eigenvector would satisfy φ₂ = -i φ₁, leading to [1; -i].

So the eigenvectors are [1; i] and [1; -i], normalized.

Now, for the options:

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az.

Since A² is the square of the angular momentum, which is L_x² + L_y² + L_z², but in this case, A is for spin, so A² is the spin component squared.

In quantum mechanics, A² commutes with each component, so any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². However, since Ay and Az don't commute, the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the eigenvectors form a basis for the 2D space, this is correct. But I'm not sure if that's what the option is saying. It says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. The basis functions for the operator's matrix would be the standard basis vectors, but if the operator is diagonalizable, its eigenvectors form a basis. So in this case, since A is diagonalizable, the eigenvectors form a basis. So option D is correct.

Wait, but I have to choose between C and D as the correct answer.

Wait, the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps C is correct because it's a fact used during the calculation (knowing that A² and Ay share eigenfunctions), while D is also correct but perhaps not an accurate statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C because the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az, which is a true statement. Because in the process of finding eigenvectors, you might note that they are eigenfunctions of A² as well.

So, looking back at the options, the correct statements are C and D, but perhaps the question only allows one correct option.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the dimension. The matrix is 2x2, so the eigenvectors are two-dimensional vectors. Therefore, they form a basis for the space. So option D is correct. But also, since A² commutes with Ay, the eigenvectors are also eigenvectors of A², making option C correct.

Wait, perhaps the operator A^2 is given by (c S)^2, where S is the spin matrix. Since S is σ_y, S² is I because σ_y^2 = I.

So, A^2 = c² S² = c² I.

So, any vector is an eigenvector of A^2 with eigenvalue c².

So, the eigenvectors of Ay are also eigenvectors of A^2. So statement C is correct.

So, the correct statements are C and D. But the options given are A, B, C, D, and only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is only correct in one of them. Let me re-examine the options.

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So, the matrix operator Ay has eigenvectors that form a basis for the space, so D is correct.

But in reality, when you have a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors (if the matrix is diagonalizable) form a basis. So, D is correct.

But now I'm getting a bit stuck because both C and D seem correct. But the options can't have two correct ones, so perhaps I need to reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps option D is incorrect because the basis functions are the standard basis vectors, not the eigenvectors. But no, in the context of linear algebra, the eigenvectors can form a basis, so D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the basis functions of the operator, which might refer to the operator's matrix representation. But that’s a bit unclear.

Wait, another approach: The question is about the process of finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. During this process, which statement is correct.

Option C is about the eigenfunctions also being eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That is a correct statement.

Option D is about the eigenvectors being the basis functions of the operator. That is also correct.

But since the problem only allows one correct option, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible statements again.

Another angle: the eigenfunctions of Ay are the same as the eigenfunctions of A^2 because A² commutes with Ay. So, when you calculate the eigenfunctions of Ay, they are also eigenfunctions of A^2. So option C is correct.

So, the correct answer is C.


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( A_y \) is Hermitian because \( S \) (the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix) is Hermitian, and \( c \) is real. Hermitian operators have real eigenvalues.
   - The eigenvalues of \( S \) are \( \pm 1 \). Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm c = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).
   - Options \( A \) and \( B \) are incorrect because they suggest eigenvalues with imaginary parts, which contradicts the Hermitian nature of \( A_y \).

2. **Eigenvectors of \( A_y \):**
   - Solving \( (A_y - aI)|\phi\rangle = 0 \) for \( a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the eigenvectors are found to be proportional to \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ i \end{bmatrix} \) and \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -i \end{bmatrix} \).
   - These eigenvectors form a basis for the 2D vector space, making Option \( D \) correct.

3. **Relation to \( A^2 \) and \( A_z \):**
   - The operator \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), meaning any eigenfunction of \( A_y \) is also an eigenfunction of \( A^2 \).
   - However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).
   - This makes Option \( C \) correct.

4. **Final Decision:**
   - Both Options \( C \) and \( D \) are correct based on the analysis. However, since the question specifies choosing one correct statement during the calculation, Option \( C \) is the most relevant because it highlights the relationship between \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \), which is a key aspect of the calculation.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \).

**Answer: C**
