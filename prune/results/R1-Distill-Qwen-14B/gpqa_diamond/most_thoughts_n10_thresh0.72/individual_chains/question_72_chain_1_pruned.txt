Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question involves a series of reactions leading to a final product, and we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4. The options are A to D, with numbers ranging from 4 to 10. Hmm, this seems a bit complex, but I'll take it one step at a time.

First, I'll break down the reaction steps.

Step 1: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1.

Hmm, okay. So the starting material is this bicyclo compound with a tert-butoxy group. The other reagent is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Sodium iodide... Oh wait, sodium iodide is often used in elimination reactions, or maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution. But wait, when I think about dibromomethyl groups, they're good leaving groups. So perhaps this is a coupling reaction? Maybe a substitution where the tert-butoxy group has a good leaving group?

Wait, tert-butoxy is O-t-Bu. Wait, maybe the starting material has a leaving group like a tosylate or something, but the name says tert-butoxy, which is O-t-Bu. Oh, but wait, perhaps the starting material is a diene with an epoxide? Or maybe it's some sort of diene undergoing a reaction.

Wait, another possibility: when you have a diene and another diene with substituents, perhaps it's a Diels-Alder reaction. But wait, the starting material is a bicyclo compound, which might act as a diene or a dienophile.

Wait, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. The bicyclo structure is norbornene, I think. Norbornene is a bicyclic diene, which is a common dienophile in Diels-Alder reactions.

So, maybe product 1 is formed by a Diels-Alder between the norbornene and the other diene, which is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Wait, but the other molecule has two dibromomethyl groups at positions 5 and 6. So perhaps each dibromomethyl can undergo substitution.

Wait, but the reaction is with two equivalents of that diene. So each of the dibromomethyl groups might react. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of the norbornene. But I'm a bit confused there.

Wait, another approach
