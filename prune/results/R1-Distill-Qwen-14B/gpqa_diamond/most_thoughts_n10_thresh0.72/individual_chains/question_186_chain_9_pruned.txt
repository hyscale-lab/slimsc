Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about the Cope rearrangement, which I remember is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. The molecule given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Hmm, I need to figure out what product it forms when it undergoes a Cope rearrangement.

First, I should probably draw the structure of the starting material to visualize it better. Bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene has a norbornene-like structure. The substituents are at positions 1 and 4. Oh wait, and there's a vinyl group on the 2-azabicyclo part. So the structure is a bicyclic compound with a nitrogen in the ring, and a vinyl group attached.

Wait, the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane system has bridgehead atoms at positions 1, 4, and 5. So the 2-azabicyclo would mean the nitrogen is at position 2. So the structure is a bridge with N at position 2. The substituent is a vinyl group on carbon 2.

Now, the Cope rearrangement occurs in 1,5-dienes, right? So the molecule must have two double bonds separated by three single bonds. Wait, or is it a single conjugated diene? No, the Cope rearrangement involves 1,5-dienes, meaning the two double bonds are separated by three single bonds. So the molecule should have a conjugated diene or something that can form such a system.

Looking at the starting material: 2-vinyl... So the vinyl group is CH2CH2, but wait, the vinyl is attached to the bicyclo system. So perhaps the bicyclo has a double bond as part of the ring, and the vinyl group adds another double bond. Let me think: the bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene has a double bond between carbons 5 and 6 perhaps? Wait, bicyclo numbering can be tricky.

Wait, the structure of bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene: the bridge is between carbons 1 and
