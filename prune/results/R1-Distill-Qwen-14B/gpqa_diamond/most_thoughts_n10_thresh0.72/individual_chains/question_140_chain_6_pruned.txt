Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question describes a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. When they react, they release a gas W, form a precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K, which is close to 0 degrees Celsius because 273 K is 0 C, so 277 would be about 4 C. Hmm, I wonder what B could be. Maybe something that's a solid at that temperature, maybe a metal?

Gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons in its molecule. Oh wait, the molecule's neutron and proton count are equal. So W is an element where each atom has equal protons and neutrons? Or the molecule as a whole? Wait, the question says 'gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.' Oh, wait, each molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. So each molecule's total protons equals total neutrons. So perhaps the molecule is something like H2O? No, because for H2O, each molecule has 2 H (each has 1 proton) and O which has 8 protons. So total protons would be 10, but neutrons would be 8 (for O-16). 10â‰ 8. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe it's CO2? Let me think. CO
