Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, parallax is involved. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Right, the formula I think is distance equals 1 over parallax. Or wait, no, wait, I think it's that the distance (in parsecs) is the reciprocal of the parallax (in arcseconds). So, distance r is approximately 1 / plx. Or more accurately, r = 1 / plx, but I might be mixing units a bit. Anyway, the key is that there's an inverse relationship between parallax and distance.

So the number of stars varies as 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that down. N ∝ 1/plx^5. But wait, since r is proportional to 1/plx, maybe I can express plx in terms of r. So plx = 1/r. Let me substitute that. So N is proportional to 1/( (1/r)^5 ). Because plx is 1/r, so plx^5 is (1/r)^5. So 1 over that is r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

Wait, but wait, I'm thinking about how the number of stars relates to the volume. Because the number of stars in a region of space would generally depend on the volume. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So if the density of stars is uniform, then the number of stars would go as r³. But this question is saying that the number varies differently with parallax. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, the question says how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Oh, so perhaps they're considering the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r, with thickness dr. That makes sense because when you're looking at a given range of distance, you're looking at a volume of a shell, not a sphere.

So the number of stars in a shell of radius r and thickness dr would depend on the volume of that shell and the density of stars in that region. But wait, the problem says that the number of stars varies as 1/(plx)^5. So let's get back to that.

Since r = 1/plx, then plx = 1/r. So plx^5
