Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, but I'm a bit confused. Let me read through it again and see if I can break it down step by step.

So, the question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five such compounds. The substances are labeled A1 to A5, and each has different properties.

Starting with A1: It's a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. The oF for A2 is 31.96%. Wait, oF usually stands for oxidation state or maybe oxygen-free, but in this context, I think it refers to the oxygen-free percentage, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the oxygen's percentage or something else. Hmm, maybe it's the oxygen-free equivalent. Alternatively, perhaps it's the oxygen percentage in the compound. Or wait, could it be the percentage of fluorine? Because later it says A1 oxidizes xenon. Xenon is a noble gas, and if it's oxidized, that means it's being converted into a higher oxidation state. So perhaps A1 is a strong oxidizing agent.

A1 decomposes into A2 and F2 (fluorine gas). So the decomposition reaction might be something like A1 → A2 + F2. Let me write that down.

The oF for A2 is 31.96%. Wait, perhaps that's the oxygen-free equivalent, meaning the fluorine content. Alternatively, maybe it's the percentage of fluorine in A2. Let me calculate what 31.96% corresponds to. If it's the mass percentage of F in A2, then perhaps I can find the formula of A2.

Wait, element Y is the other component in these compounds. So Y and F make up these substances. So A1, A2, etc., are all YFₓ compounds.

So when A1 decomposes into A2 and F2, the fluorine could be being released. Let me think about the possible decomposition reactions.

For example, if A1 is YF_a, then upon decomposition, it could produce YF_b (A2) and F2. Let me model that. The reaction would
