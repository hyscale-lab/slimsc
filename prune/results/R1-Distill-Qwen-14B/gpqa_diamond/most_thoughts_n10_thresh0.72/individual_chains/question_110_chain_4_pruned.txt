Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars detectable by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm. Let me think through this. 

First, what's the question again? It asks which stars can be detected by both spectrographs. The key here is understanding each instrument's brightness limit. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes up to 17, and HIRES up to 16. So a star has to be brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 for HIRES. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 V mag can be observed. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no, the wording is: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Wait, I'm getting confused. Brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So if a star has V magnitude brighter than 17, that means magnitude less than 17. Because lower magnitude is brighter. So, ESPRESSO can see down to 17 mag. So any star with V mag ≤17 is observable? Or is it stars brighter than (so V mag <17)? Because I think the brightness limit is such that if a star's V magnitude is lower than the limit, it's brighter than that limit. So for example, if a telescope can see up to V=17, then stars brighter than V=17 (i.e., V less than 17) are within their limits. So, a star must have apparent V magnitude ≤17 for ESPRESSO, and ≤16 for HIRES. So for a star to be detectable by both, it must have V magnitude ≤16 because that's the stricter condition.

Wait, but let me double-check. The question says: with ESPRESSO, stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17
