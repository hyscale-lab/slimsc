Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to tackle it step by step. The question describes a series of reactions starting from Compound A, which is C3H6. I remember that C3H6 is propene because propene has the formula C3H6 (it's an alkene). 

So, the first reaction is bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Bromination of alkenes typically goes through a bromination reaction, probably an addition reaction. Since propene has a double bond between C1 and C2, adding bromine would give 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, but wait, I think when you brominate propene (which is CH2=CHCH3), the bromine adds across the double bond. So the product, compound B, would be 1,2-dibromopropane. The formula would be C3H5Br2, right?

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and is used for dehydrohalogenation, which is an elimination reaction. Since compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane, when treated with alcoholic KOH, it should eliminate two HBr molecules. Wait, but wait, 1,2-dibromopropane has two adjacent Br atoms. So when KOH (a base) is present, it would abstract a β-hydrogen leading to the formation of a double bond. Since both Brs are on adjacent carbons, the elimination would lead to the formation of either 1-propene or 2-propene, but wait, propene is the same as propene because it's symmetric in a way. Wait, wait. Let me think again. Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? No, wait, no. Let me correct that. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond. So the structure would be CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, no. No, wait, adding Br2 to propene (CH2=CHCH3) would give 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH2BrCHBrCH3. So when this reacts with alcoholic KOH, the base would abstract a β hydrogen adjacent to a Br. Which Br would it abstract? Let's see. The structure is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. Each CH2Br is on the first and second carbon. So when KOH abstracts a hydrogen from the adjacent carbon, perhaps the first carbon's hydrogen or the second's. Wait, let me draw it.

Structure of 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So each Br is on C1 and C2. When KOH (alcoholic) is added, the base will abstract a hydrogen from a carbon adjacent to Br. So, for C1, the adjacent H is on C2, but C2 already has a Br. So perhaps the H is on C2, but wait, that's the same as the Br. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation where each Br can eliminate. Wait, maybe it's a double elimination. Oh wait, but 1,2-d
