Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

So, there's this civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and they've built a super fast spaceship that can go at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The aliens live about 150 solar years on average. They want to go to Earth, and the astronaut is 22 years old. The question is, from the astronaut's perspective, how long will the trip take? The options are A to D, and A says the astronaut will die before reaching Earth. The others are numbers like 72, 81, 77 years.

Hmm. I remember something about time dilation in relativity. Right, when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time slows down from the perspective of an outside observer. But wait, this is from the astronaut's point of view, so I think we're dealing with length contraction here, because in their frame, Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud are moving, making the distance shorter.

Wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is a galaxy. How far is that from Earth? I'm not exactly sure, but I think it's about 160,000 light-years away. But wait, the problem doesn't give the distance. Oh, that's a problem. Wait, the question says, the spacecraft is going to Earth, so the distance must be the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. So, I need to know that distance to compute the time.

Wait, maybe the problem is assuming that the distance is known because the time from Earth's frame would be distance divided by speed, but the astronaut's experienced time is less due to time dilation or length contraction.

Wait, the problem says "from the point of view of the astronaut." So I need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut, which is less than the coordinate time in Earth's frame.

Proper time, tau, is given by the Lorentz factor multiplied by the time experienced in Earth's frame. Or wait, the formula is tau equals t multiplied by the square root of (1 - v²/c²). Because tau is the proper time, the shortest time measured in the moving frame.

But wait, how do I find the time in Earth's frame? I think the time in Earth's frame is the distance between the two points divided by the speed of the spaceship.

But wait, the distance between
