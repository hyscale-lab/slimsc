Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The system's state at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So, that's a vector in three-dimensional space. The observable is represented by matrix P, which has specific elements.

Wait, the question asks for the probability that measuring the observable P will yield 0. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is found by calculating the squared modulus of the projection of the state onto the corresponding eigenvector.

So first, I think I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix P. Because the possible outcomes of the measurement are the eigenvalues, and the probability is given by the squared inner product of the state vector with the eigenvector.

Looking at matrix P: the first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Hmm. Let me write that out to visualize better.

P = [
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
]

So, it's a 3x3 matrix. The first thing I should probably do is find its eigenvalues. Because the possible results of the measurement are the eigenvalues, and I'm looking for the probability that the outcome is 0.

Wait, but how do I find the eigenvalues of this matrix? I remember that eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

Alternatively, maybe I can look for patterns or symmetries in the matrix P. Let me see.

Looking at P, it's a symmetric matrix, so it should have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors. That's helpful because symmetric matrices are diagonalizable.

Let me try to find the eigenvalues. Let's consider (P - λI) and compute its determinant.

So, the matrix P - λI would be:

[
[-λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ]
]

The determinant of this matrix is:

| -λ      1/sqrt(2)     0     |
| 1/sqrt(2)  -λ    1/sqrt(2) |
| 0       1/sqrt(2)   -λ     |

Calculating the determinant. Hmm, maybe it's easier to expand along the first row.

det = (-λ) * det [(-λ, 1/sqrt(2)), (1/sqrt(2), -λ)] 
        - (1/sqrt(2)) * det [ (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)), (0, -λ) ]
        + 0 * ... 

Wait, the expansion would be:

= (-λ) * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] 
- (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 ) ]
+ 0 (so third term is zero)

Calculating each part:

First term: (-λ) [ λ² - (1/2) ) ] = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2)

Second term: -(1/sqrt(2)) [ (-λ)/sqrt(2) - 0 ) ] = -(1/sqrt(2)) * (-λ/sqrt(2)) ) = (λ)/2 

So putting it together:

det = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2 )

Expanding the first term: -λ^3 + (λ/2) + λ/2

So combining like terms: -λ^3 + (λ/2 + λ/2) = -λ^3 + λ.

So the determinant is (-λ^3 + λ) = 0.

Set this equal to zero: -λ^3 + λ = 0 → λ (-λ² +1 ) = 0 → λ (1 - λ² ) = 0.

So the solutions are λ = 0, λ=1, and λ=-1.

Wait, wait a minute. So the eigenvalues are 1, -1, and 0? That makes sense because the trace of P is 0. Let me check the trace: P's diagonal elements are 0, 0, 0. Oh wait, wait! Wait, no, looking again, P's diagonal elements are 0, 0, 0. So the trace is 0,
