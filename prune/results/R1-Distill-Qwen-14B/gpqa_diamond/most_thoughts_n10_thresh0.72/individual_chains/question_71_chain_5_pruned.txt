Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

So, the setup is five exoplanets in orbital resonance with periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. They found them using the TTV method, but I don't think that's relevant here. The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... I remember that depends on their distance from the star and their albedo. Oh, right, the formula is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)), where R is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital distance. But wait, albedo comes into play too. The albedo (which is the same for all planets here) affects the absorbed light. So the formula should account for that.

The formula I think is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( (1 - A) / (2 * a) ), where A is the albedo. But wait, no, wait. I think the formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4). Yeah, because the equilibrium temperature depends on the stellar flux they receive. The flux is proportional to (L/(4πa²)), and L is related to the star's radius and temperature via the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR_star²σT_star^4. So putting it together, the flux S is S = (L/(4πa²)) = (R_star² T_star^4 σ) / (a²). 

Then, the planet absorbs (1 - A) * S. The energy balance for equilibrium is that the absorbed energy equals the emitted energy (blackbody radiation). So (1 - A) S = 4π R_planet² σ T_eq^4. Oh wait, but R_planet is negligible here because we're comparing planets with the same star. So simplifying, I think the equilibrium temperature is proportional to sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4). 

Wait, let's get the exact formula. The equilibrium temperature T_eq is given by:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( ( (1 - A) R_star )/( 2 a ) )

Wait, no.
