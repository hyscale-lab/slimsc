Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. It's about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) plus a neutrino, nu. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are four possible pairs of kinetic energies for the muon and neutrino.

Hmm, I remember that in particle decay, especially when the parent is at rest, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, its initial momentum is zero. After decay, the products must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. So the muon and neutrino will have equal and opposite momenta.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they are leptons, almost massless. Oh right, in reality, neutrinos do have mass, but for the purpose of many problems, especially older ones, we might approximate them as massless. I'm not sure if that's the case here. Let me think: the problem gives me the rest mass of the pion and muon, but not the neutrino. So I guess we're treating the neutrino as massless.

So, the decay is Pi+ → mu+ + nu. Let's denote the energies of the muon and neutrino as E_mu and E_nu, and their momenta as p_mu and p_nu. Because of momentum conservation, p_mu = -p_nu → their magnitudes are equal, p_mu = p_nu = p.

Since the pion is initially at rest, its energy is just its rest energy, E_pi = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

The total energy after decay must equal the initial energy. So E_pi = E_mu + E_nu.

Each particle's energy can be expressed in terms of their rest mass and momentum. The muon isn't massless, so E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ), and since the neutrino is considered massless, E_nu = p c * c? Wait, no. Wait, the energy of a photon would be E = pc, but neutrino is a lepton, but if m_nu is taken as zero, then E_nu = p c. But I'm a bit confused about the units here because the question gives masses in MeV/c². Hmm.

Let me think in terms of units. I'll work in units where c=1, which is common in particle physics. So, E = sqrt(p² + m²), with m in MeV/c², and p in MeV/c. So E would be in MeV.

So, E_pi = E_mu + E_nu.

But since the neutrino is massless, E_nu = p. And the muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2). So substituting, we get:

m_pi = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p.

Wait, no. Because E_pi is m_pi (since it's at rest). So m_pi = E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p.

So, m_pi = sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p.

Let me rearrange this equation to solve for p. Let me subtract p from both sides:

m_pi - p = sqrt(p² + m_mu²).

Square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(m_pi - p)^2 = p² + m_mu².

Expand the left side:

m_pi² - 2 m_pi p + p² = p² + m_mu².

Subtract p² from both sides:

m_pi² - 2 m_pi p = m_mu².

Rearranged:

m_pi² - m_mu²
