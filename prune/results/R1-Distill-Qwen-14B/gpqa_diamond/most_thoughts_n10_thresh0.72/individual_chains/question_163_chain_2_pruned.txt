Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because stoichiometry and dissolution reactions can get tricky. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The problem says: We need to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Then, determine the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required, and also find the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D.

First, I should figure out what Fe(OH)3 is. I remember that Fe(OH)3 is ferric hydroxide. It's a weak base, I think. So when it dissolves in water, it will react with water, but more importantly, when we add an acid, it will neutralize it.

Wait, but in this case, we're not just adding any acid; we're adding a strong monobasic acid. Monobasic means it donates one H+ per molecule, like HCl or HNO3. And strong acid implies it's fully ionized in solution.

So the reaction should be Fe(OH)3 reacting with the strong acid. The general reaction for a metal hydroxide with a strong acid is:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O

But wait, wait, let me get the equation right. Fe(OH)3 is a base. So when it reacts with an acid, like a strong acid HX (monobasic), it should produce Fe^3+ ions and water. The acid provides H+ ions.

So the balanced equation should be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O

Each mole of Fe(OH)3 consumes 3 moles of H+.

Now, let's calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3 we have. The mass is 0.1 g. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So:

Fe: 55.85
O: 3 * 16 = 48
H: 3 * 1 = 3
Total molar mass = 55.85 + 48 +3 = 106.85 g/mol

Moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. Let me compute that more accurately. 0.1 / 106.85 is approximately 0.0009358 moles.

Each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ from the acid. So moles of H+ needed = 0.0009358 * 3 ≈ 0.0028074 mol.

The acid used is 0.1 M HX (assuming it's a monobasic strong acid like HCl; concentration is 0.1 mol/L). The volume needed (V) is moles / concentration. So V = 0.0028074 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028074 L. Which is 28.074 cm³. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³. That's very close. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Wait, I think I should double-check the molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Let me recount:

Fe: 55.845 g/mol
Each OH group: 16 + 1 =17 g/mol. So three OH groups: 3 * 17 =51. So total molar mass is 55.845 +51= 106.845 g/mol. So 0.1 g is 0.1 /106.845 ≈ 0.0009358 mol.

So 3 times that is 0.0028074 mol H+ needed.

The acid is 0.1 M, so volume is 0.0028074 / 0.1 = 0.028074 L → 28.074 cm³. So the minimum volume is about 28.07 cm³. The options have C as 28.05 cm³, which is almost that. So option C is looking good for the volume part.

But wait, the question says "minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid" needed. So that's correct because we're using the exact amount of H+ needed to neutralize the Fe(OH)3.

So the first part of the question is answered: approx 28.07 cm³. So the volume option in the answers is C (28.05) or maybe D is 20.40, which is way less. So volume-wise, C is the right choice.

Now, the second part is the pH of the resulting solution. So after adding enough H+ to dissolve Fe(OH)3, what's the pH?

Wait, when Fe(OH)3 reacts with the acid, it forms Fe^3+ and water. So the solution will contain Fe^3+ ions. But Fe^3+ is a Lewis acid and can undergo hydrolysis in water to produce H+ ions, which would lower the pH.

So the solution will be acidic due to the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

So the pH depends on the concentration of Fe^3+ in the solution.

Let me think about the solution composition. The total volume is 100 cm³ plus the volume of acid added. Wait, wait, that's a point I may have missed. Oh wait, the problem says the total volume is 100 cm³. Oh, wait! Wait, the question says: "dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume." So the total solution volume is 100 cm³. That includes the acid added. Or is the acid added on top of that?

Wait, that's a critical point. Let me read the question again: "We would like to dissolve... in 100 cm3
