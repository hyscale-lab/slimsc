Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed. Hmm, what does that mean? Uniformly distributed probably implies that the number of stars is the same per unit volume throughout space. So, stars aren't clustered more densely in some areas than others. That makes sense because it's a basic assumption in many astronomical models.

The question asks how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Parallax is a measure of distance; the larger the parallax, the closer the star is because parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Wait, no, wait, wait. I remember that parallax (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So, if a star has a parallax of 1", it's 1 parsec away. If it's 0.5", it's 2 parsecs away. So, as parallax increases, the distance decreases.

Now, the key is to relate the number of stars per unit parallax range. Let's think about this.

If stars are uniformly distributed in space, their number density (number per unit volume) is constant. So, the number of stars in a given volume depends on the size of that volume.

But how does that translate to parallax? Well, parallax relates to distance, so the volume around us at a certain distance would determine how many stars we see with that parallax.

Wait, let's think in terms of distance. Parallax (p) is 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So d = 1/p.

The number of stars per unit volume is constant, let's call it n (number per cubic parsec). So the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr is approximately n * 4πd² dr. The 4πd² comes from the surface area of the sphere multiplied by dr (the volume element).

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So, I need to express everything in terms of parallax (p) instead of distance (d).

Since p = 1/d, d = 1/p. So, let's substitute d in terms of p. Then, dr is the change in distance,
