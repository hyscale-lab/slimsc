Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = ½ m ω² r². I remember that in a harmonic oscillator, the potential is like a spring, so the force is Hooke's law, F = -kr, but with k = m ω². Right, because Hooke's law is F = -kx, so comparing that, yeah, k here is m ω squared.

The question asks for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the same energy eigenvalue. The options are A to D.

Hmm, so I need to figure out the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator and then determine the degeneracy (number of eigenfunctions) for that state.

Wait, I remember that in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized. The energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Oh right, for a 3D oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). Alternatively, sometimes it's written as E = ħω (n + 3/2), where n is the total quantum number, n = n_x + n_y + n_z.

Wait, but wait. Another way to think about it is that each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω. So adding them up gives (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. So the energy is (n + 3/2) ħω, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z.

Now, the problem is about the third excited state. Wait, what's the ground state and the excited states here?

The ground state is the lowest energy state. For each direction, n_x, n_y, n_z are zero. So n = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. That's the ground state, energy E = (0 + 3/
