Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of IUPAC nomenclature. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about a benzene ring with several substituents. The substituents are a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to each other. That means each of these is spaced three positions apart from the others. So, if I imagine the benzene ring, carboxylic acid is at position 1, then the next meta would be position 4. Wait, no, because meta is two positions away. Actually, in a benzene ring, each substituent being meta to each other would mean that each is separated by two carbons. So if one is at position 1, the next meta would be at 3, and another at 5, perhaps?

Wait, no, that's not quite right. For three groups all being meta to each other, they must form a sort of triangle on the ring. So, for a benzene ring, if the first substituent is at position 1, the next meta would be at 3, but then where would the third be? Because 3 is meta to 1, but 5 is meta to 3, and 5 is also meta to 1? Hmm, maybe that's not possible. Wait, maybe they're arranged in such a way that each is meta to the other two. Hmm, perhaps it's a 1,3,
