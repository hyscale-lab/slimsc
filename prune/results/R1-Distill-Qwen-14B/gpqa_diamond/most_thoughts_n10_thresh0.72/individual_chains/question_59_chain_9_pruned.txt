Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these pH calculations. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: Determine the pH of the solution made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D, with some numbers.

Hmm. Right, so first things first, I need to figure out what happens when these three solutions are mixed together. Since they're all acids and bases, I think I need to find out whether the mixture is acidic, basic, or neutral, and then calculate the pH accordingly.

Let's list out the components:

1. 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH). Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. But for this problem, I might have to consider any reactions it has with other components.

2. 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it will completely dissociate into H+ and Cl- ions.

3. 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will dissociate completely. Each molecule gives two OH- ions, I think. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH-.

Wait, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base.

But the problem is, I have multiple acids and a base. So I need to calculate the total moles of H+ from the acids and the total moles of OH- from the base, then see if there's excess H+ or OH- after the neutralization.

So first, let me calculate the moles for each component:

Molarity (M) is moles per liter, so moles = M * Volume (in liters).

For CH3COOH:
Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L. Moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Since it's a weak acid, it won't fully dissociate, but maybe it's better to consider it after neutralization.

For HCl:
Volume = 400 mL = 0.4 L. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. HCl is strong, so it gives 0.08 moles of H+.

For Ba(OH)2:
Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so total OH- moles = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, wait. So the H+ comes from HCl and any that comes from CH3COOH. But since CH3COOH is weak, maybe I should first figure out how much H+ is neutralized by OH- from Ba(OH)2.

But wait, the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react with the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH.

So let's add up all the H+ available and subtract the OH-.

So total H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles. From CH3COOH, initially, it's a weak acid, so it contributes some H+, but perhaps a small amount. But since we have OH- present, the OH- will first react with the strong acid's H+ because it's a stronger acid.

Wait, but in solution, H+ ions from any source will combine with OH-.

So the initial H+ is only from HCl because CH3COOH doesn't dissociate fully, but the OH- is strong, so it will react with all available H+.

But wait, when you mix all these solutions, the H+ from HCl will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2. Similarly, any excess OH- would react with other H+ sources.

Wait, maybe I should compute the total moles of H+ and the total moles of OH-.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

Total H+ from CH3COOH: Let's think. Since CH3COOH is a weak acid, it doesn't release a lot of H+ initially. But when you mix it with a base, the solution's pH might depend on which is in excess. Wait, perhaps I should first compute how much H+ and OH- are there before considering any reactions between acid and base.

But wait, another approach: when you mix all three solutions, the total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 L.

So the concentrations in the mixed solution would be based on the total volume.

But the problem is that the acid (CH3COOH) and the base (Ba(OH)2) will react. So the first step is to find out the net moles of H+ or OH- after neutralization.

Let me think. The H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. The OH- comes from Ba(OH)2.

But HCl is a strong acid, so it will donate all its H+ (0.08 mol). CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it will contribute some H+, but perhaps I can treat it as a negligible amount for the neutralization reaction with OH-? Or maybe not.

Wait, no. Because the OH

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about pH calculations. But I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂). I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other, so I think I need to find out if the mixture results in a neutral solution, an acidic one, or a basic one. Then, based on that, calculate the pH.

First, I think I should calculate the moles of each acid and base. Because when you mix them, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the bases. The excess will determine the pH.

Let me start by calculating the moles for each component.

For CH3COOH:
Molarity (M) is moles per liter. So I have 0.1 M in 0.5 liters (500 mL). Moles = M * V. So 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Since acetic acid is a weak acid, it doesn't fully dissociate, but when mixed with a strong base, I think it will donate H+ ions.

For HCl:
0.2 M in 0.4 liters. So 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it fully dissociates into H+ and Cl-.

For Ba(OH)₂:
Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base. Each formula unit produces 2 OH- ions. The volume is 0.3 liters, concentration 0.3 M. So moles of Ba(OH)₂ is 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But since each mole gives 2 OH-, the total moles of OH- would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but Ba(OH)₂ is a base, so it will provide OH- ions, while the acids provide H+. So the reaction between H+ and OH- will be like H+ + OH- → H2O. So first, I need to find the total H+ and OH- available.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the H+ sources. CH3COOH is a weak acid, but HCl is a strong acid. So when I mix all these, the H+ comes from both HCl and the dissociation of acetic acid. But when reacting with OH-, the OH- will first neutralize the available H+ (including from HCl and any that can come from the acetic acid).

Wait, but when you mix them, the total H+ comes from both HCl and CH3COOH. But because HCl is a strong acid, it will fully dissociate, so all its H+ will be available immediately. The acetic acid, being weak, won't donate all its H+ at once, but in the presence of OH-, it will dissociate more. Hmm, but maybe it's easier to first calculate the total H+ and OH- before any reactions, then see what's left after neutralization.

Wait, but wait: The total H+ available is from HCl and any that can be provided by CH3COOH. The OH- comes from Ba(OH)₂. But when these are mixed, the OH- will react with H+ from both sources.

But maybe it's better to think of all H+ and OH- as available for neutralization. Let me calculate the total H+ and total OH-.

H+ sources:
- HCl: 0.08 mol H+ (since each HCl gives one H+)
- CH3COOH: Let
