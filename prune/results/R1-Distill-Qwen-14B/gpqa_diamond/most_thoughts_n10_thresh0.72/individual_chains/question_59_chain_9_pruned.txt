Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about pH calculations. But I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂). I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other, so I think I need to find out if the mixture results in a neutral solution, an acidic one, or a basic one. Then, based on that, calculate the pH.

First, I think I should calculate the moles of each acid and base. Because when you mix them, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the bases. The excess will determine the pH.

Let me start by calculating the moles for each component.

For CH3COOH:
Molarity (M) is moles per liter. So I have 0.1 M in 0.5 liters (500 mL). Moles = M * V. So 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Since acetic acid is a weak acid, it doesn't fully dissociate, but when mixed with a strong base, I think it will donate H+ ions.

For HCl:
0.2 M in 0.4 liters. So 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it fully dissociates into H+ and Cl-.

For Ba(OH)₂:
Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base. Each formula unit produces 2 OH- ions. The volume is 0.3 liters, concentration 0.3 M. So moles of Ba(OH)₂ is 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But since each mole gives 2 OH-, the total moles of OH- would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but Ba(OH)₂ is a base, so it will provide OH- ions, while the acids provide H+. So the reaction between H+ and OH- will be like H+ + OH- → H2O. So first, I need to find the total H+ and OH- available.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the H+ sources. CH3COOH is a weak acid, but HCl is a strong acid. So when I mix all these, the H+ comes from both HCl and the dissociation of acetic acid. But when reacting with OH-, the OH- will first neutralize the available H+ (including from HCl and any that can come from the acetic acid).

Wait, but when you mix them, the total H+ comes from both HCl and CH3COOH. But because HCl is a strong acid, it will fully dissociate, so all its H+ will be available immediately. The acetic acid, being weak, won't donate all its H+ at once, but in the presence of OH-, it will dissociate more. Hmm, but maybe it's easier to first calculate the total H+ and OH- before any reactions, then see what's left after neutralization.

Wait, but wait: The total H+ available is from HCl and any that can be provided by CH3COOH. The OH- comes from Ba(OH)₂. But when these are mixed, the OH- will react with H+ from both sources.

But maybe it's better to think of all H+ and OH- as available for neutralization. Let me calculate the total H+ and total OH-.

H+ sources:
- HCl: 0.08 mol H+ (since each HCl gives one H+)
- CH3COOH: Let
