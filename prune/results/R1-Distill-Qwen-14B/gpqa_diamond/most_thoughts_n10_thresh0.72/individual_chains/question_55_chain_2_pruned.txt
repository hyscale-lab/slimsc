Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Hmm, let's see. The compound is an organic one, and I need to figure out which structure it is based on the given 1H NMR data. The options are between different propenyl and butenyl acetates, both cis and trans.

Wait, the options are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, Trans-butenyl acetate. So all of them are esters, probably with either a propene or butene chain attached to the acetate.

The NMR data given is: 7.0 (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz), 5.5 (1H, dq), 2.1 (3H, s), and 1.6 (3H, d). Let me break this down.

First, the 2.1 ppm singlet integrating for 3H is likely a methyl group attached to something deshielded. Since acetates have an ester group, that could be the acetyl group, like OAc. So the acetate's methyl group would be around 2.1 ppm as a singlet, which matches. So that part makes sense.

Next, the 1.6 ppm doublet integrating for 3H. A doublet usually means coupling with one neighboring proton. So this is likely a methyl group adjacent to a CH2 or another CH. But wait, let's think about the structures. Both propenyl and butenyl groups would have different structures. For example, propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but wait, no. Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CH2- something? Wait, no, propenyl groups are CH2=CHCH2-O-... no, wait, acetate would be R-O-CO-O-R? No, no, acetate esters are R-O-CO-CH3. So in propenyl acetate, R is propenyl, which could be CH2=CHCH2-O-... no, wait, propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-... but that's the structure for propyl, no. Wait, maybe I'm getting the structures wrong.

Let me correct that. Acetate esters have the structure R-O-CO-CH3. So the R group is the alkyl or alkenyl group we're considering. So for propenyl acetate, R is CH2CH2CH2? No, that's propyl. Wait, no. Propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2-O-. No, wait, wait. Propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2- as an substituent. But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the possible structures.

Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- group. So propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-Me. Similarly, butenyl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-CO-Me, but depending on the position of the double bond.

Wait, but the options are either propenyl or butenyl. So the structure could be either:

Cis-propenyl acetate: CH2=CH
