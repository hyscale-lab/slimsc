Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. But the real crux is two parts: part A and part B.

Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism. The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I remember that tautomerism involves the movement of a hydrogen atom and a shift in double bonds, like between enols and ketones or something similar. So I need to think about each of these compounds.

Benzoquinone—I think benzoquinone has two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups opposite each other. So it's benzene with two O's attached, each as ketones. Because of the ring structure, maybe it can't undergo tautomerism. Wait, but wait—tautomerism usually requires adjacent hydrogen and double bonds that can shift. Benzoquinone's structure is more like a di-ketone on a benzene ring. I'm trying to think if that can lead to enol formation. Enols are when a hydrogen moves from a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group, forming a double bond. But in benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are on adjacent carbons? No, wait, benzoquinone has the two ketones on opposite positions of the benzene ring, so they're para to each other. So each is a carbonyl group, but in a fully conjugated system. So perhaps they can't easily form enols because the adjacent hydrogens are not in a position to shift. Or maybe the ring structure isn't conducive to enol formation because the necessary H isn't available. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone does undergo tautomerism?

Wait, another approach: which of these compounds can form enols? Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. Wait, three ketones in a row? So the structure is O
