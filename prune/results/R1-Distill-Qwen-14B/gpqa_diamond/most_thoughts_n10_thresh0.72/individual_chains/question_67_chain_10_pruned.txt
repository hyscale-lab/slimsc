Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals and their angular momentum. Hmm, let me try to unpack it step by step. 

So the question says that there are two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. I remember that for an electron in a p orbital, the orbital angular momentum quantum number l is 1. So each electron has l1 = 1 and l2 = 1, right?

The state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, so l is the total orbital angular momentum. Let me think: when you couple two angular momenta, l1 and l2, each being 1, the possible total l values can be l1 + l2, l1 + l2 -1, ..., down to |l1 - l2|. So 1 +1 is 2, and 0 is possible too. So l can be 2,1,0 in this case. But the state here is |2, -1>, so l=2 and m=-1.

The question asks about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ħ. So each electron's orbital angular momentum in the z-direction is being measured. Since each has l=1, their possible m values (m1 and m2) can be -1, 0, +1. 

But the state is given as a coupled state, so I think I need to express this coupled state in terms of the product of individual states. The coupled state |1,1,2,-1> is part of the total angular momentum. To find the probability, I should expand this state in terms of the product of |l1, m1> and |l2, m2> states.

Wait, the coupled angular momentum states are a combination of the product states. So the state |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1> must be a linear combination of all possible |m1, m2> such that m1 + m2 = m = -1.

So possible (m1, m2) pairs would be:
(-1, 0), (0, -1). Because -1 + 0 = -1, and 0 + (-1) = -1.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> can be written as a combination of |1,-1>|1,0> and |1,0>|1,-1>, but I think there's a specific coefficient for each.

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two l=1 states into l=2. For m = -1, which combination gives m1 + m2 = -1? Let me recall the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. 

The state |l=2, m=-1> is formed from the product states where m1 + m2 = -1. So m1 can be -1 and m2 0, or m1 0 and m2 -1. But I need to find the coefficients for each.

The general formula is:

|l, m> = sum_{m1, m2} [ <l1 l2; m1 m2 | l m> ] |l1 m1> |l2 m2>

So for l=2 and m=-1, the possible (m1, m2) pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1). 

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for each term can be looked up or derived. I think for l=2, m=-1, the coefficients are sqrt( (2 - (-1)) / (4*(2 +1)) ) ) or something like that. Wait, perhaps it's better to remember specific cases.

Wait, for two spin-1 (or l=1) particles combining to l=2, the state |2, -1> should be a combination of |1,-1>|1,0> and |1,0>|1,-1>.

The coefficients can be found from the formula. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for |l=2, m=-1> is:

sqrt( (2(2+1) - (m1 + m2)(m1 + m2 +1) ) / ( (2l1 +1)(2l2 +1) ) ) ) ?

Wait, maybe I should look up the specific coefficients. I recall that for l1 = l2 =1, the coefficients for l=2, m=-2 is 1/√3 |1, -1>|1, -1>, but that's for m=-2.

Wait, for l=2, m = -1: the state is a combination of |1,-1>|1,0> and |1,0>|1,-1>. Let me think about the normalization.

The coefficient for each term would be sqrt( (2 - m1)(2 + m2 +1) ) / something. Hmm, maybe
