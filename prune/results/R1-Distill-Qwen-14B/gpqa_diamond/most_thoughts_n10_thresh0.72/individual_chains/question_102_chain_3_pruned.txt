Okay, so I've got this question here about a molecular biology experiment, and I'm trying to figure out what's going on. Let's break it down step by step. 

The question involves a ligand-receptor pair in neural crest cells. They created a bicistronic vector with these two genes. The vector has loxP and lox2272 cassettes, which I remember are used in recombination events, probably with Cre/LoxP systems. 

The setup is that the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, followed by mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3', with eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter, I think. The receptor has an IRES element upstream, which I know allows for internal ribosome entry and is used to drive the expression of a second gene in a bicistronic construct. 

Looking at the stop cassettes: between ligand and mCherry is a loxP-stop-loxP. Between receptor and eGFP is a lox2272-stop-lox2272. So, when Cre is expressed, the loxP sites would be recognized, and the stops would be excised. 

So, when Cre is active, it would delete the stop cassettes. That would allow both ligand and receptor to be expressed. Because if the stop is in front, without Cre, the ligand would be expressed as ligand-mCherry fusion, and the receptor as receptor-eGFP. But with Cre, the stops are removed, so you'd get separate proteins: ligand and receptor, each with their respective fluorescent tags. 

Wait, no, wait. Oh, the vector is bicistronic. So, in the absence of Cre, the ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor is fused to eGFP, because the stop cassettes prevent them from being read through. When Cre is present, it recombines the lox sites, so the stop cassettes are removed. Then, the ligand and receptor are expressed as separate proteins, each with their own tags. Or is it the other way around? Hmm. Wait, the ligand is at 5', so in a bicistronic construct, the first gene is ligand, then the second is receptor. IRES is between them. So, the first gene (ligand) is under CBA promoter, and the second (receptor) is under the IRES, which is a constitutive promoter, I think.

Wait, the vector is bicistronic, which means it can express two proteins from a single transcript. So the first part is ligand, followed by IRES, then receptor. But in this case, each has a stop cassette. 

Wait, the ligand ORF is followed by a stop in a loxP cassette. So the ligand is expressed as ligand-mCherry only if the stop is not removed. Because after ligand, the stop would prevent further translation. Then the receptor is under an IRES, so it
