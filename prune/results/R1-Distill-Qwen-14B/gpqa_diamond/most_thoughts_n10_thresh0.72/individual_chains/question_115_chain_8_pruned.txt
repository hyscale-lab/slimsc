Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electrons and positrons annihilating and producing photons. Hmm, I remember that when a particle and its antiparticle meet, they annihilate and produce photons. But wait, in this case, it's an electron and a positron. Oh, right, electron and positron are each other's antiparticles.

The setup: An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate, producing two photons. The energies of both photons are the same, and their directions are measured. One photon is moving in the upper-right direction, the other in the lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Wait, so both photons have the same energy but are moving in opposite vertical directions but both to the right? Or maybe one is up-right, the other down-right. So their angle is the angle between these two directions.

Let me think about conservation laws here. Since the system is isolated, the total momentum before the collision must equal the total momentum after. And the same goes for energy. But since they annihilate into photons, energy and momentum are carried away by the photons.

Wait, but photons carry momentum and energy. So I need to calculate the total momentum and energy before the collision and then figure out how the photons' momenta add up to match that.

First, let's compute the total energy and momentum of the system before collision.

The electron is moving to the right (since it's moving from the left along the horizontal axis). The positron is moving to the left (from the right), so their velocities are in opposite directions.

Each particle's momentum and energy can be calculated using their respective gamma factors.

The Lorentz factor (gamma) is given as 4 for the electron and 2 for the positron.

For an electron, the rest mass is m_e = 9.11e-31 kg. So, the relativistic momentum p = gamma * m_e * v. But wait, another way to compute momentum is p = gamma * m_e * c * beta, where beta is v/c.

Wait, but I might not need to get into the actual numerical values because maybe I can work with ratios or relative terms.

Let me think: the electron is moving to the right, so its momentum is
