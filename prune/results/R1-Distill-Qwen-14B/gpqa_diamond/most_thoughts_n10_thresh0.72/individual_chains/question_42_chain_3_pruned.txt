Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that there are three planets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here; maybe it's just context.

The key data given are the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. Also, their albedos are all 0.3, same as Earth. The question is asking by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's.

So, the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. That means Planet1 is hotter than Planet2 by a factor of 1.4. Wait, or is it the other way around? Oh, right, the ratio is Planet1 to Planet2 as 1.4. So Planet1's temperature is 1.4 times Planet2's.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So Planet2 is hotter than Planet3 by 2.3 times. So Planet2's temperature is 2.3 times Planet3's. Wait, wait, no, the ratio is Planet2 to Planet3. So T2 / T3 = 2.3. So T2 is higher than T3.

Wait, equilibrium temperature. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ d²) ]^(1/4), but wait, I think the simplified version is T = T_earth * sqrt(R_earth / R) * (L / L_sun)^(1/4) * (1 / sqrt(1-e²)) )^(1/2). But since the orbits are circular, the eccentricity e is zero, so that term isn't relevant.

Alternatively, another formula I remember is that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance. Because T is proportional to (L/(d²))^(1/4), so T ∝ (1/d)^(1/2), which is same as T ∝ 1/sqrt(d). So if Planet1's temperature is 1.4 times Planet2's, then d2 is
