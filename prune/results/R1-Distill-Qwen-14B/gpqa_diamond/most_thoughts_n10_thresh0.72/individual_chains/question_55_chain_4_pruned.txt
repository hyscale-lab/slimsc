Okay, so I've got this NMR question in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of interpreting these spectra. Let's try to take it step by step.

The compound is an organic one, and the options are all some kind of acetate esters with either propenyl or butenyl groups, and they're either cis or trans. The NMR data given is the 1H spectrum with four signals.

Looking at the NMR peaks:

- 7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J=16 Hz)
- 5.5 ppm (1H, doublet of quartets)
- 2.1 ppm (3H, singlet)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, doublet)

Hmm, okay, let's break this down. The singlet at 2.1 ppm is probably a methyl group attached to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Since the options are acetates, which are esters, the structure is likely R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, no, acetate is OAc, so the structure is more like R-O-COCH3. Wait, no, acetate esters are like R-O-CO-CH3. So the methyl in the acetate would be at around 2.1 ppm as a singlet. That fits the 2.1 ppm peak, so that's probably the OAc group.

Now the other peaks: 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling, which suggests it's a trans coupling because typically vicinal (adjacent) protons on double bonds show coupling around 10-18 Hz. Wait, but J=16 Hz is more like what you see in alkenes, possibly a trans arrangement.

The 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quartets. That's interesting. Maybe this is a vinyl proton, perhaps part of a propenyl or butenyl group attached to the ester oxygen. Let's think about the structure.

The options are between propenyl and butenyl. Let's consider the structures.

Propenyl groups have three carbons with a double bond. So for propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3. Wait, but propenyl has three carbons, so the ester is O-CO-O- attached to CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-O-..., but wait, the propenyl group is CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, propenyl is CH2=CH-CH2-O-... or maybe CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond. Wait, wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify.

Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- as a substituent, right? So propenyl esters would have that. Similarly, butenyl would have four carbons with a double bond.

But let's go back to the NMR. The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet. That could be a vinyl proton adjacent to another proton, perhaps. The coupling J=16 Hz suggests it's a trans coupling across a double bond. So maybe the structure has a trans double bond.

Wait, but in propenyl acetate, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, so if it's trans, the substituents on either side are opposite. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the splitting.

The 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quartets. A quartet suggests coupling with three equivalent protons. Wait, but how? Let's think about the structure.

If the ester is OAc-O-R, where R is a propenyl or butenyl group, then the R group has a double bond. Let's say for propenyl, R is CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's not right. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CH-CH2-... Maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-O-O-CO-CH3? Hmm, but acetate is O-CO-O. So more accurately, it's CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO-CH3.

Wait, but no, propenyl is CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond. Wait, perhaps I should draw this out mentally.

Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. So the structure of propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3. So the protons on the double bond would be the CH2=CH- part. The ester oxygen is connected to the CH2 group.

In that case, the H on the CH2= group would split into certain patterns. Let's look at the NMR.

The 5.5 ppm proton is a doublet of quartets. So that's a splitting into two (doublet) and then each of those splits into four (quartet), so overall, 8 peaks but as a doublet of quartets. How does this happen?

Let me think about vicinal couplings. If a proton is adjacent to two different sets of protons, maybe on either side of the double bond.

Wait, maybe it's a trans double bond. So, if the structure is CH2-O-CO-CH3 connected to a double bond. Let me think of the structure. For trans-propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2CH2-O-CO-CH3, but wait, the double bond is between the first and second carbons. So it would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3. Wait, no, that's the same as propenyl. Hmm.

Wait, the structure for trans-propenyl would have the substituents on either side of
