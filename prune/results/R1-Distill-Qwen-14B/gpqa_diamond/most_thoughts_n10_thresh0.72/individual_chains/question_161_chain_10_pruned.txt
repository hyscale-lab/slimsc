Okay, so I have this question about a transmission electron microscope and the mean free path of gas molecules in the vacuum chamber. Hmm, I remember that the mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. Right, and in a vacuum, the pressure is really low, so the mean free path is longer because molecules don't bump into each other as often.

The question says Mike created an ultra-high vacuum with a pressure less than 10^-9 Torr. He determined the mean free path as λ1. But when he turned on the electron beam, the mean free path became λ2. And the temperature stayed the same, so that shouldn't affect it, right?

Wait, why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is on? Oh, because the electron beam might be interacting with the gas molecules somehow. Oh, like maybe the electrons are causing the gas molecules to move or change their velocity. Could it be that the gas molecules are getting ionized or excited by the electrons?

Ionization would mean the gas particles are charged. Charged particles would interact more with the electric fields in the microscope, right? But how does that affect the mean free path? Well, if the gas molecules are ionized, they might have more collisions because they're more likely to interact with the electron beam or other charged particles. Or wait, maybe the ions have a longer path because they're being pushed by the electric fields. But wait, the mean free path is about how often they collide with each other, not the beam.

Alternatively, when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules could be heated. Oh, but the temperature is the same, so maybe that's not it. Unless the beam adds energy in a way that increases the gas's kinetic energy, but the question states the temperature remains the same, so thermal equilibrium is maintained.

Wait another thought: the electron beam could cause the gas molecules to be more mobile, perhaps increasing their velocity. If they move faster, the mean free path would be longer. Because mean free path (λ) is proportional to velocity (v) and the relaxation time (τ). Oh, λ = v * τ. If the velocity increases, λ increases as well.

But wait, wait. The mean free path also depends on the pressure. Pressure is proportional to the number density (n) of molecules. The formula I
