Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an annihilation process. Hmm, let's see what it says. The reaction is p plus anti-p producing two A+ and two A-. So, p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Interesting. The antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe that's a clue about the energy or velocity involved. Oh, and the mass of A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. The question is asking for the velocity of particle A. The options are A to D, with various fractions of c.

Wait, I remember that in annihilation processes, particles and their antiparticles annihilate each other, releasing energy. But here, the products are these A particles. So maybe the process is creating matter-antimatter pairs of A. But wait, the initial state has a proton and antiproton, which are themselves matter and antimatter. So, perhaps the reaction is creating four A particles? Or two each of A+ and A-.

Wait, the reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So, the initial charge is (proton charge + antiproton charge) which is +1e -1e = 0. The products are 2A⁺ (each +1e) so 2e+, and 2A⁻ (each -1e) so 2e-. So 2e+ + 2e- = 0, which matches. Charge conservation is satisfied.

But I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here. The key point is probably about the energy and momentum conservation. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe its kinetic energy is not too high, and we can approximate using non-relativistic terms? Or perhaps we can consider that in the center-of-momentum frame, things are symmetric.

Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So, if the antiproton's velocity is low, perhaps the total energy is dominated by the rest mass energy, and kinetic energy is negligible. But wait, the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. So the proton is at rest? Or maybe the system is considered in the lab frame where the antiproton is moving slowly, and the proton is stationary.

Wait, let me read the problem again: "The antiproton is slowly moving." So maybe in the lab frame, the
