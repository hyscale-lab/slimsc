Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, but I'm not sure if their masses directly affect the problem. The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. So maybe the mass isn't directly relevant, but perhaps it's a distractor. I'll focus on the abundances given.

The data provided is about their elemental abundances using the EW method under LTE. Let's jot down the given values:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So the ratio of silicon to iron is higher than solar by 0.3.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. So the ratio of iron to hydrogen is the same as in the Sun.

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. So magnesium to silicon is higher by 0.3 compared to the Sun.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Magnesium to hydrogen is same as solar.

The Sun's photosphere composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. That means log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5. Wait, no, wait: wait, wait. Wait, the notation is a bit confusing. Oh, right! The notation [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So the given values are the logarithm of the ratio. 

Wait, wait, no, actually, the [X/Y] notation is defined as log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun, right? So it's the logarithmic difference from the Sun.

But in this case, the Sun's values are given directly. For the Sun:

12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So solving for log10(nFe/nH):

log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5.

Which means nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) = approximately 3.16e-5.

Similarly for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. So log10(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5. So nMg/nH =1e-5.

So in the Sun, nFe is 3.16e-5 per H, and Mg is 1e-5 per H.

But wait, I'm trying to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the two stars. So I need to find nSi in Star_1 and nSi in Star_2, and then take the ratio.

But how? Let's think.

For Star_1, [Si/Fe] is 0.3. So [Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi/nFe) - log(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3.

So log(nSi/nFe)_1 = log(nSi/nFe)_sun + 0.3.

But I don't know [Fe/H]_1. Wait, Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0, which means Fe/H is same as the Sun. So nFe/nH for Star_1 is same as the Sun. Because [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun =0 â†’ nFe/nH = same as Sun.

So for Star_1, nFe is same as Sun. Because nFe/nH is same as Sun, so nFe = nH * (3.16e-5), assuming nH is same as the Sun's, but wait, maybe nH is different? Wait, no. Since [Fe/H] is 0, that means the ratio is the same, so nFe is same as Sun relative to nH.

Wait, but wait, if the star has the same [Fe/H], then the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as the Sun. So for Star_1, the number density of Fe is same as Sun's. So nFe1 = nFe_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H] is 0. So nMg2 = nMg_sun.

But how does that help with Si?

For Star_1, since [Si/Fe] is 0.3, we can find the ratio of Si to Fe relative to the Sun. Since nFe1 = nFe_sun, then nSi1 = nFe1 * 10^(0.3) * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun).

Wait, maybe I should write it more precisely. Let's think in terms of [X/Y] notation.

[X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun.

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3.

So log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) + 0.3.

But nFe1 = nFe_sun (since [Fe/H] is 0). So nFe1 = nFe_sun.

Therefore, nSi1 = nFe1 * 10^{ log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) + 0.3 }.

Which is nFe_sun * 10^{ log(nSi_sun / nFe_sun) } * 10^{0.3}.

But 10^{ log(a) } is a, so:

nSi1 = nFe_sun * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) ) * 10^{0.3}.

Simplify that: nSi1 = nSi_sun * 10^{0.3}.

So nSi1 is 10^0.3 times the solar silicon abundance.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3.

So log(nMg2 / nSi2 ) = log(nMg_sun / nSi_sun ) + 0.3.

But nMg2 is nMg_sun (since [Mg/H] is 0; nMg2 = nMg_sun).

So substituting:

log( nMg_sun / nSi2 ) = log( nMg_sun / nSi_sun ) + 0.3.

Let me rearrange this.

Take 10^ both sides:

nMg_sun / nSi2 = (nMg_sun / nSi_sun ) * 10^{0.3}.

So,

nSi2 = nMg_sun * 10^{-0.3} / (nMg_sun / nSi_sun ) )

Wait, maybe I should rearrange the equation:

nMg2 / nSi2 = (nMg_sun / nSi_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

Then,

nSi2 = nMg2 * 10^{-0.3} * (nSi_sun / nMg_sun).
