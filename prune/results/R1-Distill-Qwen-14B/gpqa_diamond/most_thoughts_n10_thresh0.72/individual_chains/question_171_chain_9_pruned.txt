Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking me to arrange six substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer formed when they undergo electrophilic substitution with excess bromine. The options are A to D, each giving a different order.

Each substance is a benzene derivative. The substituents will direct the incoming electrophile (bromine in this case) to certain positions. Depending on the substituent's nature, the ring will activate or deactivate, and will be ortho/para or meta directing.

Let me list each substituent and figure out their directing effects:

1) ะก6H5-CH3: The substituent is a methyl group. Methyl is an activating group since it's an alkyl group. Activating groups are electron-donating through the inductive effect. So, methyl directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. So when bromine adds, the major products would be ortho and para substituted. But para would be major? Wait, in mono-substituted benzene rings with activating groups, the para isomer might be more favored than meta but wait, for methyl, which is an activating group, the major product is para when possible.

Wait, but wait. In the case of substitution on a benzene ring, when the substituent is activating, the incoming electrophile adds to ortho, para, or sometimes meta. But for meta, only when the substituent is deactivating and meta-directing.

Wait, but for a monobromination, the substituent will influence whether the incoming Br adds in ortho, para, or meta positions.

So, let me go through each substituent:

1) CH3: It's an activating group. So, the ring is activated. The substituent is an electron donor. So, it's ortho/para directing. So, bromine will add to ortho and para positions, but which is more? For most activating groups like methyl, the para position is more favored than ortho because of steric hindrance? Or maybe not. Wait, methyl is a small group, so ortho is possible but maybe para is major. Hmm. For mono-substituted benzene, the para product is major when the substituent is strong activating and when the ring is symmetric.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. For a substituent like -OCH3, which is activating and para-directing, the para product is major. Similarly, for -NH2, same thing. For methyl, which is an activating group but less so than strong activating groups, would the para product be major?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about the relative amounts between the isomers. For each compound, which substituent will produce a para isomer more or less?

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, when a substituent allows more para products, the weight fraction would be higher.

But in some cases, like when the substituent is meta-directing, the para product might not form at all or be minimal.

Wait, no. The substituent's direction dictates whether the incoming group goes to ortho, meta, or para.

So, for each substituent, I need to figure out whether it's ortho/para-directing (activating) or meta-directing (deactivating).

Wait, let's go through each substituent:

1) CH3: Activating, ortho/para (so para is possible, and may be major)

2) COOEt (COOC2H5): This is an ester group. The substituent is -COOEt. The carbonyl group is deactivating because it's an electron-withdrawing group. Esters are meta-directing. So, the incoming Br would add in the meta position. So, para product would not form, or be minimal.

3) Cl: Chlorine is an electronegative substituent. It's a deactivating group due to inductive effect (electron-withdrawing), but it's ortho/para-directing because of resonance. Chlorine can donate electrons through resonance, but the inductive effect is stronger, making it deactivating. So, Cl is a meta director? Wait, no. Wait, Cl is an ortho/para director. Because when the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group but can donate electrons through resonance (like -Cl, -NO2 is different) it can direct ortho and para. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, nitro groups (-NO2) are meta-directing, strong deactivating. Cl is a weakly deactivating group (due to inductive) but can donate electrons through resonance, so it's ortho/para-directing, but deactivating.

So, Cl is ortho/para, but deactivating. So, when Cl is present,
