Okay, so I have this problem about the partition function of a system with three spins. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-β E), right? Oh wait, no, wait. The formula for partition function is Z = sum_{n} exp(-β E_n), where E_n is the energy of each state.

But each spin can be +1 or -1, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible states for the three spins. I should probably enumerate all these states and calculate E for each, then sum exp(-β E) times the degeneracy if any.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Because each term is a product of two spins, each product can be either +1 or -1. Let me see.

Wait, S_i S_j is +1 if S_i and S_j are the same, and -1 otherwise. So each term S1S2, etc., can be +1 or -1. Let me think about the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Wait, the sum can be 3, 1, -1, or -3? Let me check. For example:

If all three pairs are +1: S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3.

If two pairs are +1 and one -1: sum would be 2-1=1.

If one pair is +1 and two are -1: sum is 1-2= -1.

If all three pairs are -1: sum is -3.

So the possible sums are 3,1,-1,-3.

Wait, but how many states correspond to each sum? Let me think.

Case 1: Sum =3. That's when all three pairs are +1. That implies S1=S
