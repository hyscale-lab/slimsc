Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about an electron's state and probabilities of measuring certain eigenstates, and then finding the average value of an operator. 

Alright, let's start by parsing the problem. The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, proportional means we need to normalize it, right? Because the state vectors in quantum mechanics must have a norm (or length) of 1.

So first, I should find the normalization factor. The state is a linear combination of |up> and |down>, which are orthonormal. So the normalization factor is 1 divided by the square root of the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients.

The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). Let me calculate their magnitudes squared. For (1+i), the magnitude squared is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2. For (2-i), it's (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 +1=5. So the total squared norm is 2 +5=7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2-i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, the next part is about the operator whose matrix representation has elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that sounds like a 2x2 matrix. Let me write it out.

The operator matrix is:
[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0 ]

Because when i≠j, it's hbar/2, else zero. So it's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 off-diagonal. Hmm, that looks familiar. Oh, wait, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so multiplying by hbar/2 gives the matrix A.

Wait, but wait, the Pauli matrices are usually defined without the hbar factor. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps this operator is similar to spin in the x-direction? Well, the spin matrices in quantum mechanics are usually written as S_x = (ħ/2) σ_x. So yes, the matrix here is exactly S_x for spin-1/2 particles.

So the operator in question is the spin-x operator. The eigenstates of S_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates we're being asked about. So the problem is asking for the probability of measuring the spin in the +x and -x states, and then the expectation value (average) of the operator S_x.

Wait, but the operator in the question is A, with the given matrix. So perhaps it's better to treat it as an abstract operator and not rely on the spin interpretation, but perhaps it doesn't matter because the mathematical approach remains the same.

So, to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of A, I need to find the eigenstates of A, express |alpha> in terms of those eigenstates, and then the square of the coefficients will be the probabilities.

Alternatively, since A is a 2x2 matrix, perhaps I can diagonalize it and find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Let me proceed. The matrix A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. To find the eigenvalues, I'll solve the characteristic equation det(A - λ I) = 0.

So ( -λ ) ( -λ ) - (hbar/2)^2 = 0 → λ^2 - (hbar^2/4) = 0 → λ = ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2. The corresponding eigenvectors can be found.

For λ = hbar/2:
(A - (hbar/2) I ) v = 0 → [ [-hbar/2
