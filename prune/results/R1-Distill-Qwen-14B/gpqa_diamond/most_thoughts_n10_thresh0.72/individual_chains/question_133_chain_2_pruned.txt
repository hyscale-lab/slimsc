Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. I remember that phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH, so I think this has to do with the dissociation of phosphoric acid.

The problem states that we've got a solution with 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) and it contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. The temperature is 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12. 

Wait, so the question is about orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? But wait, in solution, phosphate exists in various forms. H3PO4 is the fully protonated form, H2PO4^- is dihydrogen phosphate, HPO4^2- is hydrogen phosphate, and PO4^3- is orthophosphate. So, which form are we looking for? The question specifically asks for orthophosphate ions, so that's PO4^3-.

But wait, do I need to consider the buffer system here? Because we have KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, which are two different salts that can form a buffer. Let me think. So, if I have a solution with both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, they would probably form a buffer solution because they are a weak acid and its conjugate base.

Let me calculate the moles of each component. For KH2PO4, the molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. So, moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007336 mol. 

For Na2HPO4·2H2O, the molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. So, moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005611 mol.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure about the formula. Na2HPO4·2H2O would have formula weight = (Na:23*2) + (H:1*(2+4)) + (P:31) + (O:16*4) + (H2O:18*2). Let me compute that: 46 (Na) + (1*6) H from HPO4 and 2H2O gives 6 H, so 6*1 =6; P=31. O: 4 (from HPO4) + 18*2 (from H2O) =4 +36=40. So, total is
