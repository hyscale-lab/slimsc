Okay, so I've got this problem about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors: the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, and the planet's distance is determined by its orbital period, which I might need to find using the RV method data.

Wait, the problem says both planets are detected using transit and radial velocity methods. The transit method gives the radius of the planet, I think, because it blocks some light. But the radial velocity method gives the mass, because it's about the Doppler shift of the star. Oh, but here they've given both masses and radii, so maybe I don't need that for equilibrium temperature? Because equilibrium temperature is more about the energy balance, not the planet's size or mass. But wait, the star's properties are given: mass, radius, Teff. 

The star's Teff is 6300 K, which I think is similar to the Sun's. Oh, wait, the Sun is about 5778 K, so this star is a bit hotter. But to find the equilibrium temperature, I need the luminosity of the star, maybe. Because the formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T_p = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A)/0.5 )^(1/4) )? Wait, no, let me think again. The formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star
