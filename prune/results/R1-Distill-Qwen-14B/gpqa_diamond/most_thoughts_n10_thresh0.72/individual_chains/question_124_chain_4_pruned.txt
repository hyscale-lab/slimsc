Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and think through step by step.

The question is about particles being collided in a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly. They travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor around 20 on average. It says that one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters.

The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls instead. So, the goal is to find the new gamma (Lorentz factor) which would result in a higher fraction of particles making it to the detector walls.

Hmm. I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is defined as gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, maybe I don't need to calculate gamma directly here. Instead, perhaps it's about the time it takes for the particle to reach the detector wall and whether it decays before that.

Since the particles are fast-decaying, their lifetime is very short. The distance they can travel before decaying depends on their speed. The faster they go, the longer they live (due to time dilation), so they can travel further.

In the first scenario, the Lorentz factor is 20, and one third reach the inner walls. That suggests that about one third of the particles have a lifetime long enough to reach the detector's 30-meter radius.

Wait, but how does the Lorentz factor relate to the distance they travel? Oh, right! The proper lifetime (tau) of the particle is the average lifetime in its rest frame. The dilated lifetime is gamma * tau. So the time the particle has before decaying is gamma * tau.

The time to reach the detector's wall is the distance (radius) divided by the particle's speed. Since they're moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, v is approximately equal to c. So the time is t = R / c.

Wait, no wait. If the particles are moving at speed v, which is close to c, then the time is approximately R/(v), but since v is nearly c, that's roughly R/(c).

So the time t must be less than or equal to gamma * tau for the particle to reach the detector. If the time is longer than gamma * tau, the particle decays before reaching the wall.

So the fraction that reach the wall depends on the ratio between t and gamma tau. If t < gamma tau, then the particle has enough time and will reach the wall.

Wait, but how does that fraction relate? Let me think.

The average lifetime is gamma tau. So the probability that the particle hasn't decayed when it travels a distance R is given by the exponential decay formula. The probability P is exp( - R/(gamma tau * v) ), but wait, perhaps more accurately, the probability of decay is 1 - exp( - R/(gamma tau * v) ), but that's not exactly right
