Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, I've studied a bit of quantum mechanics before, but I'm a bit rusty. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem says the Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n. Oh wait, σ is the vector of Pauli matrices, right? And n is a unit vector, so it's like a direction in space. ε is an energy constant. I need to find the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian.

Wait, eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix operator. I remember that each Pauli matrix is Hermitian, so their dot product multiplied by some constants would also be Hermitian. Since H is Hermitian, its eigenvalues must be real.

But what's the form of H? Oh right, σ · n is the same as σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z. So H is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices in the direction of the unit vector n.

Wait, but each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1. But here, they are scaled by ε and the components of the unit vector n. Wait, no, because when you take the dot product, each component is scaled by n_i, but since it's a unit vector, the sum of squares of n_i is 1.

Let me think about the general form of the Pauli matrices. For any unit vector n, the operator σ · n has
