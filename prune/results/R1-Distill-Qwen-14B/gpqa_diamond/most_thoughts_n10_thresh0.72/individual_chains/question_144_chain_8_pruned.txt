Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I remember mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're made up of a quark and an antiquark. But wait, what's a resonance in this context? Oh right, in particle physics, a resonance is a particle that exists for a very short time before decaying. So, its lifetime is super short, meaning it doesn't exist for long, hence the term 'resonance'.

The question is about finding the mean decay distance of this meson X. The given data is production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters.

Wait, how do I approach this? I think the mean decay distance is related to how far the particle travels before it decays. That depends on its lifetime and its velocity. The formula I recall is something like decay distance = c * τ * β, where c is the speed of light, τ is the mean lifetime, and β is the velocity relative to the speed of light.

But first, I need to find τ. Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the total decay width Γ through the uncertainty principle. The relation is τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I remember that for
