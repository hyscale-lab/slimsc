Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an annihilation process. Hmm, let me read it again. The reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Wait, because it's an antiproton, right? So the antiproton is moving slowly, meaning its speed is much less than the speed of light. Oh wait, no, wait—antiproton is moving, but it's moving slowly. So the initial kinetic energy might not be too high, but I'm not sure yet.

Given that m_A c² is 300 MeV. So the rest mass of particle A is 300 MeV/c². And the question is, what is the velocity of particle A after the annihilation?

Wait, the process is annihilation between a proton and antiproton. So when a proton and antiproton annihilate, they turn into other particles. But in this case, it's creating two A+ and two A- particles. So four particles in total.

I think I should consider conservation of energy and momentum here. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the initial momentum is dominated by the antiproton. But wait, the proton is presumably at rest, or maybe the system's center of momentum is considered. Hmm, need to clarify.

Assuming the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly. So in the lab frame, the proton is stationary, and the antiproton has some velocity. After the annihilation, four particles are
