Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, so the problem involves some salts being heated, and then the gases produced go through some tubes with different chemicals. The goal is to find the total number of all atoms in the original salts A and B. Hmm, not too bad, but I need to break it down step by step.

First, let me read the problem again carefully. So, an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, 7.20 grams total. They're heated to 200°C without air. Only a mixture of gases is formed, and these gases are passed through three tubes. 

Tube 1 is Mg(ClO4)2. Tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. Tube 3 is red-hot copper. The results are: tube 1 gains 3.60g, tube 3 gains 0.80g (CuO formed), and tube 2's weight didn't change. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temp and pressure (STP), which is 0°C and 1 atm, right? So STP is important because 22.4 liters is a mole of gas, so that might help.

So, I think the gases are reacting with these substances in the tubes. Let's analyze each tube's reaction.

Starting with tube 1: the weight increased by 3.60g. Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent, I think. So maybe the gas is something that can be absorbed by Mg(ClO4)2, like water vapor. Because Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant, it absorbs water. So the gas could be H2O, but wait, but in another context, maybe CO2? No, Mg(ClO4)2 is more for absorbing water.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe the gas is acidic, like HCl or something. Because Mg(ClO4)2 reacts with HCl? Wait, but if the gas is HCl, would Mg(ClO4)2 absorb it? Let me think. Mg(ClO4)2 is a magnesium salt, and HCl is a strong acid. Maybe they react to form MgCl2 and HClO4? Or perhaps, no, because HCl is a gas and would typically not react with Mg(ClO4)2 unless under certain conditions.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is a moisture-carrying gas. Let me think about what's produced when salts are heated. If A and B are carbonates or sulfites, heating would produce CO2 or SO2, but that might react with Mg(ClO4)2. Wait, but Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong drying agent, so it could trap water vapor. So perhaps the gas is water vapor, which gets absorbed by tube 1, causing it to gain 3.60g. That makes sense because water has a molar mass of 18 g/mol. So 3.60g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 mol. So 0.2 moles of H2O were absorbed. So maybe the initial gases include H2O.

Then, moving to tube 2: Ca(OH)2 solution. The weight didn't change. So the gas that passed through didn't react with Ca(OH)2. Remember, CO2 would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water, so if CO2 were present, tube 2 would gain weight. But it didn't change. So that suggests that the gas wasn't CO2. Alternatively, maybe the gas was something else. What other gases could be present? Maybe NH3? But NH3 would react with Ca(OH)2, but in what way? Ca(OH)2 is a base; NH3 is a weak base. Maybe they wouldn't react, or perhaps it's a different scenario.

Wait, but Ca(OH)2 might react with something else. Let's think about other possibilities. If the gas is H2, then it wouldn't react with Ca(OH)2. Or maybe O2, but that also wouldn't react. Alternatively, maybe the gas is a hydrocarbon, but that's unlikely in this context.

Wait, perhaps the gas is an inert gas, like nitrogen or argon. But that wouldn't make sense because inert gases wouldn't react in these conditions. Alternatively, maybe the gas is a neutral one like CO or something else. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is a non-acidic, non-reactive gas. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is N2 or something similar. Wait, but then why would tube 3 react?

Wait, moving on to tube 3: red-hot copper. The weight increased by 0.80g, and CuO formed. So this implies that a gas reacted with copper to form CuO. So, which gas reacts with copper upon heating? Well, CO2 can react with copper at high temperatures to form Cu
