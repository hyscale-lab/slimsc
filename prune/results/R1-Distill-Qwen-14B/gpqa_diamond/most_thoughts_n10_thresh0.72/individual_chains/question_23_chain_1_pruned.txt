Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully and try to figure it out step by step.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). After some time, they checked using TLC and saw that the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots appeared. I need to determine which of the options A to D are the possible products.

Hmm, first, I should probably draw the structure of the starting material to understand what's going on. The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me break that down.

The benzene ring has an ether group (oxy-) attached to it. The other part is a butenyl group. Let's see, but-3-en-1-yl would be a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at the third carbon. Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl would actually have the double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, no, the numbering is from the end closest to the benzene. Wait, the structure is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the main chain is four carbons long, with a double bond starting at C3? Or wait, but the but-3-en-1-yl group would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond at position 3? Wait, but that's not possible because but only has four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with the double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, that can't be right because but-3-enyl would imply a double bond between C3 and C4, but that's outside the four carbons. Wait, perhaps I should think of the structure differently.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

The group is (but-3-en-1-yl). So the substituents are at position 1. The double bond is between C3 and C4? That doesn't seem to make sense because but has four carbons. Alternatively, perhaps it's but-1-en-3-yl? No, wait, the correct numbering would have the double bond at the
