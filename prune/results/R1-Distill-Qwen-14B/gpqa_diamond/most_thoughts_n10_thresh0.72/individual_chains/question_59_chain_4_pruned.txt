Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I'll take it one step at a time.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I probably need to find out how much acid and base are present in total after mixing. The reactions between them will determine the pH of the final solution.

Let me jot down the given information:

- 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
- 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid)
- 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide)

I think I should calculate the moles of each acid and base first because moles will tell me how much of each substance is reacting.

Starting with acetic acid (CH3COOH). The formula is CH3COOH, which is a weak acid. The molarity is 0.1 M, and the volume is 0.5 L (since 500 mL is 0.5 L). Moles = Molarity × Volume.

Moles of CH3COOH = 0.1 mol/L * 0.5 L = 0.05 mol.

Next, HCl. That's a strong acid. Molarity is 0.2 M, volume is 0.4 L.

Moles of HCl = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 mol.

Now for Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH- ions because it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

Molarity is 0.3 M, volume 0.3 L. So moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. But since each mole gives 2 OH-, the total moles of OH- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Wait, but I think I need to consider the reaction between the acids and the base. So the acids (HCl and CH3COOH) will react with the base (Ba(OH)2). HCl is a strong acid, so it will completely dissociate, providing H+ ions. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely, but for calculating the neutralization, perhaps I can treat it as providing H+ as well, but maybe in a different way.

Wait, maybe I should think about all the H+ and OH- ions in the solution. Let me try to find the total moles of H+ from the acids and the total moles of OH- from the base.

So, let's calculate total H+ from both acids first.

HCl is a strong acid, so all 0.08 moles will produce H+. So H+ from HCl is 0.08 mol.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't fully dissociate. The dissociation is CH3COOH ↔ H+ + CH3COO^-. But wait, when considering the neutralization with a base, perhaps we can treat the acetic acid as providing H+? Because the OH- from the base will react with H+ from the acid. But since acetic acid is a weak acid, it's not as straightforward as HCl.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the total H+ available from all sources and the total OH- available, then see which is in excess.

Wait, another approach: since HCl is a strong acid, it will donate all its H+ ions. The acetic acid will donate some H+ (but not all), but the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react with both
