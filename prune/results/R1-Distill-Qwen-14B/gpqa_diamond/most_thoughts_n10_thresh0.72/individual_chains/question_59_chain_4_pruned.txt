Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I'll take it slow.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. But wait, I need to figure out the stoichiometry of the reaction. Let's see. The three solutions are:

- 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
- 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid)
- 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (a strong base)

I think the first step is to calculate the moles of each acid and base. Moles are calculated by Molarity × Volume (in liters).

So, for CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles.
For HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles.
For Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH- ions, right? Because the formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2OH^-.

So, the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, the HCl is a strong acid, providing H+ ions. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+. So HCl gives 0.08 moles of H+.

And the CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it contributes 0.05 moles of H+. But wait, since it's weak, it doesn't dissociate completely. But when you mix acids and bases, you have to consider neutralization reactions.

So, the initial H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. The initial OH- comes from Ba(OH)2.

The reaction between H+ and OH- will form water. So, the strong H+ from HCl
