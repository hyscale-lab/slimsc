Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transition probabilities. Hmm, let me think. The question is about the |3,0,0> state decaying to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, transitions happen between energy levels, and dipole transitions are governed by certain selection rules.

Wait, selection rules. Right, for electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Oh, but for s states, like l=0, the possible transitions must change l by ±1. So from l=0 (n=3), the first transition would go to l=1 (n=2 or maybe n=4, but since it's going down to n=1, probably n=2). So the first transition is 3,0,0 → 2,1, something.

But wait, the initial state is |3,0,0>. The next state should have l=1, because dipole transitions require Δl=±1. So from l=0 to l=1. Okay, that means the first state after transition is |2,1, m>, but what's m?

Also, the final state is |1,0,0>, so the second transition must take l=1 to l=0, which fits the selection rule again. So the two-step process makes sense.

Now, each transition has its own probability, but the question is about the overall probability. I'm a bit fuzzy on how the probabilities combine, but I think each transition contributes a probability factor.

Wait, another thing. The dipole transition matrix elements depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or the spherical harmonics overlaps. For the transition from l=0 to l=1, the possible m changes are 0 → m can be -1, 0, +1. So from |3,0,0>, the first transition can go to |2,1, -1>, |2,1,0>, or |2,1,+1>.

But the second transition from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0> must have Δl = -1 again. So, the second transition requires that m goes to m=0 because the final state is m=0. So in the first transition, m can be -1, 0, or +1, but then in the second step, how does m change?

Let's think: for each possible first transition, what's the probability of the second transition. But I'm not sure about the exact probabilities. Alternatively, maybe each possible first transition has the same probability, and the total is the sum of the possible paths.

Wait, the question gives options for the transition routes and their probabilities. Let's look at the options.

Option A: 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0, and probability 1/3. Hmm, but why 1/3? There are three possible m values for the first transition.

Option B: 3,0,0 → 2,1,1 → 1,0,0, probability 1/4. I don't know why 1/4.

Option C: →2,1,-1 →1,0,0, with
