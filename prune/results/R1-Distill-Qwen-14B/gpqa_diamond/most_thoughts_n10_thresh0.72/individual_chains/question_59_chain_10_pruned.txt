Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about determining the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Hmm, I remember that when mixing acids and bases, I need to calculate the moles of H+ and OH- ions to see if they react or not. Let's break this down step by step.

So the problem says we have three solutions:

1. 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so I'll need to consider its dissociation.
2. 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it will fully dissociate.
3. 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. Barium hydroxide is a strong base, so it will fully dissociate into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions.

Wait, but I think I should first calculate the moles of each acid and base component. Because when you mix them, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base. If there's excess, that will determine the final pH.

Let me think about each component.

First, CH3COOH. It's 0.1 M, and 500 mL. So moles = Molarity × Volume (L). 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH. Since it's a weak acid, it doesn't fully dissociate. I'll have to consider that, but wait, maybe after considering the reaction with the base, the acetic acid might not be the main contributor? Not sure yet.

Next, HCl. It's 0.2 M, 400 mL. So moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely into H+ and Cl^-.

Ba(OH)2 is 0.3 M, 300 mL. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH^-.

So moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Then, moles of OH^- = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now the total solution volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 liters.

Wait, but the H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH, and OH- comes from Ba(OH)2. But since HCl is a strong acid, its H+ will react with the OH- from the base first, right? Oh wait, but wait—what about the acetic acid? Since it's a weak acid, the H+ it contributes will be less. So perhaps the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH will react with the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but maybe the strong acid H+ will react with the strong base OH-? That's correct because they neutralize each other.

So let's see: the moles of H+ from HCl is 0.08. Do I include the H+ from acetic acid here? Well, acetic acid is a weak acid, so in solution, it doesn't dissociate completely. But when you mix all together, the strong acid H+ will react first. Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, so it will contribute a lot of H+ ions. The OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react with this H+.

So let me do the neutralization reaction:

H+ (from HCl) + OH- (from Ba(OH)2) → H2O.

The moles of H+ from HCl is 0.08, and moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18. So H+ is less than OH-.

So the OH- will have
