Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. The options are four different compounds. I'll need to analyze the given data step by step.

First, let's look at the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity, and there's another peak at m/z 158 with 32% intensity. Wait, molecular ion is the highest mass peak, so that's M+. The m/z 158 is probably M+ plus something. Since 158 is two more than 156, that's a mass difference of 2. Hmm, I think that could be due to a double bond or maybe something else. Oh wait, another possibility is that the fragment has a chlorine or another substituent. Or maybe it's an isotope? Chlorine has a significant natural abundance isotope, Cl-35 and Cl-37. Oh wait, but in that case, the molecular ion would have a certain isotopic pattern. Let me think, if the molecular formula includes chlorine, the molecular ion might show peaks at m/z 156 and 158, because Cl has two main isotopes. So the molecular ion at 156 would be the most abundant, and 158 would be a lower abundance due to the heavier isotope. But wait, the question says the molecular ion is at 156, which is 100%, and 158 is a separate peak. So perhaps the molecular ion is a fragment or not the actual molecular weight? Or maybe the molecular weight is 156, and the 158 is a fragment. Alternatively, perhaps the 158 is an M+ with an additional Cl, but that doesn't quite fit. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I'll come back to this after looking at other data.

Next, the IR spectrum. It shows a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches. Since the compound is a solid, maybe it's a carboxylic acid or an alcohol? But wait, a broad peak spanning a large area could also suggest an amide or something else, but looking at the options
