Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with pH calculations, especially when multiple acids and bases are involved. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking for the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (which is acetic acid, a weak acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid), and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (a strong base, since Ba is a group 2 metal and OH- is a strong base). Hmm, mixing acids and bases, so it's a neutralization reaction.

Wait, but since there are both acids and bases, I should first figure out if the mixture is acidic, basic, or neutral. So I think I need to calculate the total moles of H+ from the acids and the total moles of OH- from the base, then see which is in excess.

Let's start with the acids. First, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. HCl is a strong acid, so it does dissociate completely, releasing H+ ions.

Then there's Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.

I think the plan is:
1. Calculate moles of H+ from CH3COOH and HCl.
2. Calculate moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2.
3. Find the total moles of H+ and OH-.
4. Subtract to find the excess H+ or OH-.
5. Determine the concentration of the excess H+ or OH- in the total solution volume.
6. Use that concentration to find pH or pOH, then pH.

Wait, let me think about each step.

First, calculate moles:

For CH3COOH: Molarity is 0.1 M, volume 500 mL = 0.5 L. Moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Since it's a weak acid, it doesn't fully dissociate. So it contributes 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, but only a small amount of H+.

For HCl: 0.2 M, 400 mL = 0.4 L. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. HCl is strong, so it fully dissociates into H+ and Cl-; so 0.08 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M, 300 mL = 0.3 L. Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so total OH- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

So, initial H+ is 0.05 (from CH3COOH) and 0.08 (from HCl). Wait, no—wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because CH3COOH is a weak acid, its contribution to H+ isn't just 0.05. Hmm. Wait, no, wait: the question is whether the mixture results in a solution where the H+ and OH- will neutralize each other, but since HCl is a strong acid, its H+ is completely available. CH3COOH's H+ is only partial, but in the presence of a strong base like Ba(OH)2, perhaps the H+ from all the acids will react with the OH-.

Wait, but when you mix the three solutions, they all go into the same mixture. So the H+ from the acids (CH3COOH and HCl) will react with the OH- from the base (Ba(OH)2).

So the reaction would

Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Let me try to work through this step by step. I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these kinds of problems, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says we have 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (which is acetic acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. We need to find the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm, okay. So first, I remember that when mixing acids and bases, the H+ and OH- ions will react. But since there are multiple acids and a base, I think I should find the total moles of H+ and OH- in the mixture, then see what's left after any neutralization.

Let me break it down. Each solution contributes some H+ or OH- ions. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it also dissociates completely.

First, I'll calculate the moles for each component.

Wait, but before that, maybe I should consider the total volume. Because the volumes are different, the concentrations will change when mixed. So I need to find the total volume first. Let me add them up: 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 L.

Now, find moles for each.

CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. But wait, since it's a weak acid, it doesn't fully ionize. But when mixed with other acids and a base, maybe the H+ from CH3COOH will be negligible compared to the strong acid? Or perhaps it's better to consider all H+ sources first.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles H+. Because HCl is strong, it fully dissociates, so each mole gives one mole H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2. Since Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions, each mole gives 2 moles OH-. So 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles OH-.

Wait, but when you mix an acid and a base, the H+ and OH- will react. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So let me calculate the total moles of H+ and OH-.

Total H+ comes from CH3COOH and HCl. But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it won't contribute as much H+ as HCl. Alternatively, perhaps in a mixture with strong acid and base, the weak acid's contribution is negligible? Or maybe I should calculate the H+ from all sources,
