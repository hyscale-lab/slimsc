Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Let me try to work through this step by step. I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these kinds of problems, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says we have 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (which is acetic acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. We need to find the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm, okay. So first, I remember that when mixing acids and bases, the H+ and OH- ions will react. But since there are multiple acids and a base, I think I should find the total moles of H+ and OH- in the mixture, then see what's left after any neutralization.

Let me break it down. Each solution contributes some H+ or OH- ions. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it also dissociates completely.

First, I'll calculate the moles for each component.

Wait, but before that, maybe I should consider the total volume. Because the volumes are different, the concentrations will change when mixed. So I need to find the total volume first. Let me add them up: 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 L.

Now, find moles for each.

CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. But wait, since it's a weak acid, it doesn't fully ionize. But when mixed with other acids and a base, maybe the H+ from CH3COOH will be negligible compared to the strong acid? Or perhaps it's better to consider all H+ sources first.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles H+. Because HCl is strong, it fully dissociates, so each mole gives one mole H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2. Since Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions, each mole gives 2 moles OH-. So 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles OH-.

Wait, but when you mix an acid and a base, the H+ and OH- will react. The reaction is H+ + OH- â†’ H2O.

So let me calculate the total moles of H+ and OH-.

Total H+ comes from CH3COOH and HCl. But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it won't contribute as much H+ as HCl. Alternatively, perhaps in a mixture with strong acid and base, the weak acid's contribution is negligible? Or maybe I should calculate the H+ from all sources,
