Okay, so I have this question about organic chemistry and optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism has to do with molecules being non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? These are also called enantiomers. So when a molecule has a chiral center, it can exhibit optical activity because it can have enantiomers.

The question lists four compounds and asks which of them show optical isomerism. Let's go through each one step by step.

1. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Okay, biphenyl rings connected at position 1. So it's two benzene rings connected by a single bond. Now, biphenyls can have different conformations, like the coplanar (trans) and non-coplanar (cis) forms. But wait, can they be chiral? I think about the biphenyl group itself. If the substituents are in such a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it might not be chiral.

Wait, in this case, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Let me visualize it. Each benzene ring has two nitro groups and two ester groups. I'm trying to imagine if the arrangement around the single bond can lead to chirality. Oh, because it's a biphenyl with substituents, maybe the molecule can have a chiral axis or something. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry. If the substituents on each ring are in positions that mirror each other, then maybe it's not chiral.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents make the molecule chiral. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Wait, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro... maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that there's a lack of internal plane of symmetry. So this could lead to optical isomerism. I'm not too sure, but I'll tentatively say maybe this one does show isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break this down. Propanoate would be the ester of propanoic acid. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester where the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. The structure would be OMe-O-C-(CH2) something. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

The propanoate ester has three carbons. So, the structure is CH3-C(OH)O-OCH3? Wait, no, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the formula is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So the ester would be OMe-O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH? No, wait. Let me think again. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, so the ester would be CH2CH2CO-OCH3. But wait, it's 2-hydroxypropanoate, so the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of the propanoate.

So
