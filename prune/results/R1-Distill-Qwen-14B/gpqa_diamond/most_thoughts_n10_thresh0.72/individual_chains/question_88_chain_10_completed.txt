Okay, so I have this question about immunology and how rotavirus interacts with the immune system. Hmm, let me think through this. So, the setup is that someone tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then, through in vivo imaging, they saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid and some entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. They isolated the fluorescent Peyer patches and looked at the variable heavy chain gene, which showed high variability. The question is asking which process is taking place.

Alright, breaking it down. Rotavirus is a virus that causes gastroenteritis. The inner capsid proteins are probably the ones that are more protected, but when they're tagged with GFP, they're being tracked. When given to mice via oral gavage, the first thing is that the stomach has a lot of acid. So some GFP would be destroyed there, which makes sense because stomach acid can break down proteins. But some of them made it through, got entangled in mucus, and then reached the secondary lymphoid organs. Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are sites where antigens are sampled.

So, the fluorescently tagged proteins likely reached the Peyer patches, which are a type of secondary lymphoid organ. In the Peyer patches, immune cells, like dendritic cells or maybe even B cells, would present the antigen. Then, the B cells that recognize this antigen would be activated.

The next part says they isolated the proliferating cell population and sequenced their variable heavy chain genes, which showed high variability. High variability in the variable regions suggests that the cells have undergone some process that leads to diversity in their antibodies. 

What processes create variability in B cell receptors? Well, during B cell development, there's VDJ recombination, which happens in the bone marrow. This process combines variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments to create the unique variable regions of the heavy chains. However, VDJ is a one-time event during the development of B cells in the bone marrow. 

Another process is somatic hypermutation, which occurs after the B cells are activated. This process introduces point mutations in the variable regions, increasing diversity and affinity for the antigen. This happens in the germinal centers during the immune response.

Wait, but the question is about the process that's taking place when they observe high variability in the variable heavy chain after the cells have been activated and proliferating. So, maybe this is happening after the initial antigen recognition, leading to the generation of diverse B cell clones.

The options are: A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

I know that class switching recombination (CSR) changes the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but it doesn't create variability in the variable regions. It just changes the class. VDJ is for initial diversity but happens earlier.

So the cells in the Peyer patches are probably activated B cells that have undergone somatic hypermutation. After activation, B cells undergo proliferation and this mutation process to create a diverse set of antibodies, leading to high variability in the variable regions.

So the process is somatic hypermutation. That's option A.


The question involves tracking the fate of GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus in mice. After oral gavage, some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, while others reach the Peyer patches, a type of secondary lymphoid organ. In the Peyer patches, the fluorescent proteins are recognized by B cells, leading to activation and proliferation. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes of these proliferating cells reveals high variability.

High variability in the variable regions of antibodies is a hallmark of processes that generate diversity during the immune response. VDJ recombination (option D) occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow and establishes initial diversity but is not relevant here since the question focuses on processes occurring after antigen recognition. Class switching recombination (option C) changes the antibody isotype but does not affect the variable regions. Complement activation (option B) is unrelated to the observed variability in the variable heavy chain.

The most likely explanation is somatic hypermutation (option A), a process that introduces point mutations in the variable regions of B cell receptors after activation, increasing diversity and affinity for the antigen. This process occurs in germinal centers during the immune response and aligns with the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.

Answer: A
