Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, wait. Oh, right, in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as column vectors, and they need to be normalized, meaning their length (or norm) should be 1. So I should probably check if this vector is normalized. Let's compute the norm squared: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 equals 1 + 4 +1 = 6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). That's not 1, so the state isn't normalized. But wait, when I compute probabilities, I need the state to be a unit vector. So, I should normalize it first. 

So, the given state vector is [-1, 2, 1]^T. Its norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized state would be each component divided by sqrt(6). So the state vector ψ is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

Next, the observable is represented by the matrix P. The matrix P has elements in the first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row as (1/sqrt(2), 0,1/sqrt(2)), and third row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Let me write that out:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

Wait, no, the second row is (1/√2, 0, 1/√2). So row 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], row 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], row3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0].

I need to find the probability that measuring the observable P gives 0. In quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of an observable are the eigenvalues of the matrix. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P. The probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the corresponding eigenvector's projection onto the state ψ.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should diagonalize P to find its eigenvalues. Let me think: if P is diagonal, then its eigenvalues are just the diagonal elements. But P isn't diagonal in this case; it's symmetric, though, so it should be diagonalizable with real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.

Wait, let me check if P is symmetric. Let's see: entry (1,2) is 1/sqrt(2), and entry (2,1) is 1/sqrt(2). Similarly, (1,3) is 0, (3,1) is 0. (2,3) is 1/sqrt(2), and (3,2
