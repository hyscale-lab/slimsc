Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve, and then some organic reactions. Hmm, let me think step by step. Okay, the question is about identifying compound D based on a series of reactions starting from compound A.

First, let's look at the NMR data for compound A. The proton NMR shows two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm integrating for 4H. Hmm, what does that tell me?

So, the triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H probably indicates a CH2CH3 group or something similar. Wait, a triplet suggests that the proton is coupling with two neighboring groups. So maybe it's a CH2 adjacent to another CH2 group. Wait, 6H could be two CH2 groups each with three H's? Wait, no, each CH2 has 2 H's. Wait, 6H as a triplet. Oh wait, maybe it's a di-substituted group where each group is a CH2CH3. Wait, like two ethyl groups.

Wait, if it's two ethyl groups, each ethyl group's CH2 would be a triplet. Because each CH2 in ethyl (CH2CH3) is split by the adjacent CH3. Oh wait, but wait, in an ethyl group, the CH2 is split into a quartet by the CH3. Wait, no. Let me think. The CH3 in ethyl is a triplet because it's next to the CH2 that has two H's. So the CH3 would be a triplet. And the CH2 would be a quartet. So in the NMR of compound A, the 0.9 ppm is a triplet for 6H, which would be three CH3 groups? No, wait, 6H is three CH2 groups? No, wait. Let me think again. Each CH2CH3 has a CH3, which is a triplet. So if there are two such groups, that would be 6 H as a triplet. So the 0.9 ppm triplet for 6H suggests two CH2CH3 groups.

Then the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet implies each proton is next to a CH2 with two protons. So 4H as a quartet. That could be a CH2CH2 group, but wait, maybe it's a CH2 adjacent to another CH2. Maybe the two ethyl groups are connected to a central CH2, like in neopentane? Or perhaps a cyclopropane ring? Wait, but maybe it's more likely that the structure is something like diethyl something.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's two ethyl groups attached to a central carbon. Like if the structure is (CH2CH3)2CH2, but wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, no. If it's (CH2CH3)2CH2, but that would be 2-ethylpropane, which is 2-methylpentane? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclohexane derivative.

Wait, wait, another thought: the triplet is for 6H, which could be a CH2CH2 group.
