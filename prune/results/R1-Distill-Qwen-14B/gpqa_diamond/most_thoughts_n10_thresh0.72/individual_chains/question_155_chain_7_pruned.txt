Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. It's about finding the uncertainty of P_z given a specific state. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔP = sqrt(⟨P²⟩ - ⟨P⟩²). So to find ΔP_z, I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared in the given state.

The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Wait, are these the components in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors? The question says that the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so yes, this state is expressed in that basis.

So P_z's matrix is given. Let me write it down. The matrix for P_z is diagonal because it's in its eigenbasis. The diagonal entries are (ħ, 0, -ħ). So the matrix looks like:

[ ħ   0    0 ]
[ 0   0    0 ]
[ 0   0  -ħ ]

But wait, the state is given as a vector (−1/2, 1/√2, −1/2). Let me make sure I understand the dimensions. Since it's a 3x3 matrix, the state is a 3-component column vector. So the state is |ψ> = [-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2]^T.

Wait a second, I should check if this vector is normalized. Let me compute the sum of the squares of its components. So ( (-1/2)^2 ) + ( (1/√2)^2 ) + ( (-1/2)^2 ) = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) is 1/2, plus 1/2 gives 1. Oh, right, so it's normalized. Good.

Now, to find ⟨P_z⟩, which is the expectation value of P_z. Since the state is in the eigenbasis of P_z, each component corresponds to an eigenvalue. So the expectation value is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

The components are |a₁|² * λ₁ + |a₂|² * λ₂ + |a₃|² * λ₃.

Let me compute each |a_i|²:

a₁ = -1/2 → |a₁|² = 1/4.

a₂ = 1/√2 → |a₂|² = 1/2.

a₃ = -1/2 → |a₃|² = 1/4.

The eigenvalues λ_i are ħ, 0, -ħ for the respective components.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (ħ/4 - ħ/4) + 0 → 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Wait, that's interesting. So the expectation
