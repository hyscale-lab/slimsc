Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry question to tackle. I remember some stuff from my notes, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think through this.

The question is about oxygen as an oxidant in different solutions—basic and acidic. The first part is thermodynamic and the second part is kinetic. Hmm.

Thermodynamics deals with whether a reaction is favorable (spontaneous) or not, based on factors like Gibbs free energy. Kinetics is about the rate at which reactions happen. So the question is asking about the oxidizing strength of O2 in basic vs acidic solutions, and how fast it reacts in acidic conditions.

Wait, I think in basic solutions, oxygen tends to be a stronger oxidant. Because in basic conditions, the pH is high, which might stabilize the oxidized form more. Like, in the standard hydrogen electrode, the basic solution has a higher pH and O2 is more oxidizing. Or wait, isn't O2 a stronger oxidizing agent in acidic conditions? No, wait, no—I'm mixing things up.

Wait, let me think about the standard reduction potentials. In acidic solution, the O2 reduction has a higher E°, meaning it's a stronger oxidizing agent. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me get the correct E° values.

I remember that the standard reduction potential for O2 + 4 H+ + 4e^- → 2 H2O(l) is around +1.23 V. But in basic solution, O2 + 2 H2O + 4e^- → 4 OH^- has a lower E°, like around +0.401 V. So in acidic solution, O2 is a stronger oxidant (higher E° means more tendency to be reduced, so it's a better oxidizing agent). So thermodynamically, in basic solution, O2 is a weaker oxidant compared to acidic, right? Wait, wait, because the E° is higher in acidic, so O2 is a stronger oxidizing agent in acidic. So in basic, it's weaker.

Wait, the question says: Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. So the blank is 'weaker' because it's less strong compared to acidic. Because higher E° means stronger oxidant.

So the first blank is 'weaker' because in basic solutions, the E° is lower, making O2 a weaker oxid
