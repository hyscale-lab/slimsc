Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm. Let me read it carefully. The question is about an acid-catalyzed reaction involving 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to select the correct reagent A and catalyst B from the options given.

Wait, so the starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine. Pyrrolidine is a five-membered amine ring, right? So, 3-methyl means there's a methyl group attached at the third position. When it reacts under acid catalysis, probably some kind of electrophilic substitution or addition? I'm a bit fuzzy on this.

The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Let me visualize that. The substituent is at position 1 of the pyrrolidine ring. The substituent is cyclohexylidenemethyl, which I think is a cyclohexyl group attached via a methylene bridge. Wait, cyclohexylidenemethylâ€”maybe it's a cyclohexene ring attached to a methyl group, so like a substituted cyclohexane with a double bond. Hmm, perhaps it's a cyclohexylidene group, which is a cyclohexyl group with a double bond. So, maybe a cyclohexene ring connected via a methylene (-CH2-) group?

Wait, cyclohexylidenemethyl would be like a cyclohexyl group with a double bond to the methylene. So, structure-wise, it's a cyclohexene ring connected via a CH2 group to the pyrrolidine. So the substituent is a methylene group attached to a cyclohexene ring.

So the reaction is adding this cyclohexylidenemethyl group to the pyrrolidine. Under acid-catalyzed conditions, what reactions happen with amines? Oh, maybe it's an alkylation or some kind of cyclization.

Wait, wait. Let's think about possible reactions. 3-methylpyrrolidine has a ring with a nitrogen. In acid conditions, perhaps the amine is protonated. Protonated amines are good leaving groups sometimes, but I'm
