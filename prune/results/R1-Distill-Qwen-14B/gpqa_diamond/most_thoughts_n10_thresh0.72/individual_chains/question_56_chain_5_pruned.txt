Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about the hydrogen atom. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state into |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. Hmm, I remember that dipole transitions are governed by certain selection rules.

Wait, what are the selection rules for electron transitions in hydrogen? Oh right, for a dipole transition, the change in the angular momentum quantum number l is Δl = ±1, and the magnetic quantum number m doesn't change (Δm = 0), or changes by ±1. But wait, wait, another thing: the principal quantum number n can change by any number as long as the other conditions are met.

So the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The final state is |1,0,0⟩. So n changes from 3 to 1, which is a decrease by 2. But since it's a two-step process, each step can only change n by 1, right? Because in each dipole transition, Δn must be ±1. So from 3 to 2 in the first step, then 2 to 1 in the second.

Now, each transition must follow the l and m selection rules. The initial l is 0 (s orbital). So the first transition must change l by ±1. So from l=0, the next l can be 1.

So the first transition would go from |3,0,0⟩ to either |2,1, m⟩, where m can be -1, 0, +1. So possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1,1⟩. But wait, what about the second transition? It has to go from n=2 to n=1, so again, l must change by ±1. The l for the intermediate state is 1, so the next l must be 0 or 2. But the final state is l=0, so from l=1, the second transition must go to l=0.

So the possible m values for each step: Let's think about the first step. The initial m is 0. So in the first transition, m can change by 0, +1, or -1. Wait, no, the selection rule for m is Δm = 0,
