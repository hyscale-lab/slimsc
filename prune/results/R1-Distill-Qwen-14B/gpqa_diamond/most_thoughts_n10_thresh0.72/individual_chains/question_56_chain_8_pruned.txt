Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom and electron transitions. Hmm. Let me think. The question is about the state |3,0,0> decaying to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I need to find the correct transition route and the probability.

Wait, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, the selection rules for dipole transitions are important. For an electron to transition via a dipole, certain quantum numbers change in specific ways. Let me recall: the selection rules for the hydrogen atom are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So the orbital angular momentum quantum number l can change by ±1, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0, ±1.

The initial state is |3,0,0>. So n=3, l=0, m=0. It's decaying to |1,0,0>, which is n=1, l=0, m=0. Since the transition is via two dipole transitions, there must be an intermediate state that the electron passes through. So, from |3,0,0>, it goes to some intermediate state, then to |1,0,0>.

Wait, but how does the transition happen? Each dipole transition can only change l by ±1. So, starting from l=0 (since initial state is l=0), the next step must have l=±1. Wait, no, wait: the initial state is |3,0,0>, so l=0. So to go via a dipole transition, the first step must change l to l=1 or l=-1, but l can't be negative because it's a non-negative integer. So l can only go to 1. So the intermediate state must have l=1.

So the first transition is from |3,0,0> to a state with l=1. The possible m values for l=1 are m = -1, 0, +1.

Wait, but the initial m is 0. So the selection rule for m is Δm = 0, ±1. So from m=0, the possible m in the next state is -1, 0, or +1.

So the first transition could be to a state like |n', l=1, m= -1>, |n', l=1, m=0>, or |n', l=1,
