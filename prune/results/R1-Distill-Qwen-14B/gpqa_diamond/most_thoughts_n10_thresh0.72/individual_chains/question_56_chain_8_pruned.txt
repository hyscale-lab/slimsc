Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom and electron transitions. Hmm, let me think. The question is about the |3,0,0> state decaying to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, transitions happen between energy levels, and dipole transitions follow certain selection rules.

Wait, the selection rules for dipole transitions are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Oh right, and for electrons, you can only transition if those rules are followed. So, the initial state is n=3, l=0 (which is an s orbital), m=0.

The final state is n=1, l=0, m=0. So, the electron has to drop from n=3 to n=1 in two steps because it's a two-photon emission. So, first it goes from 3 to something, then to 1.

First transition: from n=3, l=0 to which possible state? Since l can change by ±1, so l can go from 0 to 1. Because if you're in l=0, the next possible is l=1. So the first state after transition would have l=1. So possible intermediate states are |2,1,m>, where m can be -1, 0, +1.

So the first step must be from |3,0,0> to one of |2,1,m> states. Then the second step would be from that |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>.

Wait, but does the second transition require going from l=1 to l=0? Yes, because the final state is l=0. So in the second transition, l must decrease by 1 (from 1 to 0). So that's allowed because Δl is -1.

Now, the question is which intermediate m values are allowed. For the first transition, m can change by 0, ±1. So from m=0, it can go to m=-1, 0, or +1 in the first transition.

Then, in the second transition, m must change again by ±1 or 0. So let's see:

Case 1: First transition goes to m=0. So the state is |2,1,0>. Then, in the second transition, m can go to m= -1, 0, +1? Wait, no. Because the second transition is from l=1 to l=0, so the m of the state must be 0, because l=0 only has m=0. So after the second transition, m must be 0.

Wait, but the selection rules for dipole transitions also require that the change in m (Δm) can be 0, ±1. So for the first transition, from m=0 to m=Δm=0, ±1. So in the first step, possible m's are -1, 0, +1.

Then, in the second step, l goes from 1 to 0, so the new m must be 0 because l=0 only has m=0. So the second transition has to have m going from whatever it was in the intermediate state to 0.

So let's look
