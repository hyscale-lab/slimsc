Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the setup is that there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in the same conditions. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i, where i is the square root of -1. When they measured the particles' positions, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. That probably means that the wave function is zero outside this interval, right? Because if the wave function is zero, the probability of finding the particle there is zero.

Wait, the question is asking for the numerical value of 'a'. The options are given, so perhaps we can find 'a' using normalization. Because for a valid wave function, the integral of the probability density over all space must equal 1. That is, the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 should be 1.

So, ψ(x) is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that's a complex function. Let me write it as ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1 + x)] - 0.5i. Hmm, so the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5.

But wait, when calculating the probability density |ψ|^2, that's equal to ψ*ψ. So, let's compute that.

ψ = A - i B, where A is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and B is 0.5. So, ψ* is A + i B. Multiply them:

(A - iB)(A + iB) = A² + (iB A - iA B) + (i^2)(B²) → wait, actually, it's A² + B², since the cross terms are imaginary and cancel out.

Wait, no—more accurately, (A - iB)(A + iB) = A² + AB i - AB i - i² B². The middle terms cancel, and since i² is -1, it becomes A² + B².

So, |ψ(x)|² = [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2 = [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

But wait, that seems a bit off. Because the wave function is given as a complex function, but in the region where x is between 1 and 3, it's non-zero. Outside, it's zero. So, the wave function must be zero outside, so integrating from 1 to 3.

So the normalization condition is integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Wait, but wait—did I compute |ψ(x)|² correctly? Let me double-check. ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - i*(0.5). So when you take ψ*(x)ψ(x):

ψ*(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) + i*(0.5). So the product is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2 + i [a/(sqrt(1+x)) * 0.5 - a/(sqrt(1+x)) * 0.5]. Hmm, wait no, the cross terms would involve i, but when you multiply, it's (A)(A) + (A)(i B) + (i B)(A) + (i B)(i B). So:

A² + AB i + AB i + (i²) B² → A² + 2AB i - B².

Wait, but that's not right because the product is real. Wait, no, actually, because ψ is a complex function, the square would be a complex number, but the probability density is the real part? Or wait, no—wait, the probability density is the modulus squared, which is real. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach.

Wait, perhaps
