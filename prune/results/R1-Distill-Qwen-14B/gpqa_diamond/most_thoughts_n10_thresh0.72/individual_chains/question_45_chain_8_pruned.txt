Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see, the question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. Hmm.

Wait, right, the particles are spin-1/2, so they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two particles can occupy the same quantum state, including spin. But since the potential is one-dimensional, each particle has a quantum number n and a spin state. Oh, right, because spin is another quantum number, so for each spatial state, there are two possible spin states (up and down).

The well has length L, and the energy levels are given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²). Or, as the problem states, E = π² ħ²/(2mL²), so each level is E multiplied by n squared. So E_n = n² E.

Now, since it's a one-dimensional infinite potential well, each particle is in a state with some n. But because the particles are identical fermions, they have to obey the Pauli exclusion. So each spatial state can hold two particles (spin-up and spin-down). Wait, no—actually, each unique spatial wavefunction can hold two particles, each with opposite spins.

So with four particles, we need to figure out how to fill up the lowest energy states without violating the Pauli principle.

Let me think about the ground state first. The ground state is the lowest energy configuration. Since each n can hold two particles, let's see:

n=1 can hold two particles. Then n=2 can hold two more. But wait, four particles. So the first two go into n=1 (each with opposite spins), and the next two go into n=2 (again, each with opposite spins). So for four particles, the ground state would have two levels filled: n=1 and n=2.

Wait, but wait. No. Wait, each n can hold two particles (because spin-up and spin-down). So for four particles, we can have n=1 with two particles, and n=2 with two particles. That would be the lowest possible energy.

So the total energy would be the sum of each particle's energy. But since the particles are indistinguishable, the energy of the system is just the sum of the energies of each occupied state, each multiplied by the number of particles in that state.

So for the ground state:

- n=1: 2 particles → energy 1² E = E. So 2 particles contribute 2E (but wait, each particle in n=1 has energy E, so two particles contribute 2E. Similarly for n=2.

Wait, no. Each particle in n=1 contributes E. So two particles in n=1 contribute E * 2 = 2E. Similarly, two particles in n=2 contribute (2² E) * 2 = 4E * 2? Wait, no. Wait, each particle in n=2 has energy 4E, so two particles would contribute 8E? Hmm, but that would make the ground state total energy 2E + 8E = 10E.

Wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Each particle's energy is E_n = n² E. So for four particles:

In the ground state, the lowest possible energy is achieved by filling the states with the lowest n. So for four particles, because each n can hold two particles, the first two go into n=1, and the next two go into n=2. So the total energy is:

Number of particles in n=1: 2 → each contributes E, so 2E.

Number in n=2: 2 → each contributes 4E, so 8E.

Total energy: 2E + 8E = 10E. So ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but wait another moment. Are the particles allowed to all be in the same state? No, because of the Pauli exclusion. So for four particles, the first two are in n=1 with opposite spins, and the next two are in n=2, each with opposite spins. So yeah, the total is 2*(1^2 E) + 2*(2^2 E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.

So the ground state

Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. It's about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given as A, B, C, D with various multiples of E, where E is pi²ħ²/(2mL²). 

Hmm, right. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. So, the particles are spin-1/2, which means electrons, I suppose. And since they're identical fermions, the Pauli exclusion principle applies. So, each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers.

In a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The energy for a single particle in level n is E_n = (n²)E, where E is the base energy given. So for n=1, it's E; n=2, 4E; n=3, 9E; n=4, 16E, etc.

But wait, wait. Since the particles are fermions, they have to obey the Pauli exclusion. So each n level can hold a certain number of particles, considering their spin states.

Each energy level n can have a certain number of spin states. Spin-1/2 has two possible states: spin-up and spin-down. So for each n, you can have two particles with opposite spins occupying the same n.

So, for four particles, how do they fill up the energy levels?

Let me think about the ground state first. Ground state is the lowest energy configuration. So we'll fill the lowest possible n's with maximum number of particles.

n=1 can hold two particles (each with opposite spins). Then n=2 can hold two more. Wait, but wait, four particles in total. So putting two in n=1 and two in n=2.

Wait, but wait, wait a second. No, because each n can have two particles, spin-up and spin-down. So the first two particles go into n=1, each with opposite spins. The next two would go into n=2, each with opposite spins. So all four are filled into n=1 and n=2, each with two particles. So the ground state energy would be the sum of each particle's energy.

Wait, no. For the total energy of the system, it's the sum of the energies of each particle. So each particle in n=1 contributes E, and each in n=2 contributes 4E. So two particles in n=1: 2E. Two in n=2: 2*(4E)=8E. So total is 2E +8E=10E. But wait, the options don't have 10E as the ground state. Wait, the options are about the system's total energy. Hmm, wait, no. Let me check the question again.

The question says, "Calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy E." So for each state of the system (ground, first excited, second excited), what is the total energy.

Ah, so we're considering the system's energy as the sum of each particle's energy.

So for the ground state, the particles fill the lowest possible energy levels with their spins. So four particles: two in n=1 (each with spin up and down), and two in n=2 (same). So their energies are 1²E, 1²E, 2²E, 2²E. Summing up, 1+1+4+4 = 10E. So ground state energy is 10E.

Wait a second, no. Wait, no, each particle in a state has energy n²E. So two particles in n=1 (each contributing 1E), and two in n=2 (each 4E). So 2*(1) + 2*(4) = 2 +8=10E. So the ground state is 10E. 

But looking at the options, option B's ground state is 4E. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if the four particles are all in the same level, which is impossible because of the Pauli exclusion. So the minimal configuration is two in n=1 and two in n=2, giving 10E.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm mixing up the approach. Alternatively, perhaps each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers, but in this case, since it's a 1D well, the quantum number is just n, and spin. So each unique (n, spin) counts. So each n can hold up to two particles.

So filling up:

n=1, spin up: particle 1

n=1, spin down: particle 2

n=2, spin up: particle 3

n=2, spin down: particle 4

So the total energy is 2*(1E) + 2*(4E) = 10E. So the ground state is 10E. Then the first excited state would be when one of the particles moves to a higher state.

Wait, but how? Because the particles are fermions, and their filling is according to the lowest energy. So to get the first excited state, we need to promote one particle to the next available state, but considering the Pauli exclusion.

Wait, perhaps considering that the ground state is filled up as much as possible, and the excited states are when one or more particles are in higher energy levels.

Wait, the ground state is 10E. Now, for the first excited state, perhaps moving the highest particle (n=2) to the next available level, but considering the spin.

Wait, but n=3 is higher. Let's think: each state is filled with two particles (spin up and down) per n. So after n=2, which holds two particles, the next available is n=3
