Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. It's about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given as A, B, C, D with various multiples of E, where E is pi²ħ²/(2mL²). 

Hmm, right. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. So, the particles are spin-1/2, which means electrons, I suppose. And since they're identical fermions, the Pauli exclusion principle applies. So, each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers.

In a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The energy for a single particle in level n is E_n = (n²)E, where E is the base energy given. So for n=1, it's E; n=2, 4E; n=3, 9E; n=4, 16E, etc.

But wait, wait. Since the particles are fermions, they have to obey the Pauli exclusion. So each n level can hold a certain number of particles, considering their spin states.

Each energy level n can have a certain number of spin states. Spin-1/2 has two possible states: spin-up and spin-down. So for each n, you can have two particles with opposite spins occupying the same n.

So, for four particles, how do they fill up the energy levels?

Let me think about the ground state first. Ground state is the lowest energy configuration. So we'll fill the lowest possible n's with maximum number of particles.

n=1 can hold two particles (each with opposite spins). Then n=2 can hold two more. Wait, but wait, four particles in total. So putting two in n=1 and two in n=2.

Wait, but wait, wait a second. No, because each n can have two particles, spin-up and spin-down. So the first two particles go into n=1, each with opposite spins. The next two would go into n=2, each with opposite spins. So all four are filled into n=1 and n=2, each with two particles. So the ground state energy would be the sum of each particle's energy.

Wait, no. For the total energy of the system, it's the sum of the energies of each particle. So each particle in n=1 contributes E, and each in n=2 contributes 4E. So two particles in n=1: 2E. Two in n=2: 2*(4E)=8E. So total is 2E +8E=10E. But wait, the options don't have 10E as the ground state. Wait, the options are about the system's total energy. Hmm, wait, no. Let me check the question again.

The question says, "Calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy E." So for each state of the system (ground, first excited, second excited), what is the total energy.

Ah, so we're considering the system's energy as the sum of each particle's energy.

So for the ground state, the particles fill the lowest possible energy levels with their spins. So four particles: two in n=1 (each with spin up and down), and two in n=2 (same). So their energies are 1²E, 1²E, 2²E, 2²E. Summing up, 1+1+4+4 = 10E. So ground state energy is 10E.

Wait a second, no. Wait, no, each particle in a state has energy n²E. So two particles in n=1 (each contributing 1E), and two in n=2 (each 4E). So 2*(1) + 2*(4) = 2 +8=10E. So the ground state is 10E. 

But looking at the options, option B's ground state is 4E. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if the four particles are all in the same level, which is impossible because of the Pauli exclusion. So the minimal configuration is two in n=1 and two in n=2, giving 10E.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm mixing up the approach. Alternatively, perhaps each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers, but in this case, since it's a 1D well, the quantum number is just n, and spin. So each unique (n, spin) counts. So each n can hold up to two particles.

So filling up:

n=1, spin up: particle 1

n=1, spin down: particle 2

n=2, spin up: particle 3

n=2, spin down: particle 4

So the total energy is 2*(1E) + 2*(4E) = 10E. So the ground state is 10E. Then the first excited state would be when one of the particles moves to a higher state.

Wait, but how? Because the particles are fermions, and their filling is according to the lowest energy. So to get the first excited state, we need to promote one particle to the next available state, but considering the Pauli exclusion.

Wait, perhaps considering that the ground state is filled up as much as possible, and the excited states are when one or more particles are in higher energy levels.

Wait, the ground state is 10E. Now, for the first excited state, perhaps moving the highest particle (n=2) to the next available level, but considering the spin.

Wait, but n=3 is higher. Let's think: each state is filled with two particles (spin up and down) per n. So after n=2, which holds two particles, the next available is n=3
