Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see, the question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. Hmm.

Wait, right, the particles are spin-1/2, so they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two particles can occupy the same quantum state, including spin. But since the potential is one-dimensional, each particle has a quantum number n and a spin state. Oh, right, because spin is another quantum number, so for each spatial state, there are two possible spin states (up and down).

The well has length L, and the energy levels are given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²). Or, as the problem states, E = π² ħ²/(2mL²), so each level is E multiplied by n squared. So E_n = n² E.

Now, since it's a one-dimensional infinite potential well, each particle is in a state with some n. But because the particles are identical fermions, they have to obey the Pauli exclusion. So each spatial state can hold two particles (spin-up and spin-down). Wait, no—actually, each unique spatial wavefunction can hold two particles, each with opposite spins.

So with four particles, we need to figure out how to fill up the lowest energy states without violating the Pauli principle.

Let me think about the ground state first. The ground state is the lowest energy configuration. Since each n can hold two particles, let's see:

n=1 can hold two particles. Then n=2 can hold two more. But wait, four particles. So the first two go into n=1 (each with opposite spins), and the next two go into n=2 (again, each with opposite spins). So for four particles, the ground state would have two levels filled: n=1 and n=2.

Wait, but wait. No. Wait, each n can hold two particles (because spin-up and spin-down). So for four particles, we can have n=1 with two particles, and n=2 with two particles. That would be the lowest possible energy.

So the total energy would be the sum of each particle's energy. But since the particles are indistinguishable, the energy of the system is just the sum of the energies of each occupied state, each multiplied by the number of particles in that state.

So for the ground state:

- n=1: 2 particles → energy 1² E = E. So 2 particles contribute 2E (but wait, each particle in n=1 has energy E, so two particles contribute 2E. Similarly for n=2.

Wait, no. Each particle in n=1 contributes E. So two particles in n=1 contribute E * 2 = 2E. Similarly, two particles in n=2 contribute (2² E) * 2 = 4E * 2? Wait, no. Wait, each particle in n=2 has energy 4E, so two particles would contribute 8E? Hmm, but that would make the ground state total energy 2E + 8E = 10E.

Wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Each particle's energy is E_n = n² E. So for four particles:

In the ground state, the lowest possible energy is achieved by filling the states with the lowest n. So for four particles, because each n can hold two particles, the first two go into n=1, and the next two go into n=2. So the total energy is:

Number of particles in n=1: 2 → each contributes E, so 2E.

Number in n=2: 2 → each contributes 4E, so 8E.

Total energy: 2E + 8E = 10E. So ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but wait another moment. Are the particles allowed to all be in the same state? No, because of the Pauli exclusion. So for four particles, the first two are in n=1 with opposite spins, and the next two are in n=2, each with opposite spins. So yeah, the total is 2*(1^2 E) + 2*(2^2 E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.

So the ground state
