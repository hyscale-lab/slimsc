Okay, so I've got this question about a scientific experiment involving ligands, receptors, and some genetic constructs. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, the setup: The researcher has identified a new ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They want to study their developmental roles. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets that form a binding site. The ligand is a coiled-coil made of two alpha helices. 

They created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. I remember that bicistronic means it has two coding regions, so two proteins are expressed from one vector. The vector is using loxP sites for recombination, probably with Cre to excise certain parts.

The ligand's ORF (open reading frame) is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at its C-terminus. So, each has a fluorescent marker attached.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. I think CBA is a strong promoter, maybe used for expression in certain cells. The receptor has an IRES regulatory element upstream. IRES is a structure that allows internal ribosome entry, so it can drive the expression of a second gene in the same mRNA, typically in a cell type-specific manner.

Now, between the ligand and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP is a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. I recall that loxP sites are recognition sites for Cre recombinase. So, when Cre is present, it can excise the stop cassette, allowing the genes to be expressed. Lox2272 is a variant that I think is used with Cre to produce different excision outcomes, perhaps in a way that is compatible or not with loxP.

They transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins on a Western blot. The blot shows signals proportional to actin loading, which suggests that the blot is working correctly because actin is a housekeeping gene and should be present in all samples.

Then, they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre would likely be active in neural crest-derived cells. After the offspring are born, they look for the GFP signal under a confocal microscope but don't see any green.

The question is why there's no green signal (which is from the receptor-eGFP fusion). The options are about possible reasons.

Looking at the options:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Hmm. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the construct is in the same vector, so if the ligand is expressed, it would act on the same cell's receptor? Or maybe on neighboring cells. Wait, but the vector is bicistronic, so both are expressed in the same cell. But paracrine would mean the ligand is secreted and acts elsewhere. Not sure if this directly affects the expression of the GFP.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi. So, the construct might not be properly trafficked. The eGFP would be on the receptor, which is a transmembrane protein. If it's stuck in the Golgi, it wouldn't reach the cell surface, so no fluorescence. But why would that happen? Maybe a stop codon or frame issue? The construct has a stop cassette between receptor and eGFP, so without Cre, the receptor is expressed but without eGFP. Wait, let me think again.

The vector is bicistronic. So ligand and receptor are both expressed. The ligand is under CBA promoter, which is strong. The receptor is under IRES, which is usually weaker. So, in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed (with mCherry) and the receptor is expressed (but with a stop before eGFP, so no eGFP). So, in the mouse, when they are crossed with SOX10-Cre, the Cre would excise the loxP and lox2272 stops. Let me see: the ligand has a stop in loxP, so Cre would excise that, so ligand and mCherry are co-expressed. Similarly, the receptor's stop is in lox2272, so Cre would excise that as well, allowing eGFP to be expressed.

Wait, but lox
