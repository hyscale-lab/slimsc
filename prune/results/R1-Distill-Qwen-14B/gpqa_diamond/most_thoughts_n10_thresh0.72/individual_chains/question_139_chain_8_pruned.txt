Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying starting materials A and B that, when treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water, produce different diketones. 

Hmm, I remember that sodium nitrite and HCl are involved in diazotization reactions, typically with amines. Oh wait, right! Diazonium salts are formed from aromatic amines, especially those with activating groups. But wait, in this case, the products are diketones, which are carbonyl compounds. So maybe the starting materials are something that can form carbonyl groups upon certain reactions.

Wait, another thought: if the starting material is a benzyl alcohol or some other alcohol, maybe it undergoes a substitution reaction. Oh wait, I think when an alcohol is treated with HCl and NaNO2, maybe it's a formation of a diazonium salt, but that's more for amines. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different kind of reaction. 

Wait, another possibility: if the starting material is a secondary or tertiary alcohol, maybe it can undergo some kind of elimination or substitution. Alternatively, maybe the reaction involves oxidation. Because if you have an alcohol, under certain conditions, it can oxidize to a ketone. But wait, the reagents here are HCl, NaNO2, water. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, I remember that in the presence of HCl and NaNO2, a primary amine forms a diazonium salt, which can then undergo various reactions. But in this case, the product is a diketone, which suggests that two ketone groups are formed. So perhaps the starting material is a diol, and the reaction is turning both hydroxyl groups into ketones? Or maybe it's a glycol that's forming a diketone after oxidation.

Wait, another approach: looking at the products. The first product is 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione. So it's a cyclohexane ring with two ketones (dione) at positions 1 and 2, and an isopropyl group at position 4. The second product is 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione. So it's a six-carbon chain with ketones at positions 2 and 3, and a methyl group at position 5.

So both products are 1,2
