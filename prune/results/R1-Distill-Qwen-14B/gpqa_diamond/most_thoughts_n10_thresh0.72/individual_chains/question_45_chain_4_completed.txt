Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. The question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The energy E is given as E = π²ħ²/(2mL²). The options are A to D, each giving different combinations of energies.

Wait, first, I remember that for a particle in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula is En = (n²)E, where E is the base energy (n=1), so n is an integer. So each particle's energy is proportional to the square of its quantum number.

But wait, the particles are identical and spin-1/2, which means they're fermions. Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. Since the particles are in the same potential well, their quantum numbers (n) must be unique, but because they have spin, each state can hold two particles (spin up and spin down).

So here's the thing: each energy level can hold two particles, one for each spin state. So the filling of the energy levels will depend on how many particles we have and the order of their energy levels.

Let me write down the steps:

1. The particles are spin-1/2 fermions, so each energy level (each n) can hold 2 particles (spin up and spin down).

2. The energy levels are E, 4E, 9E, 16E, 25E, etc., since En = n²E.

3. We have four particles to place into these energy levels, filling them according to the Pauli exclusion principle.

So the first step is to figure out how the four particles fill the energy levels.

Let's list the energy levels in order:

n=1 → E
n=2 →4E
n=3 →9E
n=4→16E
n=5→25E
and so on.

Each n can hold 2 particles. Since we have four particles, let's see how they fill.

Ground state: All particles are in the lowest possible energy states.

Starting from n=1: it can hold 2 particles (spin up and down). Then n=2 can hold the next 2. So n=1 has 2, n=2 has 2. So four particles in total. So the configuration would be (n=1: 2 particles), (n=2: 2 particles).

Wait, but wait: in the ground state, the particles fill the lowest available orbitals. So the first two go into n=1, and the next two go into n=2. So the energy levels occupied are n=1 and n=2.

But wait, no. Each energy level can hold 2 particles (since spin-1/2, two possible spins). So for four particles, the first two go into n=1 (each with opposite spins), the next two into n=2. So the total energy would be 2 particles in n=1 (so 2 * E each), and 2 particles in n=2 (each 4E). So total energy is (2*E) + (2*4E) = 2E +8E=10E.

Wait, but wait: Each particle in n=1 contributes E, so two of them: 2E. Each in n=2 contributes 4E, two of them: 8E. So total 10E for the ground state.

But wait, the system's energy is the sum of all the individual energies. So ground state is 2*(E) + 2*(4E) = 10E. Hmm. But wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, each particle in n=1 has energy E, so two particles would contribute 2E.

Similarly, each in n=2 has 4E, two particles contribute 8E.

So total energy is 2E +8E=10E. So ground state energy is 10E.

But wait, looking at the options, option C says the ground state is 4E, first excited 10E, second excited 15E. Option B has ground state 4E, etc. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way the particles are filled. Let me think again. The particles may not necessarily all be in the same n level. Because when you have identical particles, especially fermions, each must have a unique set of quantum numbers, which in this case includes n and spin. So for each n, you can have two states (spin up and spin down), so each n can hold two particles.

So the filling would be:

Number of particles: 4.

n=1: 2 particles (max, since 2 spins)

n=2: 2 particles (again, 2 spins)

Total:4 particles. So the occupied states are n=1 and n=2.

So the total energy is 2*(E) + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E =10E. So the ground state energy is 10E? But in the options, only option B and C have 10E as the first excited state. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait the question says 'ground state, first excited, second excited' for the system. So the ground state is the lowest possible total energy, which is 10E as I calculated.

But wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again: the particles are spin-1/2, so each can have spin up or down. So for each n, two possible states.

So for four particles, the first two fill n=1 (each with opposite spins), then the next two go into n=2. So the total energy is 2E (from n=1) + 2*(4E) (from n=2) = 2E +8E=10E.

So the ground state energy is 10E.

But wait, look at the options. Option C says ground state is 4E, first excited 10E, second 15E. Option B says ground state 4E, first excited 10E, second 50E.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the ground state wrong. What if the ground state is when all particles are in the same state? No, that's impossible because they're fermions and can't occupy the same quantum state.

So the way I filled it is correct. Now, moving on. The first excited state: how does that work?

Wait, maybe the first excited state would involve promoting one particle to the next available state, which would be n=3.

Wait, but let me think again. The ground state is when all the lowest possible states are filled. So for four particles, the filling is n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). The first excited state would involve moving one of the particles to the next available state, which would be n=3, but only one particle can go there because n=3 can hold 2, but perhaps since four particles are already in the system, maybe the first excited state has one particle promoted to n=3.

Wait, but wait, let's think about the possible states in order.

Ground state: n=1 has 2, n=2 has 2. The next available state is n=3, which can hold 2 more.

But since we have only four particles, perhaps the first excited state would have one particle promoted to a higher state.

Wait, but wait, when you have multiple particles, the ground state is when the particles are in the lowest possible states. The first excited state would involve moving the highest occupied state up by one level, but that's not possible because each level can hold two. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3. But wait, since n=2 is filled (2 particles), perhaps the first excited state would be moving one particle from n=2 to n=3, but that would mean that n=3 has one particle and n=2 has one left. But wait, no, because each n can hold two particles. So let me think in terms of the possible configurations.

Wait, perhaps the ground state has the lowest possible energy, which is when the particles are in the lowest possible n levels. So with four particles, the configuration is (n=1: 2), (n=2:2). The next possible state (first excited) would be to have one particle promoted to n=3, which is the next higher energy level. But wait, n=3 can hold two particles, so perhaps I can have two in n=3, but that would require more particles. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when the highest filled level is n=3, but only with two particles, but that would require more particles than we have. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Let me think about filling the states in order of energy. The particles are spin-1/2, so each n can hold 2 particles. The ground state fills n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2), giving 4 particles in total. So the ground state energy is 2E + 2*(4E)=10E.

The first excited state would be the next possible configuration. Now, how can we have an excited state with four particles? We could have one particle promoted to a higher n.

Wait, but no, because all the lower n's are filled. So perhaps the first excited state has the n=2 level partially filled, but that's not possible because each n can be filled with two particles. Hmm, maybe the first excited state would involve a particle moving from n=2 to n=3. But wait, that would require that n=2 has less than two particles, which isn't the case in the ground state. So perhaps the first excited state is when one of the particles from n=2 moves to n=3. But then, n=3 would have one particle, and n=2 would have one less. So the configuration would be n=1 (2), n=2 (1), and n=3 (1). But wait, that gives a total of 4 particles again.

Wait, but each n can hold two particles, so for n=3, having one particle is allowed. So the first excited state would have the particles in n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So the energy would be 2E (n=1) + 1*(4E) (n=2) + 1*(9E) (n=3) = 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Wait, but then the ground state is 10E and first excited is 15E. But looking at the options, option C says ground state 4E, first excited 10E, second 15E. So that would make sense, but wait, what about the ground state? How can that be 4E?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ground state. Maybe the ground state is when the particles are arranged in the lowest possible n levels, but perhaps the way I calculated before is wrong. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the particles are arranged in the lowest possible n's, but whether it's possible to have a lower energy. For four particles, the minimal arrangement would be n=1:2, n=2:2. So total E is 2E + 2*(4E) = 10E. So ground state is 10E.

But in the options, option C has 4E as the ground state, which doesn't match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the way the energy is calculated. Let me think again: each particle in n has energy En =n²E. So for each particle in n=1, it's E. In n=2, 4E.

In the ground state, two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. So total energy is 2*(E) + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E=10E.

So ground state is 10E, first excited state would be when one particle is promoted to n=3. So the configuration would be n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. So total energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Wait, but that's just the first excited state. The second excited state would be when another particle is promoted to higher n. Let's see:

Second excited state could have another particle promoted, say from n=2 to n=3, but that would require that n=2 has one less particle.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state has the particles in n=1:2, n=2:0, and n=3:2. So total energy would be 2E + 2*(9E)=2E +18E=20E. But that's not an option in the given choices.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1, and another particle promoted to n=4:1. Wait, but that would require 2+1+1+1=5 particles, which we don't have. So perhaps the second excited state would have the particles in n=1:2, n=2:1, and n=3:1, same as the first excited state, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when all four particles are in the lowest possible n's, but with the highest n being 3. So n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. Then the next excited state would be when n=1:2, n=2:0, n=3:2, which would be 2E + 2*(9E) =2E +18E=20E.

Wait, but none of the options have 20E. Let's check the options again.

Option A: 30E, 39E,50E.

Option B:4E,10E,50E.

Option C:4E,10E,15E.

Option D:10E,15E,18E.

Hmm, so if the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E, that would match option D. But wait, how does that fit?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the filling. Let me think again. Maybe the way the particles are filled leads to different energies.

Wait, perhaps the ground state is when each particle is in the lowest possible n, with each n holding two particles. So n=1:2, n=2:2, giving a total of 4 particles. So the ground state energy is 2E + 8E=10E.

The first excited state would be when one of the particles in n=2 moves up to n=3, leaving n=2 with one particle, and n=3 with one. So the configuration is n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. The energy would be 2E +4E +9E=15E. That's the first excited state.

Now, the second excited state could involve another promotion. Maybe the next available state is n=4, but perhaps it's more efficient to promote another particle from n=2 to n=3, but that's not possible because each n can hold two. Alternatively, maybe another particle from n=2 moves to n=3, making n=3 have two particles, and n=2 empty. Wait, but that would require moving two particles, which might be a higher energy configuration.

Wait, but let's think about the possible next step. After the first excited state, the second excited state would have the next possible promotion. So perhaps one more particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, making n=2:0, n=3:2. So the configuration would be n=1:2, n=3:2. The energy would be 2E + 2*(9E)= 2E +18E=20E. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=4, so the configuration is n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1, n=4:0. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because we still have four particles. Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when the particles are in n=1:2, n=2:2, but that's the ground state. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the possible energy levels in order, and figure out what the first and second excited states would be when considering the total energy.

Wait, another approach: the ground state is the lowest possible energy, which is 10E. The first excited state would be the next possible energy state, which is when the highest occupied n increases. So perhaps the first excited state is when the highest n is 3, and the configuration is n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. The energy is 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Then, the second excited state would be the next possible, which could be when the highest n is 4, and the configuration is n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:0, n=4:1. But wait, that's not possible because each n can hold two. So perhaps the second excited state is when one more particle is promoted to n=3, making n=3 have two particles and n=2 have zero. So the configuration is n=1:2, n=3:2. The total energy would be 2E + 18E=20E.

But 20E isn't an option. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the first excited state is when the system is in a higher configuration, but perhaps the way I'm counting is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state isn't when a particle is promoted to a higher n, but another scenario. Let me think: maybe the first excited state of the system corresponds to the first possible higher energy that can be achieved by adding a particle to a higher n, while the others stay in their lowest states.

Wait, perhaps the ground state is 10E. Then, the first excited state would have one particle in n=3 and the rest in the lowest possible. So the configuration would be: two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state would then be when another particle is promoted to n=3, making it two in n=3, and one in n=2. But wait, that's 2 in n=3, which is allowed. So the configuration is two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3. The energy would be 2E + 18E=20E. But again, that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when the particles are arranged such that the highest n is 3, but maybe in a different configuration, like one in n=3 and the rest in n=2? Let's see, that would require two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Which gives an energy of 2E + 4E +9E=15E. So that's the first excited state.

Then, the second excited state would be when one more particle is promoted to n=3, making it two in n=3, and zero in n=2. So energy would be 2E + 18E=20E. But again, that's not in the options.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again.

Option D says the energies are 10E, 15E, 18E.

Hmm. 10E, 15E, then 18E. How can the second excited state be 18E?

Well, 18E would come from n=4: 16E. Wait, 16E is n=4. So 16E per particle. But how would that fit into the four particles?

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4. Let's calculate the energy:

n=1:2 particles → 2E,

n=2:1 particle →4E,

n=3:1 particle →9E,

n=4:0 particles.

Wait, no, that's the same as the first excited state.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state has one particle in n=3 and another in n=4, making the configuration: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3, 0 in others. So the energy would be 2E + 2*(9E) = 20E, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4, but that requires four particles. Wait, no, because 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4. The energy would be 2E +4E +16E=22E. Still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way I'm filling the states. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the system's total energy is the sum of all individual energies. So for four particles, the ground state is when each is in the lowest possible state, which is 2*(E) + 2*(4E) =10E.

The first excited state would involve promoting one particle to n=3. So the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. So energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state would be promoting another particle to n=3, making two in n=3, and zero in n=2. So energy is 2E + 2*(9E) =2E+18E=20E.

But the options don't have 20E. So perhaps the second excited state is when a particle is promoted to n=4. So the configuration would be two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.

Energy: 2E +4E +16E=22E. Still not an option.

Wait, but option D gives 18E as the second excited state.

How can the total energy be 18E? Let's see:

18E could come from:

n=1: 2 particles → 2E,

n=2: 2 particles →8E,

n=3: 0,

n=4: 0.

Wait, that's the ground state again. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the system's energy is not the sum of all the individual energies, but something else. No, that can't be right; the total energy should be the sum.

Wait, perhaps the energy levels are filled in a way that the particles are arranged with higher n's but in a different configuration.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state has one particle in n=3 and the rest in n=1 and n=2. So the energies are 2E (n=1) + 4E (n=2) +9E (n=3) =15E.

The second excited state would then have another particle promoted to n=4, but that's one particle. So the configuration would be 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3, 1 in n=4. Wait, but that's five particles. We have only four. So perhaps instead, the second excited state has two particles in n=3 and one in n=4, but that's three particles, which plus the two in n=1 would make five, which is too many. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when the highest occupied state is n=3, but with two particles there. So configuration: 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3. The energy would be 2E + 2*(9E)=20E.

But the options don't include 20E. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe the particles are arranged in a way that the ground state is not 10E but something else. Let me think again. Perhaps the ground state is when all four particles are in the lowest possible n's, but not necessarily all in the first two n's. Wait, that can't be because each n can hold two particles. So four particles would fill n=1 (2) and n=2 (2), giving 10E as the ground state.

So the first excited state is 15E, and the second excited state is when another particle is promoted to higher n. But in the options, the only possible option that includes 10E, 15E is option C and D.

Option C has ground state 4E, which doesn't fit. Option D has ground state 10E, first excited 15E, second 18E.

Wait, 18E would be 2E (n=1) + 16E (n=4) → 2E +16E=18E. But that's only if three particles are in n=1 and one in n=4. But that's not possible because each n can hold two.

Wait, perhaps the configuration for the second excited state is n=1:2, n=3:1, n=4:1. But that would require four particles. So the energy would be 2E +9E +16E=27E, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1:2, n=2:1, n=4:1. So energy is 2E +4E +16E=22E. Not an option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the possible energy levels in terms of their energies:

Ground State: 10E.

First excited state: 15E.

Second excited state: ?

Wait, let's think of the possible combinations:

For four particles:

n=1:2, n=2:2 →10E → ground state.

n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1 →15E → first excited.

n=1:2, n=3:2 →20E → second excited.

But option D has second excited as 18E. How?

Wait, 18E is 2E +16E =18E. So that would be n=1:2, n=4:2. But that would require four particles: two in n=1, two in n=4. So the energy would be 2E + 2*(16E)=34E, which isn't 18E. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the way the particles are filled. Maybe the ground state isn't 10E. Let me consider that perhaps the particles are fermions, so each must have unique quantum numbers, but perhaps the way spin is considered allows for different fillings.

Wait a moment, no. For spin-1/2, each n can have two particles: spin up and spin down. So the initial analysis holds.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the total energy as the sum of the individual energies, but maybe the way the particles are arranged allows for lower energy in some way I'm not seeing.

Wait, perhaps the ground state isn't n=1:2, n=2:2. Maybe some other configuration results in a lower energy. But I don't think so, because the lower n's have lower energy.

Wait, maybe the particles are arranged in a way where one is in n=1, another in n=2, another in n=3, and another in n=4. So each in a unique n. But that would give a higher energy: E +4E +9E +16E=30E. That's higher than 10E, so it's definitely not the ground state.

So the initial conclusion must be that the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, and second excited 20E. But the options don't include 20E.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering only the sum of the lowest possible states when the particles are excited. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the energies are being considered for each particle, and the sum is the total. But that's what I did.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about four particles in the same potential well but four particles in a single state, but that's impossible due to Pauli.

Hmm. I'm stuck here. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: ground 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E. Where does 18E come from? 18E= (2² + 3² + 4²)E? No, 4 +9 +16=29. No.

Wait, 18E could be 2E (n=1) + 2*(4E) (n=2) + 2*(something). No, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when the configuration is n=1:2, n=2:2, but that's the ground state. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way the excited states are determined. Maybe the first excited state is when the highest n is 3, but with only one particle in n=3. So energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state would then have the highest n as 4, with one particle, so energy is 2E +4E +9E +16E=31E. That's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when the particles are arranged in n=1:2, n=2:2, and n=3:0. No, that's the ground state.

I'm really not getting this. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the filling is not as I thought. Perhaps the four particles are arranged in the lowest possible n's in a different way.

Wait, n=1 can hold two particles (spin up and down), n=2 can hold two, so four in total. So that's the ground state: 10E.

The first excited state would involve one particle moving to n=3. So the configuration is n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. Energy: 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state would involve another particle moving to n=3, making n=3 have two particles. So configuration is n=1:2, n=3:2. Energy: 2E + 2*(9E)=2E+18E=20E. But 20E isn't an option.

Hmm. But option D says the second excited state is 18E. How can that be?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and the others are in higher n's. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when the particles are in n=1:2, n=2:0, n=3:2. So energy 2E + 2*(9E)=2E+18E=20E. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1:1, n=2:1, n=3:1, n=4:1. Each in a unique n. So the energy would be E +4E +9E +16E=30E. But that's the highest energy in option A, which says 30E as the ground state. That can't be right because that would be a higher energy than the ground state.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the possible energies of each particle, not the sum. No, the question says the system's energy.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option D, which has 10E, 15E, 18E. But how?

Wait, 18E could be 9E*2. So perhaps when two particles are in n=3. So energy is 2*(9E)=18E. But that would mean the configuration is n=1:0, n=2:0, n=3:2, n=4:2. But that's four particles. So the energy would be 2*(9E) + 2*(16E)= 18E +32E=50E. No, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the system's energy is considered per particle. No, the question is about the system's total energy.

I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option D is 10E, 15E, 18E.

So, ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

How can the second excited state be 18E?

Wait, 18E= 2E + 16E. So perhaps one particle in n=1 and one in n=4. But that's two particles. The other two would have to be in other n's. Wait, perhaps the configuration is n=1:2, n=4:2. So 2*(E) +2*(16E)=2E +32E=34E. No, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration is n=1:2, n=2:1, n=4:1. So energy 2E +4E +16E=22E. Still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the way the energy is calculated considers only the highest occupied state multiplied by the number of particles in that state. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy is calculated as the sum of the squares. Let me try:

Ground state: two in n=1 (2E each?), no, that's 2*(1)E=2E. Two in n=2 (each 4E), 2*(4E)=8E. Total 10E.

First excited: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. So 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Second excited: two in n=1, one in n=2, two in n=3. Then the energy would be 2E +4E + 2*(9E)=2E +4E +18E=24E. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=4: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4. So energy is 2E +4E +16E=22E. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when the particles are in n=2:2, n=3:2. No, that's four particles. So energy would be 2*(4E) + 2*(9E)=8E +18E=26E.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Let me think that perhaps the correct answer is option D, which has 10E,15E,18E. But I don't see how the second excited state is 18E. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the ground state.

Wait, perhaps the ground state is not 10E but something else. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the particles are in n=1, n=2, n=3, n=4. So each in a unique n, but that would require four different n's, each with one particle. But that's not possible because each n can hold two particles, but here each is in a different n. So the energy would be E +4E +9E +16E=30E. But that's higher than the configuration where n=1:2, n=2:2.

So the ground state must be 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 20E. But since none of the options match, perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option B: 4E,10E,50E.

Hmm, 4E would require two particles in n=1, but that's only two particles, leaving two more to be placed elsewhere. So perhaps that's not possible.

Option C:4E,10E,15E. So ground state is 4E, which would imply two particles in n=1, and two in n=0 which isn't possible. So that's probably incorrect.

Option A: 30E,39E,50E. That would imply all particles in higher n's. Not likely for ground state.

Option D:10E,15E,18E. So ground state 10E, first excited 15E, second 18E.

Wait, 18E could be the sum of n=1:2, n=3:2. So 2E + 2*(9E)= 20E. Hmm, no. Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3, and two in n=2: but that would require 2*(4E) +2*(9E)=8E +18E=26E. Not matching.

I'm really stuck here. Perhaps I should go with the initial thought that the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 20E, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option D, assuming I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4. So the configuration is n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1, n=4:0. Wait, that can't be because we have four particles. Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=4, but that would require more particles.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when the particles are in n=1:2, n=3:2, so energy is 2E + 2*(9E)=2E +18E=20E. Again, not matching.

Hmm. Maybe the second excited state has one particle in n=4, so the energy would be 2E +4E +9E +16E=31E. Not an option.

I'm really not sure. Given the options, perhaps the correct answer is option D:10E,15E,18E. I think I've spent enough time on this.


The problem involves determining the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length \( L \). The energy levels for a particle in such a well are quantized and given by \( E_n = n^2E \), where \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \). Since the particles are fermions, they obey the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. Each energy level \( n \) can hold two particles, one for each spin state (spin-up and spin-down).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Ground State**:  
   In the ground state, the particles fill the lowest available energy levels. The first two particles occupy \( n=1 \) (one spin-up and one spin-down), and the next two particles occupy \( n=2 \) (one spin-up and one spin-down). The total energy is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{ground}} = 2E + 2(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E
   \]

2. **First Excited State**:  
   In the first excited state, one particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \). The configuration becomes \( n=1 \) (2 particles), \( n=2 \) (1 particle), and \( n=3 \) (1 particle). The total energy is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E
   \]

3. **Second Excited State**:  
   In the second excited state, another particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \), leaving \( n=2 \) empty and \( n=3 \) with two particles. The configuration becomes \( n=1 \) (2 particles) and \( n=3 \) (2 particles). The total energy is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E + 2(9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E
   \]

### Matching with Options:
- **Option A**: \( 30E, 39E, 50E \)  
  These values are too high and do not match the calculated energies.  

- **Option B**: \( 4E, 10E, 50E \)  
  The ground state energy \( 4E \) is incorrect, as the ground state energy is \( 10E \).  

- **Option C**: \( 4E, 10E, 15E \)  
  The ground state energy \( 4E \) is incorrect, as the ground state energy is \( 10E \).  

- **Option D**: \( 10E, 15E, 18E \)  
  The ground state energy \( 10E \) matches. The first excited state \( 15E \) matches. The second excited state \( 18E \) does not match the calculated \( 20E \), but it is the closest option provided.

### Conclusion:
While the calculated second excited state energy is \( 20E \), none of the options explicitly include this value. Based on the given options, the best match is **Option D**, which aligns with the ground state and first excited state energies.
