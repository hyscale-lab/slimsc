Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and their flux ratios in two different energy bands. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, with the proton-proton (pp) chain being the main one. There are different branches in the pp chain, like pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III, I think. The question specifically mentions the pp-III branch stopping. Oh, right, the pp-III branch is one of the steps where a helium-3 nucleus fuses with a helium-4 nucleus to form carbon-12, which is part of the CNO cycle maybe? Wait, no, the CNO cycle is a different process altogether. Or maybe I'm mixing things up. 

Wait, the pp chain has several steps. The pp-I branch produces boron-8, and then that undergoes more reactions. The pp-II and pp-III are maybe different pathways. Oh, pp-III probably refers to a specific reaction in the chain that leads to higher energy neutrinos. Because I remember that in the Sun, the dominant neutrinos come from the decay of boron-8, which is from the pp-I branch. But there are also neutrinos from other processes, like the CNO cycle. 

If the pp-III branch stops, that means a particular part of the pp chain isn't contributing anymore. But how does this affect the neutrino flux? Neutrinos are produced in different parts of the Sun's core. Well, the pp chain produces lower-energy neutrinos, while the CNO cycle produces higher-energy ones. Because the pp chain is the main source, but the CNO contributes a smaller fraction. 

But wait, the question is about the flux ratio between two specific energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So band 1 is lower than band 2. 

If the pp-III branch suddenly stopped, what would happen to the neutrinos in each band? Well, if pp-III was a significant source of neutrinos in a particular energy range, stopping it would reduce the flux in that range. 

Wait, I think that the neutrinos from the CNO cycle are higher energy than those from the pp chain. Because the CNO cycle operates at higher temperatures and densities. So the neutrinos from CNO are more energetic. So if pp-
