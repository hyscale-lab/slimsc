Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So the question is about what happens if the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stops about 8 and a half minutes ago. And we need to find the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2).

Wait, first, I should remember what the pp-III branch is. The proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun, right? I think the pp chain has a couple of branches. The pp-I branch is the main one where two protons fuse to deuterium, then another proton fuses to make helium-3, and then two helium-3s combine into helium-4. But then there's the pp-II and pp-III branches as well.

Oh right, the pp-III branch is a less significant part of the proton-proton chain. I think it involves a different pathway. In pp-III, a helium-3 nucleus captures two protons, but one of them is actually a positron, which is emitted in the process. Or wait, maybe I'm getting that mixed up. Alternatively, I remember that the pp-III branch involves the reaction where a helium-3 fuses with a helium-4, but that's more the CNO cycle. No, wait, the CNO cycle is a different process altogether. Let me think again. Oh, right! The pp-III branch is the reaction where a helium-3 captures a proton to form a helium-4, but that's not right because that's part of the main pp-I branch. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III branch is another reaction. Oh, I think I remember now. The pp-III branch is when two helium-3 nuclei combine to form a helium-4, but that's actually the main pp-I branch. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III is a side reaction where a helium-3 captures two protons, one of which is converted into a neutron, but that doesn't make sense because protons are being converted into neutrons, which would require a higher energy.

Wait, maybe I should look this up in my mind. So the main branches are:

1. pp-I: two protons fuse to deuterium, then another proton fuses to make helium-
