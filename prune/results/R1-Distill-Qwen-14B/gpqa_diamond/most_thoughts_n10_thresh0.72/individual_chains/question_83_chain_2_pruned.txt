Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid. Hmm, I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Let's see... I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so they should neutralize each other in the titration.

First, the initial solution. They diluted 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Wait, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. To find the new concentration, I should calculate the moles of acetic acid before dilution. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So that's 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After diluting to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), the new concentration is moles / volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let's calculate that. At equivalence, moles of NaOH = moles of CH3COOH. So moles = 0.001 (from earlier). The volume of NaOH needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L or 10 cm³? Wait, but wait, the volume of the solution at equivalence is the sum of the diluted acetic acid and the NaOH added. So 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³. But I'm not sure if that matters for the pH calculation.

At equivalence, all acetic acid is converted to acetate ions (CH3COO^-). The solution will be a buffer of acetate ions in water, which will hydrolyze to form OH- ions, making the solution basic. The pH at equivalence can be found using the Kb of acetate. Since Kw = Ka * Kb, Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate at equivalence is moles / total volume. Moles of acetate are 0.001, and total volume is 50 cm³ (0.05 L), so 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Using Kb: Kb = [OH-]^2 / [CH3COO^-]. So [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. Then pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98, so pH is 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02. Wait, but the options don't have 9.02. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the equivalence point calculation. Oh, wait! When you dilute the acetic acid, you have 0.025 M as I thought. Then, when you reach equivalence, you have 0.025 M acetate in a solution. Wait, no. Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol in 0.04 L (40 mL), so 0.025 M. When titrated with 10 mL of 0.
