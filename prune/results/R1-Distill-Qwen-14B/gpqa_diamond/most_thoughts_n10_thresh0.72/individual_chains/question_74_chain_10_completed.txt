Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay probabilities. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows something called an exponential decay law. Let me think. The key thing here is that the decay of atoms is a random process, right? So each atom has a certain probability of decaying over a period of time, and this probability is independent of how much time has already passed.

The question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Wait, so that means if we have a large number of such atoms, 32% of them would decay in 100 minutes. Oh, but wait, in this case, we're looking at a single atom, and we want to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have already passed without it decaying.

I think the key point is that radioactive decay is memoryless. That means the probability of the atom decaying in the next t minutes doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So whether it's been 50 minutes or 5 seconds, the chance of it decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as it would be for a fresh atom in that time.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The decay probability given is 32% within 100 minutes. So, the decay constant λ can be calculated from that. The formula for the probability of decay within time t is P = 1 - e^(-λt). So 32% is 0.32, so 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Let me solve for λ.

Rearranging, e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking natural logs: -100λ = ln(0.68). Let me compute ln(0.68). I think ln(1)=0, ln(0.5)= about -0.693. So ln(0.68) would be approximately -0.385. Because e^(-0.385) is about 0.68. So λ is approximately 0.385 / 100 ≈ 0.00385 per minute.

Wait, but maybe I should be precise. Let me compute it more accurately. Let me see, 0.68 is 68%, so ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566.

So λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 = 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the next part is, what is the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes? Because the process is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next T minutes is 1 - e^(-λ T).

So T is 150 minutes. So the probability is 1 - e^(-150 * 0.0038566).

Let me compute 150 * λ. 150 * 0.0038566 ≈ 0.57849.

So e^(-0.57849) is approximately... Well, e^(-0.5) is about 0.6065, e^(-0.6) is around 0.5488. So 0.57849 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, I can use a calculator approach. Let me think. Let me compute 0.57849.

We can write 0.57849 = 0.5 + 0.07849.

Wait, perhaps using the Taylor series expansion for e^x around x = -0.5.

Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate it. Let me think, maybe using a calculator-like approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the natural logarithm and exponentials more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I can just remember that e^(-0.578) is around 0.561.

Wait, wait, another approach: 0.57849 is approximately 0.5785.

Let me compute e^(-0.5785).

I know that ln(0.56) is around -0.5798, because ln(0.5) is -0.6931, ln(0.56)=?

Wait, let me compute ln(0.56). Let's see, 0.56 is e^x.

We know that e^(-0.5798) is 0.56, because e^(-0.5798) is approximately 0.56.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, how? Let me imagine. If x = ln(0.56), then e^x = 0.56.

So, ln(0.56) ≈ -0.5798. So that implies that e^(-0.5798) = 0.56.

So, e^(-0.5785) would be slightly higher than 0.56 because the exponent is slightly less negative. So, 0.5785 is a bit larger than 0.5798. So e^(-0.5785) = approx 0.562.

Wait, wait a second, actually, when x increases, e^x increases. So, -0.5785 is higher (less negative) than -0.5798. So e^(-0.5785) would be higher than e^(-0.5798) which is 0.56. So, perhaps 0.562.

So 1 - e^(-0.5785) ≈ 1 - 0.562 = 0.438 or 43.8%. So about 44% probability. Looking at the options, option A is 44% and option D is 48%. Hmm, that's not matching exactly.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate λ.

I had 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100). So e^(-100λ) = 0.68. So λ = ln(1/0.68) / 100.

Wait, ln(1/0.68) is ln(1.470588) ≈ 0.38566. So λ is 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

So for 150 minutes, λ*T = 0.0038566 * 150 ≈ 0.57849.

So e^-0.57849 ≈ ?

Wait, perhaps I can use a calculator-like approach. Let me think of e^0.57849.

Wait, e^0.5 is about 1.6487. e^0.57 is about 1.768. e^0.578 is about 1.781. So e^0.57849 is approximately 1.781.

So e^-0.57849 ≈ 1 / 1.781 ≈ 0.561.

So 1 - 0.561 ≈ 0.439, or 43.9%, which is about 44%. So the answer would be option A) 44%.

Wait, but wait, the question says, so far 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. So the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Since the process is memoryless, the 50 minutes don't matter. So the probability is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes from now, which is the same as the probability for a fresh atom over 150 minutes.

Wait, but another approach: the decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%. So the decay constant λ can be found, and then find the probability for 150 minutes.

Alternatively, perhaps the decay follows the formula P = 1 - e^(-λ t), where t is the time.

But perhaps another approach is to find the half-life. Wait, but the given is 32% decay in 100 minutes, which isn't a standard half-life. The half-life is the time when 50% have decayed. So if 32% decay in 100 min, the half-life isn't directly given. But maybe using the formula to find the decay constant.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the method of conditional probability. The probability that the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes is e^(-λ *50). Then, the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes (so between 50 and 200 minutes) is the same as the probability it decays in 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed yet.

Wait, but in the case of exponential decay, the probability of decay in the next t minutes is the same regardless of how much time has already passed. So whether it's 50 minutes or any other time, the probability of decay in the next 150 is the same as for a fresh atom in 150 minutes.

So all I need to calculate is the probability of decay in 150 minutes. So the 50 minutes part doesn't affect the calculation.

So the initial approach is correct.

So for 150 minutes, P = 1 - e^(-λ * 150) ≈ 43.8%, so 44% which is option A.

Wait, but the options are A)44%, B)40%, C)52%, D)48%.

So the correct answer should be A)44%.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in approximating e^(-0.57849) as 0.561. Let me be more precise.

Let me compute e^(-0.57849). Let me calculate using Taylor series.

The expansion for e^x around x= -0.6.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 0.57849 as 0.5 + 0.07849.

Wait, e^(-0.5) = 0.6065, e^(-0.57849) is e^(-0.5 - 0.07849) = e^(-0.5) * e^(-0.07849).

e^(-0.07849) ≈ 1 - 0.07849 + (0.07849)^2/2 - ... 

0.07849^2 is about 0.00616, divided by 2 is 0.00308.

So e^(-0.07849) ≈ 1 - 0.07849 + 0.00308 ≈ 0.925 approximately.

So e^(-0.57849) ≈ 0.6065 * 0.925 ≈ 0.6065 * 0.925.

Let me compute that: 0.6 * 0.925 = 0.555. 0.0065 * 0.925 is about 0.006. So total approx 0.561. So 0.561.

So 1 - 0.561 is 0.439, which is 43.9%, so about 44%, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach. Since the probability is 32% in 100 minutes, what is the decay constant λ?

We have P = 1 - e^(-λ t), so 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ *100). So e^(-100λ) = 0.68. So λ = - (ln(0.68)) / 100.

ln(0.68) is approximately -0.385662. So λ = 0.385662 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

So for 150 minutes, the probability is 1 - e^(-150 * 0.0038566) = 1 - e^(-0.57849).

Which as above is ≈ 43.8%, which is about 44%.

So the answer is option A)44%.


The problem involves calculating the probability that a single atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. Radioactive decay follows an exponential decay law, which is memoryless. This means the probability of decay in the next \( t \) minutes depends only on \( t \), not on the elapsed time.

The decay probability within 100 minutes is given as 32%, or \( P = 0.32 \). Using the formula for radioactive decay:

\[
P = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

we can solve for the decay constant \( \lambda \). Rearranging:

\[
e^{-\lambda t} = 1 - P
\]

Substituting \( P = 0.32 \) and \( t = 100 \):

\[
e^{-100\lambda} = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
-100\lambda = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.38566 \):

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.38566}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

Now, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is calculated using the same formula:

\[
P = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda = 0.0038566 \) and \( t = 150 \):

\[
\lambda t = 0.0038566 \times 150 \approx 0.57849
\]

\[
P = 1 - e^{-0.57849}
\]

To approximate \( e^{-0.57849} \), note that \( e^{-0.5} \approx 0.6065 \) and \( e^{-0.6} \approx 0.5488 \). Since \( 0.57849 \) is between \( 0.5 \) and \( 0.6 \), \( e^{-0.57849} \) is approximately \( 0.561 \). Thus:

\[
P \approx 1 - 0.561 = 0.439 \, \text{or} \, 43.9\%.
\]

This rounds to approximately \( 44\% \). Since the process is memoryless, the 50 minutes that have already passed do not affect the calculation. Therefore, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately \( 44\% \).
