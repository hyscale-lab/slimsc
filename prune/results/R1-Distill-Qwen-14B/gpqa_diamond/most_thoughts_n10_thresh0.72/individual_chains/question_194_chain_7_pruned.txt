Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different exponential terms.

Hmm, I remember that the partition function is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor for each state. The Boltzmann factor is e^{-βE}, where β is 1/(kT). 

First, I should figure out all the possible states of the system. Since each spin can be +1 or -1, and there are three spins, the total number of states is 2^3 =8. So there are 8 possible combinations of S1, S2, S3.

Wait, but maybe I can find a smarter way to compute Z without listing all 8 states. Because each term in the energy is a product of two spins, perhaps I can find a way to express this in terms of each spin's contributions or find a symmetry.

Let me think: The energy E is -J times (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So E depends on the sum of the products of pairs. Each product S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1, depending on whether the spins are the same or opposite.

Wait, but the sum of three terms (each ±1) can vary. The possible values of the sum (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3) would be when each term is 1 or -1. So the sum can be 3, 1, -1, or -3. Hmm, let me check: 

If all pairs are 1 (all spins same), then sum is 3. 

If two pairs are 1 and one is -1: sum is 1.

If one pair is 1, two are -1: sum is -1.

If all pairs are -1: sum is -3.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think of specific cases. For example, all spins up: S1=1, S2=1, S3=1. Then S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. So E= -J*(3) = -3J.

Another case: two spins up, one down. Let's say S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1. Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1. So E= -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, wait, E is -J multiplied by the sum. So when the sum is S, E is -J * S. So E can be -3J, -J, J, 3J, depending on the sum.

Wait, let me restate that. The sum S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. So for each state, the sum S can be 3, 1, -1, -3.

Then E = -J * S, so E can be -3J, -J, J, 3J.

So for each state, the energy is either -3J, -J, J, or 3J.

Now, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of e^{-β E}.

So Z = sum_{all states} exp( β J S ), because E = -J S, so -β E = β J S.

Wait, let's make sure: E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3) = -J S. So β E = -β J S. Therefore, e^{-β E} = e^{β J S}.

So each state contributes e^{β J S}, where S can be 3, 1, -
