Okay, so I've got this problem here about stellar abundances. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But wait, maybe the masses aren't directly relevant to the calculation? Or maybe they relate to something else, like the star's evolution? Hmm, not sure yet. I'll keep that in mind.

The problem states that using the EW method (which I think stands for Equivalent Width, a method used in spectroscopy to determine elemental abundance), the elemental abundances are given. So let's list out the given data:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the solar photospheric compositions are:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7

Wait, right. The notation [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So these are logarithmic abundances relative to the Sun.

The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, they want (n_Si, Star1) / (n_Si, Star2) ?

I think so. So I need to find [Si/Star1] divided by [Si/Star2], but let's see.

Wait, actually, the ratio is n_Si1 / n_Si2, right? So that would be (n_Si in Star1) divided by (n_Si in Star2). So if I can find the abundance of Si in each star relative to H, then I can take their ratio.

Wait, but the given data don't directly give [Si/H] for each star. So I'll have to derive that.

Let's start with Star_1.

Star_1's data:
[Si/Fe]_1 =
