Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these pH calculations. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but I think I can handle it.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, the H+ and OH- ions react. So, maybe I should calculate the moles of H+ and OH- from each solution and see what's left after they neutralize each other. 

Let me start by calculating the moles of each component. For each solution, moles = concentration (M) × volume (L). 

Starting with the acetic acid: it's a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. But wait, when you mix it with HCl and Ba(OH)2, I think the HCl will donate H+ ions, and Ba(OH)2 will donate OH- ions. So I need to consider all the H+ and OH- sources.

Wait a second, I should first figure out the total H+ and OH- from each solution before mixing.

1. **Calculating moles for each solution:**
   - **CH3COOH (Acetic acid):** It's 500 mL of 0.1 M. Moles = 0.1 mol/L × 0.5 L = 0.05 mol. Acetic acid donates one H+ per molecule, so 0.05 mol H+.
   - **HCl:** 400 mL of 0.2 M. Moles = 0.2 × 0.4 = 0.08 mol. HCl is a strong acid, so it fully dissociates into H+ and Cl-.
   - **Ba(OH)2:** 300 mL of 0.3 M. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. Moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.3 × 0.3 = 0.09 mol. Thus, OH- moles = 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 mol.

Wait, but when mixing, the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2. Let me write down the reaction:

H+ + OH- → H2O

So, the total H+ from CH3COOH and HCl is 0.05 + 0.08 = 0.13 mol. The OH- is 0.18 mol.

So, the OH- is in excess. The amount of OH- left will be 0.18 - 0.13 = 0.05 mol.

Wait, no, because the H+ comes from both the strong and weak acid. So all the H+ ions will react with OH- as much as possible. So:

Total H+ = 0.05 (from CH3COOH) + 0.08 (from HCl) = 0.13 mol.
Total OH- = 0.18 mol.
So, OH- is in excess by 0.18 - 0.13 = 0.05 mol.

But wait, wait. Wait a second. Acetic acid is a weak acid. So in the solution, does it contribute all its H+? No, because it doesn't fully dissociate. So when I mix everything, the presence of strong acid (HCl) might affect the dissociation.

Hmm, this complicates things. Because HCl is a strong acid, it will fully dissociate, so the H+ from HCl is 0.0

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about determining the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.

The problem says: We have 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). I need to find the pH of the resulting solution. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Alright, first, I remember that when mixing acids and bases, the strong acid and strong base will neutralize each other, and if there's any excess, it will affect the pH. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely. But HCl is a strong acid, so it will. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base because it's a group 2 hydroxide, I think, so it'll dissociate completely too.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 can dissociate into two OH- ions per formula unit, right? Because Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2OH^-.

So, the plan is probably: calculate the moles of each acid and base, see which one is in excess, determine the excess moles, then find the concentration, and then calculate pH or pOH accordingly.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate moles of each component.
2. Determine the reaction between strong acid and strong base first.
3. Then consider the weak acid (acetic) along with any excess acid or base.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So, they'll react completely. The reaction between HCl and Ba(OH)2 would be:

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

Wait, actually, the neutralization reaction. Since Ba(OH)2 has two OH- ions, each HCl provides one H+. So, the reaction would be 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

So the mole ratio is 2:1.

So, let's calculate the moles of HCl and Ba(OH)2.

Moles = concentration (M) × volume (L).

HCl: 0.2 M × 0.4 L = 0.08 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles.

But wait, each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-, so the equivalent for base is 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 equivalents (since each OH- is one equivalent for neutralization with H+).

Each mole of HCl gives 1 equivalent of H+.

So, the H+ from HCl is 0.08 equivalents. The OH- is 0.18 equivalents.

So when H+ and OH- react, they neutralize each other: H
