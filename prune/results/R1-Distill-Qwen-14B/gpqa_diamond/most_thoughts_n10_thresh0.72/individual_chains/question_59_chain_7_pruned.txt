Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about determining the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.

The problem says: We have 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). I need to find the pH of the resulting solution. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Alright, first, I remember that when mixing acids and bases, the strong acid and strong base will neutralize each other, and if there's any excess, it will affect the pH. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely. But HCl is a strong acid, so it will. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base because it's a group 2 hydroxide, I think, so it'll dissociate completely too.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 can dissociate into two OH- ions per formula unit, right? Because Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2OH^-.

So, the plan is probably: calculate the moles of each acid and base, see which one is in excess, determine the excess moles, then find the concentration, and then calculate pH or pOH accordingly.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate moles of each component.
2. Determine the reaction between strong acid and strong base first.
3. Then consider the weak acid (acetic) along with any excess acid or base.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So, they'll react completely. The reaction between HCl and Ba(OH)2 would be:

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

Wait, actually, the neutralization reaction. Since Ba(OH)2 has two OH- ions, each HCl provides one H+. So, the reaction would be 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

So the mole ratio is 2:1.

So, let's calculate the moles of HCl and Ba(OH)2.

Moles = concentration (M) × volume (L).

HCl: 0.2 M × 0.4 L = 0.08 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles.

But wait, each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-, so the equivalent for base is 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 equivalents (since each OH- is one equivalent for neutralization with H+).

Each mole of HCl gives 1 equivalent of H+.

So, the H+ from HCl is 0.08 equivalents. The OH- is 0.18 equivalents.

So when H+ and OH- react, they neutralize each other: H
