Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these pH calculations. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but I think I can handle it.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, the H+ and OH- ions react. So, maybe I should calculate the moles of H+ and OH- from each solution and see what's left after they neutralize each other. 

Let me start by calculating the moles of each component. For each solution, moles = concentration (M) × volume (L). 

Starting with the acetic acid: it's a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. But wait, when you mix it with HCl and Ba(OH)2, I think the HCl will donate H+ ions, and Ba(OH)2 will donate OH- ions. So I need to consider all the H+ and OH- sources.

Wait a second, I should first figure out the total H+ and OH- from each solution before mixing.

1. **Calculating moles for each solution:**
   - **CH3COOH (Acetic acid):** It's 500 mL of 0.1 M. Moles = 0.1 mol/L × 0.5 L = 0.05 mol. Acetic acid donates one H+ per molecule, so 0.05 mol H+.
   - **HCl:** 400 mL of 0.2 M. Moles = 0.2 × 0.4 = 0.08 mol. HCl is a strong acid, so it fully dissociates into H+ and Cl-.
   - **Ba(OH)2:** 300 mL of 0.3 M. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. Moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.3 × 0.3 = 0.09 mol. Thus, OH- moles = 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 mol.

Wait, but when mixing, the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2. Let me write down the reaction:

H+ + OH- → H2O

So, the total H+ from CH3COOH and HCl is 0.05 + 0.08 = 0.13 mol. The OH- is 0.18 mol.

So, the OH- is in excess. The amount of OH- left will be 0.18 - 0.13 = 0.05 mol.

Wait, no, because the H+ comes from both the strong and weak acid. So all the H+ ions will react with OH- as much as possible. So:

Total H+ = 0.05 (from CH3COOH) + 0.08 (from HCl) = 0.13 mol.
Total OH- = 0.18 mol.
So, OH- is in excess by 0.18 - 0.13 = 0.05 mol.

But wait, wait. Wait a second. Acetic acid is a weak acid. So in the solution, does it contribute all its H+? No, because it doesn't fully dissociate. So when I mix everything, the presence of strong acid (HCl) might affect the dissociation.

Hmm, this complicates things. Because HCl is a strong acid, it will fully dissociate, so the H+ from HCl is 0.0
