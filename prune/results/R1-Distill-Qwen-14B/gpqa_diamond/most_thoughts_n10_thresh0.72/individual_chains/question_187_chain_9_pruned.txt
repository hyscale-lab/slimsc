Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It says that a star is detectable if it achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So, I need to determine for each star option whether the S/N meets this threshold when observed with ESPRESSO coupled to an 8m VLT telescope.

Wait, what do I know about ESPRESSO? I remember reading that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used for exoplanet studies and other precise measurements. It's installed on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile. It's known for its high spectral resolving power, which I think is around 140,000 or so. High resolution usually means it can pick up fainter signals because it's more sensitive, but perhaps it trades off some collecting area because the fibers might be smaller? Or maybe not, since it's using the full 8m telescope?

I should think about the factors that affect the signal-to-noise ratio. The S/N depends on the brightness of the star (apparent magnitude, I think), the exposure time, the telescope's collecting area, and the spectrograph's efficiency and resolution. Also, distance plays a role because a star's apparent brightness decreases with distance.

The formula for S/N ratio is something like S/N = (flux) * sqrt(exposure time) / (noise), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. I think for a given star, the flux it provides depends on its apparent brightness. So the apparent magnitude of the star is crucial here.

Wait, the question gives absolute magnitudes for some stars. Absolute magnitude (M) is how bright a star would appear at 10 parsecs away. So to find the apparent magnitude (m), I can use the distance modulus formula: m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d), where d is the distance in parsecs.

So for each option, I'll calculate the apparent magnitude, then determine if the S/N is at least 10 per binned pixel.

But wait, how does apparent magnitude relate to S/N? I think the S/N for a star in an exposure depends on the photon flux received. The number of photons a telescope collects depends on the star's brightness (apparent magnitude) and the exposure time.

ESPRESSO's sensitivity: From what I remember, ESPRESSO is designed to achieve high S/N ratios on a wide range of stars. But specifics might vary. I think the VLT's 8m mirror gives it a large collecting area, which helps in gathering more photons, improving S/N.

So, the steps I need to take for each star:

1. Determine the star's absolute magnitude (given for some) and distance.
2. Calculate the apparent magnitude using the distance modulus.
3. Find out if the apparent magnitude is bright enough so that, with a 1-hour exposure, the S/N per binned pixel is at least 10.

But I'm not exactly sure how to compute this. Maybe I can find the formula that relates apparent magnitude to S/N.

I think the formula for S/N in spectroscopy is:

S/N = (sqrt(N_photons)) 

where N_photons is the number of photons detected. But N_photons depends on the flux from the star, the exposure time, the telescope area, and the instrument's efficiency.

Alternatively, another approach: I recall that for astronomical imaging, the S/N per pixel can be approximated by:

S/N = 5.48 * 10^5 * (T^(1/2)) * (A / 10^4) * (efficiency) * 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)) )

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's better to look for a reference or a standard relation. Alternatively, perhaps the ESPRESSO spectrograph's S/N depends on the star's apparent magnitude in the V band.

Wait, I found a resource stating that for ESPRESSO, the S/N per pixel (after binning) can be approximated as:

S/N = 5.0 * 10^(-0.4*(m - 10)) ) * sqrt(t)

Where t is the exposure time in seconds, and m is the apparent magnitude in the V band.

Wait, no, that's probably not correct. Another way: the formula for photon flux is F = 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)) * F0, where m0 is a reference magnitude (like m=0 would give F0). But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, I've read that for a given star, the S/N ratio scales with the square root of the exposure time and the photon flux. Photon flux is proportional to 10^(-0.4*m), because lower magnitudes are brighter.

So, S/N is proportional to sqrt(t) * 10^(-0.4*m/2). Because S/N scales as sqrt(N_photons) = sqrt(flux * t).

Wait, more accurately, the number of photons (N) is proportional to flux * t. The flux is proportional to 10^(-0.4*m), so N ~ 10^(-0.4*m) * t. Then, the noise is sqrt(N), so S/N = (N)^0.5 / (noise per pixel). Hmm, perhaps.

Wait, let me think in terms of photon counts. The number of photons is given by:

N_photons = F * A * ε * t

Where F is the flux from the star (photons/cm²
