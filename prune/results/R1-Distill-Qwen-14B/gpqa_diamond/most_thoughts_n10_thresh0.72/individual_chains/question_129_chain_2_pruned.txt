Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a reaction scheme involving several compounds. The goal is to identify compound E based on a series of reactions and some hints. Let me break it down.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are two hints provided. 

Hint a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

Hint b) The IR spectrum of compound A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, while compound E has a peak at around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are four different cyclic ketones. I need to figure out which one is E.

Let me start by analyzing each step and the hints.

Starting with the IR data. A strong peak around 1750 cm^-1 typically indicates a carbonyl group (C=O). So compound A probably has a ketone group. The product E has a peak at 1715 cm^-1, which is a bit lower, so maybe E's carbonyl is in a different environment, perhaps more substituted or in a ring.

Now, looking at the reactions.

Step 1: A + HCN â†’ B. HCN usually adds to carbonyl groups. So if A is a ketone, B would be a cyanohydrin. So, the reaction is a ketone reacting with HCN to form a cyanohydrin. The cyanohydrin would have an -OH and a -CN group attached to the same carbon where the ketone was.

Step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. H2 and Pd is a hydrogenation catalyst. Since B is a cyanohydrin (which has an alcohol group and a nitrile group), hydrogenation under such conditions would likely reduce the nitrile group (-CN) to an amine (-CH2NH2?), but wait, no, wait. Wait, hydrogenation of nitriles with H2 and Pd. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile is reduced to an amine. Alternatively, perhaps the reduction is of the alcohol. Wait, but Pd is a catalyst for hydrogenation, so perhaps it's a catalytic hydrogenation. Let me think: in the presence of a catalyst, H2 can add to triple bonds, double bonds, or nitriles. So, but B is a cyanohydrin. So B has an -OH group and a -CN group on adjacent carbons. So when B is hydrogenated, the nitrile group (-CN) would be reduced. Nitrile reduction under H2 and Pd would typically convert it into an amine. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile is hydrogenated to a primary amine (-CH2NH2), but that might not make sense in this context. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond in the cyanohydrin is hydrogenated. Wait, but a cyanohydrin has a structure like R-C(OH)-CN. So the carbon adjacent to the OH has a CN. So, perhaps the hydrogenation would add H2 across a double bond if there's one, but the cyanohydrin doesn't have double bonds. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation reduces the nitrile group to an amine. Let me think.

Wait, another thought: H2 and Pd could be used for hydrogenolysis of certain groups. Wait, but the cyanohydrin has an alcohol and a nitrile. So if we reduce the nitrile, maybe it becomes a primary amine. So B is R-C(OH)-CN. After reduction, C would be R-C(OH)-CH2NH2? Or perhaps the nitrile is hydrogenated to a methylene group. Wait, another possibility: the nitrile group is hydrogenated to a methyl amine, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is hydrogenated to an amine, but maybe in this case, the hydrogenation reduces the nitrile to an amine, which upon further work-up, perhaps forms a -CH2NH2 group. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile is hydrogenated to a primary amine, so converting -CN to -CH2NH2. Wait, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, sometimes, nitriles are reduced with H2 and a catalyst like Raney Ni to amines, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reduction
