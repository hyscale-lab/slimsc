Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's see what the question is about.

The problem describes several reactions and then asks about the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, Dâˆžh, and C2v. I remember from my studies that symmetry groups are classified based on the types and numbers of symmetry operations they possess, like identity, reflections, rotations, etc.

Alright, let's break down the reactions given.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Okay, 8 equivalents is a multiple, which might hint at a stoichiometric ratio. Maybe A is something that combines with B in an 1:8 ratio. Common red products... could be something like copper(II) sulfate, but wait, no, that's blue. Oh wait, maybe it's like a metal sulfide or oxide? Or perhaps a transition metal complex.

Second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. Hmm. Gas D reacting with C in 1:2 ratio. Maybe D is a halogen? Like chlorine (Cl2) or something else. If E is hazardous, perhaps it's a toxic gas or a highly reactive compound. Let me think about possible reactions.

Third reaction: When C reacts with water, it reforms A and produces two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Strong acids include HCl, H2SO4, HNO3. Weak ones are like H2S, H3PO4, etc. So C plus water gives back A, and two acids. Maybe C is a salt that undergoes hydrolysis. For example, if A is a metal, and C is its sulfate or nitrate, which on hydrolysis gives back the metal oxide (or hydroxide) and strong/weak acids.

Fourth reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So D and B combine 1:1 to make H, a solvent. Common solvents are water, ethanol, maybe something like HCl in a solution? Wait, but D is a gas. So D and B are both gases. One possible pair is D as HCl and B as NaOH, but both are solids. Alternatively, D could be something like SO3, reacting with water (but B is a gas, so maybe that's not it). Wait, D is a gas reacting with B (another gas) 1:1 to form a solvent. Hmm, maybe D is NH3 and B is HCl? Because NH3 and HCl gas (though HCl is a gas at higher concentrations) would react to form NH4Cl, which is a solid. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the product H is a solvent. Alternatively, maybe H is something like ethanol, but how? Wait, maybe D is Cl2 and B is something else. Or perhaps D is H2O vapor and B is something else.

Wait, let's try to think of B and D as gases. Suppose B is Cl2 (chlorine gas), but then D would have to be something that reacts with Cl2 in 1:1 ratio. Alternatively, B is NH3 and D is HCl, but they are both gases. Wait, but when NH3 and HCl gas react, they form NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is CO2 and D is H2O? Because CO2 (gas) and H2O (gas?) can form H2CO3, but that's not a very stable solvent. Wait, but H is a solvent, so H could be something like ethanol, but how would B and D gases react to form that? Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps B is H2O (but it's a liquid, not a gas?), or perhaps it's another gas like O2.

Wait, let's think about H. H is a
