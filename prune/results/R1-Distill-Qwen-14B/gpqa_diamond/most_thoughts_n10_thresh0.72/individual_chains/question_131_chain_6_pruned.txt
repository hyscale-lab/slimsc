Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about dicarboxylic acids and their dehydration products. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, the question says that a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene was dehydrated to form an anhydride. I remember that when a dicarboxylic acid undergoes dehydration, it typically forms an anhydride by losing a water molecule. The structure of the starting material must influence the structure of the anhydride.

The anhydride's NMR data is given. The 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. Wait, 7 ppm is usually in the aromatic region. But wait, does this anhydride have any aromatic protons? Or maybe it's an alpha proton? Hmm, I'm not so sure. Alternatively, maybe the 7 ppm peak isn't aromatic. Wait, another thought: perhaps the 7 ppm is due to an olefinic proton, but wait, olefins are usually around 5-6 ppm. Wait, maybe it's a conjugated enone or something else. Alternatively, maybe the 7 ppm is a ketone group, but no, ketones don't have protons. Oh wait, maybe it's an aromatic ring. But if the anhydride is formed from a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene, perhaps it's a cyclic anhydride like maleic anhydride. Wait, male
