Okay, so I have this physics problem about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll have to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, the problem says there's an atomic nucleus with mass M at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. We're told to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment and the value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Hmm, okay. So, I need to compare the relativistic kinetic energy with the classical (non-relativistic) kinetic energy for the more massive fragment. The options are in MeV, which is a much smaller unit than GeV, so maybe there's some mass-energy conversion happening here.

Let me jot down the given data:

- Initial rest mass energy: 300 GeV → So, Mc² = 300 GeV. That means M = 300 GeV / c². But since we're dealing with energies and masses, I might not need to worry about c² because when we're dealing with mass and energy, the units often work out in terms of GeV and GeV/c².

Wait, but for kinetic energy, I think relativistic effects become important. Because when masses are involved in high-energy processes, classical mechanics (like Newtonian) might not be accurate enough.

So, the nucleus splits into two fragments. Let's call the mass of the lighter fragment m, so the heavier one is 2m. The sum of their masses is 99% of M: m + 2m = 0.99 M → 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.99M/3 → m = 0.33 M. So the masses are 0.33 M and 0.66 M. Wait, because 0.33 *3 is 0.99 M.

Wait, but the initial mass is M, but the sum after fission is 0.99 M. So the rest mass energy after is 0.99 Mc², which is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. The initial rest mass energy was 300 GeV, so the mass difference is 3 GeV. So that's the energy released, I suppose. But I'm not sure yet.

But wait, the problem is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. So I need to find the correct T1 and compare it with the classical approximation.

In fission, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum before is zero. Therefore, after fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. So their momenta must satisfy p1 = -p2.

But since one is more massive than the other, their velocities will be different. The more massive one (2m) will have a lower speed, I think.

Wait, but in the relativistic case, kinetic
