Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but let's break it down step by step.

So the problem describes a few reactions and mixtures. Let me see what each part means.

First, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. Wait, decolorizing bromine water usually means the mixture has unsaturated bonds, like alkenes or alkynes, which can react with Br2. So the two liquids in X probably have double bonds. Also, the question says there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X's compounds. So each compound has isolated double bonds, maybe.

Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction. The result is mixture Y, which is also equimolar but has two different liquids that don't decolorize bromine water. So Y's components must not have any double bonds left, or maybe they're saturated. But wait, Y is formed by a disproportionation reaction. Disproportionation is when an element in a compound is both oxidized and reduced. So, looking for a scenario where this happens.

Hydrogenation of both X and Y with platinum under severe conditions gives only one substance, Z, which is a hydrocarbon. Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%. Let me calculate that. The mass percentage of H is (mass of H)/(molar mass) *100. Suppose Z's formula is CnH2m or something. Let's see: 14.28% is roughly 1/7, since 100/7 ≈14.28. So if the molar mass is M, then (2m)/(12n + m*1) )= 14.28/100.

Wait, let me think again. Let's say Z is a hydrocarbon with formula CxHy. The mass fraction of H is (Hy/(12x + y)) * 100 =14.28%. So,

(Hy) / (12x + y) ) = 0.1428 → approximately 1/7.

So Hy = (12x + y)/7.

But since H and C are involved, let's try some small numbers. Let me see: For ethane, C2H6. H is 6/(24 +6)=6/30= 0.2 → 20%, too high. For methane, it's 4/16=25%. Hmm, too high. For propane, C3H8: 8/(36 +8)=8/44≈18.18%. Close, but not 14.28. Wait, 14.28 is exactly 1/7. So,  (Hy) / (12x + y) = 1/7.

Let me solve for x and y. Let's rearrange:

7 * Hy = 12x + y.

But Hy is the number of H atoms per molecule, so must be an integer. Let's try small x.

x=1: 7y =12 + y → 6y=12 → y=2. So C1H2? That's not possible for a hydrocarbon; it's CH2, which is highly unstable. So x=1 is unlikely.

x=2: 7y=24 + y →6y=24 → y=4. So C2H4. Let's see: 4/(24 +4) =4/28=1/7 →14.28%. Yes! That fits. So Z is C2H4? Wait, but wait, C2H4 is ethylene, which is unsaturated. But Z is the product of hydrogenation of X and Y, meaning Z is more saturated. Wait, no, hydrogenation usually adds H2 across double bonds. So if X has double bonds, hydrogenation would make them single.

Wait, if Z is C2H6, then the H% is 6/30=20, which is higher than 14.28. So that can't be. Hmm, maybe another approach.

Wait another thought: Maybe Z is a benzene derivative? No, because benzene is C6H6, which has 6/78 ≈7.69%. No, that's lower. Wait, so what's another way?

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine.

Hydrogenation of both X and Y gives Z. So when X is hydrogenated, since X has double bonds, it would add H2. For example, if X is ethylene (C2H4), hydrogenation would make ethane (C2H6). But then the H% would be 6/(24+6)=6/30=20%. Which is higher than 14.28%.

Alternatively, if X is something else. What about if the two liquids in X are something like 1,3-p
