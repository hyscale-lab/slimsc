Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So that's like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR shows ester groups, which makes sense because esters have specific absorption bands, especially around the carbonyl region. So the compound likely has an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: six signals. Two aromatic Hs, two vinyl Hs, and two -CH3 groups. No signals for -CH2. Hmm, so let me break that down.

A di-substituted benzene means the substituents are in positions that cause the aromatic protons to split into certain signals. For example, if the substituents are para to each other, the aromatic protons would be a singlet. But if they're ortho, the splitting might be more complex. Wait, but the NMR shows two signals for aromatic H. So perhaps the substituents are in positions that create two sets of aromatic protons. Maybe one substituent is ortho and another is para, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, if the substituents are meta, but that might produce a different splitting. Alternatively, maybe each substituent is a group that deactivates the ring, and they're in positions that lead to two sets of equivalent Hs.

Wait, but the substituents themselves might have other protons. Since there's an ester group, which is O-CO-O... no, wait, esters are usually R-O-CO-R'. So the ester group would have carbonyl and ether-like oxygen. The structure could be something like an aryl ester, but more likely, maybe it's an aromatic ring with two ester substituents? Or perhaps one ester and another group.

Wait, no, the substituents are two, and the IR shows an ester. So one substituent is an ester, or both are ester groups? Probably just one, since IR would detect the presence, but maybe the other substituent is something else. Hmm.

But looking at the NMR, besides the aromatic Hs, there's signals for vinyl Hs.
