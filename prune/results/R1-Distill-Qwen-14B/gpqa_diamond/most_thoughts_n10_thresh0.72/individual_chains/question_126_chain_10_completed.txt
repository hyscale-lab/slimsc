Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to tackle. Hmm, let me read through it carefully.

Alright, the question involves two reactions that an organic chemist performed. I need to figure out what the products are, how many peaks they would show in different chromatography columns, and then choose the correct option from the given choices.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually used to reduce ketones and aldehydes. Hexan-3-one has a ketone group at position 3. So when reduced, that ketone would become a secondary alcohol. The structure is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, when we reduce the ketone, the 3-ketone becomes a 3-hydroxyl group. But wait, the molecule is (S) configuration. So the product after reduction would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, but LAH is a strong enough reducing agent to also reduce ethers? No, LAH typically doesn't reduce ethers. Ethers are generally unreactive towards LAH. So, the methoxy group at position 5 remains as is. So, Reaction I's product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Now, Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup. Pentane-2,4-dione has two ketone groups on adjacent carbons. So, structure is (CH3)C(O)CH2C(O)CH3? Wait, no. Wait, pentane is five carbons. So, positions 2 and 4 are the ketone groups. So, the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, wait. No, pentane-2,4-dione is CH3-CO-CH2-CO-CH3. So, two ketone groups on carbons 2 and 4.

When you treat that with NaBH4. NaBH4 usually can reduce ketones, but in the case of two ketones, like in a diketone, what happens? Each ketone can be reduced. But wait, in some cases, like if the diketone is symmetrical, the reductions might be the same. Here, pentane-2,4-dione is symmetrical because the structure is symmetric around the center. So, each ketone is in a symmetric position. So, when reduced, each ketone becomes a secondary alcohol. So the product would be (CH3)CH(OH)CH2CH(OH)CH3. Wait, but wait, would both ketones be reduced? Or does NaBH4 sometimes not reduce all of them?

Wait, the question says excess NaBH4. So probably both ketones are fully reduced. So, the product is 2,4-pentanediol, but wait, it's a vicinal diol? No, wait, pentane-2,4-dione has two ketone groups on carbons 2 and 4. So when each is reduced, we get hydroxyl groups on 2 and 4. So the product is 2,4-pentanediol. So the structure would be HOCH2-COH-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again.

The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, which is CH3-CO-CH2-CO-CH3. So, it's a five-carbon chain where carbons 2 and 4 have ketone groups. So, structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

When each ketone is reduced, the carbonyl groups become CHOH groups. So, the product would be CH3-CHOH-CH2-CHOH-CH3. So, that's 2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but 2,4-pentanediol has two hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons? No, positions 2 and 4 are two apart. So, the structure is:

CH3-CHOH-CH2-CHOH-CH3. So, each hydroxyl is on C2 and C4.

Wait, but wait. When you reduce a diketone, especially with two ketones, you have to see if the diol would be meso or have some stereochemistry. Since the starting material is symmetrical, the product could be meso compound, meaning that the two OH groups are on opposite sides, leading to an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, but let's think about the product. The two OH groups are on C2 and C4. Each of those is a secondary alcohol. So for each OH, the configuration could be R or S. But since the starting material was symmetrical, the reduction would lead to a meso compound. Because if you have two OHs on adjacent carbons, but in a symmetrical arrangement, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral overall.

Wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH3-CHOH-CH2-CHOH-CH3. So, the two CHOH groups are on C2 and C4. Let me draw this. Let me imagine the structure as:

CH3 - C(OH)H - CH2 - C(OH)H - CH3.

The molecule is symmetrical, so if the OH groups are on opposite sides, it's a meso compound. So, the product would be meso-2,4-pentanediol, which is an achiral molecule because of the plane of symmetry.

So Reaction II produces a single product, which is meso-2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but wait. When you reduce a symmetrical diketone with a strong reducing agent, does it form a single enantiomer, or a meso compound? Let me think: The starting material is symmetrical, so each ketone is identical. When you reduce each ketone, the stereochemistry of each OH could be the same or opposite. But in the case of a symmetrical starting material, the reduction would lead to a product that's either meso or a racemic mixture. But since the starting material is a single compound, the product would be a single compound. Wait, but if both ketones are reduced independently, would each OH group have R or S configuration?

Wait, maybe I should model this. The starting material is symmetrical, so when you reduce each ketone, the OH groups could end up as R and R, S and S, R and S. But given the symmetry, perhaps the product is a meso compound.

Wait, let's think about the molecule. The two OH groups are on C2 and C4. The molecule is symmetrical across the C3-C4 bond. So, if the OH on C2 is R, the OH on C4 would have to be S to be a meso compound. Alternatively, perhaps if both are R and S, but the molecule is symmetrical, thus making the overall molecule achiral.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about the product. If the product is meso, then it's a single compound, hence only one peak in chiral HPLC. But wait, in any case, let me see if the product is chiral.

Wait, 2,4-pentanediol: If the two OHs are on C2 and C4, and the molecule is symmetrical, then the molecule has a plane of symmetry, so it's a meso compound. So the product is achiral. So, no peaks in a chiral column because it's a single compound, but in normal-phase HPLC, it would be a single peak.

Wait, but that's if the product is a single compound. So Reaction II gives a single product, meso-2,4-pentanediol.

Now, bringing it back to the question. After both reactions are completed, the products are combined. So, the products are:

From Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

From Reaction II: meso-2,4-pentanediol.

So, when these two are combined, we have two different compounds: one is a chiral molecule, and one is an achiral molecule.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the reactions.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH. LAH is a strong reducing agent. It reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Which is a chiral molecule because the OH is at C3, and the configuration is S. So it's one stereoisomer.

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione, which is a symmetrical diketone, treated with excess NaBH4. The product is meso-2,4-pentanediol, which is an achiral molecule.

So the combined products are (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (a single chiral compound) and meso-2,4-pentanediol (a single achiral compound). So, in total, two different compounds.

Wait, but wait. Let me confirm that. Are there any other products?

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Yes, that's the only product.

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione → meso-2,4-pentanediol. That's the only product.

So, when they are combined, we have two products: a chiral molecule and an achiral molecule.

Now, the question is about running these products on HPLC columns. The products are:

1. (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: chiral.
2. meso-2,4-pentanediol: achiral.

Now, the chromatography part. The two chromatography columns are:

a) Normal-phase HPLC: which separates based on polarity. The stationary phase is polar (like silica), and the mobile phase is non-polar. So, more polar compounds elute later (higher retention times), but how many peaks would each product produce?

b) Chiral HPLC: which separates enantiomers. The stationary phase is chiral, so it can distinguish between enantiomers. But if a compound is achiral, it won't split into peaks; it'll just have one peak.

So, for each product:

For normal-phase HPLC:

The two products are different in structure, so each would produce a separate peak. So 2 peaks.

Wait, but wait. Are those two products structurally different? Yes. Because one is a hexanol with a methoxy group, and the other is a pentanediol. So, yes, two different compounds. So in normal-phase, two peaks.

For chiral HPLC:

The first product is a chiral alcohol. So, in a chiral column, would it show one peak or two? Wait, no, because if the molecule has a chiral center, but the column is chiral, it would have a certain retention time, but since the molecule is a single enantiomer, it would produce a single peak. The second product is achiral, so it would also produce a single peak. So, in chiral column, two peaks—each product being a single compound. So, two peaks in total.

But wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, the first product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. It's a single enantiomer. In a chiral HPLC column, it would have a certain retention time, but since it's only one enantiomer, it's a single peak. The second product is meso, which is achiral, so it would also produce a single peak. So, in the chiral column, two peaks.

Wait, but the options don't have two peaks in both. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) 5 and 4

B)3 and 2

C)4 and 2

D)3 and3.

Wait, none of these options show 2 and 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, maybe I should re-examine the products more closely.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I's product has more than one stereocenter? Let me check.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is reduced to (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2(OCH3)CH(OH)CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, the structure is more like:

CH2-CH2-OCH3 at position 5, but wait, the structure is hexan-3-one. So, the carbon chain is six carbons, with the ketone at C3. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2-OCH3? No, wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3.

Wait, perhaps I should write the structure as:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3.

Wait, no, wait, the 5-methoxy group is on the sixth carbon? Or I'm getting confused. Let me number the chain.

Hexan-3-one is:

1   2   3   4   5   6

CH3-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but in the starting material, it's (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, position 5 has a methoxy group. So, the structure is:

CH3-CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3.

Wait, but that would be five carbons. Oh wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one is six carbons.

So, positions 1 to 6: 1 is CH3, 2 is CH2, 3 is C=O, 4 is CH2, 5 is CH2-OCH3, and 6 is CH3? No, wait, let me correct.

Wait, hexan-3-one is:

CH3-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3.

So, the carbonyl is at position 3. The 5-methoxy would be on the 5th carbon. So, substituting the 5th carbon's hydrogen with OCH3.

So, structure would be:

CH3-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

Wait, so the molecule is (S)-configured at carbon 5? Or wait, the starting material is (S) at the 3-ketone? No, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the carbonyl is at C3, and the methoxy is at C5.

Wait, when you reduce the ketone at C3, the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. So, the configuration at C3 is S.

Wait, but the 5-methoxy is on C5, which is CH(OCH3). So, in the product, it's 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2(OH)CH(OCH3)CH2CH2CH3? No, let me write it clearly.

The structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol is:

CH2CH2(OH) at C3, and OCH3 at C5.

Wait, the molecule would have two stereocenters? Wait, no. Let's see:

The molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

At C3: the OH is attached. The configuration is S. So, C3 is a stereocenter.

At C5: OCH3 is attached. But wait, in the starting material, the 5-methoxy is on a CH2 group?

Wait, no. Let me think again.

The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.

So, the carbonyl is at C3. The structure is:

CH3-CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3?

Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one is a six-carbon chain with ketone at position 3.

So, positions:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C(O)-

4: CH2-

5: CH2-OCH3

6: CH3.

Wait, no, that can't be because in a six-carbon chain, position 5 would be adjacent to position 4. Hmm, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(CH2)4-OCH3, but with the ketone at position 3.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it as:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C(O)-

4: CH2-

5: CH(OCH3)-

6: CH3.

Wait, that makes sense.

So, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which has a ketone at C3 and a methoxy group at C5.

After reduction, the ketone at C3 becomes an alcohol, so the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

So, the structure is:

CH3-CH2-C(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

Now, the molecule has two stereocenters: C3 and C5.

Wait, because the OH is on C3 and the OCH3 is on C5.

Wait, wait, no. The OCH3 is on C5, but is that a stereocenter?

Wait, when the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, the configuration at C3 is S. After reduction, the OH is on C3, so it's a stereocenter. But the OCH3 is on C5, which is a CH group. Wait, no.

Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the structure is:

CH3-CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the starting material is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one, so the structure is:

Position 1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C(O)-

4: CH2-

5: OCH3 attached to a CH2 group?

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-OCH3.

Wait, but that would be 6 carbons: 1 (CH3), 2 (CH2), 3 (C=O), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH2-OCH3), 6 (CH3? No, wait, that's seven carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, hexan-3-one is:

CH3-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

So, six carbons. Position 3 is the ketone. Then, 5-methoxy would be on carbon 5, which is CH2 in the original structure.

So, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which would have a structure like:

CH3-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

Wait, but that would be seven carbons, no. Wait, no. Hexan-3-one: six carbons, so positions 1 to 6.

So, the structure is:

1: CH3,

2: CH2,

3: C(O),

4: CH2,

5: CH2-OCH3? No, that would make position 5 a CH2-OCH3.

Wait, but the starting material is hexan-3-one, so the carbonyl is at position 3, and the methoxy is at position 5. So, the structure is:

CH3-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-OCH3.

Wait, but that's six carbons? No, because position 5 is CH2-OCH3, which is two carbons: one in the chain, and one in the OCH3.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

(CH3)CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-OCH3.

Wait, but that would be seven carbons, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be.

Let me think about the product after reduction. The product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. So, the structure has an OH at position 3 and a methoxy at position 5. So, the molecule has two stereogenic centers: at C3 (OH) and at C5 (OCH3).

Wait, but wait. In the starting material, the configuration was S at C3, but after reduction, the configuration at C3 becomes S in the product. The OCH3 is on C5, which was a CH2 group in the starting material. After reduction, the structure at C5 is CH2-OCH3, which is not a stereocenter because it's attached to two identical groups (two CH2 groups). So, no, C5 isn't a stereocenter.

Wait, no. Let me think again. C5 in the starting material is CH2-OCH3, which is a secondary carbon in the original structure (hexan-3-one). After reduction, the structure at C5 is still CH2-OCH3, so it's a CH2 group attached to OCH3. So, in the product, that carbon (C5) is a CH2 group, so it doesn't have four different substituents. Therefore, it's not a stereocenter. Only C3 is a stereocenter in the product.

So, the product is a single stereoisomer: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, with only one chiral center at C3.

So, when this is run on a chiral HPLC column, it would appear as a single peak because it's a single enantiomer.

On the other hand, the product from Reaction II, meso-2,4-pentanediol, is an achiral molecule. So, in a chiral HPLC, it would also appear as a single peak because there are no enantiomers to separate.

Wait, but wait. If both products are chiral, but no, the second product is achiral. So, in the chiral column, each product would have one peak.

So, when both products are run on the chiral column, how many peaks?

(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol is a single enantiomer, so it would give one peak.

Meso-2,4-pentanediol is achiral, so it would give one peak.

So, total of two peaks in the chiral HPLC.

In the normal-phase HPLC, each product is a different compound, so they would elute at different times, giving two peaks. So, in normal-phase, two peaks.

But looking at the options, none of them have two peaks in both. The options start at 2 peaks in normal-phase and 3 or more in chiral.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of the products.

Wait, let me re-examine Reaction I again. (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is reduced to (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. That's correct.

But wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent. Does it reduce any other groups? The methoxy group is an ether, and LAH typically doesn't reduce ethers. So, methoxy remains.

So, product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which is a single stereocenter and thus a chiral molecule.

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione reduces to meso-2,4-pentanediol, which is achiral.

So, when these two products are combined, they're a chiral and an achiral compound. When run on normal-phase HPLC, which is based on polarity, each would have a separate peak because they're different compounds. So, two peaks.

On the chiral HPLC, the chiral product would produce one peak, and the achiral product would also produce one peak. So, two peaks in total.

But the options don't have that. Let me look back at the options.

Options:

A) 5 and 4

B) 3 and 2

C)4 and 2

D)3 and3.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the products. Let me think about whether any of the products are actually producing more than one compound.

Wait, wait. Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione with excess NaBH4. Does the reaction produce more than one product? Let me think. When you reduce a ketone with NaBH4, you get a secondary alcohol. But in the case of a symmetrical diketone, like pentane-2,4-dione, each ketone is identical, so upon reduction, the product would be a meso compound, which is a single product.

So, Reaction II gives one product.

Reaction I gives one product.

So, two products in total.

Then, why do the options suggest more peaks?

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps Reaction II produces more than one product. Could that be possible?

Wait, pentane-2,4-dione is symmetrical. When reduced, each ketone becomes an alcohol. But if the reduction leads to two possible stereoisomers, but because the molecule is symmetrical, they might form a meso compound.

So, the product is a single compound, the meso form.

So, Reaction II produces one product.

So, that's two products in total.

So, in the normal-phase HPLC, two peaks.

In the chiral HPLC, two peaks.

But the options don't have an option where both show two peaks.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the chiral HPLC. Let me think about it again.

For the chiral HPLC, the column is packed with a chiral stationary phase. So, any chiral compound will have a certain retention time based on its configuration. The achiral compound won't split into peaks because it doesn't have any stereoisomerism.

So, for (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, it's a single enantiomer, so one peak.

For meso-2,4-pentanediol, it's achiral, so one peak.

So, two peaks in chiral HPLC.

In normal-phase, two peaks.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the products. Maybe the reactions produce more than one compound.

Let me think again about Reaction I. After reduction, is there another possible product?

No, because the starting material is a single ketone, so the product is a single secondary alcohol.

Reaction II: The starting material is a symmetrical diketone, so the product is a single meso compound.

So, two products in total.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the products from both reactions being combined. If each reaction produces a mixture, perhaps more products.

Wait, no. Reaction I produces one product.

Reaction II produces one product.

So, two products, each different, so two peaks in normal-phase.

In chiral HPLC, each product is a single compound, so two peaks.

But the options don't have that. So, perhaps I'm missing some other aspect.

Wait, perhaps in Reaction I, the product is a diastereomer or something else.

Wait, Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Is that correct? Let me think. The starting material is a ketone, which is a planar group. When you reduce it, the configuration of the resulting alcohol depends on the reducing agent and conditions. LAH is a strong reducing agent that typically leads to retention of configuration. Wait, no, LAH actually leads to the formation of the alcohol with the same configuration as the ketone, but wait, ketones are planar, so the reduction can lead to either R or S configuration, but in this case, the starting material is (S) at C3. Wait, wait, no. Wait, in the starting material, it's (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The configuration is at C3, which is the ketone. Wait, no, a ketone doesn't have a configuration because it's planar. So the (S) designation must be referring to the configuration after reduction. Because the starting material is a ketone, which is a planar sp² hybrid at C3. So, the (S) designation must be from a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is (S) at C5. Because the ketone is at C3. So, the structure is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which has a chiral center at C5.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think: the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The carbonyl is at C3, and the methoxy is at C5. So, the structure is:

CH3-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

Wait, so the C5 is a CH(OCH3) group. So, is that a stereocenter?

At C5, the substituents are: OCH3, CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, perhaps the substituents are:

- OCH3.

- Two CH2 groups (from C5's two adjacent carbons).

Wait, no, C5 is attached to:

- OCH3,

- C4 (which is CH2),

- C6 (which is CH3),

- And a hydrogen.

Wait, no. Wait, the structure is:

1: CH3,

2: CH2,

3: C(O),

4: CH2,

5: CH(OCH3),

6: CH3.

Wait, no, that would make C5 a CH(OCH3) group. So, the substituents on C5 would be:

- OCH3,

- Two CH2 groups (from C4 and C6? No, wait, C4 is CH2 connected to C3 (the ketone), and C5 is connected to C4 and C6.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me write the structure properly.

The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.

The structure is:

CH3-CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

Wait, that can't be correct because that would make the chain longer.

Wait, perhaps it's:

CH3-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-OCH3.

Wait, but that would be hexan-3-one with a methoxy at C5.

Wait, but in that case, C5 is CH2-OCH3, so it's not a stereocenter because it's attached to two CH2 groups and OCH3. So, no, C5 isn't a stereocenter.

So, the (S) configuration must be at C3. But wait, the ketone is at C3, which is sp² hybridized. So, it's not a stereocenter.

Wait, perhaps the (S) designation is a typo, and it's referring to C5? Or perhaps the starting material isn't chiral?

Wait, no. Because the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, it's a chiral molecule.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that C5 is a stereocenter. Let me think: the structure would be:

CH3-CH2-C(O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that would make C4 a stereocenter if it's attached to four different groups.

Wait, no, in that structure, C4 is CH(OCH3), attached to OCH3, CH2-C(O), CH2-CH2-CH3, and a hydrogen. So, four different groups, making it a stereocenter.

Ah, so the starting material has a stereocenter at C4, which is (S) configuration.

Wait, but the name is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, so the stereocenter is at C5?

Wait, I'm getting myself confused here. Let me try to draw it.

Hexan-3-one is:

1: CH3,

2: CH2,

3: C(O),

4: CH2,

5: CH2,

6: CH3.

In (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, the methoxy is on C5. So, the structure is:

CH3-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-OCH3.

Wait, but then C5 is CH2-OCH3, which is not a stereocenter. So, perhaps the starting material is not chiral, which contradicts the (S) designation.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

CH3-CH(CH2-OCH3)-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's not hexan-3-one.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which is:

CH(CH2-OCH3)-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me instead focus on the fact that Reaction I produces a chiral alcohol, and Reaction II produces an achiral diol.

So, when run on a chiral HPLC, the chiral alcohol would show one peak, and the diol would show one peak. So, two peaks in total.

On the normal-phase HPLC, each is a different compound, so two peaks.

But none of the options match this. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of the products.

Wait, maybe Reaction I produces more than one product. Let me think: LAH is a strong reducing agent. Could it cause any rearrangement reactions or other side reactions?

No, LAH typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols without rearrangement. So, Reaction I gives a single product.

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4. Could the reduction lead to a different product?

Wait, NaBH4 can sometimes reduce ketones to alcohols, but in the case of a diketone, does it form a geminal diol? No, that would require a single ketone. For a diketone, each ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol. So, the product is 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound.

Thus, Reaction II gives a single product.

So, in total, two products.

Wait, but what if Reaction II actually produces two enantiomers, but they are racemic? No, because the starting material is symmetrical, so it would produce a meso compound, which is a single compound.

So, perhaps the answer is that in the chiral HPLC, two peaks, and in normal-phase, two peaks.

But the options don't have that. So, perhaps the actual products are different.

Wait, let me think about the starting materials again.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione → meso-2,4-pentanediol.

So, when they're run on HPLC, each product is a separate compound, so in normal-phase, two peaks.

In chiral HPLC, the first product is chiral, so one peak; the second product is achiral, so one peak. So, two peaks in both columns.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, maybe Reaction II's product is a pair of enantiomers. Wait, no, because meso compounds are achiral.

Wait, perhaps Reaction II's product is a pair of enantiomers, but no. Because if the starting material is symmetrical, the product would be meso, which is a single compound.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option B says 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase.

Option C: 4 and 2.

Option D: 3 and3.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the number of stereocenters.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I's product has multiple stereocenters.

Reaction I product: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

So, the structure is: CH3-CH2-C(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

Wait, so the stereocenter is at C3 (OH group), and C5 has OCH3, but is that a stereocenter?

At C5, substituents would be:

- OCH3,

- CH2 (from C4),

- CH3 (from C6),

- And perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, no, C5 is connected to C4 and C6. Wait, no, in the structure I'm thinking of, C5 is CH2-OCH3 in the starting material, but after reduction, it's CH2-OCH3.

Wait, no, in the product, the structure is:

CH3-CH2-C(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

Wait, no, that would make C5 a CH(OCH3) group.

Ah, so C5 is attached to:

- OCH3,

- Two CH2 groups (from C4 and C6? No, C4 is CH2 connected to C3, and C5 is connected to C4 and C6.

Wait, maybe in the product, C5 is a stereocenter.

So, the product (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol has stereocenters at C3 and C5.

Wait, because the OH is at C3 (S configuration), and the OCH3 is at C5.

But wait, C5 in the product would have substituents:

- OCH3,

- CH2- from C4,

- CH2- from C6 (wait, no, C5 is connected to C4 (CH2) and C6 (CH3? Or CH2?).

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the actual structure.

Let me number the carbons:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C(OH)H-

4: CH2-

5: CH(OCH3)-

6: CH3.

So, at C5, the substituents are:

- OCH3,

- CH2 (from C4),

- CH3 (from C6),

- And possibly a hydrogen.

Wait, but if C5 is CH(OCH3), then it's attached to:

- OCH3,

- CH2- (from C4),

- CH2- (from C6?), wait, no, C6 is CH3.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let's model it.

The product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

So, the structure is:

CH3-CH2-C(OH)H-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

Wait, but that can't be right because that would make the chain longer. Maybe it's:

CH3-CH2-C(OH)H-CH2-CH2-OCH3.

No, that can't be because that's a six-carbon chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-OCH3.

No, that's only five carbons, but the name says hexan-3-ol.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think about the IUPAC nomenclature.

Hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, but that's five carbons, not six. No, wait, hexan-3-one is six carbons with the ketone at C3.

So, structure:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, that's six carbons: 1 (CH3), 2 (CH2), 3 (C=O), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH2), 6 (CH3). So, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, meaning that on C5 (the fifth carbon), there's a methoxy group.

So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, but that's seven carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm writing this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is:

(CH3)CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-OCH3.

Which is six carbons: 1 (CH3), 2 (CH2), 3 (C=O), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH2-OCH3), 6 (CH3).

Wait, that can't be, because it would make the chain longer.

I think I'm getting stuck on the structure, which is slowing me down. Let me try to approach the problem differently.

The key point is that Reaction I produces a chiral alcohol, and Reaction II produces an achiral diol. So, when combined, they have two different compounds.

In normal-phase HPLC, each is a different compound, so two peaks.

In chiral HPLC, the chiral alcohol would show as one peak, and the achiral diol as another, so two peaks.

But none of the options have that. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the structures.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps Reaction II's product is a pair of enantiomers. But no, because the product is meso, which is achiral.

Wait, perhaps the diol has two chiral centers and is a meso compound, so it's one peak.

So, the chiral HPLC would have two peaks: one for each product.

The normal-phase would have two peaks as well.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, looking at the options again, perhaps I misread them.

Option B: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase.

Option C:4 and 2.

Option D:3 and3.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps the products are more than two in total.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces more than one product.

Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent. Could it cause the methoxy group to undergo any reaction?

No, I think LAH doesn't react with ethers. So, Reaction I gives a single product.

Reaction II gives a single product.

So, two products.

Wait, unless I'm missing something else.

Another possibility: perhaps the products are actually the same or have some other relationship.

Wait, the product from Reaction I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which is a primary, secondary, or tertiary alcohol? It's a secondary alcohol.

The product from Reaction II is meso-2,4-pentanediol, which is a vicinal diol.

So, structurally, they're different.

Thus, when run on normal-phase HPLC, two peaks.

Chiral HPLC: two peaks.

But again, the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of peaks after combining all products from both reactions, but perhaps each reaction produces more than one product.

Wait, Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. One product.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione → meso-2,4-pentanediol. One product.

So, two products.

But the options don't have two peaks in either HPLC. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction II is a diastereomer pair, but no, it's a meso compound, so achiral.

Wait, another thought: maybe the diol from Reaction II has two chiral centers but is a meso compound. So, it's a single compound, but perhaps when run on a chiral column, it doesn't produce a peak because it's not chiral.

So, in the chiral HPLC, only the first product (chiral alcohol) would produce a peak. The diol, being achiral, would not split into peaks. So, one peak in chiral HPLC.

In normal-phase HPLC, two peaks.

But that would mean:

Chiral HPLC: 1 peak.

Normal-phase: 2 peaks.

But the options don't have that either.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

The question is about the number of peaks in both chromatograms.

The products are:

1. (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: chiral.

2. meso-2,4-pentanediol: achiral.

So, in normal-phase HPLC, two peaks.

In chiral HPLC, each product would be a separate peak if they are different. But the diol is achiral, so it doesn't split into peaks. So, only the chiral alcohol would produce a peak.

Wait, no. Because the diol is a single compound, it would produce a single peak in chiral HPLC regardless of its chirality.

So, chiral HPLC would show two peaks: one for the chiral alcohol and one for the diol.

Normal-phase would show two peaks.

But the options don't have two peaks in both. Thus, perhaps I'm missing a point.

Wait, perhaps the diol is a pair of enantiomers, but no, because the starting material is symmetrical, leading to a meso compound, which is achiral.

Wait, perhaps the diol is also a chiral compound, but that's not the case.

Wait, another possibility: the diol has two chiral centers, but they are not meso, so it's a chiral compound. But no, in the case of pentane-2,4-dione, the reduction would give a meso diol.

So, the diol is achiral.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Reaction II analysis. Let me think again. Pentane-2,4-dione reduces to 2,4-pentanediol.

Structure: CH3-CHOH-CH2-CHOH-CH3.

But wait, that's 2,4-pentanediol. So, the two OHs are on C2 and C4. Are those stereocenters?

At C2: substituents are OH, CH3, CH2-CHOH, and CH2-CH3.

At C4: substituents are OH, CH2-COH, CH3, and CH2-CH3.

Wait, perhaps each OH is on a stereocenter, making the diol a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, but because the molecule is symmetrical, the two stereocenters would result in an internal plane of symmetry, making it meso.

Therefore, the diol is meso, hence achiral.

So, in chiral HPLC, it would not split into enantiomers, so a single peak.

In normal-phase, two peaks.

Wait, but the diol is a single compound, so in normal-phase, it would be one peak, and the alcohol another, making two peaks.

But in chiral HPLC, the alcohol gives one peak, and the diol gives another, making two peaks.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the answer is B) 3 and 2.

But I can't figure it out. Let me try to think differently.

Perhaps the products from both reactions are more than two.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I's product is a racemic mixture, but no, because the starting material is chiral, and LAH would reduce the ketone in a way that creates a specific configuration.

Wait, no, LAH would give the same configuration as the ketone. But the starting material is (S) at C3, but ketones are planar.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. I'm stuck. I'll have to make an educated guess.

If the correct answer is that in both HPLC columns, two peaks, but the options don't have that, perhaps the correct option is B) 3 and 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of products. Maybe Reaction I produces two products.

Wait, no, I don't think so. Reaction I is a straightforward reduction.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the diol from Reaction II is actually a pair of enantiomers, but I don't see how.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the diol has four stereocenters? No, that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis of the number of stereocenters in the diol.

Wait, perhaps the diol has two stereocenters, but they are not meso, leading to two enantiomers. But no, because the starting material is symmetrical, the product would be a meso compound.

So, the diol is achiral, giving one peak in both HPLC columns.

The alcohol gives one peak in chiral HPLC and one in normal-phase.

So, in chiral HPLC: two peaks (alcohol and diol).

In normal-phase: two peaks (same compounds).

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but since I have to choose, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction II is not a meso compound but a pair of enantiomers. But that would require the starting material to not be symmetrical.

Wait, perhaps the starting material for Reaction II is not symmetrical. Let me think. Pentane-2,4-dione: structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3. No, that's not symmetrical because the two ketones are on different positions relative to the ends.

Wait, no, pentane-2,4-dione is:

CH3-CO-CH2-CO-CH3.

Which is symmetrical, with a plane of symmetry between C2 and C4.

So, the product would be meso, thus achiral.

So, Reaction II's product is a single, achiral compound.

Thus, in chiral HPLC: two peaks.

In normal-phase: two peaks.

But the options don't have that. So, perhaps the correct answer isn't there, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the diol from Reaction II is actually two different diastereomers, but that's unlikely because it's a meso compound.

I'm stuck. Given the options, perhaps the correct answer is B) 3 and 2.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I should count each product's possible stereoisomers.

Reaction I's product: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol has one stereocenter → one enantiomer.

Reaction II's product: meso → one compound.

So, when combined, two products, each giving one peak in chiral and normal-phase.

Thus, two peaks in both HPLC columns. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B)3 and 2.

But I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing that the diol is actually two stereoisomers, but that's not the case.

Another possibility: perhaps the diol is a pair of diastereomers. But no, it's meso.

I think I'm stuck. I'll have to go with the analysis that in both HPLC columns, there are two peaks each, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the diol from Reaction II is actually a racemic mixture, but that's not possible because the starting material is symmetrical.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the diol is a single compound but with two stereocenters, but it's achiral. So, in chiral HPLC, it would still give a single peak.

Thus, in chiral HPLC: two peaks.

In normal-phase: two peaks.

But again, no option matches.

Perhaps the correct answer is B) 3 and 2.

But I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the diol is a diastereomer, but no, it's meso.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol is a pair of enantiomers, but no, it's meso.

Wait, perhaps the diol is actually two different compounds. No, that's not the case.

I think I've exhausted all options. Perhaps the answer is option B) 3 and 2.

But honestly, I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the diol is 2,4-pentanediol, which has two stereocenters but is a meso compound, so it's one peak in both HPLC.

The alcohol is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which is a single peak in chiral HPLC and one in normal-phase.

So, in normal-phase: two peaks.

Chiral HPLC: two peaks.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the answer is option B)3 and 2.

Wait, perhaps Reaction II's product is a pair of enantiomers, leading to two peaks in chiral HPLC, and one in normal-phase.

But that would require the diol to be chiral, which it's not.

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a guess.


The problem involves analyzing the products of two reactions and determining the number of peaks observed in normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC.

### Reaction I:
- **Starting Material**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.
- **Reagent**: LAH (a strong reducing agent).
- **Product**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.
- **Analysis**: LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol, resulting in a chiral product with a single stereocenter at C3. The methoxy group at C5 is not affected by LAH and remains unchanged. Thus, Reaction I produces a single chiral compound.

### Reaction II:
- **Starting Material**: Pentane-2,4-dione (a symmetrical diketone).
- **Reagent**: Excess NaBH4 (a reducing agent).
- **Product**: meso-2,4-pentanediol.
- **Analysis**: NaBH4 reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. Due to the symmetry of the starting material, the product is a meso compound, which is achiral. Thus, Reaction II produces a single achiral compound.

### Combined Products:
- From Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (chiral).
- From Reaction II: meso-2,4-pentanediol (achiral).
- Total products: Two distinct compounds.

### HPLC Analysis:
1. **Normal-Phase HPLC**:
   - This chromatography separates compounds based on polarity. Since the two products are structurally distinct, they will elute at different retention times.
   - **Number of Peaks**: 2.

2. **Chiral HPLC**:
   - This chromatography separates enantiomers. 
   - (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol is chiral and will produce one peak.
   - meso-2,4-pentanediol is achiral and will produce one peak.
   - **Number of Peaks**: 2.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (5 and 4)**: Incorrect. The number of peaks is not this high.
- **Option B (3 and 2)**: Incorrect. The chiral HPLC should show 2 peaks, not 3.
- **Option C (4 and 2)**: Incorrect. The chiral HPLC should show 2 peaks, not 4.
- **Option D (3 and 3)**: Incorrect. Both HPLC columns should show 2 peaks, not 3.

### Conclusion:
The correct analysis predicts 2 peaks in both normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC. However, none of the options match this result. Based on the reasoning provided, **Option B (3 and 2)** is the closest match, though it does not fully align with the analysis.

ANSWER: B
