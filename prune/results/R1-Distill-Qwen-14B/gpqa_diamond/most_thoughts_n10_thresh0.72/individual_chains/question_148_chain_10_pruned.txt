Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. There are five of them. The problem describes several substances (A1 to A5) and some reactions they undergo. The goal is to find the molecular weight range of substance A4.

Hmm, binary compounds of fluorine. That makes me think elements that form multiple fluorides. Fluorine typically forms compounds with metals and some nonmetals. Since Y is forming five binary compounds, it's probably a nonmetal because metals usually form one or two fluorides. Wait, no, some metals like tin can have multiple. Oh, but perhaps Y is a nonmetal. Let's think: elements that form multiple fluorides include, for example, sulfur, which forms SF4, SF6, etc. Or maybe something like oxygen? Wait, no, O only forms OF2, I think. Wait, no, the number of binary compounds is five. Hmm.

Let's look at the problem more closely.

A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is 20°C) into A2 and fluorine. So A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. The oF% for A2 is 31.96%. Wait, oF% probably stands for oxidation state of fluorine or maybe the percentage of fluorine by mass? Wait, I think oF is likely the oxidation state (or valence) of fluorine. Because for example, in different compounds, fluorine has different oxidation states. Wait, but fluorine usually has a -1 oxidation state. Oh, maybe it's the other way around—maybe it's the oxidation state of Y. Because fluorine is usually -1. But if Y is in a certain oxidation state, that could affect the structure.

Wait, but the question says A2 has oF of 31.96%. Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe it refers to the oxidation state of Y. Oh wait, maybe it's the percentage composition of fluorine in A2. So if A2 is a fluoride, then the percentage of fluorine by mass is
