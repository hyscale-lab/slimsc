Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question involves several reactions between substances A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. The goal is to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) Dâˆžh, D) C2v.

Hmm. I remember that molecular symmetry groups are determined by the highest symmetry operations present in the molecule. So I need to figure out what E is, then determine its structure and symmetry.

Let me break down the reactions given.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I'm trying to think of a reaction where a solid reacts with a gas in a specific stoichiometry to form a red product. Maybe something like sulfur reacting with something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal and B is a halogen or another diatomic gas. Another thought: perhaps A is a metal oxide, and B is a halogen? Or maybe it's a reaction involving a transition metal.

Wait, the product C is bright red. Bright red makes me think of something like mercury(II) oxide, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal sulfide? Or perhaps it's a nitrate or something else. I'm not certain yet.

Second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. Hmm, some dangerous products come to mind, like phosgene, or maybe something with chlorine. Wait, but E must be a product of C and D. Let me think about possible reactions.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So C plus H2O gives A, F, and G. So, perhaps C is a salt that when hydrolyzed produces acids. For example, if C is a nitrate salt, maybe? Or perhaps it's something like a sulfide, but that would produce H2S, which is a weak acid. Or maybe a metal carbonate reacting with water? Wait, no, because carbonate would react with water to give
