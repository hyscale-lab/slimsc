Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, paramagnetic coupling... I remember that has something to do with magnetic fields affecting electrons.

Alright, the setup: there's a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis, which I think is the z-axis. So the field is pointing straight up in that direction. The value of B is 1 Tesla. Oh wait, and the problem mentions small values of m, which is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Oh right, m can be -1, 0, 1 for p orbitals, or maybe something else depending on the orbital.

The question is asking to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term, which I think is the energy term due to the magnetic interaction, with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The given wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers. Wait, that's the wavelength for the Balmer series, right? Like the H-alpha line, which is about 656 nm. Oh wait wait, 0.4861 micrometers is 486.1 nm, which is the Balmer's beta line, I think. So that's the wavelength corresponding to a certain energy transition in hydrogen.

So I need to find the ratio or the order of magnitude between the paramagnetic term and this transition energy. Let me think about the formula for paramagnetic coupling. I think it's related to the Zeeman effect. Oh right, the Zeeman effect is the splitting of spectral lines in a magnetic field. So the energy shift due to the magnetic field is the paramagnetic coupling term here.

The Zeeman energy shift is given by ΔE_Zeeman = μ_B * B * m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m is the magnetic quantum number. But wait, the question says small m. So for hydrogen, m can be 0, ±1, but maybe even lower if it's a different orbital. Wait, for hydrogen, the ground state is 1s, which has l=0, so m=0. Then the first excited state could be 2s (l=0, m=0) or 2p (l=1, m= -1,
