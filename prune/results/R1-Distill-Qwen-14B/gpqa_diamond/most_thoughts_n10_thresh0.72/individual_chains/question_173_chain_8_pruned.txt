Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says: An electron is traveling at a speed of v = 2*10^8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position (Δx) is 0.1 nm. We need to estimate the minimum uncertainty in its energy ΔE.

Hmm, right. I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle comes into play here. The principle states that there's a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, like position and momentum, can be known simultaneously. The formula I think is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

So, the first step is to find the uncertainty in momentum, Δp, using the given Δx. Once I have Δp, I can relate that to the uncertainty in energy ΔE. Wait, how exactly do I get from momentum uncertainty to energy uncertainty?

Wait, I think for a particle moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, relativistic effects come into play. But wait, the speed given is 2e8 m/s. Let me see, the speed of light is about 3e8 m/s, so this is about 2/3 the speed of light. Hmm, so maybe relativistic effects are not negligible here. Oh wait, but the problem says to estimate the minimum uncertainty in energy. I'm not entirely sure if I should consider relativistic momentum or classical (non-relativistic) momentum.

Wait, the problem is about the uncertainty principle, which is a quantum mechanics concept. But for the electron's energy uncertainty, perhaps we can approach it using the uncertainty in momentum and kinetic energy. Because the kinetic energy is related to the momentum.

Wait, but wait. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates position and momentum. So, the uncertainty in momentum is approximately Δp ≈ ħ / (2Δx). Then, the kinetic energy is p²/(2m), so the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be approximately (Δp)^2/(2m). Let me think.

Alternatively, another approach I've
