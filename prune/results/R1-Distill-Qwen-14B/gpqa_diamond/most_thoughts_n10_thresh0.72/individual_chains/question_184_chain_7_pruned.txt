Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene, and I have to choose the correct sequence of reactions from the given options. Let me try to break it down.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm. Let me sketch the benzene ring structure. The numbering here is important. So, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3.

Wait, benzene is a ring with six carbons. Let me number them: position 1, 2, 3, etc. The substituents are ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, it's like 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, 3-nitro.

Now, the substituents are in the meta positions relative to each other. Wait, no. Let me see: position 1 is ethoxy, which is adjacent to position 2 (tert-butyl), which is next to position 3 (nitro). So, the substituents are in the ortho and meta positions. Hmm, but I think the key here is the order of substitution and the directing effects of each group.

So, benzene can undergo electrophilic substitution reactions. The substituents attached can be activating or deactivating, and they can direct incoming groups to ortho, para, or meta positions.

Let me list the substituents:

- Ethoxy (OCH2CH2CH3): This is an activating group because it's an electron-donating ether. It directs incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions.

- tert-Butyl (C(CH2CH3)3): This is a bulky alkyl group, which is activating (electron-donating via induction, but wait, wait. No, actually, alkyl groups are activating because they donate electrons through sigma bonds. So, they activate the ring towards electrophilic substitution. They are ortho/para directors.

- Nitro (NO2): Deactivating, strong meta director. Because nitro is a strong deactivating group (due to the electron-withdrawing effect), it makes the ring less reactive overall but directs incoming groups to the meta position relative to itself.

So the target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, nitro. Each must have been added in a specific order so that the directing effects are correctly utilized.

Wait, but the order of substitution matters because each new substituent is added relative to the existing ones.

Let me think: when adding substituents to benzene, each new group is added in a position that's activated by the existing substituents.

So, if I add the first substituent, that's a certain group, then the next, and so on.

So, the target is 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, 3-nitro. Let me visualize the ring: positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). Wait, but that's not possible because if you have substituents in 1, 2, and 3, each is adjacent to the next. Wait, no, in benzene, each position is adjacent to two others.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, nitro at position 3. So, each substituent is in the ortho position to the next. But that would mean that substituents are in the 1, 2, 3 positions, which are adjacent. Hmm, but that's a meta arrangement for some groups.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the order of adding substituents.

The options all present different sequences. Let's see. Each option has a series of steps, which are reactions. The steps involve adding substituents in a particular order.

The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. So, I need to figure out the order in which these are added to the benzene ring to get the desired positions.

But wait, the ethoxy group is an activating group, so it's probably added early because once you add a deactivating group like nitro, the ring is harder to substitute. Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is added later because adding it early could complicate directing.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is added first because it's a strong meta director, but that's a deactivating group. Let me think.

But considering that the nitro group is a meta director and deactivating, adding it first would make the ring less reactive, making subsequent substitutions harder. So perhaps it's better to add the activating groups first to make the ring more reactive for those
