Okay, so I've got this chemistry question to tackle, and I'm a bit nervous because isomerism and tautomerism can get a bit tricky. Let's break it down step by step.

The question is about two parts, A and B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is about which of the given compounds shows optical isomerism. The options are between benzoquinone, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, and dimethyl fumarate.

First, I need to understand what each term means. Let's start with tautomerism. Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair between two atoms, resulting in a different structure. This usually happens in compounds with adjacent double bonds and hydroxyl groups, like in carbonyl compounds. For example, in compounds with keto-enol tautomerism. So if a compound has such a structure, it can show tautomerism.

Looking at the compounds: Benzoquinone is a quinone, which is a cyclic di-ketone. Its structure is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. Wait, no, does it have three? Trione would mean three ketone groups. So cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have three carbonyl groups attached to the cyclohexane ring at positions 1,3,5. So each of these is a ketone.

Benzoquinone has two ketone groups. Now, can these compounds undergo tautomerism? Well, tautomerism usually requires adjacent hydrogen and carbonyl groups. So in a cyclic diketone like benzoquinone, can the hydrogens adjacent to the ketones shift? Let me think. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups opposite each other. Each carbonyl is connected to a benzene ring. Wait, the structure is O=C6H4=O. So each oxygen is double-bonded to a carbon, which is part of the benzene ring. In benzene, the carbons are spÂ² hybridized. So, the carbonyl groups are on adjacent carbons? No, wait, benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two ketone groups, probably at positions 1 and 4, making it para-benzoquinone. So each carbonyl is on opposite ends.

Wait, but can they undergo enol tautomerism? For enol tautomerism, you need a hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl group. In benzoquinone, each ketone is attached to a benzene ring. Are there any hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl groups? Let me visualize: The structure is O=C6H4=O. Each carbonyl is attached to a carbon that's part of the ring. So, the carbons next to the carbonyl are the ones in the ring. Each of those is connected to two other carbons in the ring and has a hydrogen. Wait, no, in a benzene ring, each carbon is connected to one hydrogen if it's not a substituent. So in benzoquinone, the two carbonyl groups are on adjacent carbons or across the ring? No, in para-benzoquinone, the two ketones are on opposite carbons, so the carbonyl groups are on 1 and 4 positions. So, each carbonyl is attached to a carbon that's part of the ring, which is connected to two other ring carbons. So, each of those carbons has one hydrogen attached?

Wait, maybe. So, the structure would be O=C-C6H3-C-O, but wait, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The benzene ring has two carbonyl groups. Each of those carbonyl carbons is connected to two other ring carbons. So, the carbonyl is at position 1 and 4, I think. So, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl are each part of the ring, and each has one hydrogen. So, for example, position 2 has a CH, which is connected to the carbonyl at position 1. So, could this hydrogen shift? Because enol tautomerism requires a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl group.

In benzoquinone, each carbonyl group is adjacent to two CH groups in the ring. So, each of those would have a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl. Therefore, benzoquinone should be able to undergo enol tautomerism, right? Because the alpha hydrogens can shift.

Wait, but wait, I've heard that aromatic quinones are generally not as prone to tautomerism because of the conjugation. Hmm, but that's more about their stability rather than the ability to tautomerize. Alternatively, maybe in such a conjugated system,
