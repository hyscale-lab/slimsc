Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me see. I'm trying to find the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, relative to each other.

Wait, the question gives me a bunch of abundance values. Let me parse the given data. Both stars have masses higher than the Sun, but I don't think the mass directly affects the abundance ratio. Oh wait, maybe not, because more massive stars might have different nucleosynthetic histories, but I think the problem is just about using the given [X/Y] values.

So, the given abundances are:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the solar photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 → that's -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.
Wait, no, wait, because the way the notation works, [X/H] is log10(nX/nH) - log10(nX/nH)_sun. So the problem gives the Sun's
