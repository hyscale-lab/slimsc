Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. I need to choose the correct sequence of reactions from the options A to D.

First, let me draw out the target molecule to visualize it better. The structure is a phenyl group with substituents at the 3 and 5 positions. The substituents are a bromine and a nitro group. Additionally, there's an ethanone group attached. Wait, ethan-1-oneâ€”so that's a ketone. Structure-wise, the benzene ring has a ketone (O=C-) attached to the 1-position. Then, at positions 3 and 5, there's Br and nitro groups. 

Wait, no. Wait, the compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ethanone is attached to the phenyl ring. The phenyl ring has substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (nitro). So numbering the ring: the ketone is at position 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. So the substituents are meta to each other and the ketone.

So the plan is to add these substituents in the correct order, considering the directing effects of each group and the possible reaction sequences.

Since benzene is the starting material, I'll need to perform a series of electrophilic substitutions. Let's think about the groups we're adding: nitro (NO2), bromine (Br), and a ketone group (COCH3, but wait, the target is ethan-1-one, which is (CH3)C=O attached to the ring? No, wait, ethan-1-one is CH3-C(=O)-, but in this case, it's attached to the benzene.

Wait, no. Wait, ethan-1-one is acetone, but attached to the benzene ring. So, the structure is benzene with a ketone group (like an acetyl group) attached. So the substituent is an acetyl group (COCH3) at position 1, and then at positions 3 and 5, we have Br and nitro groups.

But wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the benzene ring has the ketone group (from ethan-1-one) attached at position 1, and then substituents at 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2). So the substituents are at the meta positions relative to each other and the ketone.

So now, the key is to plan the synthesis steps, considering the order of adding substituents and their directing effects.

Because nitro groups are meta directors, bromine is also a meta director (if introduced via electrophilic substitution). The ketone group is an electron-withdrawing group and is a meta director as well.

Wait, but wait. The acetyl group (COCH3) is an activating group
