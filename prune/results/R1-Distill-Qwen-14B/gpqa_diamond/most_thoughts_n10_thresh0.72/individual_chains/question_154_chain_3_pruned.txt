Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the question involves a chemist who found an unnamed white solid. He has some spectral data to help identify it. The options are four different compounds, and I need to figure out which one matches the spectral data given.

Let's look at the data provided:

Mass Spec: Molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%), and another peak at m/z = 158 (32%). Hmm, molecular ion is the highest mass peak, so the molecular weight of the compound is 156. The other peak at 158 is a fragment, perhaps? Or maybe it's an isotopic peak? But 156 is the main one.

IR: A broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Wait, but a carboxylic acid would have a broad O-H stretch around 3000-2500, which fits the first IR peak. Also, the carbonyl in a carboxylic acid is usually around 1700 cm^-1, so that fits the 1720 peak. But wait, the 1720 is a bit higher, which might suggest an ester or maybe a ketone? Hmm.

1H NMR: Let's break this down. The peaks are at 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H), 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H), and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H). 

The 11.0 ppm peak is a singlet. That's a high chemical shift, so likely an -OH proton. But wait, in NMR, if it's a broad peak, it might be an exchange broadened peak, but in this case, it's a singlet. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the -OH proton is usually broad. But in the NMR data here, it's a singlet, which is sharp. Hmm, maybe it's an aldehyde proton? No, aldehyde protons are around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. Or maybe it's an acidic proton, like from a phenol? But phenol protons are around 7-8 ppm. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide, but the options don't have amides.

Wait, another thought: the strong peak at 1720 cm^-1 in IR could be an ester (which is around 1730-1750) or a ketone (around 1700-1750). But a carboxylic acid has a lower carbonyl stretch, around 1700. Alternatively, maybe a chlorinated compound, like chloroformate
