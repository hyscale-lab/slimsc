Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think it through step by step. Hmm, the question involves a series of reactions starting from compound A and ending with compound E, and I need to figure out what E is. There are a few hints given, so I should probably start by breaking down each step and the information provided.

First, let's look at the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form E.

And the hints:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) IR spectra: A has a peak around 1750 cm^-1, E around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are four different cyclic ketones, so E must be a ketone. Wait, but D loses an inert gas to get E. Inert gases are probably like CO or something similar? Wait, no, wait. Wait, elimination usually involves losing small molecules like H2O, H2S, or maybe NH3, but in this context, maybe CO or another gas. Oh wait, wait, in the context of reactions with HNO2, which is nitrous acid. When a compound reacts with HNO2, it's often involved in diazotization or some kind of substitution.

Wait, but looking at the steps: let me think about each transformation.

First, A + HCN → B. HCN adds to carbonyl groups. So if A is a ketone, HCN would add to the carbonyl to form a cyanohydrin. So B would be a cyanohydrin. Alternatively, A could be an aldehyde, but the IR suggests a carbonyl around 1750, which is more like a ketone than an aldehyde (which is higher, around 1720 maybe? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the IR for A is 1750, which is higher than a typical ketone. Because for example, aldehydes are around 1720, ketones around 1715. Hmm, but maybe if it's an aromatic ketone, maybe higher. Wait, but maybe A is a cyclic ketone. Alternatively, perhaps A is an ester, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, moving on. Then B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. So if B is a cyanohydrin, which is a compound with a C≡N group attached. Reducing such a compound with H2 and Pd would probably reduce the nitrile group to an amine. Wait, no, wait. H2 with Pd is catalytic hydrogenation. Under hydrogenation, nitriles (CN) would reduce to amines. But here, B is the product of A + HCN, which is a ketone + HCN. So the product would be a cyanohy
