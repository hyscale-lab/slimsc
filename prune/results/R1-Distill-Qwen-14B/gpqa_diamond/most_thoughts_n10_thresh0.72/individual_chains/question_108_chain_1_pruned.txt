Okay, let me try to figure this problem out. So, the question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I remember that paramagnetism has to do with the magnetic properties of materials due to their electrons, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

Wait, the question mentions a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis. Oh right, Oz is the z-axis. So the magnetic field is in the same direction as the spin. But since it's a paramagnetic coupling, I think that refers to the interaction between the magnetic moment of an electron and the external magnetic field. 

The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small. Oh, m can be -1, 0, +1 for p orbitals, but wait, in hydrogen, the electrons can be in different energy levels with different l values. But wait, m is the orbital quantum number, so for each l, m ranges from -l to +l. But the problem says small values of m, so maybe m is small, like m=0, but I'm not sure if that matters here.

The paramagnetic coupling term would be related to the energy due to the magnetic field. I think the formula for the energy of a magnetic dipole in a magnetic field is something like H = -μ·B. And μ is the magnetic moment, which for an electron is μ = -gμ_B S, where g is the Landé g-factor, and μ_B is the Bohr magneton. 

Wait, but for paramagnetism, we're considering the interaction of the electron's spin with the external field. So the Hamiltonian term is probably H = -μ·B. Since B is along Oz, the z-axis, then μ·B would be μ_z * B. And μ_z is given by μ_z = m_s * μ_B, where m_s is the spin quantum number. But wait, for electrons, m_s can be +1/2 or -1/2. So the energy shift would be H = -μ·B = - (g μ_B m_s) * B.

But wait, the problem says m is small. Oh wait
