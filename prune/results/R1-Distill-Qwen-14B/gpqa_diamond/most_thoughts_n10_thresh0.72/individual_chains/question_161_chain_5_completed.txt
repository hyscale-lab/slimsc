Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and mean free paths. Hmm, let me try to think through this. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to reason it out.

So, the setup is that Mike is working with a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using a really high accelerating voltage, 1000 kV. That's a lot, probably for better resolution. He's got vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment, like less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to get rid of as many gas molecules as possible because, in electron microscopy, gases can mess things up by scattering the electrons. So, better vacuum means fewer gas molecules, leading to better image quality.

But even with all that pumping, some gas molecules remain. The mass spectrometer detects them. Mike calculates the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path, if I remember correctly, is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. It depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules. The formula, I think, is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the molecules, and P is pressure. But wait, sometimes it's expressed using the ideal gas law terms, like λ = (1)/(√(2 π n d²)), where n is the number density. So higher pressure (more molecules) leads to a shorter mean free path.

Now, when Mike starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes. Instead of λ1, it's now λ2. And the temperature hasn't changed because the sample compartment is the same. So what's different now? The presence of the electron beam, I guess.

Wait, the mean free path is about how far a gas molecule travels before colliding with another. But in this case, the electrons are moving through the gas. The electrons can interact with the gas molecules. So when the electrons are on, maybe the gas molecules are getting excited or ionized or something. Or perhaps the gas molecules are being bombarded by the electrons, causing them to move more, or maybe even getting knocked out of the system.

Oh, right! When the electron beam is on, the gas molecules can get hit by the electrons. So each time an electron hits a gas molecule, the molecule might gain some energy. This could cause a couple of things: the molecule might get ionized, or it might get enough kinetic energy to physically move or even leave the vacuum chamber. Hmm, but wait, the pressure is already ultra-high vacuum, so maybe the molecules are moving very slowly because of low density. But when hit by a high-energy electron (1000 kV is super high energy), the interaction could be significant.

Alternatively, think about the electron beam itself. Those electrons are moving at a very high speed. Upon hitting a gas molecule, they might cause the molecule to scatter. But wait, in the presence of the electron beam, the gas molecules could get excited, perhaps leading to more collisions between themselves or even with the chamber walls. Or maybe the electrons cause the gas to heat up, but the question states the temperature remains the same. So thermal effects might not be the main issue here.

Wait another thought: the mean free path of the gas molecules. When the electron beam is off, the gas is just sitting there, and their mean free path is λ1. But when the beam is on, the electrons might cause the gas molecules to move more, thereby increasing the effective number density. Because the gas molecules are now moving around more, their effective density increases, which would decrease the mean free path. But wait, another possibility is that the electrons are causing the gas molecules to have more energy, maybe even leading to some of them being lost from the system (like getting ejected), which would decrease the number density, increasing the mean free path. Hmm, conflicting possibilities.

Wait, let's think about how the mean free path is determined. The mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the number density n, because λ = 1/(√(2 π n d²)). So if n increases, λ decreases. But if the number of gas molecules decreases, then n goes down, so λ increases. But why would n change when the electron beam is turned on? Unless the beam is causing the gas molecules to be pumped out more efficiently, or perhaps causing them to collide more with the chamber walls, leading to loss.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam is causing the gas to ionize, and then those ions are being attracted to the walls, effectively removing them from the vacuum. So the number of neutral gas molecules decreases, leading to a lower n. If n decreases, then the mean free path λ of the gas molecules would increase because λ is inversely proportional to n.

Wait, but the mean free path that Mike is measuring is for the gas molecules. Or wait, perhaps the mean free path of the electrons? No, the question says that after turning on the electron beam, he observes a change in the mean free path, so it's the gas molecules' mean free path.

Wait, actually, the mean free path of the electrons would be important for the electron microscopy. If the electrons are scattered more, their mean free path (in terms of scattering) would be shorter, which would reduce resolution. But the question is about the gas molecules' mean free path.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me re-read the question.

Mike determined λ1, the mean free path of the gas molecules in the vacuum. But upon initiating the electron beam, the mean free path becomes λ2. So, what causes λ2 to change?

Possibly, the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to move more, or perhaps the presence of the electrons affects the gas in a way that changes the effective pressure.

Wait, if the electrons are high-energy, they could cause the gas molecules to ionize. Ionized gas molecules (ions) would have different behavior. For example, ions are more massive, so their mean free path might be longer because their momentum is higher. Alternatively, the ions might be more likely to stick to the walls or get pumped out more effectively.

But wait, the pressure is already so low that the mean free path is large. So, when the beam is on, if the gas is ionized, the number of neutral molecules would decrease, and the ionized ones might be removed more quickly. So the effective number density of the neutral gas molecules would decrease, leading to a longer mean free path for the gas molecules. Because n decreases, λ increases.

So in that case, λ2 would be greater than λ1. Because λ is inversely proportional to n, and n is lower now because some molecules are ionized and removed.

But wait, the problem states that the mean free path that Mike found was no longer λ1. So, perhaps λ2 is longer than λ1.

Alternatively, another angle: when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might be bombarded by electrons, causing them to scatter more. But that would increase the collision rate, which would decrease the mean free path. So λ would be shorter.

Wait, that's conflicting. So which effect dominates? Does the number of gas molecules decrease (leading to longer λ) or does the collision rate increase (leading to shorter λ)?

Hmm. Let's think about the electron beam as a source of energy. High-energy electrons (like 1000 kV) have a lot of kinetic energy. When they collide with gas molecules, they can transfer some of that energy. This could cause the gas molecules to gain energy, possibly leading to increased velocity, and thus more collisions between themselves, which would lower the mean free path. But wait, I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if the gas molecules are ionized, they would become charged. Charged particles in a vacuum chamber may experience forces from electric fields. In a transmission electron microscope, the electron beam is focused and guided by electromagnetic lenses. So the ions could be repelled or attracted, leading them to hit the walls and be removed from the vacuum. So the number of gas molecules would decrease, leading to lower n, thus longer λ.

So if n decreases, λ increases because λ is proportional to 1/n. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

Looking back at the options, option A says λ2 >= 1.22*λ1. Option C says it's less than. So if we think that λ2 is larger, then options A or D or B.

Wait, but the question says Mike found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; it became λ2. The sample temperature is the same, so the thermal motion of the gas molecules isn't the main factor here.

So why did λ change? Because of the electron beam causing some change in the system.

If the number of gas molecules in the compartment decreased, n would be lower, so λ increases.

So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

Looking at the options, option A says λ2 >=1.22λ1. Option D says λ is between λ1 and 1.22λ1.

Wait, but why 1.22 times? Oh, wait, the 1.22 factor comes from the Debye length or something else? Or perhaps from the mean free path in the context of electron scattering.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the gas's mean free path and the electrons' mean free path. Let me think again.

In the gas, the mean free path λ1 is for the gas molecules. When the electron beam is on, the gas's mean free path for the gas molecules might increase because the number density n decreases due to gas being pumped out or ionized.

But how does the presence of the electron beam affect n? It could cause additional loss mechanisms. For example, the high-energy electrons could strip off electrons from gas molecules (ionization), and the ions are then attracted to the walls or pumped out more efficiently. So the number of neutral gas molecules decreases, thus n decreases, leading to λ increasing.

So λ2 would be larger than λ1, so λ2 > λ1.

So looking at the options, option A is λ2 >=1.22λ1. Option D says λ is between λ1 and 1.22λ1. So which one is it?

Wait, but why 1.22? I'm trying to remember if that's a specific factor. Oh, wait! The mean free path of electrons in a gas is given by λ_e = 1/(n_e * σ_e), where σ_e is the electron scattering cross-section. But that's for electrons, not gas molecules.

Alternatively, in some contexts, the mean free path of gas atoms is considered in relation to electron scattering. But perhaps the 1.22 factor is from the relation between the mean free path of electrons and gas molecules. For example, when considering the Townsend discharge, the mean free path for electrons is different from that of gas molecules. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. The mean free path of the gas molecules (λ1) is calculated based on the pressure, temperature, and volume. When the electron beam is on, gas molecules might be more likely to collide with the electrons, leading to more frequent collisions, which would reduce the mean free path for the gas molecules. But wait, no, because the gas molecules' mean free path is about how far they go before colliding with another gas molecule. The presence of electrons might not directly affect that, unless the electrons are causing the gas molecules to move more.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam is causing the gas to heat up, but the question says temperature remains the same. So thermal expansion isn't a factor.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam introduces additional ionization, which affects the number density. If the gas is ionized, the neutral atoms' density decreases, so n decreases, leading to λ increasing. So λ2 > λ1.

So if λ2 is greater than λ1, which options are possible?

Options:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1

C) λ2 < λ1

Well, the options don't specify by how much, but in this scenario, we're considering λ2 is larger than λ1.

But the options don't all agree on that. So the other options either say it's larger (A, D) or smaller (C), or it's the same (B).

So, according to our reasoning, λ2 > λ1, so options A, D, or possibly others.

Wait, but is there any reason why λ2 would be less than λ1?

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam causes more collisions between gas molecules. For instance, the electrons could cause the gas molecules to have higher energy, leading to more frequent collisions. But that would decrease the mean free path. So λ2 < λ1.

Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to approach it differently.

What is the mean free path of gas molecules in a vacuum? It's the average distance a molecule travels between collisions with other molecules. So, when the electron beam is off, the gas molecules are just in the vacuum, moving around, and their mean free path is λ1.

When the beam is on, the electrons are moving through the gas. Do the gas molecules collide more with each other because of the electron beam?

Alternatively, perhaps the electrons cause the gas molecules to lose energy, perhaps through inelastic collisions, leading to more frequent collisions between gas molecules. Or maybe the electrons cause the gas to become more dense, but that doesn't make sense because the pressure is already ultra-low.

Wait, another angle: the electron beam could cause the gas molecules to get more excited, perhaps leading to more frequent collisions because they're moving faster. But wait, the temperature is the same. So if the temperature is the same, the average kinetic energy is the same, so their speed is the same. So their collision rate wouldn't change due to speed, but maybe the presence of the electrons introduces more ways for the gas molecules to collide.

Wait, but the gas molecules' mean free path depends on their own number density and their collision cross-section. The electron beam might not directly affect this. Unless... perhaps the electrons cause the gas to become ionized, and the ions are more likely to stick to the walls, effectively reducing the number of gas molecules in the compartment.

So if the number of gas molecules decreases, the number density n decreases, so λ increases. So λ2 > λ1.

Which would mean that the correct answer would be either A or D.

But why 1.22 times? I'm not sure, but perhaps that's a standard factor in electron microscopy related to the mean free path of electrons.

Wait, maybe I should think about the concept of mean free path in electron microscopy. In transmission electron microscopy, the mean free path of electrons (λ_e) is crucial because it determines the resolution. The resolution is roughly λ_e / 2, so a longer λ_e means better resolution.

The mean free path of electrons is given by λ_e = (1) / (n * σ), where σ is the scattering cross-section per atom, and n is the number density of scattering centers (like gas molecules). So if n decreases, λ_e increases.

In this scenario, when the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas molecules are being ionized or pumped out, so n decreases. So λ_e increases, leading to better resolution. However, the question is about the gas molecules' mean free path, λ2, not the electrons'. So I might have been mixing up the concepts.

Wait, the question says Mike observed that the mean free path was no longer λ1 but was λ2. So he's measuring the mean free path of the gas molecules, not the electrons. So in that case, if the number of gas molecules decreases (due to being ionized and pumped away), then their number density n decreases, so their mean free path λ increases.

Therefore, λ2 > λ1, so λ2 is greater than λ1.

Looking at the options, only option A and D suggest that λ2 is larger than λ1 (A is >=1.22λ1; D is between λ1 and 1.22λ1).

Wait, but why would the mean free path be exactly 1.22 times? I'm not sure. Perhaps there's another factor involved.

Wait, maybe the presence of the electron beam introduces another factor. For example, the electrons might contribute to additional scattering, but that's for the electrons, not the gas molecules. So the gas molecules' mean free path would be about their own collisions.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes gas molecules to move more, but again, if the temperature is the same, their speed isn't changing. So the collision rate between gas molecules doesn't change, so their mean free path remains the same. But Mike observed a change, so that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the mean free path of the gas molecules is now dominated by collisions with the electron beam. But wait, the mean free path is for the gas molecules, so their collisions would be with other gas molecules, not the electrons.

Wait, another thought: the presence of the electron beam could cause the gas to become a plasma. In a plasma, the gas becomes ionized, and the behavior changes. In a plasma, the mean free path could be significantly longer because the ions and electrons can move more freely. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, more accurately, when a gas becomes ionized (plasma), the mean free path of the neutral atoms would decrease because the plasma might cause more frequent collisions, but I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to be more transparent, but again, this is about the electrons.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of it in terms of possible effects:

- Electron beam on: causes gas molecules to ionize, leading to fewer neutral molecules. So n decreases, λ increases.

So, λ2 > λ1.

Looking back at the options, A says λ2 >= 1.22 λ1. So λ2 could be equal to or greater than 1.22 times λ1.

But why 1.22? Maybe that's a standard scaling factor when considering electron scattering in gases.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path is actually smaller than before because the electron beam introduces more scattering events for the gas molecules, but that doesn't make sense because the gas molecules' mean free path depends on collisions between themselves, not with the electrons.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to move in such a way that they collide more frequently with the walls of the compartment, thereby effectively increasing the number of collisions and reducing the mean free path.

But in that case, more collisions with the walls would decrease the mean free path, but only if they are more likely to hit the walls rather than other gas molecules.

Wait, but the mean free path is about collisions between gas molecules, not walls. So if the gas molecules are hitting the walls more often, that doesn't directly affect their mean free path, unless the wall collisions are adding more energy or something, but the temperature is the same.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think of it in terms of physics principles.

In a vacuum, the mean free path λ is given by λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2) * π * d² * P), where P is the pressure. But when the electron beam is on, perhaps the pressure effectively increases because the gas is somehow being compressed or heated. But the problem states the temperature is the same, so heating isn't the issue.

Wait, but if the electron beam is causing some of the gas molecules to be removed (like they're getting knocked out of the chamber), then the pressure would decrease, leading to a longer mean free path. So that would lead to λ2 > λ1.

So which option says λ2 > λ1?

Options A, D.

But the problem is, I don't know the exact reasoning behind the 1.22 factor. Maybe that's a clue. 1.22 is about the square root of 2 times the mean free path in a certain context. Wait, I remember that the Debye length in a plasma is sqrt( (ε N λ_D) ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the 1.22 factor is approximately 4/π, which is about 1.27, close to 1.22. So perhaps it's a factor related to the cross-section or something.

Wait, perhaps the mean free path is calculated using the relation λ = 1/(n * σ), where σ is the collision cross-section. If the presence of the electron beam introduces a different cross-section, perhaps due to ionization or other effects, then λ could change.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path for electrons is different than that for gas molecules. But the question is about the gas molecules' mean free path.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to expand, but that would require the pressure to decrease, which would increase the mean free path.

But without knowing the exact reason, I need to make an educated guess.

Based on the reasoning that the electron beam causes gas molecules to be ionized and removed, leading to a lower n and thus a longer λ, I think λ2 is larger than λ1. So the correct answer is either A or D.

Looking at the options, option A states λ2 >= 1.22λ1, which could imply that the mean free path is significantly longer. Option D says it's between λ1 and 1.22 times.

But perhaps in the scenario, the mean free path doesn't increase by much. Maybe because the pressure is already ultra-low, the change isn't that drastic. So maybe λ2 is just a bit longer than λ1, which would make option D correct.

Wait, but I don't know the exact factor. Alternatively, maybe the mean free path for the electrons is λ_e = 1/(n_e * σ_e), and the gas molecules' mean free path is λ = 1/(n * σ). So if n_e is the number density of electrons, perhaps after ionization, λ_e would change. But this is about the gas molecules, not the electrons.

I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about what each option implies.

Option C says λ2 < λ1. That would happen if the number of gas molecules increases, which doesn't make sense because the electron beam would likely cause them to be removed.

Option B says they are the same, which can't be true because Mike noticed a change.

So the only possibilities are A and D.

If the mean free path increases, then the correct answer is either A or D.

But without knowing the exact factor, perhaps the correct answer is A, which states that λ2 is greater than or equal to 1.22 times λ1.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam doesn't directly affect the number of gas molecules in a way that significantly changes the mean free path. Maybe the change is minimal, so λ2 is just a little larger than λ1, which would make option D correct.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Another angle: when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are being bombarded by high-energy electrons. Each collision could transfer momentum, causing the gas molecules to move more randomly. But if the temperature is the same, their average kinetic energy is the same, so their speed is the same. So the collision rate between gas molecules shouldn't change, implying λ remains approximately the same. But Mike saw a change, so this can't be.

Wait, but if the gas molecules are ionized, they could lose charge and be quickly removed from the system, effectively reducing n. So the mean free path would increase.

So in that case, λ2 is longer than λ1.

So the only options left are A and D.

But the question says that Mike accurately determined λ1, but upon initiating the beam, the mean free path was now λ2, which is different. So the electron beam has some effect that Mike didn't account for in λ1.

If the effect is that the number of gas molecules decreases, then λ2 would be larger than λ1.

So, if the number of gas molecules is lower, then λ2 would be larger.

So, the conclusion is that λ2 > λ1. Hence, option A or D.

But the question is whether λ2 is greater than λ1 but less than 1.22 times, or greater than or equal to 1.22 times.

Hmm. Without knowing why 1.22 is a factor, I'll have to make a choice. I think the correct answer is option C, but wait, that's the opposite.

No, earlier reasoning says λ2> λ1. So options A and D are possibilities.

Well, considering that the presence of the electron beam can cause gas molecules to be ionized and pumped out, reducing n and thus increasing λ, the correct answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1.

So looking at the options, option A says λ2 >=1.22λ1. So is it necessarily >=1.22 times?

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path doesn't change that much. Maybe the answer is D, which says λ is between λ1 and 1.22λ1.

But without knowing the exact factor, it's hard to choose between A and D.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the mean free path for the gas molecules during electron beam operation is actually λ_e (electron's mean free path). But the question says Mike is looking at the gas molecules' mean free path.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam introduces a factor that doubles the mean free path or increases it by a certain amount.

Hmm, I'm not sure. I'm a bit stuck, but given the options, the most plausible conclusion is that λ2 is longer than λ1. So the answer is either A or D.

But since the options don't specify that it's exactly 1.22 times, just that it's >=1.22 times, perhaps the correct answer is A.

Wait, but why 1.22? I'm not getting that from my reasoning. Maybe that factor relates to the mean free path under specific conditions, like accounting for electron scattering.

Alternatively, perhaps the original λ1 was calculated without considering electron scattering, and λ2 includes that.

Wait, but the problem states that Mike was calculating λ1 based on factors like pressure, temperature, and sample compartment volume. So perhaps when the electron beam is on, additional factors come into play, like electron-gas interactions, which Mike didn't consider when calculating λ1.

But the question is about the gas molecules' mean free path, not the electrons'. So maybe the presence of the electron beam doesn't directly affect the gas's mean free path. So why would λ2 change?

Wait, perhaps when the electron beam is on, it causes the gas to heat up, but the question says the temperature remains the same. So that can't be it.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to expand, but again, that would require a change in pressure, which the problem doesn't mention.

Wait, another possibility: the presence of the electron beam could cause the gas molecules to be more likely to collide with the walls of the compartment due to the electrons pushing them, which would effectively increase the collision rate between gas molecules and walls, leading to more frequent collisions and thus a shorter mean free path.

But the mean free path is the average distance between collisions with other gas molecules, not the walls. So if gas molecules are colliding more with the walls, that doesn't directly affect their mean free path.

Alternatively, if the gas molecules are being pushed towards the walls by the electrons, it might cause them to have a higher effective pressure, but since the temperature is the same, that seems unlikely.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Key points from the question:

- Ultra-high vacuum: <1e-9 Torr.

- Electron beam on: gas molecules' mean free path changes from λ1 to λ2.

- Temperature same.

So the only variable is the presence of the electron beam.

What could the electron beam do? It could cause gas molecules to:

1. Get ionized and pumped out → n decreases → λ increases.

2. Get heated → but temperature is same, so no.

3. Cause more collisions between gas molecules → λ decreases.

But why would the presence of the electron beam cause more collisions between gas molecules? Because the electrons could be adding energy, but the temperature is the same, so perhaps the speed isn't higher. Alternatively, the electron beam could be inducing vibrations or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to become more ionized, leading to a higher rate of gas escaping the compartment. So n decreases.

So, the mean free path increases: λ2 > λ1.

Thus, the options would suggest either A or D.

But why 1.22 times? Maybe the factor comes from the relation between the mean free path of the gas and the electrons. For example, in electron microscopy, the mean free path of electrons is often about 1.22 times the gas's mean free path. So if the electron's MFP is λ_e, the gas's would be λ1 = λ_e / 1.22. So if λ_e increases, λ1 increases, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps when the electron beam is on, the effective mean free path of the gas is related to 1.22 times, but I can't recall.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is A: λ2 >= 1.22λ1.

But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C: λ2 < λ1, but that would require that the mean free path decreases, which would happen if the gas molecules collide more with each other, but I don't see why that would happen with the electron beam on.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to become a plasma, and in a plasma, the mean free path is longer. So λ2 would be larger.

So, the answer is either A or D.

Wait, Mike's observation is that the mean free path is now λ2, different from λ1. So the presence of the electron beam is causing λ to change. Since the only way that makes sense is if the number of gas molecules decreases (n decreases), leading to λ increasing.

Therefore, λ2 is greater than λ1. So the correct options are A or D.

But without knowing the exact factor, perhaps the answer is C, but I don't think so. So the best I can conclude is that λ2 > λ1, so the answer is either A or D.

Wait, perhaps the correct reasoning is that when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules' mean free path is longer because they are ionized and pumped out, so n is lower. So λ2 = 1/(n2 sqrt(2 pi d²)) is larger than λ1 = 1/(n1 sqrt(2 pi d²)).

So the answer is λ2 > λ1.

Looking at the options, only A and D suggest λ2 is larger.

But the question doesn't give any information about the magnitude of the increase, just that it's different.

So perhaps the correct answer is option C, but that's the opposite.

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let's think of another approach.

In a vacuum, the mean free path is primarily determined by the pressure (n) and the size of the molecules. So if n decreases, λ increases.

Thus, when the electron beam is on, and if n decreases, λ increases. So λ2 > λ1.

Therefore, the correct answer is either A or D. But the options don't specify by how much, so all we can conclude is that λ2 is larger than λ1.

Looking at the options again, option A says λ2 >= 1.22λ1, so it's possible that λ2 is larger than this factor.

Option D says λ is between λ1 and 1.22λ1.

But without knowing exact numbers, perhaps the intended answer is A, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam doesn't affect the mean free path of the gas molecules much, so λ2 remains approximately the same as λ1. But the question says Mike found a change, so this isn't the case.

I think I'll have to go with option C: λ2 < λ1, but wait, earlier reasoning contradicts that.

No, I think the correct conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1, so the options are A or D.

But since I can't be certain, and given the options, I'll choose option C as incorrect. Therefore, I think the correct answer is A.


The question involves analyzing the change in the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in an ultra-high vacuum (<10⁻⁹ Torr) when an electron beam is initiated in a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. Initially, Mike calculates the mean free path as λ₁ based on pressure, temperature, and volume. However, upon turning on the electron beam, the mean free path changes to λ₂, and the task is to determine the relationship between λ₁ and λ₂.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mean Free Path Basics**:  
   The mean free path (λ) of gas molecules is inversely proportional to the number density (n) of the gas, given by the formula:  
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi n d^2}}
   \]  
   where \(d\) is the molecular diameter. A decrease in \(n\) (number density) leads to an increase in λ, and vice versa.

2. **Effect of the Electron Beam**:  
   When the electron beam is turned on, several effects could occur:  
   - **Ionization**: High-energy electrons from the beam can ionize gas molecules, turning them into charged particles (ions). Ions are more likely to interact with the walls of the vacuum chamber or be pumped out, effectively reducing the number of neutral gas molecules. This decreases \(n\), leading to an increase in λ.  
   - **Scattering**: The electron beam could also cause gas molecules to collide more frequently with each other or the walls, but this would depend on the specific dynamics of the system. However, the problem specifies that the temperature remains constant, so thermal effects are unlikely to play a significant role.

3. **Observed Change in λ**:  
   Mike observes that λ changes from λ₁ to λ₂ upon initiating the electron beam. The reasoning suggests that the ionization effect dominates, reducing the number of neutral gas molecules and increasing the mean free path. Thus, λ₂ > λ₁.

4. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A (λ₂ ≥ 1.22λ₁)**: This implies that λ₂ is at least 1.22 times larger than λ₁. This is plausible if the electron beam significantly reduces the number density \(n\), leading to a substantial increase in λ.  
   - **Option B (λ₂ = λ₁)**: This would mean no change in the mean free path, which contradicts Mike's observation of a change.  
   - **Option C (λ₂ < λ₁)**: This would require an increase in \(n\), which is unlikely given the ionization and pumping effects of the electron beam.  
   - **Option D (λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22λ₁)**: This suggests a moderate increase in λ₂, less than 1.22 times λ₁. While possible, the problem does not provide specific evidence to limit the increase to this range.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The most consistent explanation is that the electron beam reduces the number of neutral gas molecules, increasing the mean free path. Therefore, λ₂ > λ₁. Among the options, **Option A (λ₂ ≥ 1.22λ₁)** is the most reasonable, as it aligns with the expected increase in λ due to reduced \(n\).
