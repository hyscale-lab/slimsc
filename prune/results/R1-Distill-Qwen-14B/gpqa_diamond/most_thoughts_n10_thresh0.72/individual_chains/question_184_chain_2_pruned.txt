Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Hmm, the question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Breaking that down, I see three substituents on the benzene ring: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are 1,2,3 respectively, so the substituents are at the ortho and para positions relative to each other.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering them as 1, 2, 3 would mean that the substituents are adjacent in a way. Let me visualize that. So, the nitro group is at position 3, ethoxy at 1, and tert-butyl at 2. So, the nitro is next to ethoxy, and tert-butyl is next to ethoxy as well.

Synthesis steps typically involve electrophilic substitution reactions. But the order matters because each substituent directs the next reaction. Let's think about the directing effects.

Nitro groups are meta-directing, strong deactivating. Ethoxy groups are ortho/para-directing, activating. Tert-butyl is an alkyl group, so it's ortho/para-directing and activating (since it's an electron-donating group via induction, but actually, wait, alkyl groups are activating because they donate electrons through sigma bonds, making the ring more reactive towards electrophilic substitution. So, tert-butyl is an activating group, ortho/para-directing.

Wait, but when you substitute multiple groups, the directing effect can be influenced by the existing substituents. Let me think about the order of adding these groups.

So, the target has three substituents. Let me figure out the order in which they should be added.

One approach is to decide which substituent should be added first so that the subsequent reactions are possible and in the correct positions.

Option 1: Add the nitro group first. Nitro is a strong deactivating group, so if we add it first, the ring becomes less reactive. But in that case, adding the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups would be difficult because the ring is deactivating. Wait, but the nitro group is meta-directing, so maybe if we add it first, the next substituents would go in the meta positions. But let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps we should add the activating groups first so that the ring remains reactive for the deactivating groups.

Wait, but the ethoxy group is an activating group, and the tert-butyl is also activating. The nitro is deactivating. So, perhaps the nitro should be added last because once the ring has activating groups, adding a deactivating group might be more challenging, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, maybe the nitro group is added after the activating groups. Because if you add a deactivating group first, the ring is less reactive towards adding activating groups. So, perhaps the nitro should be added later.

But wait
