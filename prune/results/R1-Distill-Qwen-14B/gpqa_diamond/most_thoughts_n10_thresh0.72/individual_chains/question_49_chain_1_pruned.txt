Alright, I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It involves sigmatropic rearrangements, and I need to figure out the products of three different reactions. Hmm, let me break it down step by step.

So, the first reaction is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacting with but-3-en-2-ol under H+ and heat to give product A. I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements, like Cope and Claisen, involve the migration of a sigma bond along with a pi bond shift. But wait, in this case, what kind of reaction is it?

Wait, the starting material is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. That structure has two methoxy groups on a central carbon which is also attached to an amine. So, the structure is probably (CH3O)2CH-NH2. But wait, no, it's 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. So it's H2N-C(OCH3)2. That makes sense. 

The other reactant is but-3-en-2-ol, which is allyl alcohol. Its structure is CH2=CHCH2OH. But wait, the position is 3-en-2-ol, so it's CH2CH2OH with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Or wait, but wait: but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait, butenol. Let me think: but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait, numbering. Carbon 1: CH2, carbon 2: OH, carbon 3: double bond to C4. So but-3-en-2-ol is CH2(OH)CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, no. Wait, butenol. The correct structure is CH2=CHCH2OH. Because but-3-en-2-ol is (CH2)2CH-OH with a double bond between C2 and C3. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3 with a double bond between C2 and C3? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think: but-3-en-2-ol would have four carbons, with a double bond starting at C3, but that's impossible because the last carbon can't have a double bond. Oh wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2(OH)CH2CH3 but with a double bond between C2 and C3? No, that can't be because that would be but-2-en-2-ol. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2OH, which is allyl alcohol. Yeah, that's right. So but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2OH.

So, the reaction is between 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol under H+ and heat. Hmm, what kind of reaction is that? Maybe a Michael addition or some kind of
