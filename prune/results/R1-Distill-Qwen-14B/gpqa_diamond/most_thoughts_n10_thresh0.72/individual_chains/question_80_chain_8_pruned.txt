Alright, so I've got this problem here where an algorithm takes a DNA sequence as input and outputs a number. The examples given are AGG ->115 and TGCTGA ->176. I need to figure out what the algorithm is doing so I can apply it to the sequence ACAGTGACC and choose the correct option from A to D.

Hmm, okay, let's start by looking at the examples. Let's break them down.

First example: AGG â†’ 115.

AGG is a DNA triplet. Each letter probably represents a nucleotide: A, G, G. I'm wondering if each nucleotide is converted into a number and then summed or multiplied.

Wait, DNA bases are A, T, C, G. Their ASCII values are important? Let me think. A is 65, T is 84, C is 67, G is 71 in ASCII. Let me check the first example:

A is 65, G is 71, G is 71. So for AGG, the numbers are 65,71,71. If I add them: 65+71=136, plus 71 is 207. That's way higher than 115. So maybe it's not adding.

Alternatively, perhaps each base is assigned a value, like A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4 or something like that. Let's try that.

So for AGG: A=1, G=4, G=4. Sum is 1+4+4=9. But the output is 115. So that can't be it. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe each base is paired with a number, but perhaps it's the position in the alphabet. A is 1, G is 7, so AGG would be 1,7,7. Sum is 15. Still not matching 115.

Wait, maybe it's the sum of the individual digits when each base is represented as a number. Like A is 65, which is 6+5=11. But that seems too simplistic and the sum would be 11 + 7+7 (since G is 71:7+1=8? Wait wait, no. Wait, G is 71 in ASCII, so 7+1=8. So A=6+5=11, G=7+1=8, another G=8. So total is 11 +8+8=27. Still nowhere near 115.

Alternatively, perhaps each base is converted to a single digit, like A=0, T=1, C=2, G=3. Let's see: AGG would be 0,3,3. Sum is 6. Doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe each base is represented by a two-digit number, and then those digits are summed across all bases. Let me try that with AGG.

A is 65, so digits 6 and 5. G is 71: 7 and 1. Another G:71 again. So all digits: 6,5,7,1,7,1. Sum them all: 6+5=11, 7+1=8, 7+1=8.
