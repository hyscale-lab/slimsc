Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear decay, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about how the energy spectrum of E particles changes when a different particle is emitted.

Alright, the original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. And in the variant, it's emitting one exotic, massless particle M instead of 2V. So, the reaction becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M.

Wait, so I need to compare the E particles' energy spectrum in both cases. The original case has a continuous spectrum with endpoint Q. What changes when M is emitted instead?

I remember that in beta decay, the emitted electrons have a continuous spectrum because of the energy sharing between the electron and the antineutrino. The maximum energy (endpoint) occurs when all the energy goes to the electron, but in reality, both particles share the energy, leading to a range of possible energies.

In the original decay, two E and two V are emitted. Maybe E and V are like beta particles and antineutrinos? Or perhaps they're other leptons. But regardless, when multiple particles are emitted, the energy spectrum of each can be continuous because the energy is shared among them.

So, in the original setup, the E particles' energy spectrum is continuous because each E can have varying energy depending on how the total energy is divided between E and V. The maximum energy Q would be when each E gets as much as possible, but since there are two E and two V, perhaps the maximum is when each E has Q/2 each? Or maybe I should think in terms of each pair.

Wait, but the question says the total energy spectrum of E is continuous with endpoint Q. So for each E, the maximum energy is Q. But if there are two E's, then the maximum total energy for them would be 2Q, but that's probably not relevant. The important thing is that each E has a maximum possible energy of Q.

Now, in the variant decay, they emit one M instead of two V. So, instead of 2V, it's M. And M is massless and exotic. Hmm, so what's the implication on the decay?

In the original case, the decay products are 2B, 2E, and 2V. Assuming B and E are the main products, but the Vs are other particles. Now, in the variant, 2V are replaced by one M. So the number of particles changes, which affects how energy is distributed.

Wait, in the original scenario, the decay produces multiple particles, so the energy is shared among more particles, leading to a continuous spectrum. If in the variant, you have fewer particles, perhaps the energy distribution changes.

But wait, energy is conserved. The total energy available (Q value of the decay) would be the same, right? Because it's the same reaction except for how the energy is partitioned.

In the original decay, the E particles' energy comes from the available energy, which is split among E, V, and the recoiling B particles. In the variant, M is emitted, which is massless. So M will carry away some
