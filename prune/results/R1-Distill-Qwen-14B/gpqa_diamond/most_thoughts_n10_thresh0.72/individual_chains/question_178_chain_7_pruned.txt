Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. Right, so that's the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices, which probably has some specific dimension.

First, I need to figure out the mass dimension of each field and then the terms in the Lagrangian. Oh wait, in quantum field theory, each field has a certain mass dimension based on the theory's requirements for the terms to be Lorentz-invariant and renormalizable.

So, the fields involved here are ψ (the fermion field), F^{μν} (the field strength tensor, which is for a gauge field like electromagnetism or Yang-Mills), and κ is the coupling constant.

Let's break down each part.

The Lagrangian is an interaction term, so the dimension of the term must be [Mass]^4 because the action has to be dimensionless (in natural units where ħ = c =1, the action is dimensionless). The Lagrangian density has dimension [Mass]^4, since integrating over [Mass]^-1 (d^4x) gives dimensionless.

So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension [Mass]^4.

Let me write down the dimensions of each field:

1. Fermion field ψ: For a Dirac spinor, the field ψ has dimension [Mass]^{3/2}. Because in the kinetic term L = i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, each derivative ∂_μ has [Mass]^1. So the term is ψ̄ (dim 3/2) * ∂ψ (dim 1 + 3/2) = 3/2 + 3/2 +1 = 5/2? Wait, no. Wait, the kinetic term is L = i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_mu ψ. The dimension of each ψ is D, so ψ̄ is also D. The term is [D]^2 * [Mass], because ∂_mu has dimension Mass. So [L] = [Mass]^4 implies [D]^2 * [Mass] = [Mass]^4. So [D]^2 = [Mass]^3 → [D] = [Mass]^(3/2). So ψ has [Mass]^(3/2).

2. F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. For a gauge field A_mu, which has dimension [Mass]^1 (since the field strength F is ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu, so F has same dimension as A). Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The field strength tensor F^{μν} is built from the gauge field A_mu. The term in the Yang-Mills Lagrangian is ~ F^2, which must have dimension [Mass]^4. So F^2 has [Mass]^4 → F has [Mass]^2. Because each F would be [Mass]^2, so F^2 is [Mass]^4.

Wait, that's right. Because F^{μν} F_{μν} is the term in the Lagrangian, and each F has [Mass]^2. So F^{μν} has dimension [Mass]^2.

3. The sigma matrix σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices. Gamma matrices are dimensionless. Because in the Dirac equation, the term γ^μ ∂_mu ψ has dimension [Mass]^{3/2} + 1. Wait, the derivative ∂_mu has dimension [Mass], and ψ has [Mass]^{3/2}, so the product γ^mu (∂_mu
