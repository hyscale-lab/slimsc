Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it step by step. So the question is about space travel and time dilation, right? Hmm, I remember that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. So from the astronaut's perspective, less time would pass compared to someone back on Earth. But wait, the question is from the astronaut's point of view, so I need to calculate the proper time experienced by them.

Alright, let's see. The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's really close to the speed of light! The distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud—wait, do I know how far that is? Oh right, the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away from Earth. So the distance is approximately 160,000 light-years.

Wait, but wait. From the astronaut's perspective, the distance would be length-contracted because of their high speed. So the proper length (distance as measured in Earth's frame) is L0, and the contracted length is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, the astronaut is on the spacecraft, so for them, Earth is moving towards them at a high speed. So the distance they perceive would be shorter.

So the proper time experienced by the astronaut (their time) is given by the time dilation formula. But I think the formula is τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time measured in the Earth's frame. Wait, no, I might be getting confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the proper time (τ) is the shortest time experienced by the traveler, and it's given by τ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So first, I need to find the time it takes from Earth's frame, then apply the gamma factor to get the astronaut's time.

Wait, let me clarify. The Earth observes the spacecraft traveling at v = 0.99999987c. The distance is D = 160,000 light-years. So the time from Earth's perspective (t_earth) would be D / v. Let me compute that.

v is 0.99999987 c, so in terms of light-years per year
