Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, it's a bit intimidating because I'm still new to these concepts. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. That's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent attached. The substituent is a hydroxymethyl group (a CH2OH) attached to another cyclohexane ring. Also, there's a carbonyl group (aldehyde) attached somewhere. Wait, the name is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again.

1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main cyclohexane ring has a carbaldehyde group (CHO). The substituent on carbon 1 is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. Wait, the substituent is a methyl group connected to a cyclohexyl group and an OH group. So, it's like CH2- where the CH2 is attached to a cyclohexane (cyclohexyl) and an OH. So, structure-wise, the main ring has a CHO group, and at position 1, there's a CH2OH connected to another cyclohexane.

So, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynyl is a triple bond, so it's cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (like HCâ‰¡C- attached). 

I need to figure out the sequence of reactions to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target. Let's think about the steps involved in such a synthesis.

First, ethynylcyclohexane is an alkyne. To make a cyclohexane ring with some substituents, maybe we can add something to the triple bond. Alkyne chemistry often involves reactions like hydration, hydrogenation, or maybe some kind of addition.

Wait, the target has a cyclohexyl group attached. So maybe I need to introduce a ring expansion or some kind of cycloaddition. Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group can be functionalized in a way that allows forming rings.

Another approach: The target has two cyclohexane rings. The starting material is one. So, maybe we need a coupling or a ring-forming reaction.

Looking at the reagents in the options, I see NaNH2 and methyl chloride. That sounds like a deprotonation and alkylation. For example, using a strong base like NaNH2 to deprotonate a terminal alkyne to form an acetylide. Then, treating with methyl chloride would alkylate the acetylide, adding a methyl group.

So, step 1 in some options is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So, ethynylcyclohexane would react with NaNH2 to form the acetylide, then methyl chloride would add
