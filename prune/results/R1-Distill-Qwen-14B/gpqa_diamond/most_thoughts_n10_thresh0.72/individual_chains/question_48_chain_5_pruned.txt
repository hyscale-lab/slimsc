Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, a six-membered ring with a ketone group. So, structure-wise, it's a chair cyclohexane with a carbonyl group.

The first reaction is treatment with bromine (Br2). I think when a ketone like cyclohexanone reacts with bromine, it's probably undergoing some kind of addition. Wait, bromine adds to carbonyl groups? Or maybe it's a dienophile? Oh wait, no, cyclohexanone can't form a diene because it's a six-membered ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromination via the enol. But wait, waitâ€”another possibility: perhaps it's a halohydrin formation, but that usually requires a specific setup like with H2O and HBr. Alternatively, I think when ketones react with Br2 in a non-polar solvent like CCl4, it's a bromination via the enol. So the mechanism would involve the enol attacking Br2. The enol intermediate would have the double bond between the alpha and beta carbons, so adding Br across that.

Wait, but another thought: maybe it's a different reaction. Oh! I've heard that when a ketone is treated with bromine, it can form a dibromide via the acid-catalyzed addition, but that's under acidic conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromohydrin formation, which would add Br and OH across the carbonyl. But wait, the reaction conditions here just say bromine, so maybe it's a diaddition. Oh, wait another thought: the reaction of ketones with Br2 could be the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that's for introducing an oxygen. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. Cyclohexanone has the carbonyl group, which is attacked by Br2. I think in such a case, the Br2 adds to the carbonyl group, but where? Oh wait, ketones can undergo addition reactions, but in the presence of a base, it's more likely to form an enolate. But if it's just Br2, maybe it's adding to the carbony
