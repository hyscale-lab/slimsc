Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. So, the question involves several reactions, and I need to figure out what compound D is. Let's break it down.

First, the starting compound is A. The proton NMR of A shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, each signal corresponds to a set of equivalent protons. The triplet at 0.9 ppm with 6H suggests that these are probably methyl groups (since each CH3 has 3H, and 6H would be two CH3 groups). The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H could be a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2. Wait, maybe it's a -CH2CH2- group because the quartet would come from coupling with two neighboring protons. So, putting that together, I'm thinking that compound A might be something with two methyl groups and a central CH2CH2. 

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H: that's two separate methyl groups each as a triplet? Or maybe one group of six equivalent protons? Oh, but a triplet usually implies coupling with two neighboring protons. So, if it's two CH3 groups, each as a triplet, but how? Or maybe it's a group like (CH3)2CH- or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted ethyl group. Wait, no. Let me think about the splitting. If the 6H is a triplet, each CH3 is split into a triplet. That would mean each CH3 is adjacent to a CH2. Oh! So, maybe A is neopentane? Wait, no, neopentane is 2,2-dimethylpropane. Its NMR would have a singlet for the central CH and triplets maybe for the CH3 groups. Alternatively, perhaps it's isopentane or something else.

Wait, another approach: the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. A quartet usually arises when a proton has three neighboring protons. Wait, no, wait. Wait, a quartet (
