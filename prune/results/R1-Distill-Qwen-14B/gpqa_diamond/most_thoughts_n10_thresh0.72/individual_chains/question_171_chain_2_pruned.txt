Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand.

The question is about electrophilic substitution reactions of certain benzene derivatives with excess bromine. Each of the six compounds (1 to 6) undergoes this reaction, and we're supposed to determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. Basically, which compound gives the least para product and which gives the most, in order.

Electrophilic substitution reactions on aromatic rings are influenced by the substituents already present. The substituents can activate or deactivate the ring and can direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions, like ortho, meta, or para.

So, I need to consider each compound's substituent, determine its directing effect, and then figure out the major product distribution.

Let me list each compound:

1) C6H5-CH3 → toluene
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 → ethyl benzoate
3) C6H5-Cl → chlorobenzene
4) C6H5-NO2 → nitrobenzene
5) C6H5-C2H5 → ethylbenzene
6) C6H5-COOH → benzoic acid

Now, each substituent has an effect on the ring's reactivity and the direction of substitution.

Toluene (1): The methyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing substituent. That means when bromine adds, it will substitute mainly at ortho and para positions. Since it's a strong activating group, the para product should be a major part, but because it's ortho/para, the para might be the major isomer. Wait, no, in toluene, para is a major product because the methyl directs to ortho and para, but due to steric hindrance, para is more favored than ortho. So, the weight fraction of para would be higher than in other cases.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, for each substituent, we need to see how much of the product is para.

Ethyl benzoate (2): The substituent is a COOEt group. Let's see. The ester group is an electron-withdrawing group because of the carbonyl. So it's a meta-directing substituent. So the substitution would occur more at the meta position. But wait, ethyl benzoate is an ester, which is a deactivating group (since the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing), so it's meta-directing. So in the substitution, the major product would be the meta isomer. So the para isomer would be less than, say, an activating group. So the weight fraction of para would be low.

Chlorobenzene (3): Cl is a deactivating (due to electronegativity) but ortho/para-directing substituent. So substitution occurs at ortho and para. But since Cl deactivates the ring, the reaction is slower, but when it does happen, the substitution is ortho or para. Wait, for chlorobenzene, the para isomer is usually the major because steric factors make ortho less favored. So the para fraction is high, but not as high as toluene perhaps.

Nitrobenzene (4): Nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing substituent. So substitution occurs mainly at meta. So the para isomer would be the minor product here. So the weight fraction of para would be low, perhaps the lowest among some of the compounds.

Ethylbenzene (5): The substituent is an ethyl group. Like the methyl group, it's an activating, ortho/para-directing group. But ethyl is a stronger activating group than methyl? No, wait, methyl is a stronger activating group. Or is it the other way around? Wait, ethyl is a larger alkyl group, so perhaps it's more activating than methyl. Wait, no, all alkyl groups are similarly activating. But wait, the directing effect is the same—ortho/para. So when bromine adds, it'll go ortho and para. However, steric hindrance is a factor. For ethyl group, the ortho positions are more hindered than in toluene (methyl is smaller), so maybe the para isomer is more favored than in toluene? Hmm, not sure. Wait, in ethylbenzene, the bulky ethyl group would make the ortho positions less accessible, so para would be the major product. So the para fraction is high, similar to toluene but perhaps higher than toluene because ethyl is bulkier.

Benzoic acid (6): The substituent is a COOH group. Carboxylic acid is a strong electron-withdrawing group. It's deactivating and meta-directing. So substitution occurs mainly in meta positions. So the para isomer would be minor. But wait, benzoic acid is a strong deactivating group, so the substitution is more difficult. But the directing is meta, so the para isomer would be less than 50%, but how does it compare to other substituents?

Wait, let me think again. Let me list each substituent, their activating/deactivating nature, directing effects, and how that affects the para product.

1) CH3: activating, o/p-directing. So para is major. So high weight fraction of para.

2) COOEt: deactivating, meta-directing. Para is minor. So low weight fraction.

3) Cl: deactivating, o/p-directing. But since the ring is deactivating, the substitution is slower, but para
