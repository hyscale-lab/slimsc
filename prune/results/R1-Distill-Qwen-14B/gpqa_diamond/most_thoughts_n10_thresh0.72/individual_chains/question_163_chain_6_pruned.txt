Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution using a strong monobasic acid. I need to find two things: the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid required and the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D, each giving a pH and a volume.

First, I should probably break this down into parts. I think the first part involves calculating how much H+ ions are needed to dissolve Fe(OH)3. Then, using that, I can find the volume of acid needed. The second part is about finding the pH of the resulting solution after the reaction.

Let me start with the dissolution reaction. Fe(OH)3 is a weak base and will react with a strong acid like HCl. The reaction should be something like:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O

Wait, no, wait. Wait, Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, so it's a base. When it reacts with a strong acid, the OH- will react with H+ to form water. So the reaction is:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O

So each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+.

First, I need to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)3 are in 0.1 grams. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3:

Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, oxygen is 16, hydrogen 1. So:

Fe: 55.85
O: 3 * 16 = 48
H: 3 * 1 = 3
Total: 55.85 + 48 +3 = 106.85 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol, or 9.36e-4 mol.

Since each mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of H+, the moles of H+ needed are 3 * 9.36e-4 = 0.002808 mol.

But wait, wait. The acid is monobasic, so the concentration of H+ in the acid is 0.1 M, right? Because monobasic acid HCl would give 0.1 M H+.

So the volume of acid needed would be moles of H+ / concentration = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L, which is 28.08 cm³. Hmm, but looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04. But wait, the question says the total volume is 100 cm³, so perhaps I need to account for the dilution.

Wait, wait a second. The acid is being added to 100 cm³ of solution. So the total volume after adding the acid would be 100 cm³ plus the volume of acid used. But since the acid is being added to the solution, perhaps the H+ concentration after mixing is what matters. Alternatively, maybe the initial solution is 100 cm³, and the acid is added, so the total volume becomes more than 100.

Wait, the problem states that the total volume is 100 cm³. Oh, wait, maybe the 100 cm³ is the total volume after adding the acid. Or is it the initial solution? Wait, the question says "100 cm3
