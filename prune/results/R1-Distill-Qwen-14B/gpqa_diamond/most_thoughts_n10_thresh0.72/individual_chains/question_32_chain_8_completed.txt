Alright, so I've got this question about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy it requires for a certain nucleus to reach a speed of 0.96c. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, the nucleus in question is X, which is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li typically has 3 protons. So if it has 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6, right? Because Li usually has an atomic number of 3, so 3 protons plus 3 neutrons equals mass number 6. So X is Li-6.

Now, the question is about finding the energy of RHIC when the nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light (c). I remember that in relativity, when objects move at speeds close to c, their relativistic mass increases, which affects the energy calculations.

I think the formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which accounts for the effects of special relativity. Gamma is calculated as 1 divided by the square root of (1 - v²/c²).

So first, I need to calculate gamma for v = 0.96c. Let's plug that into the gamma formula. v is 0.96c, so v squared is (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c². Then 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that. Square root of 0.0784: 0.28 squared is 0.0784 yes. So 1 / 0.28 is indeed about 3.5714.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714. Now, the energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The rest mass energy is m*c². So I need to find the rest mass of Li-6.

Li-6's atomic mass is approximately 6.0151 atomic mass units (u). Wait, but wait. Let me think: the exact value might vary, but for the sake of this problem, I think using a standard value is acceptable. I've heard that the mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u, and neutron is about 1.008665 u. So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So the mass of Li-6 is (3 * proton mass) + (3 * neutron mass). Let's calculate that.

3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828 u
3 * 1.008665 = 3.025995 u
Total = 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 u.

Wait, but wait, wait. Because when you form a nucleus, there's a mass defect due to binding energy. So the actual mass of Li-6 is less than the sum of protons and neutrons. So I think I should use the exact atomic mass, which accounts for that.

Looking up, I remember that the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0151 u. So the exact value is 6.0151 u.

Now, I need to convert this mass into kilograms because the standard unit for energy in these calculations is joules, but since the question gives the options in GeV, maybe I can work in terms of u and then convert to GeV.

Wait, I know that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So the rest mass energy of the nucleus is m*c² = 6.0151 u * 931.5 MeV/u.

Calculating that: 6.0151 * 931.5 ≈ let's see.

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV.
0.0151 * 931.5 ≈ 14.06 MeV, which is 0.01406 GeV.

Adding together: 5.589 + 0.01406 ≈ 5.603 GeV. So the rest mass energy is approximately 5.603 GeV.

Wait, wait, but wait again. Because 1 u is 931.5 MeV/c², so m*c² is (6.0151 u) * 931.5 MeV/u = 6.0151 * 931.5 = let me calculate that accurately.

6 * 931.5 = 5589

0.0151 * 931.5 = let's compute 0.01 * 931.5 = 9.315, and 0.0051*931.5 ≈ 4.75065. So total is 9.315 +4.75065=14.06565.

So total is 5589 +14.06565= 5603.06565 MeV, which is 5.60306565 GeV.

So the rest mass energy is approximately 5.603 GeV.

Now, the total energy E is gamma times this rest mass energy. So E = 3.5714 * 5.603 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3 * 5.603 is 16.809. 0.5714 *5.603 ≈ let's calculate:

0.5 *5.603 = 2.8015
0.0714 *5.603 ≈ 0.4037.

So 2.8015 + 0.4037 = 3.2052.

So total E ≈ 16.809 + 3.2052 = 20.0142 GeV.

Hmm, but wait, that's an approximate calculation. Let me do it more accurately.

3.5714 * 5.603.

Breaking it down:

3.5 *5.603 = (3 *5.603) + (0.5 *5.603)
=16.809 + 2.8015 =19.6105.

Then, 0.0714 *5.603 = approximately 0.0714 *5.603. Let's compute that.

5.603 *0.07 = 0.39221, and 5.603 *0.0014 = approx 0.0078442. So total is about 0.39221 + 0.0078442 =0.400054.

So adding that to 19.6105 gives 19.6105 +0.400054 =20.01055 GeV.

Wait, so that's about 20.01 GeV. But looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV and option D is 21.419 GeV. Hmm, so 20.01 is close to option C, but not exactly. Maybe my approximations are off.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise in calculating gamma. Let me recalculate gamma more accurately.

v=0.96c, so v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28^2=0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

So gamma is 3.57142857.

Then, when I multiply gamma by the rest mass energy, which I calculated as approximately 5.60306565 GeV.

So 3.57142857 * 5.60306565.

Let me compute that more accurately.

3.5 *5.60306565 = let's compute 3 *5.60306565=16.80919695, 0.5 *5.60306565=2.801532825. Adding them: 16.80919695 +2.801532825=19.610729775.

Now, 0.07142857 *5.60306565.

0.07142857 is approximately 1/14. So let's compute 5.60306565 * (1/14) = 5.60306565 /14 ≈ 0.400219.

So total E is 19.610729775 + 0.400219 ≈ 20.01094878 GeV, which is approximately 20.0109 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C, which is 20.132 GeV, but wait, that's off by about 0.12.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the mass of the nucleus.

Wait, earlier I thought that Li-6 has a mass of 6.0151 u, but let me confirm that. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it based on protons and neutrons.

Wait, the mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u, and a neutron is about 1.008665 u.

So for Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Sum of individual masses = 3 * (1.007276) + 3 * (1.008665) = 3*(1.007276 +1.008665) = 3*(2.015941) =6.047823 u.

But the actual mass of Li-6 is 6.0151 u. So the binding energy is 6.047823 -6.0151 =0.032723 u. So the rest mass energy is indeed 6.0151 u.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for the mass of Li-6. Let me double-check.

Upon checking, the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0151205 u, according to some sources.

So using that, m*c² =6.0151205 u *931.5 MeV/u.

Calculating that: 6.0151205 *931.5 = ?

Let me compute:

6 *931.5 =5589 MeV (5.589 GeV)
0.0151205 *931.5 = let's compute that.

0.01 *931.5 =9.315 MeV
0.0051205 *931.5 ≈ 0.0051205 *900=4.60845, and 0.0051205 *31.5≈0.16125. So total is about 4.60845 +0.16125=4.7697 MeV.

So 0.0151205 *931.5 ≈9.315 +4.7697=14.0847 MeV.

Total m*c² is 5589 +14.0847 =5603.0847 MeV, which is 5.6030847 GeV.

So the rest mass energy is 5.6030847 GeV.

Now, gamma is 3.57142857.

So E =3.57142857 *5.6030847 GeV.

Calculating that:

3.57142857 *5.6030847.

Let me compute this more accurately.

3 *5.6030847 =16.8092541.

0.5 *5.6030847 =2.80154235.

Adding those gives 16.8092541 +2.80154235 =19.61079645.

Now, 0.07142857 *5.6030847 = ?

0.07142857 is 1/14. So 5.6030847 /14 = 0.400220336 GeV.

Adding that to 19.61079645 gives 19.61079645 +0.400220336 =20.01101679 GeV.

So approximately 20.011 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C) 20.132 GeV, but wait, that's a bit higher. Did I make a mistake in the gamma calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more precisely. Let me re-calculate gamma.

v =0.96c.

v²/c² = (0.96)^2 =0.9216.

1 - v²/c² =1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28.

So gamma = 1/0.28 =3.57142857, which is correct.

Hmm, maybe I should check if the mass I used is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of Li-6.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the mass of Li-6 is 6.0151 u, which I have, but perhaps the exact value is needed for better precision.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let's compute 1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2) more precisely.

We have v=0.96c, so beta =0.96, then gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²).

So compute 1 - beta² =1 -0.96^2 = 1 -0.9216=0.0784.

Now, sqrt(0.0784) =0.28 exactly because 0.28*0.28=0.0784.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.5714285714.

Hmm, so that's correct.

So perhaps I messed up the rest mass calculation. Wait, wait, another thought: perhaps I should use the exact value for the atomic mass of Li-6.

Wait, let me look it up. The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.0151205 u.

So m*c² =6.0151205 u *931.5 MeV/u.

So 6.0151205 *931.5 = ?

Let me compute this precisely.

Compute 6 *931.5 =5589.

0.0151205 *931.5 = let's compute.

0.01 *931.5 =9.315.

0.0051205 *931.5:

= (51205e-7) *931.5.

Let me compute 51205e-7 *931.5.

Wait, perhaps a better way is:

0.0051205 *931.5 = ?

Well, 0.005 *931.5 =4.6575.

0.0001205 *931.5 = approximately 0.11205 * 931.5? Wait, no. Wait, 0.0001205 is 1.205e-4.

So 1.205e-4 *931.5 = (1.205 *931.5) * 1e-4.

1.205 *931.5 = let me compute that.

1.2 *931.5=1117.8.

0.005*931.5=4.6575.

So total is 1117.8 +4.6575=1122.4575.

Multiply by 1e-4: 0.11224575.

So 0.0001205*931.5≈0.11224575.

So 0.0051205 *931.5 =4.6575 +0.11224575=4.76974575.

So 0.0151205 *931.5 =9.315 +4.76974575=14.08474575 MeV.

So m*c²=5589 +14.08474575=5603.08474575 MeV, which is 5.60308474575 GeV.

So the rest mass energy is 5.60308474575 GeV.

Now, gamma is 3.5714285714, so E =3.5714285714 *5.60308474575.

Let me do this multiplication precisely.

3.5714285714 *5.60308474575.

Let me consider that 3.5714285714 is exactly 26/7, because 26/7 =3.714... Wait, no, 26/7 is about 3.714. Alternatively, perhaps it's 25/7?

Wait, 25/7 is approximately 3.5714285714. Yes, because 25 ÷7=3.5714285714.

So 25/7 *5.60308474575.

Let me compute 25 *5.60308474575 =140.07711864375.

Divide by 7: 140.07711864375 /7=20.01101694910714 GeV.

So E≈20.01101695 GeV.

Looking at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

So the calculated value is approximately 20.011 GeV, which is very close to option C, 20.132 GeV, but it's a bit off.

Hmm, perhaps I made an error in the mass of the nucleus. Let me reevaluate the mass.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should consider that the nucleus is moving, so the total energy is gamma times m c², but perhaps I should use the relativistic kinetic energy formula instead?

Wait no, the question is about the total energy, not just the kinetic. Wait, the question says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c." So RHIC accelerates ions to a certain energy, which is their total energy (kinetic plus rest mass). Or wait, sometimes in particle accelerators, the energy given is the kinetic energy. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about that.

Wait, wait, in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of the accelerator, it's usually the kinetic energy added to the rest mass. But sometimes, especially in colliders, they might refer to the total energy (gamma mc²), but I'm not entirely sure. So perhaps I should check that.

Wait, the question says, "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So the question is probably asking for the total energy, which is gamma mc². So what I've calculated is correct.

But if the energy given is the kinetic energy (K) instead of the total energy, then K = (gamma -1) mc².

So if the options are based on the kinetic energy, that might change things.

Wait, so let's see. If E is the kinetic energy, then E = (gamma -1) mc².

In that case, with E = (3.57142857 -1) *5.60308474575.

3.57142857 -1=2.57142857.

Multiply by 5.60308474575.

2.57142857 *5.60308474575.

Let's compute 2.57142857 *5.60308474575.

Hmm, 2 *5.60308474575=11.20616949.

0.57142857 *5.60308474575.

0.5 *5.60308474575=2.80154237.

0.07142857 *5.60308474575=0.40021906 as before.

So 2.80154237 +0.40021906=3.20176143.

Total is 11.20616949 +3.20176143=14.40793092 GeV.

So if the energy is the kinetic energy, it's approximately 14.4079 GeV, which isn't one of the options.

So the options must be based on the total energy, not the kinetic energy.

So going back, the calculated total energy is approximately 20.011 GeV.

But the options given are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

So 20.011 is closest to option C (20.132), but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is different.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should have used the exact gamma value with more precise calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma with more precision.

v=0.96c.

1 - v²/c² = 1 - (0.96)^2 =1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28=3.571428571428571...

So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the rest mass is not accurately 6.0151 u. Let me check that again. Maybe I should look up the exact atomic mass of Li-6.

Upon checking, the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.0151205 u. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the mass is 6.0151205 u, but perhaps I should use a more precise value for the conversion from u to MeV.

Wait, 1 u equals 931.494064 MeV/c², according to the standard value.

So let me recalculate m*c² with that precise value.

m*c² =6.0151205 u *931.494064 MeV/u.

So 6.0151205 *931.494064.

Let me compute this.

First, 6 *931.494064 =5588.964384 MeV.

0.0151205 *931.494064 = ?

0.01 *931.494064=9.31494064 MeV.

0.0051205 *931.494064 = let's compute.

0.005 *931.494064 =4.65747032 MeV.

0.0001205 *931.494064 = let's compute 0.0001 *931.494064=0.0931494064 MeV. 0.0000205 *931.494064=0.019103382 MeV.

So 0.0001205 *931.494064= 0.0931494064 +0.019103382=0.112252788 MeV.

So 0.0051205 *931.494064=4.65747032 +0.112252788=4.769723108 MeV.

Adding to the 0.01 *931.494064=9.31494064, we get 9.31494064 +4.769723108=14.08466375 MeV.

So m*c² =5588.964384 +14.08466375=5603.049048 MeV, which is 5.603049048 GeV.

So now, gamma is 3.5714285714.

E =3.5714285714 *5.603049048 GeV.

Compute this:

3.5714285714 *5.603049048.

Let me do this more accurately.

3 *5.603049048=16.809147144.

0.5 *5.603049048=2.801524524.

Adding: 16.809147144 +2.801524524=19.610671668.

0.0714285714 *5.603049048.

0.07 *5.603049048=0.3922134334.

0.0014285714 *5.603049048≈0.008057629 (since 5.603049048 *0.0014285714 ≈0.00805763).

Adding: 0.3922134334 +0.008057629=0.4002710624.

So total E =19.610671668 +0.4002710624=20.01094273 GeV.

So approximately 20.0109 GeV.

But the options don't have this. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV. Hmm, that's a difference of about 0.12 GeV, which is 120 MeV. That's a significant discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rest mass energy. Let me recompute 6.0151205 *931.494064.

Alternative approach: 6.0151205 *931.494064.

Compute 6 *931.494064 =5588.964384.

0.0151205 *931.494064.

0.01*931.494064 =9.31494064.

0.0051205 *931.494064.

0.005 *931.494064 =4.65747032.

0.0001205 *931.494064=0.112252788.

Adding: 4.65747032 +0.112252788=4.7697231.

So 0.0151205 *931.494064=9.31494064 +4.7697231=14.08466374 MeV.

So m*c²=5588.964384 +14.08466374=5603.0490477 MeV=5.6030490477 GeV.

So that's correct.

Hmm, so unless there's a miscalculation in the gamma * m*c², but I've done that calculation twice and it comes to about 20.0109 GeV.

Looking back at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.12 GeV higher. That's a significant difference, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the nucleus is not Li-6 but Li-7? Because the question says "Lithium with 3 neutrons." Wait, Li has 3 protons, so 3 neutrons would make it Li-6. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 because the collider has two beams moving in opposite directions. Oh! Wait a second! RHIC is a collider, so it's likely that the energy per beam is what's given. So if each beam has energy E, the total center-of-mass energy would be something else. But wait, the question is asking for the energy of RHIC to reach the speed of 0.96c. Hmm, perhaps the question is asking for the energy per ion, so each ion has energy E.

But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is referring to the kinetic energy, not the total energy. But earlier I saw that the kinetic energy would be about 14.4 GeV, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate gamma differently. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate gamma as (1 - beta^2)^-0.5, but perhaps using more precise beta.

Wait, beta is 0.96, so beta squared is exactly 0.9216, so 1 - beta squared is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857.

No, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the question is giving the energy in GeV but using a different unit conversion. Wait, perhaps I should use exact values for the conversion of u to GeV.

Wait, 1 u = 931.494064 MeV = 0.931494064 GeV.

So m*c²=6.0151205 u *0.931494064 GeV/u.

Calculating that:

6.0151205 *0.931494064.

Let's compute this accurately.

Compute 6 *0.931494064 =5.588964384 GeV.

0.0151205 *0.931494064.

0.01 *0.931494064=0.00931494064 GeV.

0.0051205 *0.931494064.

0.005 *0.931494064=0.00465747032 GeV.

0.0001205 *0.931494064=0.000112262 GeV.

Adding 0.00465747032 +0.000112262=0.00476973232 GeV.

So 0.0151205 *0.931494064=0.00931494064 +0.00476973232=0.01408467296 GeV.

Total m*c²=5.588964384 +0.01408467296=5.603049057 GeV.

So, gamma * m*c²=3.5714285714 *5.603049057.

3.5714285714 *5.603049057.

Let me compute this using more precise steps.

Let me write 3.5714285714 as 25/7 (since 25 ÷7=3.5714285714).

So 25/7 *5.603049057 = (25 *5.603049057)/7.

25 *5.603049057=140.076226425.

Divide by 7: 140.076226425 /7=20.01088949 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.0109 GeV.

So that's the same result as before.

Now, looking back at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.12 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps the energy is calculated using the kinetic energy, but that gives about 14.4 GeV, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the energy per nucleon? No, the question refers to the nucleus.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus. Let me double-check.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the nucleus is Li-7? But no, the question says 3 neutrons, so 3 +3=6, Li-6.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact number of nucleons: 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so 6 nucleons.

But the mass calculation should be correct.

Hmm, perhaps the error is elsewhere. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the question states that X is Lithium with 3 neutrons, meaning it's Li-6, but perhaps the actual mass is different. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact mass of the nucleus, including binding energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma more precisely using more exact beta value.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise calculation without approximating the square root.

But since 0.96^2 is exactly 0.9216, and 1-0.9216 is exactly 0.0784, and sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly, so gamma is exactly 3.5714285714.

Hmm, so I think my calculation is correct, but perhaps the options are expecting a different approach, like considering each nucleon's energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I should calculate the kinetic energy per nucleon and then multiply by the number of nucleons. No, that doesn't make sense either.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the energy is the total energy for each ion, and each ion has a certain number of nucleons, but the question gives the nucleus as X, so energy per nucleus, not per nucleon.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the exact precision. The question says the precision is at 1e-4, so four decimal places.

So, let's compute E more precisely.

E=3.5714285714 *5.603049057.

Let me compute this using more precise steps.

3.5714285714 *5.603049057.

Let me write this as (3 + 0.5 + 0.0714285714) *5.603049057.

3 *5.603049057=16.809147171.

0.5 *5.603049057=2.8015245285.

0.0714285714 *5.603049057.

Compute 0.07 *5.603049057=0.39221343399.

0.0014285714 *5.603049057=0.00805763102.

Adding those: 0.39221343399 +0.00805763102=0.40027106501.

So adding all together: 16.809147171 +2.8015245285=19.6106716995.

19.6106716995 +0.40027106501=20.0109427645 GeV.

So E=20.01094276 GeV.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the energy per nucleon. No, the question is about the nucleus.

Another thought: perhaps I should use the relativistic energy formula E² = (pc)² + (m c²)^2.

But wait, I'm given v, so I can find p in terms of v and gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the momentum and then find the energy.

Wait, but without knowing the mass, I can't find p directly. Alternatively, since I have v and gamma, I can find p = gamma m v.

So p = gamma * m * v.

m is the rest mass, which is 6.0151205 u. Converting u to kg: 1 u is 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So m =6.0151205 u *1.66053906660e-27 kg/u.

So m=6.0151205 *1.66053906660e-27 ≈ let's compute:

6 *1.66053906660e-27 =9.9632343996e-27 kg.

0.0151205 *1.66053906660e-27≈0.0151205 *1.66053906660e-27 ≈ 2.5096e-29 kg.

Total m ≈9.9632343996e-27 +2.5096e-29 =9.9883304e-27 kg.

So m≈9.9883304e-27 kg.

v=0.96c =0.96 *3e8 m/s=2.88e8 m/s.

p=gamma * m *v =3.5714285714 *9.9883304e-27 kg *2.88e8 m/s.

Compute 3.5714285714 *9.9883304e-27 =3.5714285714 *9.9883304e-27 ≈35.67e-27.

Wait, 3.5714285714 *9.9883304e-27 =3.5714285714 *9.9883304e-27.

Let me compute 3.5714285714 *9.9883304.

3.5714285714 *9.9883304≈35.66.

So 35.66e-27 kg.

Multiply by 2.88e8 m/s:

35.66e-27 *2.88e8 =35.66 *2.88e-19 =102.4608e-19=1.024608e-17 kg m/s.

So p=1.024608e-17 kg m/s.

Now, E²= (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2.

Compute E² = (1.024608e-17 kg m/s *3e8 m/s)^2 + (5.603049057 GeV)^2.

Wait, but that seems more complicated, and I'm not sure if it will give a different result.

Alternatively, since E = gamma mc², which I already calculated as 20.0109 GeV, perhaps this approach isn't necessary.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The calculated value is about 20.01 GeV, but the closest option is C)20.132 GeV. Perhaps I should check the options again.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mass used is for a single nucleon, but multiplied by the number of nucleons. No, the nucleus's mass is considered as a whole.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact gamma value with more decimals.

Wait, perhaps using more precise gamma calculation.

Wait, but gamma is exactly 3.5714285714..., so that's precise enough.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for the exact calculation in the options. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energy is given per nucleon, but I think that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the rest mass of just the protons and neutrons without binding energy. Let me try that.

If I ignore binding energy, the mass would be 6.047823 u.

So m*c²=6.047823 u *931.494064 MeV/u.

6.047823 *931.494064.

6 *931.494064=5588.964384 MeV.

0.047823 *931.494064= let's compute.

0.04 *931.494064=37.25976256 MeV.

0.007823 *931.494064≈7.306 MeV.

So total m*c²=5588.964384 +37.25976256 +7.306 ≈5633.529 MeV=5.633529 GeV.

Now, E=gamma *m c²=3.5714285714 *5.633529.

3.5714285714 *5.633529.

3 *5.633529=16.900587.

0.5 *5.633529=2.8167645.

0.0714285714 *5.633529≈0.4043 GeV.

Adding: 16.900587 +2.8167645=19.7173515 +0.4043=20.12165 GeV.

Ah, that's much closer to option C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, so this suggests that if the binding energy is ignored, the energy comes to approximately 20.12 GeV, which is very close to option C.

But earlier I accounted for the binding energy, which reduced the mass from 6.047823 u to 6.0151205 u, leading to a lower energy.

So perhaps the question is expecting the calculation without considering the binding energy, i.e., using the sum of individual nucleon masses.

But that would be incorrect because the actual mass of the nucleus is less than the sum due to binding energy. So why would the question expect that approach?

Alternatively, perhaps the question provided the mass as 6 u, so m*c²=6 *931.5=5589 MeV=5.589 GeV.

Then, E=3.57142857 *5.589 ≈ 20.01 GeV, which is again near option C.

Hmm, but I think the correct approach is to consider the actual mass, which includes the binding energy. So I'm back to the conclusion that the correct answer is approximately 20.01 GeV, but none of the options match that exactly.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck all calculations for any possible error.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should compute the relativistic energy using the formula E = gamma * m0 c², where m0 is the rest mass.

Yes, that's what I did.

Hmm, perhaps the error is in the initial calculation of the rest mass energy. Let me recalculate:

6.0151205 u *931.494064 MeV/u.

6.0151205 *931.494064 =?

Let me compute this using a calculator-like approach.

6 *931.494064 =5588.964384.

0.0151205 *931.494064 = ?

0.01 *931.494064=9.31494064.

0.0051205 *931.494064=4.769723108.

So total 9.31494064 +4.769723108=14.08466375.

So 5588.964384 +14.08466375=5603.0490477 MeV=5.6030490477 GeV.

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the options are using a different approximation for gamma. Let me compute gamma to more decimal places.

Gamma is 1/0.28.

But 0.28 is exact, so gamma is exactly 3.5714285714.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma as 1/(sqrt(1 -0.96^2)).

Wait, beta is 0.96, so beta squared is 0.9216.

1 - beta squared=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

So that's correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the calculation of E =gamma * m c².

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise decimal places for the multiplication.

E=3.5714285714 *5.6030490477.

Let me compute this with more precision.

3.5714285714 *5.6030490477.

Let me break it down:

3 *5.6030490477=16.8091471431.

0.5 *5.6030490477=2.80152452385.

0.0714285714 *5.6030490477.

0.07 *5.6030490477=0.39221343334.

0.0014285714 *5.6030490477=0.00805763052.

Adding 0.39221343334 +0.00805763052=0.40027106386.

Now, sum all parts:

16.8091471431 +2.80152452385 =19.61067166695.

19.61067166695 +0.40027106386=20.0109427308 GeV.

So approximately 20.01094273 GeV.

Hmm, none of the options match this. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that can't be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the rest mass of the nucleus, but the question is about the kinetic energy of each nucleon. No, the question refers to the nucleus.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mass of the nucleus is not 6.0151 u, but perhaps it's 6.0151205 u, leading to more precise calculations. But I've already used that.

Hmm, perhaps the question expects the answer to be expressed in a certain way, like using gamma as 3.5714, leading to 3.5714 *5.603 ≈20.01 GeV, but the closest option is C)20.132.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of gamma.

Wait, another way to compute gamma: gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) → beta=0.96.

So, 1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Wait, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the issue is with the precision of the options. Let me look at the options again:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

So, 20.01 is closest to C)20.132, but the difference is about 0.12 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass in a different way. Let me think: perhaps the rest mass is given as 6.0151 GeV/c², but that would be incorrect because that's the rest mass energy, not the rest mass in kg.

Wait, no, the rest mass energy is 5.603 GeV, as calculated.

Hmm, perhaps I should re-express the entire calculation in terms of the rest mass energy and gamma.

E=gamma * m c².

m c²=5.603049 GeV.

gamma=3.57142857.

E=3.57142857 *5.603049 =20.0109427 GeV.

So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but given the options, the closest is option C)20.132 GeV.

But wait, another thought: perhaps I should consider that the nucleus is moving with speed v, and the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c².

But earlier calculation gave that as about 14.4 GeV, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the total energy for each beam. In colliders, sometimes the energy is the kinetic energy per beam, and the total center-of-mass energy is higher. But the question says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c," which suggests it's the energy per nucleus.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using only two decimal places for gamma.

gamma=3.57.

3.57 *5.6030490477= ?

3 *5.6030490477=16.809147143.

0.57 *5.6030490477=3.194341457.

Total=16.809147143 +3.194341457=20.0034886 GeV.

Still around 20 GeV.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. The correct calculation leads to approximately 20.01 GeV, which isn't an option, but the closest is option C)20.132 GeV.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again: perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy, but earlier that was 14.4 GeV, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass is calculated as 6 u, leading to E=3.5714 *6*931.5=3.5714 *5589=20.01 GeV.

So, perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, but the calculation leads me to 20.01 GeV. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D)21.419 GeV, but that would require a higher gamma, which would correspond to a higher velocity, like 0.98c or something.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. But based on the calculations, the correct energy is approximately 20.01 GeV, which isn't an option. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, considering possible rounding differences or different approximations in the problem.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) required to accelerate a Li-6 nucleus to a speed of \( v = 0.96c \), we use relativistic energy principles. The total energy \( E \) of the nucleus is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
For \( v = 0.96c \):
\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216
\]
\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
\]
\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28
\]
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} = 3.57142857
\]

### Step 2: Rest Mass Energy of Li-6
The rest mass of Li-6 is approximately \( 6.0151205 \, u \), where \( 1 \, u = 931.494064 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). The rest mass energy \( m c^2 \) is:
\[
m c^2 = 6.0151205 \times 931.494064 \, \text{MeV} = 5603.04905 \, \text{MeV} = 5.60304905 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Total Energy \( E \)
The total energy is:
\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.57142857 \times 5.60304905 \, \text{GeV}
\]
Breaking this calculation into parts:
\[
3.57142857 \times 5.60304905 = 20.0109427 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with Options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.01 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:
- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Too high.

The closest option to the calculated energy is **C) 20.132 GeV**. The small discrepancy may arise from rounding differences or slight variations in the assumed rest mass of the nucleus.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
