Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is all about.

The question talks about five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. So, Y is some element that forms five different compounds with fluorine. Hmm, binary compounds are ones where two elements combine, so YF, YF2, YF3, YF4, YF5 maybe? Or perhaps other combinations, but knowing that there are five, maybe.

The substances are labeled A1, A2, A3, A4, A5. Let me parse the information given.

First, A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, around 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. The oF of A2 is 31.96%. Wait, oF is probably the oxidation state or maybe the formula? Oh wait, the oF symbol often stands for the oxidation state, or maybe it's the formula? Hmm, not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the mole fraction or something else. Wait, the context is decomposition into A2 and F2. So when A1 decomposes, it gives A2 and fluorine gas. So the decomposition reaction would be something like A1 → A2 + F2.

Then it says that A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so being oxidized by A1 suggests that A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent, so maybe A1 is a fluorine compound that's a strong oxidizer.

A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y. So when Y reacts with fluorine, you get A3. So A3 is probably the most common fluorination product of Y, maybe YF3 or something else. Wait, but Y is an element that has five binary fluorides, so it's likely a non-metal or metal that can form multiple fluorides.

Then, when Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4, A5 is obtained. A5 then decomposes in water to form two substances. The question is about the molecular weight of A4.

Hmm, so I need to figure out what Y is, then determine what each compound is, and from there find the molecular weight of A4.

Let me start by thinking about Y. It forms five binary fluorides. Let's list elements that form multiple fluorides. For example, sulfur can form SF4, SF6, etc., but I'm not sure if that's five. Alternatively, chlorine forms ClF, ClF3, ClF5, but that's maybe three. Alternatively, phosphorus can form PF3, PF5, but that's two. Wait, perhaps it's something else.

Wait, another approach: consider that fluorine's oxidation states in the compounds might vary. For example, if Y is oxygen, but that's unlikely. Or maybe Y is a halogen. Alternatively, perhaps Y is another element that can form multiple fluorides, such as chlorine. Wait,
