Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the minimum uncertainty in the energy of an electron based on the uncertainty in its position. 

Alright, let me recall what I know. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that there's a limit to how precisely we can know both the position and momentum of a particle simultaneously. The formula I remember is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. 

Wait, but the problem is about energy uncertainty. Oh right, because the uncertainty in energy relates to the uncertainty in momentum since energy is related to momentum. Specifically, the kinetic energy for a non-relativistic particle is (p²)/(2m), where p is momentum and m is mass. 

So, to find the uncertainty in energy ΔE, I need to relate Δp to ΔE. Let's see. The kinetic energy E is p²/(2m), so if we take the derivative of E with respect to p, that gives dE/dp = p/m. But since we're dealing with uncertainties, maybe I should use the differential approximation: ΔE ≈ (dE/dp) * Δp. So ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp. 

Wait, but I don't know p exactly, but I know the speed v of the electron. Oh, because p = m*v. So substituting p into the equation for ΔE, I get ΔE ≈ (m*v / m) * Δp = v * Δp. Oh wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. 

Wait, wait. Let's get back. The energy depends on p squared, so the uncertainty in energy would be more related to the square of the uncertainty in p. Hmm, maybe I should express ΔE in terms of Δp. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the uncertainty principle to find Δp and then relate that to the uncertainty in energy. Let me outline the steps.

Step 1: Use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle to find the minimum uncertainty in momentum, Δp. The principle says Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/
