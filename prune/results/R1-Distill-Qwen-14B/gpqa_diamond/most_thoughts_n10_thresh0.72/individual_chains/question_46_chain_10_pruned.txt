Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read it again. The question says that racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there, excluding ethene? The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm. I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when you break and reform carbon-carbon double bonds, swapping the ends. Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, probably Ruthenium-based. It's good for ring-closing metathesis and also for cross metathesis, I think.

So the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw the structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So the structure is CH₂=CHCH(CH₂CH₂?) Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pentane has five carbons. So numbering from the double bond, which is at position 1.

So the structure would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But it's 3-methyl, so on carbon 3, which is the third carbon, so the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2? No, wait, maybe I should write it as CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-... No, wait, wait.

Wait, the formula for pent-1-ene is C5H10. If it's 3-methylpent-1-ene, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂? No, wait, that's four carbons only. Wait, maybe I should number it properly.

Pentene is five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be:

Carbon 1: CH₂=
Carbon 2: CH-
Carbon 3: CH(CH3)
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: CH3.

Wait, no, perhaps it's CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that would make it 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is a methyl group on C3.

Wait, but that would make the
