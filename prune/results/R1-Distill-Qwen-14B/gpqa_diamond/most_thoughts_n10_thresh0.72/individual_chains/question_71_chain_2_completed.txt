Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors, like the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. Oh wait, the question says all planets have the same albedo, so that part cancels out.

The planets are in orbital resonance, which probably means their orbital periods are in a specific ratio. The given periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has the shortest period, and each subsequent planet has a longer one following that ratio. 

I need to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)), where T_star is the star's effective temperature, R is the star's radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance. But wait, another version I remember is T = T_star * sqrt( (L/(16πσ)) )^(1/4) ) / (2a)^(1/2) ), but maybe it's easier to think in terms of the inverse square law for radiation. Alternatively, since the planets are around the same star, perhaps their equilibrium temperatures relate to the square root of the inverse of their semi-major axes. Because the equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * (L / (16 π σ a² ))^(1/4 ), but for stars with the same L and σ, it's proportional to (1/a²)^(1/4) = 1/sqrt(a). So T is inversely proportional to the square root of a.

So the key here is to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of Planet_4 and Planet_2. Since the periods are in a ratio, I can use Kepler's third law. Kepler's law says that P² is proportional to a³ (assuming same star mass). So P² is proportional to a³, which means a is proportional to P^(2/3).

Let me write down the periods. Let's denote P1 as the period of Planet_1, so the periods are:

Planet_1: P1

Planet_2: 2 P1

Planet_3: 2.5 P1

Planet_4: 3.5 P1

Planet_5: 5 P1

So for Planet_2, P2 = 2 P1. For Planet_4, P4 = 3.5 P1.

Since a is proportional to P^(2/3), the ratio a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3).

Compute P4/P2: 3.5 / 2 = 1.75.

So (1.75)^(2/3). Hmm, I need to compute that. Let's see, 1.75 is 7/4, so 7/4 = 1.75.

Wait, let me think numerically. Let's compute 1.75^(2/3). Alternatively, take natural logs: ln(1.75) ≈ 0.5596. Multiply by 2/3: ~0.373. Then exponentiate: e^0.373 ≈ 1.452.

So a4/a2 ≈ 1.452.

But equilibrium temperature T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), so T ∝ 1/sqrt(a). So T4 / T2 = (sqrt(a2)/sqrt(a4)) ) = sqrt( a2 / a4 ).

Wait, let me clarify: T = T_0 * (1 / sqrt(a)), where T_0 is a constant based on the star. So T4 = T0 / sqrt(a4), T2 = T0 / sqrt(a2). So the ratio T4/T2 = sqrt(a2) / sqrt(a4) = sqrt( a2 / a4 ).

Since a4/a2 ≈ 1.452, a2/a4 ≈ 1 / 1.452 ≈ 0.688.

Taking the square root of 0.688: sqrt(0.688) ≈ 0.829.

Wait, but wait, let me recheck the math. Because a4 = a2 * (3.5/2)^(2/3).

Wait, P4 is 3.5 P1, P2 is 2 P1. So (P4/P2) = 3.5/2 = 1.75. So a4 = a2 * (1.75)^(2/3).

So a4 = a2 * (1.75)^(2/3) ≈ a2 * 1.452. So a4 is about 1.452 times a2.

So the ratio a4/a2 is 1.452, so a2/a4 is 1/1.452 ≈ 0.688.

Then sqrt(0.688) ≈ 0.829. So T4 / T2 ≈ 0.829. So the ratio is approximately 0.83. Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83.

Wait, but let me check if I did the exponents correctly. Because Kepler's third law is P² ∝ a³ => a = (P²)^(1/3) = P^(2/3). So the ratio a4/a2 is ( (P4/P2) )^(2/3) ).

Which is (3.5/2)^(2/3) = (1.75)^(2/3). Let me compute that more accurately.

1.75 is 7/4. So (7/4)^(2/3). Let me calculate it numerically.

Take 1.75 to the power of 2/3. Let me think about it as e^( (2/3) * ln(1.75) ). ln(1.75) ≈ 0.5596. Multiply by 2/3: ≈ 0.373. e^0.373 ≈ 1.452. So that's correct.

So a4/a2 ≈ 1.452. So the ratio of their distances is 1.452:1.

So the ratio of their temperatures will be sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt(1/1.452) ≈ sqrt(0.688) ≈ 0.829. So approximately 0.83.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83, so that would be the answer.


To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the fact that equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance \( a \), i.e., \( T \propto 1/\sqrt{a} \). The orbital periods of the planets are given in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, and the planets are in orbital resonance. 

Using Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto a^3 \), the semi-major axis \( a \) is proportional to \( P^{2/3} \). Let \( P_1 \) be the orbital period of Planet_1. Then:

- Planet_2 has \( P_2 = 2P_1 \),
- Planet_4 has \( P_4 = 3.5P_1 \).

The ratio of their semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = \left(\frac{P_4}{P_2}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{3.5}{2}\right)^{2/3} = (1.75)^{2/3}.
\]

Calculating \( (1.75)^{2/3} \), we find:

\[
\ln(1.75) \approx 0.5596, \quad \frac{2}{3} \cdot \ln(1.75) \approx 0.373, \quad e^{0.373} \approx 1.452.
\]

Thus, \( a_4/a_2 \approx 1.452 \). Since equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to \( \sqrt{a} \), the ratio of temperatures is:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{1.452}} \approx \sqrt{0.688} \approx 0.829.
\]

This value is approximately \( 0.83 \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
