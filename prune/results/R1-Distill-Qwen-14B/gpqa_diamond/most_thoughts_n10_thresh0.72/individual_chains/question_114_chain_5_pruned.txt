Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question involves two reactions, and I need to pick the correct reagents from the given options. Let me break it down.

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A â†’ 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.
Hmm, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. I remember that ketones react with certain reagents. Oh wait, sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a nucleophile. So, maybe this is a nucleophilic addition reaction. But wait, ketones typically don't undergo nucleophilic substitution; they usually do nucleophilic addition followed by something else. Oh right, in the presence of an acid catalyst, maybe?

Wait, when a ketone reacts with CN- (cyanide ion), it's a nucleophilic addition. The mechanism would be the ketone getting protonated, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. Then the cyanide attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to a tetrahedral intermediate. Then, water or another proton source would help eliminate the proton and form the nitrile.

Wait, but wait, in the product, it's 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or maybe (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Let me think. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Or wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be CH(CN)(OH)(CH2CH3)? Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon, so the product would have the CN attached there. Then, after some steps, perhaps elimination. Wait, but the product is a nitrile and a hydroxyl group. Oh, wait, maybe it's a ketone to a cyanohydrin? Oh right, cyanohydrin formation. So when a ketone reacts with CN- in the presence of an acid catalyst, it forms a cyanohydrin. The cyanoh
