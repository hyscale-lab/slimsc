Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about an electron and a positron annihilating each other, producing two photons. The problem gives me some information about their Lorentz factors and the direction of the photons after the collision. I need to find the angle between the two photons.

First, let me try to visualize what's happening. An electron is moving from the left along the horizontal axis with a Lorentz factor (gamma) of 4. A positron is moving from the right along the same axis with a gamma of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are such that one is going upper-right and the other lower-right. So both are moving to the right, but one upwards and the other downwards.

Wait, wait. No, the electron is moving from the left, so it's going to the right. The positron is moving from the right, so it's going to the left. Oh wait, noâ€”wait, the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So maybe they're moving towards each other. Because the electron is moving from left to right, and the positron is moving from right to left. So yes, they're moving toward each other.

When they collide and annihilate, they produce two photons. The photons have the same energy and are moving in opposite vertical directions but both to the right? Or maybe both to the left? Wait, the problem says one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So both are moving to the right, but one is going up and the other down relative to the horizontal. So their directions are symmetric about the horizontal axis.

Wait, no. Wait, the initial setup: the electron is moving along the horizontal from left, so to the right. The positron is moving along the horizontal from the right, so to the left. Oh wait, the question says both are moving along the horizontal. So maybe the electron is moving to the right, and the positron to the left. So they collide head-on.

Upon annihilation, they produce two photons. Both photons have the same energy. The problem says one photon is moving in the upper-right direction, the other in the lower-right. So both moving to the right, one upwards and the other downwards. Hmm, but that would mean that the total momentum in the vertical direction
