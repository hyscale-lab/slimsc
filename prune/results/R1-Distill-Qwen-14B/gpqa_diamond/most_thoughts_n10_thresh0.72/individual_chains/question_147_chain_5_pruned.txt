Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an annihilation process. Let me read it again. The reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Wait, no, actually, the particles are A⁺ and A⁻. Hmm, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass-energy of A is 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A to D, each a different fraction of the speed of light.

Alright, let me think about this step by step. So, the reaction involves a proton and an antiproton annihilating into two A⁺ and two A⁻ particles. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I think in annihilation processes, energy and momentum are conserved. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe I can treat this as a low-energy approximation or use some non-relativistic approach? Or perhaps it's better to use relativistic conservation laws.

Wait, the problem gives m_A c² as 300 MeV. The proton and antiproton have their own masses. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², right? Since the antiproton has the same mass as the proton, that's 938 MeV/c² each.

So the initial system is a proton (p) and an antiproton (p̄) colliding. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe its kinetic energy is low compared to its rest mass energy. But wait, the term "slowly moving" is relative. I'm not sure if it's non-relativistic or not. Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the initial kinetic energy is negligible, so we can approximate the initial total energy as the sum of their rest energies.

Wait, but in particle reactions, the conservation of energy and momentum is key. Let's consider the initial and final states.

The initial state: p and p̄. Let's assume the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly. Alternatively, maybe they're moving towards each other. But the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Hmm, the wording is a bit unclear. Maybe the proton is stationary, and the antiproton is moving with some velocity, but it's low, so non-relativistic approximation could be used.

Wait, but maybe energy and momentum are conserved
