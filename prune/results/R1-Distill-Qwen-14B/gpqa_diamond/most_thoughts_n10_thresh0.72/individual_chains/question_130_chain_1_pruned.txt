Okay, so I have this question about neutral hydrogen clouds and quasars. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when quasars emit light, if there's a cloud of neutral hydrogen in front of them, the hydrogen will absorb certain wavelengths of that light. Specifically, the Lyman alpha wavelength, which I think is around 1216 Angstroms.

Wait, right, the Lyman alpha line is at about 121.6 nanometers, which is the same as 1216 Angstroms. So when the quasar's light passes through a hydrogen cloud, this wavelength gets absorbed. But if the cloud is moving away from us (because of the expansion of the universe), the wavelength of the absorbed light would be stretched, right?

Oh, redshift! So the observed wavelength depends on the redshift. The redshift formula is z = (observed wavelength - emitted wavelength) / emitted wavelength. So z = (λ_obs/λ_emit) - 1.

But wait, the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. I'm trying to figure out the minimum redshift needed so that the absorption line is still in the optical range. Because ground-based telescopes can't see ultraviolet light, which would be the case if the observed wavelength is too short.

So the Lyman alpha line is in the UV when the object is at low redshift. But as the redshift increases, the observed wavelength shifts into the visible (optical) range. So the question is, what's the smallest z where 1216 Angstroms (emitted) is shifted into the optical.

Wait, but optical wavelengths are longer than UV. So for the absorption to be in the optical, the observed wavelength should be longer than what is visible in UV. So let me think: what's the threshold? I think the cutoff is around 300 nm or so because below that (like 290 or lower), it's considered UV and ground telescopes can't observe it because the atmosphere absorbs it.

So to find the minimal z where the observed λ is just above 300 nm. Let's calculate that.

The emitted wavelength λ_emit is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm. The observed wavelength λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + z). We want λ_obs to be greater than or equal to 300 nm.
