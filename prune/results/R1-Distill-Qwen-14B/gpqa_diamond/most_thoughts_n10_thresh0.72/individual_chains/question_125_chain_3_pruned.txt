Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that this is like a 3D version of the simple harmonic oscillator, which is a standard problem in QM.

The question asks about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for that energy. So I need to find both the energy value and the degeneracy (number of eigenfunctions with the same energy) for that state.

Wait, let's break it down step by step. In 3D, the potential is separable into x, y, and z components, right? Each direction behaves like a 1D harmonic oscillator. The energy levels in each direction are quantized as E_n = (n + 1/2) ħω, where n is the quantum number (0,1,2,...) for that direction.

In 3D, the total energy is the sum of the energies in each direction. So the total energy E = E_x + E_y + E_z. Each E contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, where n_x, n_y, n_z are the quantum numbers for x, y, z. So adding them together, the total energy is (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω.

Wait, because each term is (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so when you add three of them: (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3*1/2) ħω → (N + 3/2) ħω, where N = n_x + n_y + n_z.

So the energy levels are determined by the value of N. For each N, the energy is E = (N + 3/2) ħω. So the energy levels are degenerate because different combinations of n_x, n_y, n_z can lead to the same N.

Now, the problem is about the third excited state. Wait, what's the ground state? The ground state is when all n's are zero: n_x = n_y = n_z = 0. So N=0, E=(0 + 3/2)ħω = 3/2 ħω. That's the first energy level.

The first excited state would be the next higher energy. That would be when N=1. Because N is the sum, so N=1 gives E=(1 + 3/2) ħω = 5/2 ħω. Then N=2 gives E=(2 + 3/2) = 7/2 ħω, which is the second excited state. Wait, no, wait: the ground state is N=0, first excited N=1, second N=2, third excited N=3.

Wait, does that make sense? Let me think: ground state is the lowest energy, so N=0. First excited is next, so N=1, which is one quantum above. Second excited would be N=2, and third excited
