Okay, so I've come across this astronomy question, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says that there are five exoplanets (Planet_1 to Planet_5) with circular orbits, discovered using the TTV method. They’re in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods have a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. We’re told to assume they all have the same albedo, and we need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.

Hmm, equilibrium temperature. Right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is based on the inverse square law. The temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Since the albedo is the same for all, it should cancel out in the ratio.

The formula I remember is T = [(L / (16πσ d²)) * (1 - A)]^(1/4), but since A is the same for all, the (1-A) term is a constant. So when taking the ratio, it would cancel out. So the temperature ratio depends on the square of the distance.

Wait, but the planets are in orbital resonance, so their orbital periods are in the given ratios. I think I need to relate their orbital periods to their distances from the star. Kepler's third law comes into play here. Kepler's law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from the star). So P² ∝ a³. Since all orbits are circular, a is the radius.

So if P1 : P2 : P3 : P4 : P5 is 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, then I can write each planet's period as P_i = k * i, where k is a constant. But wait, their ratios are not integers. Hmm, maybe it's better to assign Planet_1's period as P, then the others are 2P, 2.5P, 3.5P, 5P.

So for each planet, P_i = (a_i^3 / a_1^3 )^(1/2) * P_1. Wait, Kepler's law says P² ∝ a³. So (P_i / P_1)^2 = (a_i / a_1)^3.

Taking the square root of both sides, (P_i / P_1) = (a_i / a_1)^(3/2).

So (a_i / a_1) = (P_i / P_1)^(2/3).

That gives the ratio of distances between each planet and Planet_1.

So, to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, I need to find the ratio of their distances, then take the inverse square root for temperature.

Wait, equilibrium temperature formula: T ∝ (L / (16πσ d²))^(1/4). Since L and σ are constants, the ratio T4/T2 = (d2/d4)^(1/2), because T is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance.

Wait, no. Let me think
