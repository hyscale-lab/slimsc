Okay, so I've got this question about neutral hydrogen clouds and their redshift. Hmm, let me think. I remember that neutral hydrogen emits or absorbs light at a specific wavelength. Oh right, the Lyman-alpha line is about 1216 Angstroms. Wait, but wait, what's a redshift here?

Redshift happens when the universe expands, causing light from distant objects to stretch to longer wavelengths. So if a cloud is at a high redshift, the wavelength we observe it at would be longer than the rest wavelength.

The question says that these clouds absorb light from background quasars at Lyman alpha. So the quasar's light is being absorbed by the hydrogen at 1216 Angstrom. But wait, wait. I'm a bit confused. So if the hydrogen is at a certain redshift, the wavelength we observe the absorption line would be 1216 * (1 + z), right?

But the telescopes in question are optical ground-based ones. So they can observe in the visible spectrum. Hmm, what's the cutoff for optical? Well, optical light is roughly from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). But wait, Angstroms and nanometers are the same scale, since 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. Oh right, 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is in the ultraviolet. But ground-based telescopes can't see UV because the atmosphere absorbs it. So how does this work?

Oh, right! So if the absorption is at 1
