Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light passing through moving glass. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the question says a light beam is moving through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light relative to the observer. The options are given as A, B, C, D. 

Wait, I remember that in a medium like glass, the speed of light is v = c/n, where c is the speed in vacuum. But wait, this is when the medium is at rest relative to the observer. Oh, right, because the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties, but the medium's motion affects it as well. Wait, no, or maybe it's more about the frame of reference. Hmm, I'm a bit mixed up here.

So the glass is moving towards the observer. The light is propagating in the same direction as the glass's motion. So both the glass and the light are moving towards the observer. Wait, no, the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is propagating in the same direction as the beam. Wait, so the beam is moving towards the observer as well, because the glass is moving toward the observer
