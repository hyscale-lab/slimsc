Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals and their angular momentum states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says that two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum states. Wait, p orbitals have l=1, right? So each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l=1. The problem is ignoring spin, so I don't have to worry about that part for now.

The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. I remember that in these coupled states, the first two numbers are the individual quantum numbers l1 and l2. So l1=1 and l2=1. The next number is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number L, which here is 2. And m is the magnetic quantum number, which is -1.

So the state is |l1, l2, L, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Now, the question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for each electron. They want the joint probability that both measurements yield -ħ.

Wait, L1z and L2z are the z-components of the individual orbital angular momenta of each electron. Each of them can have values mħ, where m can be -l to +l. So for each electron, possible m values are -1, 0, +1.

But the total state is a coupled state. I think when you combine two angular momenta, you have to consider all possible ways the individual m1 and m2 can add up to the total M (which here is m=-1).

Wait, so the total m is -1. That means m1 + m2 = -1.

But the question is about measuring both m1 and m2 as -1. So m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

Hmm, so can that happen? Let's see.

Each electron's m can be -1, 0, +1. So if both are -1, their sum would be -2. But the total M here is -1. That's a problem. So in the state |1,1,2,-1>, can the individual m1 and m2 both be -1?

Wait, in the coupled state, the individual m's don't directly correspond because the state is a combination
