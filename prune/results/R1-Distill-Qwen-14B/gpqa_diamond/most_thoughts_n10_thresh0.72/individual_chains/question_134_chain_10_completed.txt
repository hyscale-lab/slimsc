Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on enthalpy of neutralization, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

The question is asking me to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when three different solutions are mixed: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. The options are given, and I need to choose the right one.

Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The typical value for strong acids and bases is around -57 kJ/mol, but I think that's per mole of H+ reacting. So to find the total enthalpy change, I need to figure out how many moles of H+ and OH- are involved, but I have to account for the fact that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each molecule can donate two H+ ions.

Wait, but when you mix these together, it's not just any reaction. I need to find out which is in excess and how much neutralization actually happens. Because the strong acid and strong base will neutralize each other until one runs out.

So first, I should calculate the moles of H+ from each acid and the moles of OH- from the base.

Let's break it down:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl:
HCl is a strong acid, so each mole gives one H+. Volume is 500 mL (0.5 L) and concentration is 0.2 M. Moles = 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 moles of HCl. So H+ is 0.1 moles.

2. Calculate moles of H+ from H2SO4:
H2SO4 is a strong acid, and in solution, it dissociates completely into 2 H+ and SO4^2-. So for each mole of H2SO4, there are 2 moles of H+. The volume is 300 mL (0.3 L) and concentration is 0.3 M. Moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 moles. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

3. Calculate moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2:
Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions. The volume is 200 mL (0.2 L), concentration 0.5 M. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 moles. So OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Now, the total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles. The OH- is 0.2 moles.

When they react, the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The limiting reagent here is OH- because there's only 0.2 moles of it, and 0.28 moles of H+.

So all the OH- will react, and some H+ will remain. The amount of H+ neutralized is 0.2 moles.

Wait, but wait—no, wait. The H+ comes from two sources, HCl and H2SO4. So when they react with OH-, the neutralization is the same regardless of the source. So the reaction will proceed until one of the H+ or OH- is used up.

So, in this case, OH- is the limiting reactant. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react with 0.2 moles of H+.

But wait, the total H+ is 0.28 moles. So after neutralization, 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles of H+ will remain. But the excess H+ doesn't contribute to the enthalpy of neutralization because the neutralization is only for the amount that reacts.

Wait, but perhaps I should think of the problem differently. Maybe I should compute the total H+ and total OH- and see which is in excess.

Alternatively, when mixing all together, the reaction is:

H+ (from all acids) + OH- (from Ba(OH)2) → H2O

So, the moles of H+ available: 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles.

Moles of OH- available: 0.2 moles.

The reaction can happen for the minimum of the two, which is 0.2 moles. So 0.2 moles of H+ will react with 0.2 moles of OH-.

The enthalpy change (ΔH) for neutralization is usually given per mole of H+ neutralized. Since each mole releases about 57 kJ (but wait, the sign depends on convention. Neutralization is exothermic, so ΔH is negative. So if it's per mole, it's -57 kJ/mol.)

Wait, but I've heard that the standard enthalpy of neutralization is -57.1 kJ/mol, so that's per mole of H+ (or OH-) neutralized.

So the total enthalpy change would be:

ΔH = moles of H+ neutralized × ΔH per mole.

But wait, the problem gives the options in kcal and kJ. Let me check the options: A is -2.72 kcal, B -11.42 kcal, C -3.80 kcal, D -16.0 kJ.

Wait, so some are in kcal, others in kJ. Hmm, maybe I should convert units.

Alternatively, maybe the question expects me to calculate the total moles of H+ neutralized and multiply by the enthalpy per mole.

But wait, another approach: The total moles of H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So the H+ in excess is 0.08. So the moles that actually react are 0.2 (since OH- is limiting). So the moles of water formed are 0.2.

But wait, no, because each mole of OH- reacts with a mole of H+ to form a mole of water.

So, the moles of H+ consumed are 0.2.

So the amount of heat released is 0.2 moles × (-57.1 kJ/mol) ≈ -11.42 kJ.

But wait, let me compute that. 0.2 × 57.1 = 11.42. So the enthalpy is -11.42 kJ.

But looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Oh wait, no—option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion.

Wait, no, wait: wait, when I calculated 0.2 moles × 57.1 kJ/mol, that's in kJ. So 0.2 × 57.1 = 11.42 kJ. So the enthalpy change is -11.42 kJ. But looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, and option D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, that's a problem. Because 11.42 kJ isn't one of the options except for option B which is in kcal, not kJ.

Wait, perhaps I should check my calculations again.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem expects me to calculate the total enthalpy of neutralization for each acid and base, considering their molarity and volume.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the moles of H+ and OH- correctly.

Wait, let me recount the moles:

HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 moles OH-.

So, H+ total: 0.28 moles, OH-: 0.2 moles.

So, the neutralization would neutralize 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH-, forming 0.2 moles of H2O.

So, the heat released is 0.2 × 57.1 kJ/mol = 11.42 kJ.

But wait, the options don't have 11.42 kJ; option B is -11.42 kcal. So perhaps the question expects the answer in kcal instead of kJ? Wait, 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ.

Wait, let's see: 11.42 kJ is equal to how many kcal? 11.42 / 4.184 ≈ 2.73 kcal. So about 2.73 kcal.

But option A is -2.72 kcal. That's close. Hmm.

Wait, but why is the enthalpy of neutralization per mole approximately 57 kJ or 13.7 kcal? Because 57.1 × 1000 J / 4184 J/kcal ≈ 13.67 kcal/mol.

Ah! So 57.1 kJ/mol is equivalent to about 13.67 kcal/mol.

Wait, because 1 kcal = 4184 J, so 57,100 J is about 13.625 kcal.

So if 0.2 moles are neutralized, the enthalpy would be 0.2 × 13.67 kcal/mol ≈ 2.73 kcal.

So the total enthalpy change would be approximately -2.73 kcal, which is close to option A's -2.72 kcal.

But why the discrepancy? Let me do the exact calculation.

57.1 kJ/mol is equal to 57.1 * 1000 J/mol. To convert to kcal: 57100 J / 4184 J/kcal ≈ 13.64 kcal/mol.

So 0.2 moles × 13.64 kcal/mol = 2.728 kcal. Rounded is -2.73 kcal.

But the option A is -2.72 kcal. So that's very close.

Wait, but the problem is, the options have both kcal and kJ. So which unit should I use?

Looking back, the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Hmm, so if I go with kJ, I get -11.42 kJ, which is not among the options. But if I use kcal, I get approximately -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, but that can't be right because the enthalpy of neutralization is typically given in kJ. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the stoichiometry. Because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in the reaction, each mole contributes two H+. So perhaps the amount of H+ is correct.

Wait, but another approach: Maybe I should calculate the moles of acid and base, considering their strengths.

Wait, but HCl and H2SO4 are strong acids, so they fully dissociate. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it fully dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH-.

So the initial H+ is 0.1 (HCl) + 0.18 (H2SO4) = 0.28 moles.

The OH- is 0.2 moles.

So when they mix, the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

The limiting reagent is OH-, so 0.2 moles of H+ will react.

So the moles of water formed are 0.2.

So the heat released is 0.2 × 57.1 kJ/mol = 11.42 kJ.

But that leads to 11.42 kJ, which is not an option, but option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the moles.

Wait, let me double-check the H2SO4 moles. 0.3 M, 0.3 L → 0.09 moles H2SO4. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.18 moles H+. That's correct.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles H+. Correct.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 moles OH-. Correct.

So H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is limiting.

Wait, but perhaps the neutralization is not just between H+ and OH- but considering all the acid and base.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but when titrating with a base, the second H+ may not dissociate in the same way. But no, since it's a strong acid, both protons dissociate completely.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the neutralization is between all the acids (HCl and H2SO4) and all the base (Ba(OH)2). But the OH- is the limiting reagent, so only 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized.

So, the heat is 0.2 × 57.1 kJ = 11.42 kJ, which is approximately 2.72 kcal (since 11.42 /4.184 ≈ 2.72).

Wait, but why would the problem give both units? Let me think—maybe I should calculate the total heat and then see which option it matches.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and find the neutralization, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach—maybe I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and see which is in excess, then compute the neutralization.

H+ total: 0.28 moles.

OH-: 0.2 moles.

So, the reaction will neutralize 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH-, producing 0.2 moles of H2O.

The remaining H+ is 0.08 moles, which doesn't contribute to the neutralization.

So the heat released is 0.2 × 57.1 kJ/mol = 11.42 kJ.

But in the options, I don't see 11.42 kJ. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the dilution as well. Because when you mix the solutions, the total volume increases, but for the purpose of stoichiometry, volume doesn't affect moles. So that shouldn't matter.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to calculate the enthalpy based on the total moles of acid and base, but that doesn't make sense because the neutralization only occurs up to the limiting reagent.

Wait, maybe I should think about the equivalents. Because H2SO4 provides 2 equivalents per mole, Ba(OH)2 provides 2 equivalents per mole.

Wait, the equivalent concept might help here.

Equivalents of H+:

HCl: 0.1 moles × 1 eq/mol = 0.1 eq.

H2SO4: 0.09 moles × 2 eq/mol = 0.18 eq.

Total H+ equivalents = 0.28 eq.

Equivalents of OH-:

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 moles × 2 eq/mol = 0.2 eq.

So, the OH- is 0.2 eq. which is less than H+ (0.28). So OH- is limiting.

Thus, the neutralization will involve 0.2 eq. of H+ and OH-.

So, the heat is 0.2 × 57.1 kJ = 11.42 kJ, which is -11.42 kJ.

But the options have option B as -11.42 kcal. Hmm.

Wait, 11.42 kJ is approximately 2.73 kcal (11.42 /4.184 ≈ 2.73).

So the enthalpy change is either -11.42 kJ or -2.73 kcal.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -48.5 kJ. That's way off.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of reaction, but considering the stoichiometry.

Wait, another thought: The reaction would be as follows:

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O

But wait, HCl is a monoprotic acid, Ba(OH)2 is diprotic.

Wait, no, mixing HCl and Ba(OH)2 would produce BaCl2 and water. The reaction is:

2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

Similarly, H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would react as:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

But considering the stoichiometry, perhaps I should calculate the moles of each acid and base and see which is the limiting reagent.

But considering all three solutions are mixed together, perhaps the overall reaction is the sum of all H+ and OH-.

But in any case, the approach I did earlier seems correct.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the total H+ and OH- and see which is in excess.

Wait, but I think that's the correct approach. So 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-. Neutralizing 0.2 H+.

So the heat released is 0.2 × 57.1 kJ = 11.42 kJ, which is option D if it were 11.42 kJ, but it's not; option D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong value for the enthalpy of neutralization. Maybe it's -57.1 kJ per mole of H+.

Wait, yes, that's what I did. So 0.2 × 57.1 = 11.42 kJ.

But none of the options is 11.42 kJ. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moles.

Wait, let me recheck the moles:

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L; 0.5 L × 0.2 M = 0.1 moles. Correct.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L; 0.3 × 0.3 = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 H+. Correct.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L; 0.2 × 0.5 = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 OH-. Correct.

So, no problem there.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is considering the total equivalents, but perhaps I should think about the strong acid and strong base reacting in a 1:1 ratio.

Wait, but when you have a diprotic acid and a diprotic base, the neutralization is a bit more complex. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the total H+ and OH- and see which is in excess, which I did. So 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-. So 0.2 moles of H+ neutralized.

So, 0.2 × 57.1 = 11.42 kJ.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option D is -16.0 kJ.

How does that number come about? 16.0 /57.1 is about 0.28 moles. So if 0.28 moles of H+ were neutralized, but that would require more OH- than available.

Wait, but the OH- is 0.2 moles. So 0.28 H+ can't all be neutralized.

Wait, perhaps the problem is mixing the solutions and considering the reaction between all the H+ and OH-, but that's impossible because OH- is limiting.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think differently. Maybe I should calculate the total heat for each acid and base reaction separately.

For example, HCl and Ba(OH)2:

The reaction would be:

2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

Moles of HCl: 0.1.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1.

The stoichiometric ratio is 2:1. So for 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2, we need 0.2 moles HCl. But we only have 0.1 moles HCl. So HCl is the limiting reagent.

So moles of H+ neutralized from HCl: 0.1.

Heat from HCl reaction: 0.1 × 57.1 kJ = 5.71 kJ.

Now, for H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2:

The reaction is H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Moles of H2SO4: 0.09.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1.

The stoichiometric ratio is 1:1. So H2SO4 is limiting; 0.09 moles will react.

Each mole of H2SO4 provides 2 H+, so 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles H+ neutralized.

Heat from H2SO4 reaction: 0.18 × 57.1 kJ ≈ 10.28 kJ.

Adding the two: 5.71 + 10.28 = 15.99 ≈ 16.0 kJ.

So the total heat released is approximately 16.0 kJ, which is option D: -16.0 kJ.

Oh! That makes sense. So when I approach it by considering the reactions separately, I get option D as the answer.

Wait, why didn't the first approach work? Because in the first approach, I treated all H+ as available and all OH- as available, which might not be the correct way because each acid and base may react with each other in specific stoichiometric ratios.

So the correct way is to calculate each reaction separately, considering the stoichiometry of each acid-base pair.

So, let's go through that again.

First reaction: HCl and Ba(OH)2.

The balanced equation is 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

Moles of HCl: 0.1.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1.

The mole ratio required is 2 HCl :1 Ba(OH)2.

Available ratio is 0.1 HCl : 0.1 Ba(OH)2 → which is 1:1.

But the required is 2:1. So Ba(OH)2 is in excess. HCl is limiting.

So all 0.1 moles of HCl will react, requiring 0.05 moles of Ba(OH)2 (since 2 HCl needs 1 Ba(OH)2).

Wait, wait. Let me correct that.

Wait, 2 moles of HCl react with 1 mole of Ba(OH)2.

So for 0.1 moles of HCl, the required Ba(OH)2 is 0.05 moles.

But we have 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2 available. So HCl is limiting. So 0.1 moles HCl will react, producing 0.1 moles H2O.

But wait, each mole of HCl contributes one H+, so 0.1 moles H+ are neutralized.

The heat released from this reaction is 0.1 × 57.1 kJ = 5.71 kJ.

Now, after this reaction, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

Now, the H2SO4 is another acid. Let's see how it reacts with the remaining Ba(OH)2.

Reaction: H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Moles of H2SO4: 0.09.

Moles of Ba(OH)2 remaining: 0.05.

The stoichiometric ratio is 1:1. So Ba(OH)2 is limiting.

So 0.05 moles of Ba(OH)2 will react with 0.05 moles H2SO4.

Each mole of H2SO4 provides 2 H+, so 0.05 moles H2SO4 → 0.1 moles H+ neutralized.

So heat from this reaction: 0.05 × 2 × 57.1 kJ = 0.05 × 114.2 = 5.71 kJ? Wait, no.

Wait, per mole of H2SO4, 2 H+ are neutralized, releasing 2 × 57.1 kJ = 114.2 kJ per mole of H2SO4.

But wait, no, because the enthalpy is per mole of H+.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of moles of H+ neutralized.

Each mole of H2SO4 provides 2 H+; each H+ neutralization releases 57.1 kJ.

So for 0.05 moles of H2SO4, moles of H+ neutralized is 0.05 × 2 = 0.1 moles.

So heat is 0.1 × 57.1 = 5.71 kJ.

So total heat from both reactions: 5.71 (from HCl) + 5.71 (from H2SO4) = 11.42 kJ.

Wait, but that's the same as before. So why did I earlier get 16 kJ when considering the other approach?

Ah, I think I messed up the stoichiometry earlier. Let me do this correctly.

Wait, in the first approach, I considered the total H+ and OH- and found that 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized. So 0.2 ×57.1= 11.42 kJ.

But in the second approach, when considering the reactions separately, I get 11.42 kJ as well.

Wait, then why did I earlier get 16 kJ? Oh, I think I made a mistake in the second approach. Let me try again.

Wait, let's try the second approach again.

First, HCl and Ba(OH)2:

Moles of HCl: 0.1.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1.

The reaction is 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

So, the stoichiometric ratio is 2 HCl : 1 Ba(OH)2.

Moles of HCl available: 0.1. Moles needed for all Ba(OH)2: 0.2 (since 1 Ba(OH)2 requires 2 HCl). But we only have 0.1 HCl, which is half of what's needed.

So HCl is limiting. So 0.1 HCl will react with 0.05 Ba(OH)2.

Thus, moles of H+ neutralized: 0.1 (from HCl) ×1 =0.1.

Heat from this reaction: 0.1 ×57.1 =5.71 kJ.

Now, after this, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 -0.05 =0.05 moles.

Now, the H2SO4 is 0.09 moles.

Reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Moles of H2SO4: 0.09.

Moles of Ba(OH)2:0.05.

Stoichiometric ratio 1:1. So Ba(OH)2 is limiting.

So moles of H2SO4 that react: 0.05.

Each mole of H2SO4 provides 2 H+; so 0.05 ×2 =0.1 moles H+ neutralized.

Heat from this reaction:0.1 ×57.1 =5.71 kJ.

Total heat:5.71+5.71=11.42 kJ. So the total enthalpy is -11.42 kJ.

Which is option D if it were -11.42 kJ, but the options have D as -16.0 kJ.

Wait, but earlier when I considered all H+ and OH- without considering the separate reactions, I got 0.2 moles of H+ neutralized, which gives 11.42 kJ. So same result.

So why when I considered the reactions separately, I get same value.

So the correct answer should be -11.42 kJ, which is not in the options. Wait, but the options have option B as -11.42 kcal. So 11.42 kJ is about 2.73 kcal.

Wait, so perhaps the problem expects the answer in kcal but using the per mole value in kcal.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57.1 kJ/mol, which is about -13.66 kcal/mol.

So 0.2 moles × (-13.66 kcal/mol) = -2.732 kcal.

So approximately -2.73 kcal. Which is option A: -2.72 kcal.

Wait a minute, this makes sense. Because when you convert 57.1 kJ to kcal, it's 13.66 kcal/mol.

So, 0.2 moles ×13.66 kcal/mol =2.732 kcal.

So the total enthalpy is -2.73 kcal, which matches option A.

But earlier, I thought the answer was -11.42 kJ, but that's not in the options.

So which is correct?

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So, if I go with the calculation in kcal, the answer is A.

But earlier, when I calculated in kJ, I get 11.42 kJ, which is not an option. But in the options, there's D as -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I considered the reactions.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach where all H+ and OH- are considered is correct, and the answer is -11.42 kJ, which is option D if it's 11.42 kJ, but it's not. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering each H+ as 57.1 kJ, which would be 0.2 ×57.1 =11.42 kJ. So if the correct answer is B or D.

But looking at the options, none of them is 11.42 kJ. Wait, option D is -16.0 kJ.

Hmm.

Another thought: Perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- without considering stoichiometry, and then multiply by 57.1 kJ per mole of H+.

Wait, but that approach gives 11.42 kJ, which is not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not seeing why.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the calculations somewhere else. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of acid or base, but that's not standard.

Alternatively, perhaps each mole of H2SO4 releases 2 ×57.1 kJ.

Wait, but that would be for each mole of H2SO4 reacting completely. But in reality, only part of it reacts.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses 13.6 kcal/mol as the standard value.

So 0.2 moles ×13.6 kcal/mol =2.72 kcal. Which is option A.

So the answer should be option A.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are taken:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from HCl**:  
   HCl is a strong acid, so each mole contributes one H⁺.  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Moles of H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄**:  
   H₂SO₄ is a strong acid and dissociates completely into 2 H⁺ per molecule.  
   Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).

3. **Calculate moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂**:  
   Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base and dissociates completely into 2 OH⁻ per molecule.  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.2 \, \text{L} \times 0.5 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).

4. **Determine the limiting reagent**:  
   Total moles of H⁺ = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Total moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Since OH⁻ is limiting, only \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \) of H⁺ will react.

5. **Calculate the enthalpy change**:  
   The enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \( -57.1 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) or \( -13.67 \, \text{kcal/mol} \) per mole of H⁺ neutralized.  
   Heat released = \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \times 57.1 \, \text{kJ/mol} = 11.42 \, \text{kJ} \).  
   Converting to kcal: \( 11.42 \, \text{kJ} \div 4.184 \, \text{kJ/kcal} \approx 2.73 \, \text{kcal} \).

6. **Match the result to the options**:  
   The calculated enthalpy change is approximately \( -2.73 \, \text{kcal} \), which is closest to option A (\( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \)).
