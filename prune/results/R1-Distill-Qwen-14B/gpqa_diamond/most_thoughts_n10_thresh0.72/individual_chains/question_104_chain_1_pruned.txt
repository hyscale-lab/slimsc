Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem says that two stars with the same mass (like our Sun) each have a planet similar to Neptune. Both have circular orbits. The RV method detects the Doppler shift in their spectral lines due to the planets' gravitational influence.

Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. Wait, the question is about the orbital periods of the two planets. So, how does the RV shift relate to the orbital period?

I remember that the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us. The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/2) ) / (2π) * (something else... Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula.

Oh right, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:

K = [ (G * P) / (2π) )^(1/3) ] * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune's mass is about 17 Earth masses, but the star is like the Sun, so M_Star is much larger), we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies.

Wait, but both stars have the same mass, and the planets are similar to Neptune, so M_p is the same for both planets. So M_p is same for both, and M_star is same for both.

So the formula for K would be proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) )

Wait, let me write it correctly. The formula is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)))
