Okay, so I've got this question about the impulse approximation in nuclear physics. Hmm, I remember that the impulse approximation is a simplification where each nucleon in a nucleus behaves almost like a free particle. But wait, how does that happen?

The question is asking which of the four assumptions imply this. Let's look at the options one by one.

Option 1: The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons. Oh right, in the impulse approximation, each nucleon interacts with the external field or force individually. So the interaction doesn't involve any pair-wise interactions between nucleons. That makes sense because if the current only interacts with individual, you treat each as independent.

Option 2: The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon. Wait, what's transparent mean here? I think it means that when a particle interacts with the nucleus, it only interacts with one nucleon and the rest of the nucleus doesn't affect the interaction. So the other nucleons don't interfere, making the nucleus 'transparent' except for the one it hits. This implies that the binding between nucleons doesn't matter during the interaction, kind of like the nucleus is just a collection of free particles.

Option 3: The quarks inside the selected nucleon are non-relativistic. Hmm, I'm not too sure about this. If quarks are non-relativistic, that might mean their kinetic energy is low compared to their rest mass energy. But how does that tie into the impulse approximation? Well, the impulse approximation is often used in the context of reactions where the interaction is so short that the internal structure of the nucleon (like quarks) doesn't change much. Wait, but if the quarks are non-relativistic, maybe it's about treating them as static or not moving much during the interaction. Or perhaps it's about the nucleon being treated as a point particle without considering internal dynamics. Alternatively, relativistic effects would mean you have to consider more complex interactions, so non-relativistic might mean you can treat each quark as if it's not moving much, simplifying things. Or maybe this is a red herring because the impulse approximation doesn't directly depend on the quarks' state. I'm a bit confused here.

Option 4: The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces. Oh, that makes sense. If the nucleon is bound in the nucleus, but during the interaction, the binding forces are negligible. So the nucleon can be
