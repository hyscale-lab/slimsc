Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons are used to accelerate charged particles, right? But wait, a synchrocyclotron is a special type. Oh, right, they use a varying magnetic field, whereas regular cyclotrons have a constant one. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details, so I should think this through.

The problem says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is approximately zero. It undergoes two accelerations to reach T1 of 950 MeV. Wait, two accelerations? So maybe it goes through the accelerator twice? Or maybe it's accelerated twice per revolution? Not sure yet.

The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 * cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The initial phase Φ0 is π/4, and U0 is 190 kV. So, the voltage is oscillating with frequency ν(α), but the frequency might depend on something called α. Oh, right, in cyclotrons, the frequency depends on the mass and charge of the particle. Wait, but in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field changes with time, so the cyclotron frequency isn't constant. That complicates things.

I remember that in a cyclotron, the time period for each orbit is related to the magnetic field and the particle's mass. The equation for the cyclotron frequency is ω = (qB)/(m), where q is the charge, m
