Okay, so I have this question about a rhombohedral crystal, and I'm supposed to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that a rhombohedral crystal system is a type of hexagonal crystal system, right? Or wait, no, maybe it's a cubic system. Wait, no, rhombohedral is a subclass of the cubic system, but with all the edges equal and all angles equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. Oh right, in a rhombohedral system, a=b=c, but the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all equal, which is the case here since they're all 30 degrees.

The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms. I think that refers to the lattice parameter 'a' because in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell edges are all the same length. So a = 10 Å.

Now, the interplanar distance for a crystal plane is given by the formula from the Bragg's law context. The formula for d-spacing (interplanar distance) is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + ... something with the angles). Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal system is d = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) * (1/(a²)) * (some angle factors) ) ), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, I think
