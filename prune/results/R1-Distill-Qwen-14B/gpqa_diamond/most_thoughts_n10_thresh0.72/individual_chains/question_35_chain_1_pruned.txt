Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about angular momentum operators, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that we're considering the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, of a muon. It's represented by a 2x2 matrix Ay. The eigenvalue equation is Ay(φ) = aφ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenfunction. The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). 

The question asks us to find which statement among the options A to D is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. 

Let me break this down. First, I need to figure out what Ay looks like. Since c is h/(4π), Ay = c * S. So, let's write out matrix S first. 

S is a 2x2 matrix:
Row 1: 0, -i
Row 2: i, 0

So, multiplying each element by c, Ay becomes:
Row 1: 0 * c, (-i) * c
Row 2: i * c, 0

Plugging in c = h/(4π), that becomes:
Row 1: 0, (-i)(h/(4π))
Row 2: (i)(h/(4π)), 0

So, Ay is:
[ 0, (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), 0 ]

Wait, but the problem is about finding the eigenvalues of Ay. So, I should set up the characteristic equation. The eigenvalues a satisfy det(Ay - a I) = 0. 

The matrix (Ay - a I) would be:
[ -a, (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) ] = a² - [ (i^2 h²)/(16 π²) ) ]

Wait, i^2 is -1, so that term becomes ( (-1) h² )/(16 π²) ). So the determinant equation is:

a² - [ (-h²)/(16 π²) ) ] = 0

Which simplifies to a² = h²/(16 π²)
Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4 π )

Wait, that's interesting. So the eigenvalues are a = +h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). But wait, those are real numbers, right? Because the matrix Ay is Hermitian? Wait, wait, let me check that.

Is Ay a Hermitian matrix? Because for angular momentum components, they should be Hermitian operators. Let's see: the matrix Ay needs to be Hermitian, which means equal to its conjugate transpose.

The given matrix Ay is:
Row 1: 0, (-i h)/(4π)
Row 2: (i h
