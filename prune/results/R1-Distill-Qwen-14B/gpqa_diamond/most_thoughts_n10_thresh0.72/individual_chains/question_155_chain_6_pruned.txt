Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's start by understanding what's being asked.

The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, denoted as ΔP_z. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared for the given state.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector is given as a column vector: [-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2]. So this is the state vector |ψ⟩.

First, I should probably write down the matrix for P_z. Looking at the problem statement, P_z has diagonal elements [ħ, 0, -ħ], and zeros elsewhere. So the matrix looks like:

[ ħ    0      0   ]
[ 0    0      0   ]
[ 0    0   -ħ ]

Wait, actually, the way it was written, the first row is (ħ, 0, 0), the second row is (0,0,0), and the third row is (0,0,-ħ). So yes, that's correct.

Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, that means our state vector is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. Hmm, wait no. Wait, if the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, then the state vector's components correspond directly to the coefficients in that basis. So each component in |ψ⟩ corresponds to the amplitude of each eigenstate of P_z.

Wait, that might not be the case. Let me think. Wait, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which implies that each basis vector |k⟩ is an eigenstate of P_z. So if our state is expressed in this basis, then the components of |ψ⟩ are the coefficients of each |k⟩. So for each component ψ_i, it's the amplitude for the eigenstate |i⟩ with eigenvalue p_z,i.

So, the state |ψ⟩ is a linear combination of the eigenstates of P_z. So the eigenvalues of P_z for each basis vector are the diagonal elements given by P_z: first is ħ, second is 0, third is -ħ.

So the components of |ψ⟩ are:

ψ_1 = -1/2 (coefficient for eigenstate with eigenvalue ħ)
ψ_2 = 1/sqrt(2) (coefficient for eigenstate with eigenvalue 0)
ψ_3 = -1/2 (coefficient for eigenstate with eigenvalue -ħ)

So when we calculate ⟨P_z⟩, it's the sum of |ψ_i|^2 multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue.

Wait, no. Because in quantum mechanics, the expectation value of an operator when in its eigenbasis is the sum of |c_i|^2 times the eigenvalue λ_i, where c_i are the coefficients of the state in that basis.

So for ⟨P_z⟩
