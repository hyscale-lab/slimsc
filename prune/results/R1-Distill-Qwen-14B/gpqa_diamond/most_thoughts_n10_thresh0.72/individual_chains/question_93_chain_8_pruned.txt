Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR here, and I'm a bit new to the topic, but I'll try to think through it carefully.

The question is about a scientist who made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He ran qPCR on serially diluted samples with three technical replicates each. The efficiency was 100%, R² was 1, and the slope was -3.3. His results are given, and there are some discrepancies. The options are possible explanations for these discrepancies.

First, I need to recall what each part of a qPCR calibration curve means. So, in qPCR, the calibration curve (or standard curve) is used to quantify the amount of DNA or RNA in a sample. It's created by plotting the Ct values (threshold cycle) against the logarithm of the starting quantity (like copies per microliter) of known standards.

The efficiency being 100% means that each cycle perfectly doubles the DNA, which is ideal. R² of 1 means a perfect correlation, so the data fits the curve perfectly. So, the curve should be very accurate.

The slope of the curve is important. The formula for the slope in a qPCR standard curve is related to the efficiency. The formula is slope = log10(efficiency) * (-1). Wait, or is it the other way around? Oh right, the standard formula for the slope is -3.32 if the efficiency is 100%. Because the slope is calculated as -3.32 divided by the log base 10 of the efficiency. Wait, wait, no. The slope (m) is calculated as m = -1 / log10(efficiency). So for 100% efficiency, which is 1, log10(1) is 0. So that would make the denominator zero. Oh wait, that can't be right. Hmm. Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the formula is that the standard curve's slope is -3.32 when the efficiency is 100% (because efficiency E is 1, so log10(E) is 0, which leads to some confusion). No, actually, the correct formula is m = -1/(log10(E)). So when E is 100% (E=1), log10(1)=0, that would make m undefined, but in reality, when E is 100%, the slope is -3.322, which is close to -3.32. So in this case, the slope is -3.3, which is very close to that, which makes sense for 100% efficiency. So this part checks out.

Now, looking at the data. The Ct values for each concentration are in triplicates, and they seem to get lower as the concentration increases. Wait, no, higher concentrations should give lower Ct values because there's more DNA, so it reaches the threshold sooner. Let me check the data:

- 100,000 copies: Ct ~34 (averages)
- 10,000:
