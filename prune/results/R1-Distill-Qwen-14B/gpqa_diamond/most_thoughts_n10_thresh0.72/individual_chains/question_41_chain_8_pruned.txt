Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me think. The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light relative to the observer.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. I remember that in a medium like glass, the speed of light is lower than c, right? The formula I know is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's the speed of light in the medium when the medium is at rest relative to the observer. But here, the glass is moving. Oh, so this is a scenario involving relative motion between the medium and the observer.

So, the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. Hmm. I think this might be a situation where special relativity comes into play, but wait, n might be a big factor here. Or maybe it's a problem that can be approached using the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, no, the velocity addition formula is for objects moving at significant fractions of the speed of light. But glass's index of refraction n is typically a small number, like 1.5 for glass. But the velocity v is given as some value, but the question doesn't specify if it's a significant fraction of c. Hmm, but the options don't involve square roots or anything, so perhaps it's a non-relativistic approach.

Wait, but in the case of light in a moving medium, I'm not sure. Let me think about how light's speed is measured in a moving medium. Oh, wait. The speed of light in a medium at rest is c/n. But when the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. Inside the glass, the light has a speed of c/n. But now, from the lab frame, we need to find the speed of the light as it propagates through the moving glass.

Ah, maybe I can model this using a Galilean transformation, assuming v is much smaller than c, so relativistic effects are negligible. Because if v is small, then the relativistic terms would be negligible, and a non-relativistic approach would suffice.

Wait, but the speed of light in the glass is c/n,
