Okay, so I've got this physics problem about scattering amplitudes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. 

The question gives me some phase shifts: δ0 is 90 degrees, δ1 is 67, δ2 is 55, δ3 is 30, and δ4 is 13 degrees. And we're supposed to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond these. We're asked to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, right?

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using the partial wave expansion. The formula is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ [ (2l + 1) * e^{iδ_l} * sin(δ_l) ] * (some spherical harmonics or Legendre polynomials). Oh, but wait, maybe I'm mixing that up. Let me think.

Oh right, the general form is f(θ) = Σ (from l=0 to ∞) [ (2l + 1)/(k) ] * [ sin(δ_l) ] * e^{iδ_l} * P_l(cosθ), where P_l is the Legendre polynomial. But wait, the question asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. So θ would be zero degrees because that's the direction of the incident beam.

Hmm, because along the incident direction, θ is zero. So cosθ is 1. The Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 for all l. Because P_l(1) = 1 when l=0, 1, 2,... because it's the value at the pole.

So the scattering amplitude simplifies because P_l(1) is 1. So f(θ=0) = Σ (2l+1)/(k) * sin(δ_l) * e^{iδ_l}.

But the problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ4. So l goes from 0 to 4. So we sum l=0,1,2,3,4.

Now, the amplitude f is a complex number. The question asks for the imaginary part of f along the direction of the incident beam. So we need to compute the imaginary part of each term in the sum and add them up.

Each term in the sum is (2l+1)/(k) * sin(δ_l) * e^{i δ_l}.

Wait, e^{i δ_l} can be written as cos(δ_l) + i sin(δ_l). So the term becomes (2l+1)/(k) * sin(δ_l) * [cos(δ_l) + i sin(δ_l)].

Multiplying sin(δ_l) by each part:

(2l+1)/(k) * [ sin(δ_l) cos(δ_l) + i sin^2(δ_l) ]

So the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1)/(k) * sin^2(δ_l) multiplied by i. So when we sum all the terms, the imaginary part of f is the sum of (2l+1)/(k) * sin^2(δ_l) for each l.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. Because f is the sum of each term, each term is a complex number. So the imaginary part of f is the sum of the imaginary parts of each term.

So, the imaginary part Im(f) is Σ [(2l+1)/(k) * sin^2(δ_l)] for l=0,1,2,3,4.

But wait, let me think again. Because each term's imaginary part is (2l+1)/(k) * sin^2(δ_l), and the real part is (2l+1)/(k) * sin(δ_l) cos(δ_l). But since we're only interested in the imaginary part, that's correct.

So our task is to compute the sum of (2l + 1) * sin²(δ_l) for each l, then divide by k.

Wait, but wait, what is k? k is the wave number, right? Oh, right, k is given by (sqrt(2mE))/(ħ). But wait, in scattering experiments, especially electron scattering, the wave number k can be related to the momentum p via k = p/ħ. Oh, but I'm given the energy as 50 MeV. Hmm, I think I need to compute k. 

Wait, but wait, another approach: in electron scattering, the scattering amplitude f is often expressed in terms of the impact parameter and the scattering angle. Alternatively, the wave number k can be calculated using the de Broglie wavelength. Let me think about how to compute k.

The de Broglie wavelength λ is h/(p), and p is the momentum. For a non-relativistic electron, p = sqrt(2mE). Wait, but 50 MeV is a pretty high energy, so perhaps it's better to use relativistic expressions.

Wait, the energy E is given as 50 MeV. Electrons have rest mass energy of about 0.511 MeV. So 50 MeV is much higher, so relativistic effects are important. Hmm, but perhaps for the purpose of this problem, I can use the non-relativistic expression for k, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use a particular formula that relates E to k.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the k value. Let's think: in scattering theory, the wave number k is often given by sqrt(2mE)/ħ. But wait, I need to confirm the units.

Wait, let me get the formula right. The energy E of an electron is given by E = (ħ² k²) / (2m), where m is the mass of the electron. So solving for k: k = sqrt(2mE) / ħ.

But what is m in appropriate units? The mass of an electron is about 9.10938356 × 10^-31 kg. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J s.

But wait, the energy is given in MeV, which is megaelectronvolts. So perhaps I should convert E into joules. Let's compute that.

Wait, 1 eV is 1.60218 × 10^-19 joules. So 50 MeV is 50,000,000 eV. So E = 50e6 eV * 1.60218e-19 J/eV = 8.0109e-13 J.

But wait, that's a very small energy compared to macroscopic scales, but for an electron, it's high.

So plugging into k = sqrt(2mE) / ħ:

m = 9.10938356e-31 kg

E = 8.0109e-13 J.

Calculate 2mE: 2 * 9.10938356e-31 kg * 8.0109e-13 J = let's compute that.

Compute 2 * 9.10938356e-31 = approx 1.8218767e-30.

Multiply by 8.0109e-13: 1.8218767e-30 * 8.0109e-13 ≈ 1.46e-42 kg·J.

Wait, because E is in joules, and kg·m²/s² is the same as joules. So 2mE has units of kg·(m²/s²) = kg·J.

Wait, but 2mE would be 2*m*E = 2 * m * (ħ² k²)/(2m) )? Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it step by step.

Wait, let me compute 2mE: 2 * m * E = 2 * 9.10938356e-31 kg * 8.0109e-13 J.

Calculating that: 9.10938356e-31 * 8.0109e-13 ≈ 7.29e-44.

Multiply by 2: 1.458e-43 kg·J.

Wait, but then k = sqrt(2mE) / ħ. So sqrt(1.458e-43) is about sqrt(1.458) * 1e-21.5 = approx 1.207e-21.5. Wait, 1e-21.5 is 3.16e-22.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 1.458e-43 is 1.458 * 10^-43. The square root is sqrt(1.458) ≈ 1.207, and sqrt(10^-43) is 10^(-21.5) = 1e-21.5 = approximately 3.16e-22. So k ≈ 1.207 * 3.16e-22 ≈ 3.82e-22 m^-1.

Wait, but that seems really small. Did I make a mistake? Let's check the units again.

Wait, perhaps I should use a different approach because the numbers are getting a bit unwieldy. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use a certain formula where k is expressed in terms of the energy without computing it from scratch.

Let me think again about the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. The imaginary part along the beam direction (θ=0) is the sum over l of [(2l+1)/(k)] * sin^2(δ_l). So Im(f) = sum [ (2l+1) sin²(δ_l) ] / k.

But wait, I'm getting confused. Because the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So if I have Im(f) = sum [ (2l+1) sin²(δ_l) ] / k, then I need to compute each term, sum them, and divide by k.

Wait, but do I have all the necessary values? Let me list the given phase shifts:

l=0: δ0 =90° → sin(90)=1 → sin^2=1

l=1: δ1=67° → sin(67) ≈ 0.9205 → sin²≈ 0.8473

l=2: δ2=55° → sin(55)≈0.8192 → sin²≈ 0.6710

l=3: δ3=30° → sin(30)=0.5 → sin²=0.25

l=4: δ4=13° → sin(13)≈0.22495 → sin²≈ 0.0506

So now, for each l, compute (2l+1) * sin²(δ_l):

l=0: 2*0+1=1 → 1 * 1 =1

l=1: 3 * 0.8473 ≈ 2.5419

l=2:5 * 0.6710 ≈3.355

l=3:7 *0.25=1.75

l=4:9 *0.0506≈ 0.4554

Sum these up: 1 + 2.5419 =3.5419; +3.355=6.8969; +1.75=8.6469; +0.4554≈9.1023.

So sum is approximately 9.1023.

Then, Im(f) = 9.1023 / k.

Wait, but I need to compute k. Hmm. Let me think about possible units. The options are in fm (femtometers), so 1e-15 meters.

Wait, perhaps the formula for k is in terms of the energy. Let me think about the relation between energy and momentum for an electron.

In non-relativistic mechanics, E = p²/(2m), so p = sqrt(2mE). But E here is 50 MeV, which is relativistic, so non-relativistic approach might not be accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the relativistic relation E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

But wait, the electron's rest energy is about 0.511 MeV, and the kinetic energy here is 50 MeV, which is much larger. So the electron is ultra-relativistic.

So, for ultra-relativistic electrons, E ≈ pc. So p = E/c.

So, p = 50 MeV / c.

But I need to find k, which is p/ħ.

So, k = p/(ħ) = (50 MeV / c) / ħ.

Wait, but I need to compute this in units that make sense. Let me compute this in terms of inverse meters.

Wait, the Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 MeV·s. And the speed of light c is approximately 3 × 10^8 m/s.

So, let's compute p = E/c = (50 MeV) / (3e8 m/s) ) = (50 / 3e8) MeV·s/m.

But wait, since E = pc, so p = E/c.

Wait, but E is 50 MeV, so p = 50 MeV / (c).

Then, k = p / ħ.

Hmm, substituting:

k = (50 MeV / c) / (6.582e-25 MeV·s) ) 

Wait, let me compute this.

Wait, let me compute that:

k = (50 / (3e8 m/s)) ) / (6.582e-25 MeV·s) ) → Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled in units. Alternatively, let's think in terms of units conversion.

Another approach: the relation between the de Broglie wavelength λ and the energy E.

The de Broglie wavelength λ = h/(p) = (2πħ) / p.

But since E ≈ pc for ultra-relativistic, p = E/(c).

Thus, λ ≈ 2πħ c / E.

Wait, perhaps that's easier. Let me compute λ for E =50 MeV.

But wait, λ = h/(p) = (h c) / (E), since p=E/c. So λ = (h c) / E.

But I need k, which is 2π/λ, so k = E/(ħ c).

Wait, that makes sense because k = p/(ħ) = (E/(c)) / ħ = E/(ħ c).

So, k = E/(ħ c).

Now, E is 50 MeV. ħ is about 6.582 × 10^-25 MeV·s. c is 3e8 m/s.

So plugging in:

k = (50 MeV) / ( (6.582e-25 MeV·s) * (3e8 m/s) ) )

Simplify the denominator: 6.582e-25 *3e8 = 1.9746e-16 MeV·m.

So k = 50 / (1.9746e-16) [MeV / (MeV·m)] → units cancel, gives 1/m.

Wait, 50 / 1.9746e-16 ≈ 25.3e16 → 2.53e17 m^-1.

Wait, that's a very large value. But let me compute it numerically:

50 / 1.9746e-16 = 50 / 1.9746 × 1e16 → 25.32 × 1e16 = 2.532e17 m^-1.

Wait, but that's 2.532e17 reciprocal meters, which is 2.532e17 m^-1. But wait, 1 fm is 1e-15 m, so 1 fm^-1 is 1e15 m^-1. So, 2.532e17 m^-1 is 253.2 fm^-1.

Wait, but k is 2.532e17 m^-1 → 2.532e17 / (1e15 m^-1 per fm^-1) ) → 253.2 fm^-1.

Wait, so k ≈ 253.2 fm^-1.

Wait, but when I calculated the sum earlier, it was approximately 9.1023. So the imaginary part Im(f) is 9.1023 / k.

Wait, but wait, my sum was 9.1023, and k is 253.2 fm^-1. So 9.1023 / 253.2 ≈ 0.03595 fm.

Wait, but that would be in units of fm? Wait, wait. Because the sum is unitless (since each term is (2l+1) * sin^2, which is unitless) and k is in 1/fm.

Wait, wait, let me think about the units.

Each term in the sum is (2l+1) * sin²(δ_l) → unitless.

So the sum is unitless. k is in 1/fm.

So Im(f) = sum /k → (unitless) / (1/fm) ) → unit is fm.

So Im(f) is approximately 9.1023 / 253.2 fm ≈ 0.03595 fm.

Wait, but that's way smaller than the options given. The options are in the hundreds of fm, like 177, 251, etc.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through the steps again.

Wait, going back, the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along θ=0 is Im(f) = sum [ (2l+1) sin²(δ_l) ] / k.

But perhaps I have a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me check that again.

So, using E=50 MeV. Since the electron is ultra-relativistic, E ≈ pc → p = E/c.

So, p = (50 MeV) / c.

But in terms of units, MeV/c is a unit of momentum. Then, k = p / ħ.

So, k = (50 MeV/c) / ħ.

Now, let's compute this in units of 1/fm.

First, ħ in MeV·s is 6.582e-25 MeV·s.

c is 3e8 m/s. 1 m = 1e15 fm, so c = 3e8 m/s = 3e23 fm/s.

So, 1/(ħ c) in units of fm^-1 would be:

(1) / ( (6.582e-25 MeV·s) * (3e23 fm/s) ) ) → 

Wait, let's compute the denominator:

6.582e-25 * 3e23 = (6.582 *3 )e(-25+23) = 19.746e-2 → 0.19746.

So, 1/(0.19746 MeV·fm) ) → approximately 5.056e+1 MeV^-1 fm^-1.

Wait, but I'm trying to find k = (50 MeV) / (ħ c) → which is 50 MeV * (1/(ħ c)).

Which would be 50 * (5.056e1 MeV^-1 fm^-1) ) → 50 * 5.056e1 → 50 *50.56=2528 fm^-1.

Wait, but that's 2528 fm^-1. Which is 2.528e3 fm^-1.

Wait, but earlier I thought k was 253.2 fm^-1, but this approach gives 2528 fm^-1. Hmm, so I must have messed up the earlier calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion earlier. Let me try again.

So, let's compute k in terms of fm^-1.

We have k = E/(ħ c), where E is in MeV.

So, substituting the values:

E =50 MeV.

ħ = 6.582e-25 MeV·s.

c =3e8 m/s = 3e23 fm/s (since 1 m = 1e15 fm).

So, ħ c =6.582e-25 *3e23 = (6.582 *3) * 1e(-25+23) ) → 19.746e-2 → 0.19746 MeV·fm.

So, k = 50 MeV / (0.19746 MeV·fm) ) → 50 / 0.19746 ≈ 253.2 fm^-1.

Wait, so this calculation gives k≈253.2 fm^-1. That's the same as I found earlier. So why did I get 2528 earlier when trying to calculate using different units? Oh, I must have made a mistake in that approach.

So, k = 253.2 fm^-1.

So, Im(f) = sum / k = 9.1023 / 253.2 fm^-1 → which is approximately 0.03595 fm.

But wait, the options are in the 100s of fm, so this can't be right. Hmm, maybe I missed a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check the formula for f. I think I might have missed a factor of 1/k somewhere.

Wait, the formula for f is (1/k) * sum [ (2l+1) sin(δ_l) e^{i δ_l} ] P_l(cosθ).

Wait, but in the case of θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so f= (1/k) sum [ (2l+1) sin(δ_l) e^{i δ_l} ].

The imaginary part is (1/k) sum [ (2l+1) sin^2(δ_l) ].

Yes, that's correct. So the calculation of sum/(k) should be correct.

Hmm, so what is causing the discrepancy? Because according to this, the answer would be ~0.03595 fm, which is about 0.036 fm, but the options are much larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the sum. Let me recalculate the sum.

Compute each term (2l+1) * sin²(δ_l):

l=0: 1 * sin^2(90) =1 * 1=1.

l=1:3 * sin^2(67). Let me compute sin(67°):

sin(67) ≈ 0.9205, sin^2≈0.8473. 3 *0.8473=2.5419.

l=2:5 * sin^2(55). sin(55)= ~0.8192, sin^2= ~0.6710. 5 * 0.671=3.355.

l=3:7 * sin^2(30). sin(30)=0.5; sin^2=0.25. 7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 * sin^2(13). sin(13)= approx 0.22495, sin^2≈0.0506. 9 *0.0506=0.4554.

So sum: 1 +2.5419=3.5419; +3.355=6.8969; +1.75=8.6469; +0.4554=9.1023.

So sum is correct.

Wait, but 9.1023 / 253.2 ≈ 0.03595 fm. Which is about 0.036 fm. But that's not matching any of the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the phase shifts are given in degrees, but I used them as such. But in the formula, are the phase shifts in radians?

Wait, no, I used sin(degrees). But in programming and calculations, the sine function expects radians. Oh wait, wait: when I compute sin(67), I have to make sure it's in radians.

Wait, this is a critical mistake! Because 67 degrees is not 67 radians. Oh no, that's a big error. So I should have converted degrees to radians before computing the sine.

Wait, I think that's where I went wrong. Because if I compute sin(67 degrees) as 0.9205, but if I mistakenly thought it's in radians, then I would have a problem. Wait, no, in reality, I correctly computed sin(67 degrees), right?

Wait, but perhaps I should double-check that. Let me compute sin(67°) correctly in radians.

67 degrees is 67 * pi / 180 ≈ 1.16937 radians.

Yes, sin(1.16937) ≈ 0.9205.

So that part is correct.

Hmm, so why is the result so small? The options are much larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the imaginary part. Let me think again.

The formula I used is Im(f) = sum [ (2l+1) sin²(δ_l) ] / k.

But wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum [ (2l+1) sin(δ_l) ] / k multiplied by something else? Or perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2?

Wait, let me think about the partial wave expansion again. The scattering amplitude is f = sum [ (2l+1)/(2ik) ] e^{iδ_l} (1 - e^{2iδ_l}) ) P_l(cosθ).

Wait, wait, no, I think I confused it. The standard expression is f(s) = sum [ (2l+1)/(k) ] sin(δ_l) e^{iδ_l} P_l(cosθ).

Wait, another source: In scattering theory, the partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude f is given by:

f(θ,φ) = 4π Σ [ (l−1/2)! (2l+1) (2l)!)^{-1/2} ] [ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) sinδ_l ] (1/(ik)) P_l(cosθ)

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me check from a textbook.

According to Quantum Mechanics by Griffiths, the scattering amplitude is given by f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) [ (sin δ_l) e^{i δ_l} ] P_l(cosθ).

Wait, but that's what I used earlier. So the formula is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the wrong k? Alternatively, perhaps the given phase shifts are in radians, but I treated them as degrees. Wait, but the question says the phase shifts are given in degrees, e.g., δ0=90°, so I correctly converted them.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, not degrees? Oh! That's a possible mistake. Let me check the question again. It says "phase shifts δ0=90^o, δ_1=67^o, etc." So they are in degrees. So I correctly converted them.

Hmm. So I'm not seeing any mistake in the calculation. But according to this, the answer is about 0.036 fm, which is not among the options. So I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude multiplied by k? Or perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is sum [ (2l+1) sin(δ_l) * cos(δ_l) ] / k.

No, because the imaginary part comes from the sin^2(δ_l) term.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the Born approximation or something else, but I don't see how that applies here.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum without the k, but given that the options are in the hundreds of fm, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1e15 or something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me check that again.

k = E/(ħ c) → E=50 MeV.

ħ = 6.582e-25 MeV·s.

c =3e8 m/s → which is 3e23 fm/s.

So, ħ c =6.582e-25 *3e23 = (6.582 *3) *1e(-25+23) → 19.746e-2 → 0.19746 MeV·fm.

So, k =50 MeV / 0.19746 MeV·fm → 50 /0.19746 ≈253.2 fm^-1.

So k is 253.2 fm^-1.

Hmm, so Im(f) = sum/(k) =9.1023 /253.2 ≈0.03595 fm.

But the options are in the thousands of fm, so perhaps I'm making a mistake in the units somewhere. Let me think about this again.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in units of fm, but perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude includes a factor that I'm missing. Let me check another source.

Wait, perhaps the scattering amplitude f has units of length (fm), which it does. So Im(f) is in fm. So 0.03595 fm is about 0.036 fm, but the options are 177.675 fm (option C), 251.271 fm (D), etc.

Wait, perhaps I should multiply by 2. Alternatively, perhaps I forgot to account for the 4π factor somewhere. Wait, in the formula for f, does it include a 1/(4π) factor? Let me think.

Wait, in the partial wave expansion, f(θ) is given as f = (1/k) sum [ (2l+1) sin(δ_l) e^{i δ_l} ] P_l(cosθ).

So, the formula I used earlier is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, but I treated them as degrees. That would change everything.

Wait, if the phase shifts are in radians, let's recalculate.

For example, l=0: δ0=90 radians is impossible, but perhaps it's a typo, but the question says 90^o, so they're definitely in degrees.

I'm really stuck. Let me think if I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the sum.

Let me recompute each term:

l=0: (2*0+1) * sin^2(90) =1 *1=1 → correct.

l=1: 3 * sin^2(67°) → sin(67°)=0.9205 → sin^2=0.8473 → 3*0.8473=2.5419.

l=2:5 * sin^2(55) → sin(55)=0.8192 → 0.6710 →5 *0.671≈3.355.

l=3:7 * sin^2(30)=7*(0.5)^2=7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 * sin^2(13) → sin(13)=0.22495 → sin^2≈0.0506 → 9*0.0506≈0.455.

Sum: 1 +2.5419=3.5419; +3.355=6.8969; +1.75=8.6469; +0.455≈9.102.

So sum is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the phase shifts are for the real part, but no, the question is about the imaginary part.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is sum [ (2l+1) sin(δ_l) ] / k. But that would be different. Let me compute that sum.

Sum for l=0 to4 of (2l+1) sin(δ_l):

l=0:1 *1=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)=3*0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55)=5*0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 *sin(13)=9*0.22495≈2.02455.

Sum:1 +2.7615=3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.02455≈13.382.

So sum is 13.382. Then Im(f) =13.382 /253.2 ≈0.05286 fm.

Still way off the options.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to compute using another approach, perhaps using the given options to see which one fits.

Wait, the options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Wait, let's compute what the sum would need to be to get each option when divided by k=253.2 fm.

For example, option D is 251.271 fm.

sum = Im(f) *k =251.271 *253.2 → let me compute that.

251.271 *253.2 ≈ 251 *253 = approx 63,503.

But earlier, the sum is 9.1023. So that's nowhere near.

Hmm, this suggests that either my approach is wrong, or I'm making a calculation mistake.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f = sum [ (2l+1) sin(δ_l) e^{i δ_l} ] / (k) * 2.

Wait, some sources include a factor of 2. Let me think.

Wait, in the partial wave expansion, the formula can sometimes include a factor depending on the source. For example, some sources write f = sum [ (2l+1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1) sin δ_l ] / (2ik) P_l(cosθ).

Wait, if that's the case, then the imaginary part would be sum [ (2l+1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1) sin δ_l ] / (2ik) * P_l(1).

Hmm, let me compute that.

(e^{iδ_l} - e^{-iδ_l}) = 2i sin δ_l.

Wait, e^{2iδ_l} -1 = e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} - e^{-iδ_l}) ) / (e^{iδ_l}) ) → not sure.

Wait, another approach: e^{2iδ_l} -1 = e^{iδ_l} * [ e^{iδ_l} - e^{-iδ_l} ] / e^{iδ_l} ? No, wait, that's not correct. Let me compute (e^{2iδ_l} -1) sin δ_l.

(e^{2iδ_l} -1) = e^{iδ_l} (e^{iδ_l} - e^{-iδ_l}) ) = e^{iδ_l} (2i sin δ_l).

So, (e^{2iδ_l} -1) sin δ_l = e^{iδ_l} (2i sin^2 δ_l).

So, for the term in f, it's (2l+1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1) sin δ_l / (2ik) = (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (2i sin^2 δ_l) / (2ik) ) = (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin^2 δ_l (i/k).

So the imaginary part of this term is (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l (1/k).

Which brings us back to Im(f) = sum [ (2l+1) sin²(δ_l) ] / k.

So the formula I used is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem statement is asking for the imaginary part multiplied by k, which would give a unit of 1/(fm) * fm = dimensionless, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f = sum [ (2l+1) sin(δ_l) e^{iδ_l} ] * (1/k) * (k something else), but I'm not sure.

Another thought: perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, and I treated them as degrees. Let me recalculate the sum with radians.

Wait, if the phase shifts are in radians, then:

l=0: δ0=90 radians → which is impossible because 90 radians is way beyond 2π. So that can't be. So that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are in degrees, but when I compute sin(δ_l), I have to convert them to radians.

Wait, that's what I did earlier. For example, δ1=67 degrees → 67 *pi/180 radians. So I think I did it right.

Wait, maybe I should recheck the k calculation. Let me compute k in a different way.

Another way to compute k:

k = p / ħ.

p = gamma m v.

But for ultra-relativistic electrons, E ≈ pc → p = E/(c).

So, p = (50 MeV)/c.

So, ħ is 6.582e-25 MeV·s.

So, k = p/ħ = (50 MeV/c) / (6.582e-25 MeV·s) ) → 50/(6.582e-25) * 1/(c) → 50/(6.582e-25) ≈7.59e25 s^{-1} m.

Wait, but 1/(c) is approximately 3.335e-9 s/m.

So, 7.59e25 s^{-1} m * 3.335e-9 s/m → 7.59e25 *3.335e-9 = 2.53e17 m^{-1}.

Which is the same as 2.53e17 m^{-1} → convert to fm^{-1}.

1 fm =1e-15 m → 1 m =1e15 fm.

So, 2.53e17 m^{-1} = 2.53e17 / (1e15) ) fm^{-1} = 253 fm^{-1}.

So k=253 fm^{-1}.

Which brings me back to the same value.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude includes a factor of 1/(4π) or something else. Let me think.

Wait, if the formula is f = sum [ (2l+1) sin(δ_l) e^{i δ_l} ] / (k) * (1/ (4π)) ), but I don't think so. I think the standard formula doesn't include that.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is asking for the imaginary part of f multiplied by k. So, Im(f) * k = sum [ (2l+1) sin^2(δ_l) ].

But in that case, the sum is 9.1023, which would not correspond to any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f = sum [ (2l+1) sin(δ_l) e^{i δ_l} ] / (2ik) ), which would introduce an additional factor of 1/(2i).

Hmm, let me try that.

In that case, Im(f) would be sum [ (2l+1) sin^2(δ_l) ] / (2k).

So, 9.1023 / (2 *253.2) →9.1023/(506.4)≈0.018 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f = sum [ (2l+1) sin(δ_l) e^{i δ_l} ] / (k) * (1/(2π)) ).

In that case, Im(f) would be sum [ (2l+1) sin^2(δ_l) ] / (2π k).

So 9.1023 / (2 *3.1416 *253.2) → 9.1023/(1590.4)≈0.0057 fm.

Still not in the options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, but I treated them as degrees. Let me try that.

For example, δ1=67 degrees → 67 radians is way too big. Sin(67 radians) is not 0.9205. So that's not possible. So I think that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the given phase shifts are small and I made a mistake in their values.

Wait, the given phase shifts are δ0=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, δ4=13°.

Wait, but for higher l, the phase shifts are smaller, which makes sense. So the calculation seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I should multiply by a factor I forgot. Another possibility is that the formula for the imaginary part is sum [ (2l+1) ] times sin^2(δ_l), but without dividing by k.

In that case, sum is 9.1023, which is about 9.1. But the options are in the hundreds.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the k is in units of inverse fm, but I have k=253 fm^{-1}, so 1/k is 0.00395 fm. So the sum is 9.1023 * 0.00395 ≈0.036 fm, which is what I have.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f = sum [ (2l+1) sin(δ_l) e^{i δ_l} ] * (k) / (some constant). But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the formula for the imaginary part. Let me think again.

The general formula is f(θ) = sum [ (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} -1) sin δ_l ] / (2ik) P_l(cosθ).

Wait, if that's the case, then the imaginary part would be sum [ (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} -1) sin δ_l ] / (2k) P_l(1).

Because P_l(1)=1.

Now, e^{i δ_l} -1 = e^{i δ_l} - e^{0} = e^{i δ_l/2} * 2i sin(δ_l/2).

So, (e^{i δ_l} -1) sin δ_l = 2i e^{i δ_l/2} sin^2(δ_l/2) * sin δ_l.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated, but let's try.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider f as f = (1/(2ik)) sum [ (2l+1) (e^{2i δ_l} -1) sin δ_l ].

Then, the imaginary part of f would be (1/(2k)) sum [ (2l+1) (e^{2i δ_l} -1) sin δ_l ] * Im(1/(2ik)) ?

No, perhaps it's better to compute the imaginary part directly.

Wait, let me compute (e^{i δ_l} -1) sin δ_l.

(e^{i δ_l} -1) = e^{i δ_l} - 1 = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l -1 = [cos δ_l -1] + i sin δ_l.

So, (e^{i δ_l} -1) sin δ_l = [ (cos δ_l -1) + i sin δ_l ] * sin δ_l.

The imaginary part of this is sin^2 δ_l.

So, the term (e^{i δ_l} -1) sin δ_l has an imaginary part of sin^2 δ_l.

Thus, the imaginary part of f would be sum [ (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l ] / (2k).

Which would be sum/(2k) → 9.1023/(2*253.2) ≈9.1023/506.4≈0.018 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. Perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect, and I should look for another approach.

Another possibility is that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by (k/(4π)) sum [ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ].

Wait, if that's the case, then Im(f) = (k/(4π)) sum [ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ].

But I'm not sure about this formula. Let me check.

Wait, in some references, the scattering amplitude is expressed as f = (1/(2ik)) sum [ (2l+1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1) sin δ_l ].

So, let's compute the imaginary part of this.

The term (e^{2iδ_l} -1) = e^{i 2δ_l} -1 = cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l) -1 = [cos(2δ_l) -1] + i sin(2δ_l).

Multiplying by sin δ_l:

sin δ_l [ (cos(2δ_l) -1) + i sin(2δ_l) ].

The imaginary part is sin δ_l * sin(2δ_l).

So, the imaginary part of f is sum [ (2l+1) * sin δ_l * sin(2δ_l) ] / (2k).

Which is (1/(2k)) sum [ (2l+1) sin δ_l sin(2δ_l) ].

Hmm, perhaps I should compute this.

Let me compute each term:

l=0:

(2*0+1) * sin(90) * sin(180) → 1 *1 *0=0.

l=1:

3 * sin(67) * sin(134) → sin(67)=0.9205, sin(134)=sin(180-46)=sin(46)=0.7193 → 3 *0.9205 *0.7193 ≈3 *0.663 ≈1.989.

l=2:

5 * sin(55) * sin(110) → sin(55)=0.8192, sin(110)=sin(70)=0.9397 →5 *0.8192 *0.9397 ≈5*(0.769)≈3.845.

l=3:

7 * sin(30) * sin(60) → 0.5 * (√3/2) → 7 *0.5 *0.8660 ≈7*0.4330≈3.031.

l=4:

9 * sin(13) * sin(26) → sin(13)=0.22495, sin(26)=0.4384 →9*0.22495 *0.4384 ≈9*(0.0985)≈0.8865.

Summing these terms:

0 + 1.989 =1.989; +3.845=5.834; +3.031=8.865; +0.8865=9.7515.

Im(f) = (9.7515)/(2*253.2) ≈9.7515/506.4≈0.01925 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I should try to think outside the box. Perhaps the problem is using the real part instead of the imaginary part, but the question clearly asks for the imaginary part.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f = sum [ (2l+1) sin(δ_l) e^{iδ_l} ] / (k) * (1/2).

In that case, Im(f) would be sum [ (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l ] / (2k).

So, 9.1023/(2*253.2) →≈0.018 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm. I'm not seeing where I could have gone wrong, but according to my calculations, the answer is approximately 0.036 fm, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption about the formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is asking for the total cross-section instead of the scattering amplitude. But the question specifically mentions the scattering amplitude.

Wait, the cross-section is given by σ = 4π |f|^2 /k. But that's not the same as the imaginary part of f.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part is the sum of (2l +1) sin(δ_l) (1 + cos(θ)), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the formula for Im(f) is sum [ (2l+1) sin δ_l (1 + cosθ) ] / (k).

But along θ=0, cosθ=1. So Im(f)= sum [ (2l+1) sin δ_l *2 ] / (k).

So, (2l+1)*2 sin δ_l.

Let me compute that sum:

l=0:1 *2 *1=2.

l=1:3*2 *0.9205≈3*1.841=5.523.

l=2:5*2 *0.8192≈5*1.6384≈8.192.

l=3:7*2 *0.5=7*1=7.

l=4:9*2 *0.22495≈9*0.4499≈4.049.

Sum: 2 +5.523=7.523; +8.192=15.715; +7=22.715; +4.049≈26.764.

Im(f)=26.764/(253.2)≈0.1057 fm.

Still not matching options.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum [ (2l+1) sin(δ_l) ] / (k).

Sum [ (2l+1) sin(δ_l) ]:

l=0:1*1=1.

l=1:3*0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5*0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9*0.22495≈2.0245.

Sum≈1+2.7615=3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.0245≈13.382.

Im(f)=13.382/253.2≈0.05286 fm.

Still not matching options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum [ (2l+1) ] / (k).

So sum is 1+3+5+7+9=25.

Im(f) =25/253.2≈0.0988 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm. Perhaps I should conclude that I'm making a mistake in the formula. Let me think again about the correct formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude.

After some research, I realize that for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0, the formula is indeed Im(f) = sum [ (2l+1) sin^2(δ_l) ] / k.

So according to that, the calculation is correct, but the result doesn't match any of the options. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the phase shifts provided, or perhaps the question has a typo.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians, and I treated them as degrees. Let me try that, even though it's unlikely.

For example, l=0: δ0=90 radians → which is way too big, leading to sin(δ0) being zero or undefined. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given in units other than degrees. But the question clearly states degrees.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum. Let me recompute the sum of (2l+1) sin^2(δ_l):

l=0:1 *1=1.

l=1:3 * (sin(67°))² → sin(67)=0.9205 → (0.9205)^2≈0.8473 →3*0.8473=2.5419.

l=2:5 * (sin(55))^2 → sin(55)=0.8192 →0.8192^2=0.6710 →5*0.6710=3.355.

l=3:7 * (0.5)^2=7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 * (sin(13))^2 → sin(13)=0.22495 →0.22495²≈0.0506 →9*0.0506≈0.455.

Sum=1+2.5419=3.5419; +3.355=6.8969; +1.75=8.6469; +0.455≈9.102.

Yes, sum is correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question asks for the real part instead of the imaginary part. Let me compute that.

Real part Re(f)= sum [ (2l+1) sin(δ_l) cos(δ_l) ] / k.

So for each term:

l=0:1 *1 *0=0.

l=1:3 *0.9205 * cos(67)=3*0.9205*(0.3907)=3*(0.360)=1.08.

l=2:5 *0.8192 * cos(55)=5 *0.8192 *0.5736=5*(0.4704)=2.352.

l=3:7 *0.5 * cos(30)=7 *0.5 * (√3/2)=7*(0.5*0.8660)=7*0.4330≈3.031.

l=4:9 *0.22495 * cos(13)=9*0.22495 *0.9744≈9*(0.2195)=1.9755.

Sum:0 +1.08=1.08; +2.352=3.432; +3.031=6.463; +1.9755≈8.4385.

Re(f)=8.4385 /253.2≈0.0333 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm. I'm at a loss. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the phase shifts δ_l without considering the factor of 2. For example, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum [ (2l+1) sin(δ_l) ] / k.

Which would give sum=13.382, leading to Im(f)=13.382/253.2≈0.05286 fm. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the sum of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) / (2k). Let me compute that.

Sum of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l):

l=0:1 * sin(0)=0.

l=1:3 * sin(134°)=3*sin(134)=3*0.7193≈2.158.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5*0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7*(√3/2)=7*0.8660≈6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9*0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum= 0+2.158=2.158; +4.6985=6.8565; +6.062=12.9185; +3.9456≈16.8641.

Im(f)=16.8641/(2*253.2)≈16.8641/506.4≈0.0333 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= sum [ (2l+1) ] * sin(δ_l) / k.

Sum of (2l+1)=1+3+5+7+9=25.

So Im(f)=25 * sin(δ_avg) /k.

But I don't think that's correct.

Hmm.

Another idea: perhaps the problem uses the formula Im(f) = sum [ (2l+1) ] * (1 - cos(2δ_l)) / (2k).

Which comes from sin^2(δ_l)= (1 -cos(2δ_l))/2.

So Im(f)= sum [ (2l+1)(1 - cos(2δ_l)) / 2 ] / k.

But I don't think this is correct, but let me compute it.

Compute each term:

l=0:1 * (1 - cos(180)) /2 →1*(1 - (-1))/2= (2)/2=1.

l=1:3*(1 - cos(134°))/2 → cos(134)≈-0.6947 →1 - (-0.6947)=1.6947 →3*1.6947/2≈2.542.

l=2:5*(1 - cos(110)) /2 → cos(110)=cos(180-70)= -cos(70)= -0.3420 →1 - (-0.3420)=1.3420 →5*1.3420/2≈3.355.

l=3:7*(1 - cos(60)) /2 → cos(60)=0.5 →1-0.5=0.5 →7*0.5/2=1.75.

l=4:9*(1 - cos(26)) /2 → cos(26)=0.8988 →1-0.8988=0.1012 →9*0.1012/2≈0.4554.

Sum:1 +2.542=3.542; +3.355=6.897; +1.75=8.647; +0.4554≈9.102.

Im(f)=9.102 /253.2≈0.03595 fm.

Same result as before.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. I think I've tried all possible approaches, but none lead to the given options. Perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial understanding of the problem.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the formula Im(f) = sum [ (2l+1) ] * (1 + cosθ) * sin^2 δ_l / (2k).

But along θ=0, cosθ=1, so (1+1)=2.

So Im(f)= sum [ (2l+1)*2 sin^2 δ_l ] / (2k ) = sum [ (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l ] /k.

Which brings me back to the same result.

Hmm.

Given that none of the approaches yield any of the provided options, I'm forced to reconsider. Perhaps the formula for k was incorrect. Let me recompute k using a different approach.

I think the correct formula for k is:

k = sqrt(2mE) / ħ.

But for E=50 MeV, m is the electron mass, which is about 9.1e-31 kg.

So, E in joules is 50e6 eV * 1.6e-19 J/eV=8e-13 J.

Compute k = sqrt(2 * m * E ) / ħ.

Compute 2*m*E: 2 *9.1e-31 kg *8e-13 J = 2*9.1e-31 *8e-13 = 1.456e-43 kg·J.

sqrt(1.456e-43)=approx 3.816e-22 m^{-1}.

Wait, 3.816e-22 m^{-1} is 3.816e-7 fm^{-1}.

Because 1 fm=1e-15 m → 1 fm^{-1}=1e15 m^{-1}.

So 3.816e-22 m^{-1}=3.816e-22 *1e15 fm^{-1}=3.816e-7 fm^{-1}.

So, k≈3.816e-7 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that's a very small k. So Im(f)= sum/(k) =9.1023/(3.816e-7)≈23.84e6 fm.

Which is option A: 87163.4 fm is much smaller than this, so perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Hmm. Clearly, I'm making a mistake in calculating k because using the relativistic approach and the non-relativistic approach give vastly different k values.

In the relativistic approach, E=pc, and k=p/ħ= E/(ħ c)=50 MeV/(6.582e-25 MeV·s *3e8 m/s) ) → which gives k≈253 fm^-1.

In the non-relativistic approach, k=sqrt(2mE)/ħ→8e-13 J*2m=1.456e-43 kg·J → sqrt is 3.8e-22 m^-1→3.8e-7 fm^-1.

But the correct approach for 50 MeV electrons (which is highly relativistic) is the relativistic formula, so k=253 fm^-1.

Thus, the calculation of Im(f)=0.03595 fm, which isn't among the options.

Given that, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I've misread the question.

Wait, the question says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ4. So perhaps I should include all l=0 to l=4, which I did.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the imaginary part is given by summing (2l+1) * (1 - cos(δ_l)) / (2k).

But let me compute that.

Sum of (2l+1)(1 - cos(δ_l)) /2:

l=0:1*(1- (-1))/2=1*(2)/2=1.

l=1:3*(1 - cos(67°))/2 → cos(67)=0.3907 →1-0.3907=0.6093 →3 *0.6093/2≈0.914.

l=2:5*(1 - cos(55°))/2 → cos(55)=0.5736 →1-0.5736=0.4264 →5*0.4264/2≈1.066.

l=3:7*(1 - cos(30))/2 → cos(30)=0.8660 →1-0.8660=0.134 →7*0.134/2≈0.470.

l=4:9*(1 - cos(13°))/2 → cos(13)=0.9744 →1-0.9744=0.0256 →9*0.0256/2≈0.1152.

Sum:1 +0.914=1.914; +1.066=3.0; +0.470=3.47; +0.1152≈3.585.

Im(f)=3.585 /253.2≈0.01416 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. The only conclusion is that the correct answer isn't matching the options, but since I must choose an option, I'll recheck my steps for any possible mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me compute k= E/(ħ c) again.

E=50 MeV.

ħ=6.582e-25 MeV·s.

c=3e8 m/s.

So, ħ c=6.582e-25 *3e8 =1.9746e-16 MeV·m.

So, k=50 / 1.9746e-16 MeV/(MeV·m) ) →50 /1.9746e-16=25.32e16 m^-1 →2.532e17 m^-1.

Which is 2.532e17 m^-1. To convert to fm^-1: 1 m=1e15 fm →1 m^-1=1e-15 fm^-1.

So, 2.532e17 m^-1 =2.532e17 *1e-15 fm^-1=253.2 fm^-1.

So k=253.2 fm^-1.

Thus, Im(f)=9.1023 /253.2=0.03595 fm.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but considering the options, perhaps the closest is option D:251.271 fm, which is approximately 253 fm, but that's the value of k, not Im(f).

Wait a second! Perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the answer is actually k multiplied by the sum.

Sum is 9.1023.

If I multiply by k=253.2 fm^-1, I get 9.1023 *253.2 ≈2308 fm.

Which isn't any of the options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum [ (2l+1) ] /k.

Sum is 25.

So, 25/253.2≈0.0988 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum [ (2l+1) ] * (some factor of 1e-15 or similar).

But I can't think of any other approach.

In conclusion, despite my best efforts, I can't reconcile my calculation with any of the provided options. However, given that the sum is approximately 9.1 and k is around 253, the only option that might fit if there's a missing factor is option D: 251.271 fm, which is very close to k (253.2 fm^-1), but that's not the same as Im(f).

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is 25, leading to Im(f)=25/253.2≈0.0988 fm, but that's not an option.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is sum [ (2l+1) ] times (some conversion factor).

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = sum [ (2l+1) ] * (1e-15 m) /k.

But 1e-15 m is 1 fm.

Wait, that would make Im(f)=25 * 1e-15 m / (253.2 fm^-1 ) → 25e-15 m * (1e15 fm) / (253.2 fm) ) →25 * (1e0) /253.2 →≈0.0988 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= sum [ (2l+1) ] * (1e15 m) /k.

So, 25 *1e15 m / (253.2e15 m^-1 ) →25 *1e15 /253.2e15 →25/253.2≈0.0988 fm.

Same result.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck and have to conclude that, based on my calculations, the correct answer isn't among the options. But since I have to choose, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum calculation.

Wait, let me check the sum again.

l=0:1.

l=1:3*(0.9205)^2=3*0.8473=2.5419.

l=2:5*(0.8192)^2=5*0.671=3.355.

l=3:7*(0.5)^2=7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9*(0.22495)^2=9*0.0506≈0.4554.

Sum:1 +2.5419=3.5419 +3.355=6.8969 +1.75=8.6469 +0.4554=9.1023.

Yes, sum is correct.

Thus, I think the correct answer isn't listed. But perhaps the intended approach was to compute sum * (some factor) leading to option D:251.271 fm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= sum [ (2l+1) ] * (1/(k)).

But sum is 25, so 25/253.2≈0.0988 fm.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is 25, and 25 * k ≈25 *253.2=6330 fm, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is 9.1, and 9.1 * k ≈9.1 *253.2≈2308 fm, which is option A:87163.4 fm is way larger.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= sum [ (2l+1) ] * (1/(k)) * (1e15 fm).

So, 25 *1e15 fm /253.2 →25e15 /253.2e15=25/253.2≈0.0988 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the sum of (2l+1) * l +1, but that's stretching it.

Another approach: perhaps the question is about the differential cross-section, not the amplitude. The differential cross-section is given by dσ/dΩ = |f|^2.

But the question specifically asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude.

Hmm.

I think I've tried all possible avenues and can't find a way to match the options. Perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but given the options, I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the sum and k, none of the options fit, but perhaps the intended answer is option D:251.271 fm.

Wait, but that would mean Im(f)=251.271 fm. Which would imply sum= Im(f)*k=251.271 *253.2≈63650, which is way larger than our sum of 9.1.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the sum is 251.271 *k=253.2 → sum=251.271 *253.2≈63650, which is way off.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= sum [ (2l+1) ] * (k) →25 *253.2≈6330 fm, which is not an option.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. The correct answer based on calculations is approximately 0.036 fm, which isn't listed. Therefore, I must conclude that either the options are incorrect, or I made a mistake in the approach. Given the options and the time I've spent, I'll have to select the closest possible option, which I can't find. Therefore, I think the intended answer is option D:251.271 fm, but I can't see how it fits.


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, \( \text{Im}(f) \), for elastic electron scattering at an incident angle \( \theta = 0^\circ \), given the phase shifts \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \), and ignoring higher-order phase shifts. The formula for \( \text{Im}(f) \) along \( \theta = 0^\circ \) is derived from the partial wave expansion:

\[
\text{Im}(f) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l + 1) \sin^2(\delta_l),
\]

where \( k \) is the wave number. For the given energy \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \), \( k \) is calculated using the relativistic relation \( k = \frac{E}{\hbar c} \), yielding \( k \approx 253.2 \, \text{fm}^{-1} \).

### Key Steps:
1. **Phase Shift Contributions**: For each \( l \), the contribution to \( \text{Im}(f) \) is \( (2l + 1) \sin^2(\delta_l) \). The contributions are:
   - \( l = 0 \): \( 1 \cdot \sin^2(90^\circ) = 1 \),
   - \( l = 1 \): \( 3 \cdot \sin^2(67^\circ) \approx 2.5419 \),
   - \( l = 2 \): \( 5 \cdot \sin^2(55^\circ) \approx 3.355 \),
   - \( l = 3 \): \( 7 \cdot \sin^2(30^\circ) = 1.75 \),
   - \( l = 4 \): \( 9 \cdot \sin^2(13^\circ) \approx 0.4554 \).

   Summing these gives \( \sum = 1 + 2.5419 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554 \approx 9.1023 \).

2. **Imaginary Part Calculation**: Using \( \text{Im}(f) = \frac{\sum}{k} \), substituting \( \sum \approx 9.1023 \) and \( k \approx 253.2 \, \text{fm}^{-1} \), we find:
   \[
   \text{Im}(f) \approx \frac{9.1023}{253.2} \approx 0.03595 \, \text{fm}.
   \]

3. **Mismatch with Options**: The calculated value \( \text{Im}(f) \approx 0.036 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the provided options. The options are significantly larger, suggesting a possible error in the interpretation of the formula, units, or the problem setup.

### Critical Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (\( 87163.4 \, \text{fm} \))**: This is orders of magnitude larger than the calculated value and inconsistent with the formula.
- **Option B (\( 355.351 \, \text{fm} \))**: Also far too large, exceeding the calculated value by several orders of magnitude.
- **Option C (\( 177.675 \, \text{fm} \))**: Similarly inconsistent with the derived result.
- **Option D (\( 251.271 \, \text{fm} \))**: Closest to the calculated \( k \approx 253.2 \, \text{fm}^{-1} \), but not directly related to \( \text{Im}(f) \).

### Conclusion:
The calculated \( \text{Im}(f) \approx 0.036 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the provided options. However, based on the proximity of \( k \approx 253.2 \, \text{fm}^{-1} \) to Option D (\( 251.271 \, \text{fm} \)), and assuming a possible misinterpretation of the formula or units, **Option D** is selected as the most plausible answer.
