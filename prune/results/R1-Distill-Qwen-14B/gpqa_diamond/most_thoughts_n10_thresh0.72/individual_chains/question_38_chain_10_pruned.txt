Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question about enamine reactions. Hmm, I remember that enamine reactions involve the condensation of secondary amines with carbonyl compounds. Wait, wait, but in this case, the starting material is an enamine already, right?

The question is giving me a starting compound: (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. I need to figure out what happens when it reacts with reagent A to give product B. Then, I have to select the correct sequence of reagents.

Let me think about enamine chemistry. Enamines are typically formed from a ketone or aldehyde and a secondary amine. They're useful in reactions because they can undergo various transformations, like nucleophilic substitutions or additions, which are then hydrolyzed back to the corresponding products.

Wait, but in this case, the starting compound is the enamine itself. So what's the typical reaction of enamines? Oh right! When enamines react with an electrophile, they can perform a conjugate addition. The enamine acts as a nucleophile at the less substituted end, leading to a new carbon-carbon bond. After that, hydrolysis usually gives a ketone and an amine.

So the general steps are: form the enamine (if not already present), react with an electrophile (like an alkyl halide), then hydrolyze.

Looking at the starting material: (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. Let me draw the structure. The ethanaminium part is CH3NH+CH2. The pentan-2-ylidene is a CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- group attached to a double bond. Wait, no, pentan-2-ylidene is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond at position 2? No, wait, pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2=CH-(CH2)2-CH2? Maybe.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So the ethanaminium is a CH2-CH2N group, but with a methyl attached. Wait, the structure is:

Ethanaminium is CH
