Okay, so I have this question about the density matrix of a qubit, and I'm supposed to find its geometrical position in the qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. 

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, that looks familiar. I think this is the maximally mixed state for a qubit. A maximally mixed state is like the classical mixture of the two basis states, right? So it's as if the qubit is in a completely random state between |0> and |1>, with equal probability.

But how does this relate to the geometrical position? Oh, right! I remember that the space of density matrices for a qubit can be represented using the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize all possible states of a qubit. Each point on the sphere corresponds to a pure state, and mixed states are points inside the sphere.

For a general qubit state, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The Bloch vector r has components (x, y, z) which correspond to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. The formula is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and I is the identity matrix.

So, let me expand the given ρ. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute each term. |0><0| is a matrix that's 1 in the (1,1) position and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is 1 in (2,2), others zero. Adding them together, I get a diagonal matrix with 1s on the diagonal. Then, multiplying by 1/2, each diagonal element becomes 1/2. So ρ is a 2x2 identity matrix multiplied by 1/2. Wait, because (|0><0| + |1><1|) is the identity matrix I, right? Because |0> and |1> are orthonormal and their projectors add up to the identity.

So ρ is (I)/2. Now, comparing this to the Bloch form. The Bloch form is (I + r·σ)/2. So setting them equal: I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2. That implies that I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2. Subtracting I/2 from both sides gives 0 = r·σ/2. So r·σ must be zero. That means each component of r multiplied by the corresponding Pauli matrix sums to zero. The only way that can happen is if r is the zero vector. Because the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z and they are all non-zero and independent. So for their sum to be zero when multiplied by some coefficients (r_x, r_y, r_z), each coefficient must be zero.

So the Bloch vector r is (0, 0, 0). That would put the state at the center of the Bloch sphere. Which makes sense because the maximally mixed state is the completely depolarized state, sitting at the origin. So the geometrical position is (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which must be the correct answer.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state for a qubit, where the qubit is in a completely random superposition of the basis states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\) with equal probability. To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. 

The Bloch vector \(r = (x, y, z)\) corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices and is related to the density matrix by the formula:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + r \cdot \sigma}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix and \(\sigma = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this to the given \(\rho\), we see that:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

Substituting into the Bloch form, we find:

\[
\frac{I}{2} = \frac{I + r \cdot \sigma}{2}.
\]

This implies that \(r \cdot \sigma = 0\). The only solution to this equation is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\), meaning the Bloch vector is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. This corresponds to the maximally mixed state, which is located at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).
