Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet, or the closer it is to the star, I think.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet similar to Neptune. So the planets have about the same mass. Both planets are in circular orbits.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I need to relate the Doppler shift to the orbital period. Oh right, the RV method depends on the semi-amplitude of the velocity variation, K. The formula for K is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) ) ) * (some other factors), but since e is zero (circular orbits), that term goes away. Also, since M_planet is much less than M_star (because Neptune is much less than Sun), M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star.

Wait, but in reality, the formula for semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ) ] * ( (2π) / (P) ) )^(1/3) ) / ( (1 AU) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recall the correct formula. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2π) / P )^(1/3) ) / ( (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) )

But since M_p << M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, and neglect M_p. So K = ( (G * M_p ) / M_* )^(1/3) ) * ( (2π) / P )^(1/3) ) / sqrt(1 - e²). Since e=0, that last term is 1. So K simplifies to:

K = ( (G * M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( M_*^(1/3) ) ) * (2π / P )^(1/3)

We can rearrange this to solve for P. Let me write it out:

K = [ (G * M_p) / (M_* ) ]^(1/3) * (2π)^(1/3) / P^(1/3 )

Wait, let me get the exponents right. Let me cube both sides to make it easier.

K^3 = [ (G * M_p) / (M_* ) ] * (2π) / P

So rearranging for P:

P = ( (G * M_p) / (M_* ) ) * (2π) / K^3 )

But wait, that can't be right. Let me think again.

The original equation after simplifying is:

K = ( (G * M_p) / (M_* ) )^(1/3) * (2π / P )^(1/3 )

So, let's cube both sides:

K^3 = (G M_p / M_*) ) * (2π / P )

So, solving for P:

P = (2 π G M_p ) / ( M_* K^3 ) )

Hmm, but I'm not sure about the exact formula, but I know that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) P^(1/3)) ), but maybe I should think in terms of the velocity semi-amplitude formula.

Wait, another approach: the RV method depends on the star's velocity, which depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The star's velocity variation (K) is related to the planet's orbital period and mass.

Another formula I remember is K = (v) = ( ( (2π G) / (c P) ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) ) )

But I'm probably getting the exact formula wrong. Let's think about the relationship between K and P. Since both planets have the same mass and same star mass, perhaps I can relate K inversely to P^(1/3) ?

Wait, if M_p and M_* are the same, then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because in the formula, K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)).

So if K1 is the velocity of star 1 and K2 is that of star 2, then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) )

Wait, no. Wait, I think K is proportional to (M_p / (M_* )) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, let me get the formula right.

The formula for K is:

K = ( ( G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( ( 2π ) / ( P ) )^(1/3) ) / ( (
