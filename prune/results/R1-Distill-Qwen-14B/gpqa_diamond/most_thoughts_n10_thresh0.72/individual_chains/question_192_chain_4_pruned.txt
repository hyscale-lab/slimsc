Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The cavity's radius is r, and since r is less than R, the cavity is entirely within the conductor.

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Both L and l are greater than R, so point P is definitely outside. Also, the angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, okay. I remember that when charges are placed inside a conductor's cavity, the conductor's outer surface doesn't have any net charge if it was initially neutral. But wait, in this case, the conductor was uncharged. So any charges induced on the inner and outer surfaces would balance each other.

Let me think about the method of images or how charges distribute in such a setup. When a charge is inside a cavity of a conductor, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge opposite to it. So the inner surface would have -q. But since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have +q to balance. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The conductor was initially uncharged. So when +q is placed in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) will have -q induced. Because the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance the -q on the inner surface.

Wait, no, that's not right. Oh wait, no, if the conductor is neutral, the total charge is zero. So the inner surface has -q, so the outer surface must have +q so that the total is (-q) + (+q) = 0. That makes sense.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor. So to find the electric field there, the charges inside the conductor (like the induced charges on the inner and outer surfaces) would act as if they were all at the center, right? Because for a spherical conductor, the electric field outside is the same as if all the charge were at the center.

Wait, but wait. The conductor's outer surface has +q, so the electric field outside would be due to that +q. Because the point P is outside. So the electric field E at P would be the same as if the +q were concentrated at the center of the conductor. So the formula would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Because the distance from the center of the conductor to P is L.

But wait, what about the charge inside the cavity? The charge +q is inside, but the conductor's inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. But when outside the conductor, the field is due only to the charges on the outer surface, right? Because the inner charges are shielded. So the field at
