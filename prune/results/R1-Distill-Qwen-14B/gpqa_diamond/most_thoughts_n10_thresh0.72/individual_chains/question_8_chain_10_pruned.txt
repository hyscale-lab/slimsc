Okay, so I've got this genetics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

So, the setup is about white lupine plants and their resistance to a fungal disease called anthracnose. The experiment involves knocking out three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They made single mutants (g1, g2, g3) and double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The results show the resistance levels of these mutants compared to the wild type. The question is about the interaction of these genes, particularly which is a transcription factor and how they relate in the pathway.

Hmm. First, I need to understand what the resistance percentages mean. The control (wild type) is 100%, so if a mutant has lower resistance, it's more susceptible. So, let's look at the data:

- g1: 75% → so 75% resistance, meaning 25% susceptibility. Not very affected.
- g2: 0% → all plants infected. So, in the absence of G2, the plant can't resist the disease at all.
- g3: 50% → half the resistance of the wild type.
- g1g3: 10% → very susceptible.
- g2g3: 0% → same as g2. All infected.
- g1g2: 0% → same as g2.

Wait, so what do these results imply about the gene functions?

I remember that if a double mutant has the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, the gene that doesn't change the phenotype is epistatic. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene masks the effect of another. So, in this case, when you knock out both G1 and G2, the resistance is 0%, same as G2 alone. So, perhaps G2 is epistatic over G1. Because even when you have g1 (which alone has 75% resistance), adding g2 (which alone is 0%) makes the resistance as bad as g2 alone. So, G2 is epistatic to G1.

Similarly, looking at the g2g3 double mutant: 0% resistance. So, when you have the g2 mutation, adding g3 doesn't change the resistance. So, G2 is epistatic to G3 as well.

What about g1g3? The resistance is 10%, which is lower than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So combining g1 and g3 makes things much worse. So, maybe these two genes are in parallel pathways contributing to resistance. When both are knocked out, the resistance drops more than either alone. But in the double mutants with G2, it's completely gone. So, G2 is a key upstream gene.

The question states that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, which gene is that?

Looking at the data, g2 has 0% resistance. That's the most severe. So G2 might be a transcription factor because knocking it out completely abolishes resistance. If G2 is upstream, then knocking out G2 would disable the entire pathway, making the plant unable to resist. The other mutants (like g1) have partial resistance, suggesting that G2 is a key component.

Now, what about the other genes? G1 has 75% resistance. So, when G1 is knocked out, the plant is still somewhat resistant. But when G1 is combined with G2 knockout (g1g2), it's as bad as g2. So, that suggests that G1's function is either in the same pathway as G2 or downstream of it. But since G2 is epistatic, perhaps G2 is upstream of G1.

Wait, no, if G2 is epistatic, it suggests that G2 is acting downstream. Because in epistatic relationships, the epistatic gene is downstream. Let me think: If you have two genes where one is epistatic to the other, the epistatic gene is in a downstream position. So, if G2 is epistatic to G1, then G2 is downstream. But wait, in our case, the double mutant g1g2 is as bad as g2. So, the effect of G1 is only
