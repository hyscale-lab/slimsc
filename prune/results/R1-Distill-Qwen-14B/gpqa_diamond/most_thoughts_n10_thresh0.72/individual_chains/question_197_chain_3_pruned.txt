Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll have to think carefully.

The question is about identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are four different compounds, and I need to figure out which one is the product.

First, let me look at the data given: the IR and NMR spectra of Compound X.

Starting with the IR data: the peaks are at 3400-2500, 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm-1. Hmm, I remember that IR peaks can give information about functional groups. 

- The 3400-2500 region is usually O-H stretches. The broadness might suggest an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is usually around 2500-3300, and it's a broad peak. But wait, the IR also shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is strong. That usually indicates a carbonyl group. A carboxylic acid has a carbonyl around 1700, but maybe a bit higher. So maybe it's an ester or a ketone? Or maybe a carboxylic acid.

Then there's the 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks. Those are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So there's probably an aromatic ring in the compound.

Looking at the NMR data next: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

NMR analysis can be tricky, but let's break it down.

The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet integrating for 1H. That's probably an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, carboxylic acids also have O-H around that region, but it's a broad peak. Alternatively, an acidic proton like in a phenol? But phenol O-H is usually around 5-7 ppm, but if it's exchanging, maybe it's a broad peak. Hmm, but 10.5 is quite upfield. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde. Wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10, and the peak is broad, which suggests exchange with somethingâ€”maybe it's a COOH proton. Because in the IR, we saw a peak around 3400 which could be O-H. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

The next peaks: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggests an aromatic ring with two substituents in
