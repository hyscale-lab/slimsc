Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this nuclear decay question. Hmm, let me read it again.

The original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. The E particles have a continuous energy spectrum with an endpoint Q. Then there's a variant where instead of 2V, it emits one massless particle M. We need to compare the E spectrum in the two cases.

Wait, what do I remember about nuclear decay spectra? Oh right, in beta decay, the emitted electrons have a continuous spectrum because the process involves the conservation of energy and momentum. But in some cases, when another particle is emitted, the spectrum can change.

In the original decay, there are two E particles. The fact that their energy spectrum is continuous suggests that energy and momentum are shared between E and the other particles. So, for each decay, the energy and momentum of E must be determined based on the total available energy and the masses involved.

Now, in the original case, 2E and 2V are emitted. Oh wait, I think the presence of multiple particles affects the possible energies. But in the variant, we have 2E and 1M instead. Since M is massless, that might change the energy distribution.

Wait, the key point is about the endpoint. The endpoint Q is the maximum energy an E particle can have. How is that determined? The endpoint usually occurs when all the kinetic energy goes into one E particle, but that depends on the other particles emitted.

In the original decay: 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. The two V particles probably carry away some energy, perhaps as kinetic. Since they're lighter, their energies might be significant. But in the variant, it's 2A → 2B + 2E + M. So now, instead of two Vs, one M is emitted. Let's think about the conservation of energy and momentum.

In the original case, the decay products include more particles (two Vs), which would mean that the energy and momentum are distributed among more particles. So each E's maximum energy (endpoint) might be lower because some energy is taken by Vs. But wait, in the variant, we have only one M instead of two Vs. Since M is massless, it might carry away a lot of energy and momentum without contributing to the rest mass.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused
