Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully again and try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says that compounds A and B are treated separately with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. The result is two different diketones. I need to find out which starting materials A and B are from the given options.

Hmm, the products are 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione and 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione. Wait, what's the reaction here? Oh right, when a compound undergoes the treatment with HCl, NaNO2, and water, that's typically the conditions for a diazotization reaction, followed by some kind of reactionâ€”maybe a substitution or a rearrangement.

Wait, no, wait. Diazotization is usually for aromatic amines, but I think in this context, maybe it's about the formation of a carbocation? Or perhaps it's something else. Or maybe it's about the conversion of alcohols into ketones. Oh wait! I remember that when you treat an alcohol with HNO2 (nitrous acid) under certain conditions, especially in acidic conditions, it can lead to the formation of a carbonyl group. Like, maybe a Stephen reduction or something else? Wait, no, the Stephen reduction is for ketones to aldehydes. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the treatment with HCl, NaNO2, and water might be the conditions for a Hofmann elimination, but no, that's for amines. Or maybe it's about the conversion of an alcohol to a ketone via some mechanism. Oh! Oh wait, I think I remember something about the Beckmann rearrangement. No, that's for oximes. Or is it the formation of a carbonyl from a secondary alcohol under certain conditions?

Wait, maybe it's the conversion of a secondary alcohol to a ketone via a diazonium salt. Or wait, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. Alternatively, maybe it's the formation of a carbonyl via oxidation. But under what conditions? HCl and NaNO2... I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another thought: perhaps it's the formation of a geminal diol, but that's more about ozonolysis. No, that doesn't fit here.

Ah! Wait a second. I think I've got this. When a secondary alcohol is treated with nit
