Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll think it through.

The question says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. New particles are produced, and they travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector's radius is 30 meters. Now, they're asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Wait, Lorentz factor... Oh right, the Lorentz factor gamma is given by 1/sqrt(1 - vÂ²/cÂ²). But in ultra-relativistic speeds, v is very close to c, so gamma is large. But how does this tie into the particles reaching the detector walls?

I think it's about the time it takes for the particles to reach the walls. The particles need to travel from the center of the detector to the wall. The distance is the radius, which is 30 meters. So the time taken would be distance divided by the particle's speed.

But wait, in relativity, the particle's speed is v, so the time in the lab frame (the detector's frame) would be t = r / v. But since these are high-energy particles, maybe their lifetime is important. Oh, right, the particles are fast-decaying, so their lifetime determines how far they can travel before decaying.

So, the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame) is tau. The observed lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau because of time dilation. So the particles will travel a distance L = v * t, where t is gamma tau.

So L = v * gamma tau.

But wait, in the detector, only a fraction of the particles reach the walls. So the distance they need to travel is 30 meters. If the average distance they can travel is L, then the probability that they reach the wall is the fraction of particles for which L >= 30 meters.

Alternatively, maybe it's about
