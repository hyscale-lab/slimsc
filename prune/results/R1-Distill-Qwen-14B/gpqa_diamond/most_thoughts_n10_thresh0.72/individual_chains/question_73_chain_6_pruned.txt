Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just add them like you would in classical mechanics. I think I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula here.

The problem says the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question asks about their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, so I need to calculate both the relative velocity and the total energy to pick the right option.

First, let's tackle the relative speed. I recall the formula for relative velocity in special relativity. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Oh right, if one object is moving at velocity u and the other at velocity v in the same direction, the relative velocity of the first from the second's frame is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Wait, but in this case, both are moving in the positive direction. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So from B's perspective, the relative speed of A is (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²).

Let me compute that. The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²/c²) → 1 -0.3=0.7. So 0.1c /0.7 = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c. So approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c. So that's a clue.

Now, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut's total energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma times m c squared. So for each, calculate gamma.

For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c): gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) → 1 / sqrt(1 -0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (3m, 0.5c): gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) → 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². So about 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc², which is lower. So the correct total energy must be 5.96 mc², so option C.

Wait, but wait a second—oh, but wait, the problem asks for the total energy of the system. Oh, wait, but energy is frame-dependent. Oh no! Oh wait, wait. The problem states that the two astronauts are moving in the system. Are they moving relative to each other, or relative to an external frame?

Hmm, the question is a bit ambiguous. But I think the way it's phrased, it's asking for the total energy in the lab frame where both are moving in the positive x-direction. Because if it were the rest frame of one of them, the other's energy would be different. But the question says
