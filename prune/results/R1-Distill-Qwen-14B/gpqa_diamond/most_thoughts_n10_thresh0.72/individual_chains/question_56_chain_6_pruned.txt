Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the hydrogen atom. Hmm, the question is about the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I remember that in hydrogen, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by selection rules.

Wait, what's the dipole transition selection rule again? Oh right, for electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So l can change by one unit, and m can change by -1, 0, or +1. But wait, the initial and final states must have their angular momentum quantum numbers change according to these rules.

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The final state is |1,0,0⟩. So the initial angular momentum quantum number l is 0, and the final is also 0. But since the transition is via two steps, each step must follow the selection rules.

So first, from n=3, l=0, m=0, it can go to a state where l=1 (since Δl=±1). So possible intermediates would have l=1. Then from l=1, it can go to l=0, which matches the final state.

So the first transition is from 3s (n=3, l=0) to either 2p or 4p, but since in the options, the second state is n=2, so the first step is 3s → 2p.

Wait, but 3s can't go directly to 2p in one step because Δn is 1, but the selection rule for n is Δn = ±1 for dipole transitions. Wait, wait, no, the selection rules for n are more about the radial part. Or actually, the selection rule for n is that Δn can be any except 0, but for hydrogen-like atoms, the transition is allowed as long as Δl=±1. But in practice, the transition from n=3 to n=2 would have a dipole-allowed transition because l can change from 0 to 1.

So the first step is 3,0,0 → 2,1,m. But wait, m can change by 0, ±1. So first transition can be to m=0,
