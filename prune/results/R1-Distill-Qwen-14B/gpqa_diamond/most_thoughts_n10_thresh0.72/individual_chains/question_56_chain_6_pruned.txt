Okay, so I've got this problem about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy states. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. Wait, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by certain selection rules.

First, what are the selection rules for dipole transitions in the hydrogen atom? Oh right, for electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So the angular momentum quantum number l can change by 1, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0 or ±1.

The initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. It decays to n=1, l=0, m=0. So the decay is from 3s to 1s. Wait, but that's a change of two energy levels. So it can't happen in a single transition. Oh, the question says it's via two dipole transitions, so it must go through an intermediate state.

So the path would be 3,0,0 → something → 1,0,0. Let me think about possible intermediate states.

The first transition from n=3 to a lower n. Let's say n drops by 1 or 2. But wait, in dipole transitions, Δn can be ±1, ±2, etc., but only when Δl is ±1. So from l=0 (s orbital), the next possible l is 1 (p orbital). So the first transition must go to a state with l=1.

So from 3s (n=3, l=0, m=0) the first transition possible is to a 2p or 3p state? Wait, no, wait. Wait, n can change by any integer as long as l changes by ±1. So in the first transition, from 3s to 2p or 2p*? Let me think. 3s → 2p? Because l increases by 1 (0→1). Or can it go to higher l? Wait, no, because l is 0, so only l=1 is allowed next. So the initial state is 3s (n=3, l=0, m=0). So the first transition would go

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the hydrogen atom. Hmm, the question is about the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I remember that in hydrogen, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by selection rules.

Wait, what's the dipole transition selection rule again? Oh right, for electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So l can change by one unit, and m can change by -1, 0, or +1. But wait, the initial and final states must have their angular momentum quantum numbers change according to these rules.

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The final state is |1,0,0⟩. So the initial angular momentum quantum number l is 0, and the final is also 0. But since the transition is via two steps, each step must follow the selection rules.

So first, from n=3, l=0, m=0, it can go to a state where l=1 (since Δl=±1). So possible intermediates would have l=1. Then from l=1, it can go to l=0, which matches the final state.

So the first transition is from 3s (n=3, l=0) to either 2p or 4p, but since in the options, the second state is n=2, so the first step is 3s → 2p.

Wait, but 3s can't go directly to 2p in one step because Δn is 1, but the selection rule for n is Δn = ±1 for dipole transitions. Wait, wait, no, the selection rules for n are more about the radial part. Or actually, the selection rule for n is that Δn can be any except 0, but for hydrogen-like atoms, the transition is allowed as long as Δl=±1. But in practice, the transition from n=3 to n=2 would have a dipole-allowed transition because l can change from 0 to 1.

So the first step is 3,0,0 → 2,1,m. But wait, m can change by 0, ±1. So first transition can be to m=0,
