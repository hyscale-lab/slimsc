Okay, so I've got this problem about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy states. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. Wait, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by certain selection rules.

First, what are the selection rules for dipole transitions in the hydrogen atom? Oh right, for electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So the angular momentum quantum number l can change by 1, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0 or ±1.

The initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. It decays to n=1, l=0, m=0. So the decay is from 3s to 1s. Wait, but that's a change of two energy levels. So it can't happen in a single transition. Oh, the question says it's via two dipole transitions, so it must go through an intermediate state.

So the path would be 3,0,0 → something → 1,0,0. Let me think about possible intermediate states.

The first transition from n=3 to a lower n. Let's say n drops by 1 or 2. But wait, in dipole transitions, Δn can be ±1, ±2, etc., but only when Δl is ±1. So from l=0 (s orbital), the next possible l is 1 (p orbital). So the first transition must go to a state with l=1.

So from 3s (n=3, l=0, m=0) the first transition possible is to a 2p or 3p state? Wait, no, wait. Wait, n can change by any integer as long as l changes by ±1. So in the first transition, from 3s to 2p or 2p*? Let me think. 3s → 2p? Because l increases by 1 (0→1). Or can it go to higher l? Wait, no, because l is 0, so only l=1 is allowed next. So the initial state is 3s (n=3, l=0, m=0). So the first transition would go
