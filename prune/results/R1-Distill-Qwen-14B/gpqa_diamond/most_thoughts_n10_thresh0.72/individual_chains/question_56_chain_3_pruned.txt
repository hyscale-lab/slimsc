Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy states. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions. The options give different routes and probabilities, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electron transitions are governed by selection rules. Dipole transitions involve changes in the angular momentum, so I think the selection rules for l (the angular momentum quantum number) and m (the magnetic quantum number) apply here.

The initial state is n=3, l=0 (since it's s orbital, s=0), m=0. The final state is n=1, l=0, m=0. But the decay isn't a direct transition—it happens through two steps. Each step is a dipole transition, so I need to apply the selection rules for each step.

The selection rules for dipole transitions are: Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So for each transition (from 3→? and then ?→1), these rules must be followed.

Starting from |3,0,0>, the first transition can go to a state where l changes by ±1. Since initial l is 0, the next l can be 1. So the first step would be from l=0 to l=1. So the possible states after first transition are |2,1,m>, because n can decrease by 1 (since each transition usually involves a drop in energy, so n decreases by 1 each time, but wait, is that a strict rule? I think n can change by any integer, but in practice, for two transitions, probably n goes from 3→2 then 2→1.

So the first transition is from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m>, where m can be -1, 0, +1 because Δm is 0, ±1.

Then, the second transition takes |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>. Let's apply the selection rules again. The l must go from 1 to 0, so Δl = -1, which is allowed. For m, from m in |2,1,m> to 0 in |1,0,0>, so Δm must be -m. Because the initial m in the second state is m, and it goes to 0, so m must be 0, ±1. Because Δm can be 0, ±1.

Wait, let me think again. For the second transition, the initial state is |2,1,m>. The final state is |1,0,0>. So for m, the change is from m to 0. So Δm = 0 - m = -m. But the selection rule says Δm can be -1, 0, +1. So -m must be in {-1, 0, +1}.

Which possible m's satisfy that? Let's list possible m's after the first transition.

After first transition, m can be -1, 0, or +1. So for each of these, what happens in the second transition.

Case 1: After first transition, m=0. Then in the second transition, Δm can be 0. So from m=0 to m=0. That's allowed because Δm is 0.

Case 2: After first transition, m=+1. Then in the second transition, Δm would have to be -1, because 0 - (+1) = -1. Which is allowed.

Case 3: After first transition, m=-1. Then in the second transition, Δm would have to be +1, because 0 - (-1) = +1. Which is allowed.

So all three m values after the first transition can lead to the final state.

But wait, we're talking about the transition routes. The question is about possible routes. Each option gives a specific path, maybe involving specific m values.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Goes from 3,0,0 to 2,1,0, then to 1,0,0. So first transition l=0→1, m=0. Second transition l=1→0, m=0→0. So that's allowed.

Option B: 3,0,0 → 2,1,1 → 1,0,0. So first transition m=0 →1 (Δm=+1 allowed). Second transition m=1→0 (Δm=-1). So allowed.

Option C: 3,0,0 → 2,1,-1 →1,0,0. First transition m=0→-1 (Δm=-1 allowed). Second transition m=-1→0 (Δm=+1 allowed). Also allowed.

Option D: The first part isn't written properly. It says |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, which is the same as option A. But the probability is 2/3, which I'm not sure about yet.

So all options A, B, and C are possible in terms of allowed transitions. But the actual question is about the probability. The options give different probabilities, so I need to think about the possible transitions and their probabilities.

Wait, but the problem says it decays via two dipole transitions. So each step is a dipole transition, so each step's probability is governed by the transition dipole moment.

What determines the probability of each transition? The square of the matrix element of the dipole operator. The dipole operator is proportional to rY_{1m}, where Y are spherical harmonics. The transition probability is proportional to the square of the integral of the initial and final wavefunctions multiplied by Y_{1m}.

The initial and final states have specific angular parts. The initial state is |3,0,0>, which is an s orbital, so angular part is Y_{00}. The first transition goes to |2,1,m>, which has angular part Y_{1m}.

The transition integral is proportional to ∫ Y_{00}^* Y_{1m} Y_{1m'} dΩ. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the dipole operator is proportional to r Y_{1m}. So the matrix element is:

⟨f | r Y_{1m} | i ⟩.

But since r is radial, and the angular parts are Y_{l_i m_i} and Y_{l_f m_f}, the integral becomes the product of radial integrals and the angular integral ∫ Y_{l_f m_f}^* Y_{1m} Y_{l_i m_i} dΩ.

In our case, for the first transition, initial state is l_i=0, m_i=0. So the angular integral becomes ∫ Y_{1m}^* Y_{1m'} Y_{00} dΩ.

Wait, no, the first transition is from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m>. So for the first transition, the dipole operator will contribute a Y_{1m} factor. The integral is:

⟨2,1,m' | Y_{1m} | 3,0,0⟩.

Which becomes ∫ Y_{1m'}^* Y_{1m} Y_{00} dΩ.

Because initial state is l=0, so Y_{00}, the final state is Y_{1m'}, and the dipole factor is Y_{1m}.

The integral ∫ Y_{1m'}^* Y_{1m} Y_{00} dΩ.

This integral is non-zero only if certain conditions are met. Because the product of Y_{1m} and Y_{00} must have a component in Y_{1m'}, which requires that the angular momentum addition rules are satisfied.

But wait, when you multiply Y_{1m} and Y_{00}, the result can have terms with l=1 and l=0. Because 0 and 1 can add to 1 or 0. But when you take the integral with Y_{1m'}, it will be non-zero only if 1m' is a component present in Y_{1m} Y_{00}.

Alternatively, the integral is non-zero only if m' = m + 0 (since Y_{00} has m=0). So m' must be equal to m.

Furthermore, the integral is non-zero only when the angular momentum coupling allows it. So for the product Y_{1m} Y_{00}, the integral with Y_{1m'} is non-zero only if m' = m, and the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is non-zero.

But wait, the integral of Y_{1m} Y_{00} is zero except when certain conditions hold. Let's think about the possible m values.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to recall that the only non-zero transition occurs when the angular momentum selection rules are met, which they are in each case since m can change by 0, ±1. But for the transition probability, perhaps only certain m values contribute more.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact conditions. Maybe another approach is better.

When you have an initial state with l=0 and m=0, and you're considering a transition to l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1.

Each of these m values would correspond to a possible transition, but the probability of each transition depends on the square of the matrix element.

But wait, the matrix element for each m would have a certain value. Let me think about the integral ∫ Y_{1m}^* Y_{1m} Y_{00} dΩ.

Wait, no. The matrix element is ⟨2,1,m | dipole operator |3,0,0⟩.

The dipole operator is proportional to r Y_{1m'}, so the matrix element becomes proportional to ∫ Y_{1m}^* Y_{1m'} Y_{00} dΩ.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the matrix element is proportional to ∫ Y_{1m'}^* Y_{1m} Y_{00} dΩ.

Hmm, perhaps I can think in terms of spherical harmonics properties. The product Y_{1m} Y_{00} can be expressed as a sum over Y_{l', m'}, and then when multiplied by Y_{1m'}, the integral is non-zero only when certain conditions are met.

Alternatively, perhaps using the selection rules, the integral is non-zero only when m' = m, since Y_{00} has m
