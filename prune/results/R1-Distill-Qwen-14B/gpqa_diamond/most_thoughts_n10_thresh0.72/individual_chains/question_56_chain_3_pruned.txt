Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and electron transitions. Hmm, let me think. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a different transition route and a probability.

First, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by selection rules. Dipole transitions specifically have certain selection rules. Oh right, the selection rules for electric dipole transitions are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So the angular momentum quantum number l can change by 1, either increasing or decreasing. And the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0 or ±1.

So the initial state is |3,0,0>. Let's see. For the first transition, from n=3, l=0 (s orbital) to a lower state. Since l can change by ±1, the next possible l is 1. So the intermediate state must have l=1. So the state after the first transition must be |2,1, m>, because n has to decrease by at least 1 each time, right?

Wait, wait. Or can it decrease by more than one? Hmm. I think in two-photon transitions, like two dipole transitions, the electron can drop more than one energy level. But each photon emission is a single transition, so each step must follow the selection rules.

So first transition: from n=3 to n=2 (since each dipole transition usually changes n by 1, but wait, is that the case? Or is that just for the first transition? Hmm, no, the selection rules for n are Δn = any integer except 0, but in practice, dipole transitions are usually between adjacent n because higher changes are less likely. But for the sake of this question, I'll assume each dipole transition only changes n by 1. So first transition is n=3 to n=2, l=0 to l=1, since l can change by +1.

So the first state is |2,1,m>. Now, what about m? The initial m is 0. So the possible m after transition can be m=0, +1, or -1. So the intermediate state could be |2,1,0>, |2,1,1>, or |2,1,-1>.

Then, the second transition goes from this state to |1,0,0>. Let's see what the selection rules say here. Starting from l=1 and m= something, the next transition must change l by ±1. So from l=1, the next l must be 0. So that's good because the final state is l=0. So the second transition is from n=2 to n=1, l=1 to 0.

But wait, n must change by 1 again. So n=2 to n=1, that's a Δn of -1, which is acceptable.

Now, what about the m values? The initial m is either 0, 1, or -1. The final m is 0. So for each intermediate state, the m can change by 0, +1, or -1.

Let me take each possibility.

Case 1: Intermediate state is |2,1,0>.
Then, in the second transition, m can change by 0, so the final state is |1,0,0>. So that's allowed.

Case 2: Intermediate state is |2,1,1>.
Then, in the second transition, m can change by -1, leading to m=0. So allowed.

Case 3: Intermediate state is |2,1,-1>.
In the second transition, m can change by +1, leading to m=0. That's allowed too.

Wait, but each transition is a dipole, so each step must obey the selection rules. So all three possible intermediate states are allowed.

So the possible transition routes are:

3,0,0 →2,1,0 →1,0,0

3,0,0 →2,1,1 →1,0,0

3,0,0 →2,1,-1 →1,0,0

So looking at the options, let me check each one.

Option A: 3→2,1,0 →1,0,0. The probability is 1/3. Hmm, I'm not sure about the probabilities yet.

Option B: 3→2,1,1 →1,0,0. Probability 1/4.

Option C: 3→2,1,-1 →1,0,0. Probability 1/4.

Option D: It says |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, but the probability is 2/3. Wait, the question says "two dipole transitions", so two steps, each with their own probabilities. So the total
