Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and cosmology. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at around 790 nm in the near-infrared and optical spectrum, and the flux drops significantly below that. Wait, I remember something about quasar emission lines and how they can be redshifted. Oh right, the Lyman-alpha emission line is around 121 nm in the ultraviolet. If the peak is at 790 nm, that's much longer, so it's probably a redshifted line.

So the observed wavelength is 790 nm. The rest wavelength for Lyman-alpha is about 121.6 nm. So the redshift z would be (observed - rest)/rest. Let me calculate that: (790 - 121.6)/121.6. Let's see, 790 minus 121 is 669, so 669.4/121.6 ≈ 5.5. So z is approximately 5.5. That's a high redshift, which means the quasar is very far away.

Now, the question is about the comoving distance to the quasar. The comoving distance depends on the redshift and the cosmological parameters. The given cosmology is Lambda-CDM with Hubble constant H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ωm = 0.3, dark energy Ωλ = 0.7, and the universe is flat (so Ωm + Ωλ = 1).

I need to find the comoving distance DC at z=5.5. The comoving distance formula is DC = c * ∫ (from 0 to z) dz' / [H(z')], where H(z) = H0 * sqrt(Ωm*(1+z)^3 + Ωλ). Hmm, but integrating this analytically is tricky. I remember that for some redshifts, approximate values or look-up tables can be used.

Wait, I've heard that for high redshifts like z=5, the comoving distance is on the order of several gigaparsecs. Let me think about some rough estimates. At z=1, the comoving distance is roughly 2 Gpc for H0=70. As z increases, the distance increases, but not linearly because of the expansion history.

For z=5, I think the comoving distance is around 10-12 billion parsecs. Wait, but the options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc. Hmm, so maybe I need to think more carefully.

Alternatively, I can recall some standard values. For a flat Lambda CDM universe with Ωm=0.3, the comoving distances for various redshifts are known. Let me see:

At z=0.5, DC is about 1.7 Gpc.
z=1: 3 Gpc.
z=2: around 7 Gpc?
Wait, I might be mixing up some numbers. Alternatively, maybe I should use an approximate formula or an online calculator in my mind.

Another approach: The luminosity distance DL is related to the comoving distance. But since the question asks for comoving distance, which is DC = c * (1+z) * t(z), where t(z) is the age of the universe at redshift z. Or wait, more accurately, comoving distance is the integral of c dt / a(t), from t_emission to t_obs.

But perhaps a better approach is to use an approximation for the comoving distance. I remember that for high z, the integral can be approximated using certain functions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that for a flat universe with Ωm=0.3 and Ωλ=0.7, the comoving distance at z=5 is approximately 11 Gpc. Wait, but the options don't go that high. The highest option is C) 9 Gpc. Hmm.

Wait, maybe my initial approximation is off. Let me think again. Wait, another approach: using the look-up table or standard numbers.

Wait, from some sources I remember that at z=6, the comoving distance is around 13 Gpc. But that's conflicting with the options given. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate this more carefully. Let's try to compute the integral numerically. But that's time-consuming without a calculator, but perhaps I can approximate.

The Hubble parameter as a function of z is H(z) = H0 * sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7).

So the integrand is 1 / [H0 * sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7)].

So, the integral is from 0 to 5.5 of dz' / [H0 * sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7)].

Multiply by c to get the distance in parsecs. But H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc, which is 2.1e-18 s^-1.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the integral in terms of the scale factor. But I'm not sure. Another approach: use the approximation that for high redshifts, dark energy starts to dominate, so the expansion starts to accelerate. But for z=5, matter is still dominant, as Ωm(1+z)^3 would be 0.3*(5.5+1)^3 = 0.3*(6.5)^3 = 0.3 * 274.625 = ~82.4. Wait, but Ωm is 0.3, so that's 82.4 * 0.3=24.7? Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the term in H(z) is Ωm*(1+z)^3 + Ωλ. Since Ωm=0.3, Ωλ=0.7, then the term is 0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7.

At z=5, (1+z)=6, so 0.3*(6)^3 = 0.3*216=64.8. So 64.8 + 0.7 = 65.5. The square root of that is sqrt(65.5) ≈ 8.09. So H(z) at z=5.5 is H0 * 8.09.

But wait, the integral is [dz'] / [H(z')] = dz' / [H0 * sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7)].

So each term is 1/(H0 * sqrt(...)). Integrating from 0 to 5.5.

But doing this integral without a calculator is tricky. Maybe I can approximate it using the lookback time or other standard methods.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation that for z << 1, the integral is roughly (1/(H0 c)) * a certain factor, but for high z, it's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can look for some standard comoving distance values. I think I remember that at z=5, the comoving distance is about 12 Gpc. But that's higher than the options given.

Wait, the options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc. So perhaps for z=5.5, the comoving distance is around 9 Gpc. So option C.

But wait, another thought: in reality, the comoving distance for z=5.5 in a flat Lambda CDM model (Ωm=0.3, Ωλ=0.7) is about 11 Gpc. Hmm. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the redshift calculation. Let me double-check. The observed wavelength is 790 nm, rest is 121.6 nm. So z = (790 - 121.6)/121.6 ≈ (668.4)/121.6 ≈ 5.5.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps it's not the Lyman-alpha line. The question says the peak is in the near infrared and optical. Wait, maybe it's the Balmer series? Like H-alpha is 656 nm in rest frame. If the observed peak is 790 nm, then z would be (790-656)/656 ≈ 134/656 ≈ 0.204. So z ~ 0.2. That's much closer.

Wait, but that would imply a much smaller comoving distance. For
