Okay, so I'm trying to answer this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

So, the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits, and they were detected using the RV method. 

The question is about the orbital periods of the two planets. Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift in the spectral line, while Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. I need to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift of a star's spectral lines, which indicates the star's velocity due to the planet's gravitational pull. The formula for the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity (K) is given by something like K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) )^(1/1) ) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_star))^(something). Oh wait, maybe I should think of it as K = [ (G * M_p) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(P)) ) * something... Wait, perhaps I should recall the formula more accurately.

Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) ), but I might be mixing up the terms. Let me think again. The formula is K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ). But since the planet mass is much smaller than the star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So perhaps the formula simplifies to K ≈ ( (G M_p sin i ) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) )^(1/1) ) * some factor. Wait, maybe it's easier to think of the relationship between K, P, and other variables.

Wait, another approach: the RV method's amplitude K depends on the mass of the planet, the inclination of the orbit (but since it's circular and we've detected it, sin i is close to 1), and the period P. But since both planets have similar masses (Neptune-like) and the stars are the same mass, the only varying factors are their orbital periods and the semi-amplitude K.

The question states that the shift for Planet #1 is 5 milliangstroms, and for Planet #2, it's 7. So K is larger for Planet #2. But wait, how does K relate to the period P?

The formula for K is given by K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 * (
