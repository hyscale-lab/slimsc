Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem, and I'll need to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again and understand what's being asked.

The setup is that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly but travel at ultra-relativistic speeds. The average Lorentz factor is around 20. Now, on average, one third of these particles make it to the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters.

The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the detector's inner walls. The options are A) 54, B) 68, C) 40, D) 28.

Hmm, I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is related to time dilation and length contraction in special relativity. But how does this relate to the particles reaching the detector's walls?

Wait, so the particles are produced at the center of the detector. They move outward, and some decay before reaching the walls. The ones that don't decay will hit the walls. The problem says that at gamma ~20, one third reach the walls. We need to find the gamma that makes two-thirds reach.

I think this has to do with the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector's walls versus their lifetime as measured in the lab frame. Because if the particles have a certain proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in their own rest frame), then in the lab frame, due to time dilation, their lifetime is longer. But if they're moving at high speeds, they might not live long enough to reach the walls.

Wait, no. The problem says the particles are fast-decaying. So their proper lifetime is very short. But from the lab frame, their lifetime is longer, allowing them to travel a longer distance before decaying.

So the idea is: the particles will reach the wall if the distance they need to travel (radius of the detector) is less than the distance they can travel before decaying. The distance they can travel is their speed multiplied by their lifetime in the lab frame.

Let me formalize this. Let me denote:

- R = radius of the detector = 30 meters.
- v = velocity of the particles. Since they're ultra-relativistic, v ≈ c.
- gamma = Lorentz factor = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)
- tau = proper lifetime of the particle (rest frame lifetime)
- t = lab frame lifetime = gamma * tau

The time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is t_flight = R / v ≈ R / c, since v ≈ c.

The particle will reach the wall if t_flight < t. Otherwise, it decays before reaching.

So the condition is:

R/(v) < gamma * tau

But since v is approximately c, we can write:

R/c < gamma * tau

Rearranging, gamma > R/(c tau)

Wait, but tau is the proper lifetime. Oh wait, but wait, maybe we can relate the two scenarios. The first scenario is gamma =20, and one third reach the walls. The second scenario is gamma = ?, and two-thirds reach.

Wait, perhaps the fraction of particles that reach the wall depends on how much time they have compared to their lifetime. So, in the lab frame, the particle can reach the wall if it's lifetime is longer than the time it takes to reach the wall.

So the fraction of particles reaching the wall is the probability that the particle's lifetime is longer than R/(v), which is approximately R/c.

But wait, tau is the mean lifetime. So, the probability that the particle's lifetime is longer than t is exp(-t/tau).

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

If the proper lifetime is tau, the lab frame lifetime is gamma tau.

The distance the particle can move before decaying is v * gamma tau.

Wait, so the maximum distance a particle can travel before decaying is v * gamma tau.

But wait, actually, the mean proper lifetime is tau, so the lab frame mean lifetime is gamma tau.

The average distance a particle travels before decaying is v * gamma tau.

Wait, but given that the particles are moving at speed v, the time they take to reach the wall is R/v. So if R/v is less than the particle's lifetime, which is gamma tau, the particle will reach the wall.

Alternatively, the probability that a particle reaches the wall is the probability that its lifetime is longer than R/(v gamma), because in its own frame, its lifetime is tau, and the time experienced is t' = t / gamma, where t is the lab time.

Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me think of it as the lab frame. The time available for the particle to reach the wall is t_available = R/(v) ≈ R/c.

The particle's lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau.

So, the probability that the particle reaches the wall is the probability that gamma tau > t_available.

But tau is a mean lifetime, so the decay process follows an exponential distribution. The probability that the particle hasn't decayed by time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, but the average lifetime is gamma tau. So the probability that the particle survives beyond time t_available is P = exp(- t_available/(gamma tau)).

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the decay follows an exponential distribution in the lab frame. The survival probability is exp( - t / (gamma tau) ), where
