Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says: We want to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of total volume. We need to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required. Also, we need to find the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm, okay. So Fe(OH)3 is the iron(III) hydroxide. It's a solid, and we're trying to dissolve it in an acid. Since it's a hydroxide, reacting with an acid makes sense because they neutralize each other.

Wait, Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, I think. When it reacts with a strong acid, it should form Fe^3+ ions and water. The reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O. Yeah, that sounds right.

So first, I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 we have in moles. The mass is 0.1 grams. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Iron is about 55.85 g/mol, oxygen is 16, hydrogen is 1. So Fe(OH)3 is Fe + 3(OH). Let's calculate:

Fe: 55.85
Each OH: 17 (16+1). So 3 OH would be 51. So total molar mass is 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

Molar mass of Fe(OH)3 = approx 106.85 g/mol.

Moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me compute that more accurately: 0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.0009359 moles. So about 9.359e-4 moles.

So the reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

Each mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of H+.

So moles of H+ needed = 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3.

Moles H+ = 3 * 0.0009359 ≈ 0.0028077 moles.

The acid provided is 0.1 M, which is monobasic. So the concentration is 0.1 mol/L.

We can find the volume of acid needed using the formula: moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters).

So Volume = moles / Molarity.

Molarity is 0.1 mol/L, which is 0.1 mol/dm³. Wait, because 1 L is 1000 cm³, so 0.1 mol/L is 0.0001 mol/cm³? Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Molarity is moles per liter. So to get the volume in cm³, I can rearrange.

Volume (L) = moles / Molarity.

So Volume (mL) = (moles / Molarity) * 1000.

Wait, no, let's compute it properly.

Moles H+ needed: 0.0028077 mol.

Molarity of acid: 0.1 mol/L.

So Volume (L) = 0.0028077 / 0.1 = 0.028077 L.

Convert to cm³ (since 1 L = 1000 cm³), so 0.028077 L * 1000 cm³/L = 28.077 cm³.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³. Close enough, considering rounding errors. So the volume needed is about 28.08 cm³, which is approximately 28.05 cm³ as in option C.

But wait, the question is about the minimum volume needed. Did I miss something? Like, perhaps the solution volume after adding the acid?

Hmm, the total volume is 100 cm³. So when we add the acid, the total volume might change, but the question says the total volume is 100 cm³. Wait, no, wait. The problem states that the total volume is 100 cm³, which is the solution after adding the acid. So does that mean that the volume of the solution after adding
