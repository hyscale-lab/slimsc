Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices give different combinations.

Wait, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with certain symmetries. But which symmetries are those?

First, let's break down each symmetry.

Lorentz Symmetry: This is about how the laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames. In the Standard Model, this is definitely a big symmetry. SMEFT operators should respect this because they're just modifications at higher energies, not changing the fundamental symmetries like Lorentz.

Poincare Symmetry: Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like momentum conservation). I think that if a theory has Poincare symmetry, it must also have Lorentz symmetry. So if operators respect Poincare, they'd automatically respect Lorentz. But the question is about which must be respected by all operators. So maybe both 1 and 2 are required.

CP Symmetry: CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. I remember that the Standard Model doesn't fully respect CP symmetry because of things like the CKM matrix in quark mixing. But in SMEFT, I think that operators can have terms that violate CP, so maybe they don't have to respect it. Or wait, are there certain operators that require CP conservation? I'm a bit confused here.

CPT Symmetry: CPT is Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. I think CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, especially in theories that include spin-½ particles like the Dirac equation. So any renormalizable theory should respect CPT. Since SMEFT is built from renormalizable interactions with higher-dimension corrections, maybe all operators must respect CPT symmetry.

So, putting it together. All operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry and CPT symmetry. What about Poincare? Well, Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. Since SMEFT is a field theory, which by definition includes local symmetries and translation invariance, so operators should respect Poincare. So Lorentz is part of Poincare, so if an operator respects Poincare, it includes Lorentz. But the question is asking which symmetries must be respected, so both 1 and 2 could be correct.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. SMEFT is built as a low-energy effective theory, so it's Lorentz-invariant. So all operators must be Lorentz scalars. That definitely includes Lorentz symmetry (option 1). Poincare includes Lorentz and translation invariance. If the theory is Poincare-invariant, that includes Lorentz. So if the operators must respect Poincare, then they also respect Lorentz. So if the question includes Poincare as a must, then both 1 and 2 are correct.

But wait, the question is about which must be respected by all operators. Do all operators have to respect Poincare symmetry? Because Poincare includes global symmetries and local (Lorentz) as well as translations. For a field theory, the action is Poincare invariant, so operators (which are part of the Lagrangian terms) would have to be Poincare invariant.

Hmm, but I'm a bit confused if SMEFT operators are required to respect Poincare symmetry. I think that SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, which is part of Poincare symmetry. So maybe all operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

But wait, the first option in the question is 1 and 2. So when looking at the choices, option A is 1 and 2, option C is 1,2,4.

What about CPT symmetry? Well, CPT is a big one. In any quantum field theory that is Lorentz-invariant and has a unitary S-matrix, CPT must hold. Since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory and a valid QFT, all operators must respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 is correct.

So, putting it together, which symmetries must be respected? Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So that's three symmetries. Let's look at the options.

Option C says 1,2,4. So that would be correct.

Wait, but what about CP symmetry? The question is whether all operators must respect CP. I think that's not necessarily the case. Because in the Standard Model, there are CP-violating terms (like the CKM phase). So in SMEFT, you can have operators that violate CP. So operators don't have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not a must.

So the correct symmetries are 1, 2, and 4. The options are A (1,2), C (1,2,4), D (1,3,4), etc.

So the correct answer is option C.


The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). To determine the correct answer, let us analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, as it is built from operators that are consistent with the symmetries of the Standard Model. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translation invariance. Since SMEFT is a field theory, it must respect translation invariance, and hence Poincaré symmetry. This implies that all operators in SMEFT must also respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry involves charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). While the Standard Model contains CP-violating terms (e.g., the CKM phase), SMEFT does not require operators to respect CP symmetry. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a strict requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry combines charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). In quantum field theory, CPT symmetry is a fundamental requirement for Lorentz-invariant theories with a unitary S-matrix. Since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily required. Among the given options, the correct choice is:
