Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene.

Hmm, Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. I remember that metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. Grubbs is especially good for ring-closing and ring-opening metathesis as well as cross metathesis.

Wait, but the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, 3-methyl pent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2-CH3? No, wait, pent has five carbons. Let me count: the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, 3-methyl pent-1-ene is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I should write the structure correctly. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But 3-methyl would have a methyl branch on carbon 3. So, the structure should be CH2=CH-CH
