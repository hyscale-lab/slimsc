Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state that emits a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. The problem mentions Pauli statistics and some condition involving isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers. The equation given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. 

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. We need to determine which partial wave is not permitted, given the options. The options involve different transitions where the initial state is 1S0 and the final state is something else plus a particle (p, s, f, etc. I think p is a proton, s is a neutron or maybe something else? Wait, but the problem says particle X, which could be a pion or some other boson? Hmm, but maybe the lowercase letters denote the angular momentum state of X. Oh wait, the note says that the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), so the lowercase letters are probably the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers. Like S, P, D, F. So options are things like 7D1, 3S1, etc.

Wait, the question says, "the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X." So in each option, the part after the arrow is like (NN state) + X. For example, option A says 7D1 + p. So the X here is a particle with angular momentum state 'p', which stands for l=1 (since p is P, the letter for l=1).

The task is to find which partial wave is not permitted, considering conservation of angular momentum and parity.

So, the initial state is 1S0. Let's break that down. 1 is 2S+1. So 2S+1 =1 → S=0. So the spin of the NN system is S=0. The L is S (in the spectroscopic notation, but wait, no—wait, the term is (2S+1)L(J). So the initial state is 1S0. So S is the total spin (S=0), L is the orbital angular momentum (L=0 because it's S state?), and J is the total angular momentum (J=0). Because J = L + S, so 0 +0=0.

But wait, wait. I'm a bit confused about the notation. Let me think: each term symbol is (2S+1)L J. So 1S0 means (2*0 +1) S 0 → 1S0. So S=0 (so spin state is singlet), L is the orbital angular momentum, which in this case is S, which is L=0. So yes, L=0, S=0, and J=0.

So the initial NN state has L=0, S=0, and J=0.

Now, the NN system emits a particle X. So the process is NN → NN' + X. But wait, more accurately
