Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on my pericyclic reactions, but I'll try to think it through.

The reactants are 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione, and the reaction is done under heat. The question is about identifying the exo product. Hmm, exo product... I remember that in Diels-Alder reactions, the endo rule says that the endo transition state is favored, but wait, this might not be a Diels-Alder exactly because it's a [4+2] between different partners.

Wait, 2,5-dimethylthiophene is an aromatic heterocycle. Furan-2,5-dione is another aromatic compound, which is a dione (so two ketone groups). So, when these undergo a [4+2] cycloaddition, which is a type of pericyclic reaction, what happens?

I think that thiophene can act as a diene, and furan-2,5-dione might be the dienophile. Or maybe the other way around? Alternatively, perhaps it's a different kind of cycloaddition, like an ene reaction, but no, [4+2] implies a diene and a dienophile.

Wait, [4+2] cycloadditions are
