Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the problem says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. Oh, and the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1.

Wait, so the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. Since the light is moving through the glass, which is itself moving, this must involve some relativity. Oh right, when you have a medium moving relative to an observer, you have to consider how the speed of light is measured in that frame.

I remember that in classical mechanics, velocities just add up, but that's not the case here because we're dealing with light, which is governed by special relativity. Oh wait, but the glass is moving at a constant velocity, so maybe we can use the relativistic velocity addition formula?

Wait, but how does the index of refraction come into play here? The index of refraction n is the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum to the speed of light in the medium. So normally, without any movement, the speed of light in the medium is c/n. But since the medium is moving, I need to adjust this.

Let me get this straight. When the medium (glass) is moving, the speed of light as measured in the lab frame depends on both the medium's motion and the light's speed in that medium.

Wait, but how does the motion of the medium affect the speed of light? In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at v_light = c/n. But when the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame, we need to transform the velocity of the light from the glass frame to the lab frame.

Right, so I think this is where the relativistic velocity addition formula comes in. The formula is: 

u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/cÂ²)

But wait, which direction are we talking about? Because the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the glass frame, the light's speed is c/n in the same direction as the glass is moving. Then we apply the velocity addition to find the speed in the lab frame.

Wait, maybe I should define the frames properly. Let me think:
