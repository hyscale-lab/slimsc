Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the capabilities of each spectrograph. The question states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So, that means anything with V mag ≤17 can be seen by ESPRESSO. On the other hand, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, for HIRES, stars with V mag ≤16 are observable.

So, any star that has an apparent V magnitude ≤16 can be detected by both. But wait, the opposite is also possible. If a star is brighter than the faintest limit of a spectrograph, it can be detected. So wait, ESPRESSO can go up to 17 mag, which is fainter than HIRES's limit of 16. So, for a star to be seen by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤16, because HIRES can't see anything beyond 16. Because if a star is, say, 17 mag, HIRES can't see it, but ESPRESSO can. But the question asks which stars can be detected with both, so the star must be observable by both. So the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤16 for HIRES and ≤17 for ESPRESSO. So the star just needs to be ≤16, because that's the stricter limit.

Wait, wait. Let me get that right. The question says that with ESPRESSO, stars "brighter than 17 mag" can be observed. Oh wait, wait! Oh, that's a magnitude scale confusion. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So, when they say ESPRESSO can observe stars "brighter than 17 mag", does that mean apparent magnitude less than
