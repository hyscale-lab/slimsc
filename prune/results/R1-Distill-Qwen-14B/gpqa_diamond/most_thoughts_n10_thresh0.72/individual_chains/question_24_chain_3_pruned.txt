Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. It's a bit complex, but I'll take it slow.

So the question is about some chemical reactions involving mixtures X and Y, and a hydrocarbon Z. We need to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

First, let's parse the problem.

1. Mixture X is equimolar and consists of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. Decolorizing bromine usually means the substance has unsaturated bonds, like alkenes or alkynes, which can add bromine. But wait, the problem says that in mixture X, the liquids don't have conjugated multiple bonds. So maybe each liquid has a single double bond or something but not conjugated.

2. When X is treated with platinum under heat, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y, which is also equimolar. The formation is due to a disproportionation reaction. Disproportionation means one substance is both oxidized and reduced. Since the catalyst is platinum, which is common for hydrogenation, but here the reaction is probably dehydrogenation or some addition.

Wait, but in this case, X is reacting to form Y via a disproportionation. So perhaps X has a compound that can either add hydrogen or lose it. Wait, maybe the reaction is hydrogenation and dehydrogenation? Or perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation or something else. Hmm.

Wait, no, X is treated with platinum when heated. Oh, I think I remember that when alkenes react with H2 and a catalyst like Pt, it's hydrogenation. So if X is a mixture that can undergo hydrogenation, but the problem says that X's liquids don't have conjugated multiple bonds, but they decolorize bromine. So, X must contain alkenes or alkynes, but not conjugated. So each component of X has either a single double bond or triple bond.

But when X is treated with Pt and heated, it forms Y via disproportionation. So perhaps one component of X is being hydrogenated, and another is being dehydrogenated, or maybe one component is splitting into two different products.

Alternatively, perhaps X consists of a single compound which upon heating with Pt undergoes disproportionation. Hmm, but it's a mixture of two liquids, so maybe each of them undergoes some change.

Wait, but the result is a mixture Y of two other liquids. So
