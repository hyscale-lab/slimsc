Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and a racemic mixture of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I need to figure out how many possible products there are when treated with Grubbs catalyst, excluding ethene. Let me think this through step by step.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves breaking and reforming double bonds, right? It's a process where the catalyst facilitates the redistribution of alkylidene groups between olefins. So Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, usually ruthenium-based, and it's good for ring-closing metathesis as well as cross metathesis.

Now, the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. But since the molecule is an alkene, I should probably look at its structure. 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the double bond between C1 and C2. The structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Let me draw it out.

Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But 3-methyl would mean a methyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, wait, no, pent has five carbons. So 1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH
