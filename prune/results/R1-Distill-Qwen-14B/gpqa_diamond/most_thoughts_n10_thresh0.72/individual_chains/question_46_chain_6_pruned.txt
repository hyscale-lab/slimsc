Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and a racemic mixture of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I need to figure out how many possible products there are when treated with Grubbs catalyst, excluding ethene. Let me think this through step by step.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves breaking and reforming double bonds, right? It's a process where the catalyst facilitates the redistribution of alkylidene groups between olefins. So Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, usually ruthenium-based, and it's good for ring-closing metathesis as well as cross metathesis.

Now, the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. But since the molecule is an alkene, I should probably look at its structure. 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the double bond between C1 and C2. The structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Let me draw it out.

Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But 3-methyl would mean a methyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, wait, no, pent has five carbons. So 1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH

Okay, so I've got this problem about Grubbs catalyst reacting with racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I need to figure out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis breaks and reforms double bonds. Specifically, Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, usually rhodium or ruthenium-based, and it facilitates the breaking of carbon-carbon double bonds.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers. But since the molecule has a double bond, I should draw its structure. 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the double bond between C1 and C2. The structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Let me count the carbons. Pent-1-ene is five carbons with double bond starting at C1. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH(CH3)2? Wait no, 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3 normally. But with a methyl group on carbon 3. So carbon 3 is the third carbon from the left. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe I should write it as CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3? No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. 3-methyl would mean a methyl group on carbon 3. So that's the third carbon after the double bond. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that would have five carbons. Let me count: 1 (CH2=CH-), 2 (CH-), 3 (CH(CH3)-), 4 (CH2-), 5 (CH3). Wait, that's five carbons in total. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. No, wait, that's not correct because if it's pent-1-ene, the double bond
