Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

So the question says that researchers want to detect transits of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have limited time and want to pick the one with the highest probability of transiting. Both planets have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Oh wait, and both have the same mass. But Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star, right? Because shorter period means it's orbiting more quickly, which usually means a smaller orbit.

The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Interesting. So even though Planet_1's star is more massive, they're the same size. That must mean Planet_2's star is a bit older or evolved, perhaps a subgiant or something, but same radius.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet's orbit. Wait, but how exactly? Let me recall.

The transit probability is roughly the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's diameter. More accurately, the probability P is (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately R_star / a_planet. Wait,
