Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's going on.

Alright, the problem says we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. The total weight is 7.20 grams. When heated to 200Â°C without air, only a mixture of gases is formed. These gases are then passed through several tubes. 

The first tube is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. The second tube has Ca(OH)2 solution, and the third has red-hot copper. The results show that the first and third tubes gained weight by 3.60g and 0.80g respectively. The second tube didn't change. In the end, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

The question is asking for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. So, when salts A and B are heated, they decompose and release some gases. The gas mixture goes through these tubes, which react with certain components. 

First, the first tube with Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant and can react with water, but wait, maybe in this case, it's reacting with something else. Alternatively, Mg(ClO4)2 can react with acids. Wait, no, Mg(ClO4)2 is a salt that can deliquesce, but perhaps in this scenario, it's catching moisture or maybe absorbing certain gases. Wait, but if the tube is anhydrous, maybe the gas has water vapor which is being absorbed. But wait, the first tube's weight increased by 3.60g. So that suggests that a gas reacting with the Mg(ClO4)2, possibly adding mass to it. Let's think: Mg(ClO4)2 reacts with H2O or maybe with some acid gas.

Wait, another possibility is that the gas is HCl, because Mg(ClO4)2 reacts with HCl? Let me think. Mg(ClO4)2 is a highly deliquescent salt,
