Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and some motion between the ejecta and the galaxy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that a part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, that's pretty fastâ€”like a significant fraction of the speed of light. Oh wait, the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is 1/5th of that. So that's a significant speed, but not close to relativistic limits. Or wait, maybe I should check if it's a relativistic problem.

But wait, the question is asking about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Hmm, time dilation maybe? Or is it just a straightforward velocity problem?

Wait, wait. Let me parse this carefully.

In the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So that means, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s
