Okay, so I've got this question about the quantum rotation-vibration model, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about a diatomic molecule made of atoms X and Y. They're in their fundamental state, and they absorb a photon. We need to find the momentum of that photon so the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state. 

The given data are:
- Mass of X (Mx) = 20 amu
- Mass of Y (My) = 2 amu
- Bond length (R) = 2 angstroms
- Angular frequency (Ï‰) = 4e14 rad/s

The options are A to D with various momentum values.

Hmm. I remember that in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels involve both rotational and vibrational states. But wait, the question says it's the fundamental state. Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state for vibration, which is the first vibrational level (v=0) with the lowest rotational state (maybe J=0?).

Wait, but when a photon is absorbed, the molecule moves to the next possible state. The question is about the lowest possible energy next state. So, the molecule can either increase its vibrational state or rotational state. Which transition gives the lower energy change? I'm a bit confused here. 

Wait, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized in both rotation
