Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think through it step by step.

The question is asking about the maximum speed of a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. And they want the maximum speed, v_max, considering the speed of light c.

Wait, right, in classical mechanics, the maximum speed would be when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So for a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy would be (1/2)mv_max². So setting them equal, you get v_max² = (kA²)/(m), so v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C. But wait, this is a relativistic problem, so I can't just use the classical approach.

Oh right, in relativity, as the speed approaches c, the mass increases via gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the equations of motion are different. Hmm.

I remember that the relativistic harmonic oscillator has a different expression for energy. The total energy E is the sum of relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy. So E = gamma*m*c² + (1/2)kx².

Wait, but at maximum speed, the oscillator is at the equilibrium position, so x=0. So the potential energy is zero, and all the energy is kinetic. But wait, in the relativistic scenario, when x=0, the potential is zero, so E = gamma*m*c². But that's not right because energy in the oscillator includes potential as well.

Wait, no, I think when the oscillator is at the maximum displacement (x=A), all its energy is potential. And when it's at the equilibrium (x=0), all energy is kinetic. So E = (1/2)kA² in the classical case. But in the relativistic case, E should be the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The total energy E of the oscillator is the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy (which is relativistic) plus the
