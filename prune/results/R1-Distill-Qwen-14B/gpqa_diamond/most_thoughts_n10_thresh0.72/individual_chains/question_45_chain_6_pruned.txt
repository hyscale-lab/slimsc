Okay, so I've got this physics problem about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking me to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given in terms of E, which is provided as E = (pi^2 ħ²)/(2mL²). I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The energy for a single particle in the nth level is given by E_n = (n² E), since E is the base energy unit for n=1. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The standard formula is E_n = (n² h²)/(8mL²), but the given E is E = (pi² ħ²)/(2mL²). Hmm, so let me see if I can relate these.

Wait, let's compute E in terms of the standard formula. Planck's constant h is 2πħ, so h² = 4π² ħ². Substituting into the standard formula: E_n = (n² h²)/(8mL²) = (n² *4 π² ħ²)/(8 m L²) ) = (n² π² ħ²)/(2m L²) ). Oh, so the given E is exactly that when n=1, right? Because E = (pi² ħ²)/(2mL^2) = E_1 (the ground state energy for a single particle). So each energy level for a single particle is E_n = n² E.

Wait, wait, no. Because E is E_1, so E_n = n² * E.

So each particle's energy depends on its quantum number. Now, for four particles, each with spin 1/2, which means each can have two possible spin states (up or down). But in the ground state, the particles will fill the lowest energy levels, considering the Pauli exclusion principle. Because they are fermions, each state can hold two particles (same n, same spatial wavefunction but opposite spins).

Wait, but wait. The potential well is one-dimensional, so the particles are in a 1D box, which implies that the spatial wavefunctions are determined by the quantum number n, and each n can have 2 particles (spin up and down). So for four particles, let
