Okay, so I've got this problem about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. Hmm, let me think.

Wait, each particle is a spin-1/2, so they’re fermions, right? That means they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So each quantum state can hold only one fermion. Oh wait, no, the spin part also matters. Each spatial state can hold two particles with opposite spins. So each unique spatial orbital can have two particles.

The system is in a 1D infinite well of length L. The energy levels for a single particle in such a well are given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²), right? And the problem says E = π² ħ²/(2mL²), so E_n = n² E. So each level is E multiplied by the square of the quantum number n.

Now, for four particles, I need to fill these energy levels according to the Pauli exclusion. Since each state can hold two particles (with opposite spins), the total number of particles is four. Let's list the energy levels:

n=1: E_1 = 1² E = E
n=2: E_2 = 4E
n=3: 9E
n=4: 16E
n=5: 25E
n=6: 36E
n=7: 49E
... and so on.

But wait, each n can have two particles (spin up and down). So for four particles, how do they fill up?

Ground state: the lowest energy configuration. So we'll fill the lowest available n levels, each with two particles until we reach four.

So n=1 can take two particles. That leaves two more. Then n=2 can take two more. So all four are filled in n=1 and n=2 levels.

So the total energy for the ground state would be 2*(E_1) + 2*(E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no, wait. Because each particle has a different spatial wavefunction. No, no, each state can have two particles. So for n=1, two particles (each with opposite spin), same for n=2. So yes, the total energy is (E_1 * 2) + (E_2 * 2) ) = 2E + 8E = 10E. So ground state energy is 10E?
