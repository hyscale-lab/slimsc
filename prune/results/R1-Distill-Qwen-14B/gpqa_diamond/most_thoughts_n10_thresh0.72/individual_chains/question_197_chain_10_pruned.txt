Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that Compound X has certain IR and NMR data and reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product from the options given.

First, I should analyze the spectral data to determine the structure of Compound X. Then, figure out what reaction occurs when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. That should give me the product.

Let's look at the IR data first. The IR shows peaks at 3400-2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an -OH group, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Then there's a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is typical of a carbonyl group, like in a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching, so probably an aromatic ring.

Now the NMR. The 1H NMR data is provided. Let's break it down:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm is likely an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids typically show a broad peak around there because of the exchange with water.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. This suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. The upfield doublet (7.2 ppm) is probably the two H's ortho to the substituent, and the downfield (8.0 ppm) would be the two H's adjacent to the substituent, meaning the substituent is probably electron-withdrawing. Like a carbonyl group.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet around 3 ppm, integrating to 1H. Maybe a CH group adjacent to something electronegative, like an oxygen. Or perhaps part of a larger substituent.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, 2H. Could be part of a chain attached to the aromatic ring.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet with 3H. This looks like a methyl group attached to something that's near a CH group. Maybe a CH(CH3) structure.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating to 3H, likely a terminal CH2CH3 group, so an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, the aromatic ring is para-substituted. The substituent is probably a carbonyl group attached to some alkyl chain. The NMR suggests a structure like para-substituted benzene with a ketone or another carbonyl group attached to a chain.

Looking at the substituent on the benzene: Let's say the structure is something like Ar-CO-R, where R is an alkyl group. The 2.9 ppm peak (1H) could be a CH adjacent to the carbonyl, like in a propionyl group. Then the 1.7 ppm (2H) would be the next CH2 in the chain, and the 1.4 ppm (3H) would be a CH(CH3) group? Wait, no, wait. Let me visualize.

Wait, I think the substituent might be a propanoyl group. Let me think: If the substituent is a propanoate or propanoic acid group. Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720, which could be a carbonyl, like from a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid. But the broad peak at 10.5 suggests an -OH, so perhaps it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. For a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is broad, around 2500-3000, but in this case, the IR has 3400â€“2500, which might include that. So maybe the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

But wait, the NMR shows a singlet at 10.5 ppm, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid's -OH. So maybe the structure is something like para-ethyl benzoic acid, but wait, the substituent would be -COOH. Let me see.

So, if the benzene ring has a -COOH group in the para position, and another substituent. Wait, but looking at the NMR, the substituent on the benzene might have more complexity.

Wait, let me try to reconstruct the structure. The aromatic region has two doublets, each 2H, which suggests a para-substituted benzene. So the substituent is at the para position. But the substituent itself might have a chain.

So the substituent is a carbonyl group (from the IR) attached to a chain. Let's say it's a benzoyl group, but I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone attached to a chain.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is an acyl group, like a propanoyl group. Let's think about the NMR shifts.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH next to the carbonyl. The 1.7 (m, 2H) could be a CH2 next to that CH. The 1.4 (d, 3H) could be a CH(CH3) group, but wait, if it's a CH(CH3), the splitting would be different. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl chain with a branch.

Alternatively, let's think substituent is -(CO)-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something?

Wait, let's think about the substituent. Let me try to draw it.

If the benzene ring has a group like -CO-R, where R is a substituent. So, the substituent R could be a isobutyl group or something similar. Because the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 (3H), which is a terminal CH2CH3. So perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)- group attached? Let me see.

Wait, in the NMR, there's a triplet at 0.9 (3H), which is probably a
