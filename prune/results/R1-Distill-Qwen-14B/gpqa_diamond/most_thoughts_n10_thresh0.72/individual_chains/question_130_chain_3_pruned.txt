Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy, specifically about detecting large clouds of neutral hydrogen using optical telescopes. Hmm, let me think. The question says that these clouds are absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet, but since we're talking about absorption, it's the same wavelength.

Wait, the Lyman alpha line is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nanometers, right? That's in the far ultraviolet range. But ground-based optical telescopes can't see that because the atmosphere absorbs a lot of UV light. So the question is about when that absorption line would shift into the optical range, making it detectable.

Redshift is involved here. The formula I remember is the redshift equation, which relates the observed wavelength (lambda_observed) to the rest wavelength (lambda_rest). The formula is (1 + z) = lambda_observed / lambda_rest. So z is the redshift.

But wait, since the hydrogen clouds are at a certain redshift, the light we receive, which is from the quasar behind them, has to have the Lyman alpha absorption line shifted into the optical range. Because if the quasar's light is at a higher redshift, the Lyman alpha would be in the optical. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the clouds are in front of the quasars. So the quasars are at a higher redshift than the clouds. But the clouds' hydrogen is
