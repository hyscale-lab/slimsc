Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem says two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with relative speeds at these velocities, you can't just subtract them normally because of relativity. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is (v - u)/(1 - (vu)/c²). Wait, no, let me get it right. The formula for the relative velocity is (v - u)/(1 - (vu)/(c²)), but wait, actually, I think it's the other way around. Let me think. If one object is moving at u and the other at v in the same direction, the relative speed is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the velocity of one from the other's frame.

Wait, the astronauts are moving in the same direction. So from the perspective of the first astronaut (mass 2m), what's the speed of the second one (3m, moving at 0.5c)? Or vice versa. Let me clarify: the relative speed between them would depend on whose frame we're considering. But the problem just asks for the relative speed, so I think it's the speed of one as seen from the other. So let's pick one frame. Let me choose the frame of the first astronaut (2m, moving at 0.6c). I need to find the speed of the second astronaut (0.5c) in this frame.

Wait, no. Wait, maybe I should think about it from the perspective of an observer at rest relative to the initial setup. So the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, the second at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from the first astronaut's frame, the second is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c² ). Let me compute that.

Wait, velocities are vectors. Let me denote u as 0.6c (the speed of the first astronaut as per the observer), and v as 0.5c (the speed of the second astronaut as per the observer). So from the first astronaut's frame, what is the speed of the second astronaut? That would be (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/c²).

Wait, no, wait. The formula is (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)), but I have to make sure which is which. Let me double-check. The formula for velocity transformation in relativity is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of the object in the original frame, and v is the velocity of the moving frame (the frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to S).
