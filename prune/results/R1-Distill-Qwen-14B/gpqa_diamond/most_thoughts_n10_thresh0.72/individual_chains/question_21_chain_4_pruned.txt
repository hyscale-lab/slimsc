Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So the question is about isomers and some specific compounds. Hmm, okay, let's break it down.

The question has two parts, A and B. I need to find which compound doesn't show tautomerism for A, and which one shows optical isomerism for B. Then, match the options.

First, part A: Benzoquinone vs cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I remember that tautomerism involves the relocation of hydrogen and electrons, like in keto-enol tautomerism. So, when a compound can tautomerize, it means it has the ability to shift between different forms.

Benzoquinone is a quinone, which is a cyclic ketone. Quinones typically have two ketone groups. Wait, can they undergo tautomerism? I'm trying to recall. Alternatively, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups in a six-membered ring. I think that if a compound has adjacent ketone groups, it might not be able to tautomerize because the necessary hydrogen isn't available. 

Wait, tautomerism usually requires a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group. For example, in a diketone, maybe. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups, but are they adjacent? Wait, benzoquinone is 1,4-benzoquinone, I think. So the ketones are opposite each other on the benzene ring. So the positions are 1 and 4, which are not adjacent. So each oxygen is in a position where there's a double bond in the ring. So, does that allow for enol tautomerism?

Wait, another point. Enol tautomerism requires a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl. In benzoquinone, each carbonyl is at positions 1 and 4. The adjacent carbons (like 2 and 3, 5 and 6) in the ring are connected by double bonds. So, maybe there's no hydrogen available on the carbons next to the carbonyl. Because in a benzene ring, the carbonyl carbons are double-bonded to oxygen, so the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring and have double bonds. So, no hydrogens to shift, so no tautomer
