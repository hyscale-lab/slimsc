Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says we have a particle of mass m moving in an isotropic three-dimensional potential V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh wait, that's the potential for a harmonic oscillator, right? So this is like a 3D quantum harmonic oscillator. The force here follows Hooke's law, which makes sense because F = -k r, and the potential is (1/2)k r². So in this case, k must be m ω². 

The question is asking for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for that same energy eigenvalue. The options are A to D. 

First, I need to figure out the energy levels. In a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized. I remember that the energy levels depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Wait, for a 3D isotropic HO, the energy is given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is a non-negative integer (n=0,1,2,...). But wait, no. Wait, that's not quite right. Each dimension contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so the total is the sum for each direction.

But wait, no. Let me think again. For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as E = (N + 3/2) ħω, where N = n_x + n_y + n_z. Oh right, N is the total quantum number, and each n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers. So N can be 0,1,2,3,... etc.

The ground state is when N=0: E = 3/2 ħω. The first excited state would be N=1, so E=5/2 ħω. The second excited state would be N=2, E=7/2 ħω. And the third excited state would be N=3
