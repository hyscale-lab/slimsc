Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again carefully. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are from A to D, involving different powers of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Parallax is the reciprocal of distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. Or wait, let me think: yes, parallax in arcseconds is inversely proportional to the distance in parsecs. So plx (in arcsec) = 1 / d (in parsecs). So if the distance d increases, the parallax decreases.

The number of stars, N, is given as proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So substituting plx with 1/d, that would make N proportional to (d)^5. Because 1/( (1/d) )^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how N changes with distance, per unit range of r. Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. The question says "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". Oh, right, so it's about the number per unit distance. So probably, it's the differential number of stars with distance, like the density as a function of distance.

So perhaps I should model it as N ∝ (1 / plx^5 ), and since plx = 1/d, then N = k * d^5, where k is a constant. But to find how the number changes with distance, like the rate of change, maybe I need to take the derivative of N with respect to d.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d, with thickness dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the surface area (which depends on d^2) multiplied by the volume element (which is 4π d^2 dr, but maybe in this case, since it's a thin shell, it's just the area times the number per unit volume? Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, let me think. The number of stars in a region is usually the product of the volume of that region and the density of stars. In this case, since the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, which in terms of d is d^5, so the number might be N = k * d^5. But if we're looking for how many stars there are per unit distance, perhaps we're looking for the derivative of N with respect to d, which would be dN/dd.

Wait, no. Wait, maybe the total number of stars up to a certain distance would be the integral of the number per unit distance. But the question is about the number in a range of distance, which is per unit distance. So perhaps the number per unit distance, say, n(r), would be the rate of change of N with respect to r. So n(r) = dN/dr.

Wait, but I think I should model it this way: The number of stars in a thin shell at distance r is given by the change in N as r increases by dr. So dN = (number density) * (volume of shell). The number density is the number of stars per unit volume. But wait, in the question, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So perhaps the number density itself is proportional to 1/plx^5.

Wait, but plx is 1/r. So if the number density (stars per unit volume) is proportional to 1/( (1/r) )^5 = r^5. So number density, n(r) = k r^5, where k is a constant.

Then, the number of stars per unit distance would be the number density multiplied by the volume of a thin shell (4π r^2 dr). Wait, no: Wait, the volume of a thin shell is 4π r^2 dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be n(r) * 4π r^2 dr. So that's (k r^5) * (4π r^2) dr = 4π k r^7 dr. So dN = 4π k r^7 dr.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of distance. So dN/dr would be 4π k r^7. But this is the number of stars per unit volume? Or perhaps the question is just looking for how the number per unit distance changes, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let's think about how the number of stars depends on parallax. The question states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5, which is N ∝ d^5, since plx = 1/d.

But the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So perhaps it's about the differential number, which would be the derivative of N with respect to d. If N = k d^5, then dN/dd = 5k d^4. So the number of stars increases with d^4 as d increases.

Wait, but the options are given as 'how the number... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)'. Wait, perhaps the question is asking about (dN/dr), the rate at which the number of stars increases per unit distance. So if N ∝ d^5, then dN/dd is proportional to d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases as d^4. So the answer would be option C, which is r^4.

But wait, let me clarify. N is proportional to 1/plx^5. plx is 1/d, so N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars increases rapidly with distance. But the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So if you move a small distance dr, how much does N change? So dN = (dN/dd) dr. So dN/dr is (dN/dd), which is 5 d^4. So the change per unit distance is proportional to d^4, so the number of stars per unit distance (i.e., the density) is proportional to d^4. So the answer would be option C, r^4.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the number of stars in a region of the sky as a function of distance. So if you have an area on the sky (so a fixed solid angle), as you look deeper into space (increasing d), the number of stars you see would depend on the density of stars along that line of sight and the volume you're looking through.

Wait, but the question states that the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So perhaps for a given solid angle, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So N ∝ d^5, as plx is 1/d.

Wait, but if we think about the number per unit distance, that would be the derivative of N with respect to d, which is dN/dd ∝ 5 d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to d^4.

So the correct answer would be option C, which is ~ r^4.


The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), substituting this into the relation gives \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the total number of stars increases rapidly with distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). To determine this, we consider the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( d \), which represents the rate of change of the number of stars with distance. If \( N \propto d^5 \), then:

\[
\frac{dN}{dd} \propto 5d^4
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit distance (i.e., the density of stars) is proportional to \( d^4 \). Therefore, the number of stars in the region of the sky increases with distance as \( r^4 \).

The correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
