Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question says the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant K is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions.

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, right? So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−. The formation constant Kf is given, which is the equilibrium constant for this reaction.

Oh wait, Kf is the formation constant, so in this case, K would be the same as Kf because the problem states KCa-EDTA is 5e10. So K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in solution, EDTA exists in different protonated forms depending on pH. Oh, right, the problem says the pH is ideal, so we don't have to worry about that. That simplifies things because we can assume that all the EDTA is in the form that can react with Ca²+. So, in that case, the effective concentration of EDTA^4- is the same as the concentration of free EDTA.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me think: if all the Ca is in the complex, how much free Ca²+ is there? Because the K is so large (5e10), the complex is very stable. So very little Ca²+ should be free.

So, the total concentration of Ca would be equal to the concentration of the complex plus the free Ca²+. But if K is very large, the free Ca²+ would be negligible compared to the complex. So, [Ca²+] ≈ x, and [CaEDTA] ≈ 0.02 M.

Wait, but how do I relate the concentrations? The formation constant equation is K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). 

But wait, the total EDTA in
