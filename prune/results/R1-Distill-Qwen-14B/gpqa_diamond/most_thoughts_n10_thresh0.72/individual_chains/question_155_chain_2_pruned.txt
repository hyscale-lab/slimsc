Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the uncertainty in P_z. Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty principle comes into play here, involving the expectation values of the operator and its square. Let's think through this step by step.

First, I need to understand the setup. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So this is the state vector ψ.

The uncertainty in P_z is given by the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to compute the expectation values ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩.

Wait, but wait. Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, that means the given state ψ is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. Oh, right, because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so each component of ψ corresponds to an eigenvalue of P_z.

But wait, the state is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So I can't directly read off the expectation values of P_z from the components. Because the state is in the P_z basis, but it's an eigenstate of P_x, which likely isn't diagonal in this basis. So I'll have to compute the expectation values using the matrix for P_z and the state ψ.

Wait, no. Since the state is in the P_z basis, each component is a projection onto a P_z eigenstate. Let me think. P_z is diagonal in this basis. So each basis vector is |n⟩, where n is an eigenvalue of P_z.

So the state ψ is a linear combination of these |n⟩ states. So to find ⟨P_z⟩, it's the sum of the probabilities of each eigenstate multiplied by their eigenvalues. Because when you have a state |ψ⟩ = a|n1⟩ + b|n2⟩ + c|n3⟩, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is |a|² n1 + |b|² n2 + |c|² n3.

Wait, but wait. Let me look at the state ψ: (-1/2, 1/√
