Okay, let's tackle this astronomy problem. Hmm, it's about stars and their effective temperatures, and how spots on the star affect the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, why would having spots lower the effective temperature? Oh right, because the spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So when spots cover part of the surface, the star's overall observed temperature decreases.

The question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). The ratio, when the star doesn't have spots, versus when it does. And they observed that this ratio decreases when spots are present. Wait, the ratio decreases? So when there are spots, the ratio N1/N2 is lower than when there are no spots.

But wait, the problem is to find the factor by which this ratio changes. So we're looking for (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_spots. Because the ratio decreases, this factor will be greater than 1.

In LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the number of atoms in energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio N1/N2 is proportional to (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(kT) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of each level, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, the ratio is N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(kT) ). Because E2 > E1, the exponential term is exp(-Î”E/(kT)), which is less than 1. So higher T would make the exponent less negative, leading to a larger ratio.

So when the star has spots, the overall T_eff is lower (5500 K) compared to 6000 K without spots. So the denominator in the exponent becomes smaller. Let's think: for higher T, the exponent is less negative, so the ratio N1/N2 is higher. Because with higher T, more atoms can be in the higher energy level, so the ratio N1/N2 would decrease.

Wait, wait. Let me get this straight. The lower the temperature, the less likely atoms are to be in higher energy levels. So if T decreases, the population in level 2 (higher energy) decreases relative to level 1. So N1/N2 increases when T decreases because N2 decreases more than N1. Wait, no. Let me think again.

The ratio N1/N2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(kT) ). Because E2 is larger than E1, so E2 - E1 is positive. So when T is lower, the exponent becomes larger in the denominator, making the exponential term smaller. So the ratio N1/N2 would be smaller when T is lower.
