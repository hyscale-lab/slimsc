Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR and reaction mechanisms can be tricky. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem gives me a molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. Then, it describes a series of reactions, and I need to figure out the final product from the options.

First, let's break down the molecular formula. C8H9NO. Hmm. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Each degree is a ring or a double bond. The formula is C8H9NO. So, the general formula for organic compounds is CnH2n+2OxN something. Wait, maybe a better approach is to subtract the hydrogen count for the formula.

For a molecule with C8H9NO:

Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is zero because there's no halogen. So, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1.

DoU = (2*8 + 2 -9 -0 +1 ) / 2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So, five degrees. That's a lot. Could be a combination of rings and double bonds.

Looking at the NMR data:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H) â†’ A triplet integrating to 1H. High ppm, probably an aldehyde proton, since aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. But wait, the splitting is a triplet. Aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and might be a singlet, but maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe an acidic proton like from a phenol, but that would be around 5 ppm or so. Wait, no, a phenol O-H is usually broad around 5 ppm. But this is 9.72, so probably an aldehyde.

Next, 6.98 (d, 2H): Doublet with 2H. That's typical of aromatic protons, maybe para-substituted. Like two aromatic protons as a doublet, maybe as part of a para-substituted benzene.

6.51 (d, 2H): Another double
