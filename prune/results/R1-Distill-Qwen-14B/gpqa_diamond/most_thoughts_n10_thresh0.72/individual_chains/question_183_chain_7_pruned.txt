Okay, so I have this organic chemistry question here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI. The options are A to D, with numbers 0, 1, 3, 5.

Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency, sometimes called the degree of unsaturation, is a way to count the number of rings and double bonds in a molecule. Each ring or double bond counts as one, and each triple bond counts as two, but I think in this case we're dealing mostly with double bonds and rings.

So, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me try to draw that structure. The main ring is cyclohexene, which has a double bond at position 3. So, the cyclohexene ring has a double bond between C3 and C4. Then, at position 2, there's a formyl group (which is a CHO group attached). At position 5, there's a vinyl group. Wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-, right? So, the substituents are at positions 2 and 5.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think: for cyclohex-3-ene, positions are 1,2,3,4,5,6. So, the double bond is between C3 and C4. Then, substituents at position 2 (formyl) and position 5 (vinyl). So, cyclohexene ring with substituents at 2 and 5.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. I'm trying to remember what that does. Oh, right! That's the reaction where red phosphorus helps in the elimination of HI from a molecule, but wait, no, actually, wait. Alternatively, when you have an acid like carboxylic
