Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR and calibration curves. Hmm, I remember that qPCR is used to quantify the amount of DNA or RNA in a sample. The scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers and serially diluted it. He ran three technical replicates for each dilution.

The efficiency is 100%, which means the reaction is perfect—each cycle halves the DNA, so every cycle corresponds to a doubling in DNA. R^2 is 1, which means the data fits perfectly with the standard curve. The slope was -3.3. Wait, I think the slope in qPCR is related to the efficiency. Oh right, the formula for efficiency is E = 10^(-1/slope). Since the slope is -3.3, that would make E = 10^(1/3.3) ≈ 10^0.303 ≈ 2. So efficiency is about 2, which makes sense for 100% efficiency as per the question.

Looking at the Ct values: for each tenfold dilution (like from 100000 to 10000, which is a 10x decrease), the Ct increases by about 3.3 cycles. Wait, why? Because if the efficiency is 100% (E=2), then each tenfold dilution should increase the Ct by log10(10)/log10(2) which is about 3.32 cycles. Oh! So in each tenfold dilution, the Ct should go up by approx 3.3 cycles. So for 100000 to 10000, the Ct goes from 34 to 30.6? Wait, no, wait. Wait, looking at the data:

At 100000: Ct is around 34.2 (average of 33.9,34.2,34.5)
At 10000: Ct is around 30.9 (average 30.6,30.9,31.2)
The difference is about 3.3 (34.2-30.9=3.3). Similarly, next dilution goes from 30.9 to 27.3, which is a difference of about 3.6. Wait, that's a bit more than 3.3. Oh, but wait, the slope is -3.3, which suggests each tenfold decrease should increase Ct by 3.3. But in the data, from 100000 to 10000, the Ct increases by 3.3. Then from 10000 to 1000: 30.9 to 27.3 is a 3.6 increase. Hmm, that's a bit more. Similarly, from 1000 to 100, it's 24.0 to 27.3? Wait no, 1000 to 100 is 1000 to 100, which is a 10x decrease. So the Ct should go up by about 3.3, but the data shows 27.3 (for 1000) and 24 (for 100). Wait, that's a decrease in Ct by 3.3 cycles. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because when you dilute the sample 10x, you're starting with less DNA, so the Ct should be higher (since it takes longer to reach the threshold). So from 1000 copies to 100 copies, the Ct goes from 27.3 to 24. So that's a decrease of 3.3. Which would mean the Ct is going down, not up, when the DNA amount goes down. That's the opposite of what should happen. Wait, did I get the data right?
