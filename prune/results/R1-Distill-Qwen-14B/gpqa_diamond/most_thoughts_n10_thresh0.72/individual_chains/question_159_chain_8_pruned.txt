Okay, so I've got this question about a quasar observed in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. The peak is at about 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly below that. Hmm, I remember that quasars are very bright and they emit across the electromagnetic spectrum. But wait, the question is about the comoving distance from Earth. Oh right, comoving distance depends on the universe's expansion and geometry.

The question gives some cosmological parameters based on the Lambda-CDM model. The Hubble constant is 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density parameter is 0.3, dark energy (dark energy density parameter is 0.7), and the universe is flat. So flat universe means that the spatial geometry is Euclidean, which is an important factor for calculating distances.

I think the peak wavelength being 790 nm is a clue. Wait, redshift! Because if the quasar is moving away, the wavelength would be stretched. But wait, 790 nm is in the near-infrared. Normal emission from a quasar might peak in the optical. So if the observed peak is shifted to longer wavelengths, that suggests redshift due to the expansion of the universe.

Wait, the question is about the comoving distance. The comoving distance is a way to measure distance in
