Okay, I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll have to think it through carefully. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. The key point is their apparent V magnitudes because each spectrograph has different brightness limits.

So, the given data says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V=17 mag. Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, it says stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17. Wait, no, wait â€” no, wait, the wording is a bit tricky. It says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Wait, no, no, wait. Magnitude scale is such that lower numbers are brighter. So if a telescope can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, that means it can see stars with V magnitudes less than 17. Because, for example, a star with V=16 is brighter than V=17.

Wait, no, the question says: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So that would mean that the apparent magnitude has to be less than 17, because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V < 17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so V < 16.

Wait, no, wait again. The way it's phrased is: "brighter than 17 mag can be observed". So, if a star is brighter than 17 mag, meaning its apparent magnitude is less than 17, then ESPRESSO can detect it. Similarly for HIRES, if a star is brighter than 16 (V < 16), it can be observed.

So, the stars must have apparent V magnitudes
