Okay, so I have this science problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to break it down step by step. Hmm, let's read the question again and see what each part is saying.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W has molecules where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. When a precipitate G forms, heating it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analogs.

I think I need to figure out what Substance X is. Let me start by identifying each component.

First, the gas W. Its molecule has equal numbers of neutrons and protons. So each molecule has p = n. Wait, but for a molecule, the number of protons is the sum of protons in each atom, and the number of neutrons is the sum of neutrons in each atom. Hmm, maybe it's a molecule where each atom has p = n? Or maybe the molecule as a whole has p_total = n_total.

Wait, the problem says the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So for example, if W is H₂O, then protons would be 2 (from H) + 8 (from O) = 10, and neutrons would be 1 (from each H, so 2) + 8 (O has 8) = 10. So H₂O would fit because 10 protons and 10 neutrons. Alternatively, maybe CO, which has 1 C (6 protons, 6 neutrons) and 1 O (8 protons, 8 neutrons) → total protons 14, total neutrons 14. So CO could be W.

Wait, but gas W is released when X reacts with Y. Let's think about possible reactions. Oh, maybe X is a metal that reacts with an acid (liquid Y) to produce hydrogen gas. Wait, but in that case, H2 would be the gas. H2 has 2 H atoms, each with 1 proton and 1 neutron. So total protons 2, neutrons 2. That fits p = n. So W could be H₂.

Alternatively, if W is CO
