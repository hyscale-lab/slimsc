Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the pH of this solution. Hmm, the problem gives me three different solutions that are mixed together. Let's see. The solutions are 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other, so I need to find out if there's excess acid or base left after mixing.

First, I think I should calculate the moles of each acid and base. Because when you mix them, the moles will determine how much neutralization happens.

Let me start with CH3COOH. It's a weak acid, right? But the problem is about pH, so I'll need to consider how much H+ it contributes. Wait, but since there's also HCl and Ba(OH)2, maybe I should first figure out the total H+ and OH- in the mixture.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates completely, so each mole gives two OH- ions. HCl is a strong acid, so each mole gives one H+.

So, let's calculate each component's moles.

For CH3COOH: volume is 0.5 L, concentration 0.1 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.1 = 0.05 moles.

HCl: 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 moles HCl. Since it's HCl, it gives 0.08 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions, so moles OH- = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but when you mix acids and bases, they neutralize each other. So maybe I should find the total H+ and total OH- in the mixture.

So total H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, so it's fully dissociated. CH3
