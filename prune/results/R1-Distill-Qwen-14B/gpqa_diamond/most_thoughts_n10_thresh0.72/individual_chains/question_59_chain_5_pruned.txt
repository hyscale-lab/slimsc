Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with pH calculations, especially when there are multiple acids and bases involved. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says we have a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. I need to find the pH of the resulting mixture.

Hmm, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, you have to consider the neutralization reactions. So the first thing I should probably do is figure out how much of each acid and base we're dealing with, then see if they neutralize each other or if there's an excess.

Wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So the reaction between the acids and the base should be straightforward. Let's think about the total moles of each.

First, calculate the moles for each solution.

For CH3COOH (acetic acid):
Molarity (M) = moles / liters. So moles = M * V (in liters).
So 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles.

HCl:
0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles.

Ba(OH)2:
Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-.
So moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. But since each mole gives 2 OH-, the total OH- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but wait a minute. Bases and acids will react. The H+ from acids will react with OH- from the base. So I should sum up all the H+ from the acids and all the OH- from the base, then see which is in excess.

So total H+ comes from CH3COOH and HCl. Wait, but wait: CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. Hmm, but when considering neutralization with a strong base, maybe I should treat the acetic acid as contributing H+ ions as well? Or perhaps first calculate the total H+ and OH- available.

Wait, no. Because when you mix an acid and a base, the H+ and OH- will react. So the total H+ available is from both HCl and CH3COOH, but wait, for the purpose of neutralization, perhaps only the strong acid contributes all its H+ and the weak acid contributes less? Or is it that the weak acid's H+ will react as well because it's in solution?

Hmm, maybe I should consider all the H+ from strong acids and some from weak acids, but in the context of neutralization, perhaps only the strong acid's H+ is fully available. Alternatively, perhaps the weak acid's H+ is negligible compared to the strong acid and
