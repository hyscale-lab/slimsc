Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it.

The question says that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, and all the angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. They're asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Hmm, interplanar distance... I remember that's the d-spacing, right? Like the distance between adjacent lattice planes.

Rhombohedral crystals... I think they have a rhombohedral lattice, which is a type of hexagonal system, but maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh wait, no, rhombohedral is a form of cubic system but with all edges equal and angles not necessarily 90 degrees. In this case, all angles are 30 degrees, so it's a non-orthogonal rhombohedral structure.

The formula I recall for interplanar distance is d = a / sqrt(l² + m² + n² + 2lm cosα + 2ln cosβ + 2mn cosγ), where a is the lattice parameter, and l, m, n are the Miller indices. Wait, but wait, I think it's different. Oh right, maybe the formula is d = (a) / sqrt( (h)^2 + (k)^2 + (l)^2 + 2hk cosα + 2hl cosβ + 2kl cosγ ) ... wait, no, maybe the signs are different? Or perhaps it's for a different type of crystal.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Another approach: I remember that for a cubic system, it's simpler, but for non-cubic, it's more complicated. Since this is rhombohedral, which is a special case of the hexagonal system? Or maybe it's a separate system. Maybe I should think about the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal.

The general formula I think applies to any crystal system. The interplanar distance d for a plane with Miller indices (hkl) is given by:

d = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ )

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure about that. Another thought: in the case of a rhombohedral crystal, which has a = b = c, and α =
