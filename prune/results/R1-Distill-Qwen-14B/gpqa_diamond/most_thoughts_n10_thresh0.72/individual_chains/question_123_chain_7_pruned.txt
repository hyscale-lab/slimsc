Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and some ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see what I can figure out.

Alright, the question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. And the question is, how far does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame? Oh, right, and we can ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution, so it's all about relative motion.

Wait, so first, I remember that when dealing with velocities in different reference frames, especially when things are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, special relativity might come into play. But wait, 60,000 km/s is a big number. Let me think: the speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is 20% the speed of light. That's a substantial fraction but not super high. So maybe we can't ignore relativistic effects, but maybe the problem expects a classical approach? Or maybe it's expecting to use the time dilation formula from special relativity.

Wait, the problem says both are inertial frames, so we can probably use the Lorentz transformation or something. Let me think about the frames here.

Let me denote the Galaxy's frame as S and the ejecta's frame as S'. In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So in S', the Galaxy's velocity is u = -60,000 km/s (since it's moving towards the ejecta, which is at rest in S'). But wait, in the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s. So their velocities are inverses of each other.

Wait, no, the problem says that from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. So in S' (ejecta
