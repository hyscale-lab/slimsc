Okay, so I have this question in front of me about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my organometallics, but I'll try to think it through. 

Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions, right? So that's breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds. The starting material here is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers, so the molecule has a chiral center.

Let me draw the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent means five carbons, and the double bond starts at carbon 1. So it's CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, 3-methyl would be on carbon 3. Let's see: the structure is actually CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Wait, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the full structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Or is it CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)- something else? Wait, no, wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me count the carbons. Pentene has five carbons. For pent-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But wait, that's 1-pentene. But we have a 3-methyl substituent. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)? No, wait, no. Wait, 3-methyl would be on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait, that would make it six carbons. Oh wait, no, maybe I'm counting wrong. Let's think again.

Pent-1-ene: positions are 1,2,3
