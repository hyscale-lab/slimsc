Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Wait, what's metathesis again? Oh right, it's a reaction where the catalyst breaks and reforms carbon-carbon double bonds, effectively redistributing the substituents between the alkenes.

So the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. But wait, since the molecule has a double bond, does it have any stereogenic centers? Let me draw the structure.

3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CHCH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃. Wait, is that correct? Let me count the carbons. Pent-1-ene has five carbons with the double bond starting at carbon 1. So carbon 2 is next to the double bond. Wait, 3-methyl would be on carbon 3, which is the third carbon. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3? Wait, that can't be right because the double bond is between C1 and C2, so the chain is:

Carbon 1: CH2=
Carbon 2: CH-
Carbon 3: CH(CH3)-
Carbon
