Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments involving GFP-tagged proteins. Hmm, I need to figure out what process is happening based on the observations.

Let me read the question again. So they tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then, through imaging, they saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid and some tangled in mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. Then they isolated the fluorescent Peyer patches and looked at the variable heavy chain genes, which showed high variability. The question is about which process is taking place.

Wait, Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), right? They're specialized for sampling antigens in the gut. When the rotavirus proteins are delivered orally, the immune system in the gut should respond.

So, in the Peyer patches, the antigens are probably being taken up by antigen-presenting cells, like dendritic cells or M cells. Once the antigen is there, it's presented to B cells. If the B cells recognize the antigen, they get activated.

The variable heavy chain gene variability suggests something about the B cell receptors. Variable regions are part of the B cell receptor (BCR) diversity. High variability usually comes from processes that generate diversity in the BCRs.

The options given are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

VDJ recombination is the process during B cell development in the bone marrow where the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments are combined to form the heavy chain. This happens during the maturation of B cells in the early stages, before they leave the bone marrow.

Somatic hypermutation (option A) occurs after the B cells have been activated. It's a process where the variable regions of the BCR are mutated, increasing the diversity of the antibodies. This happens in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues, like the Peyer patches.

Class switching (option C) is when the B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG), which involves recombination of the heavy chain's constant region. But this doesn't directly cause variability in the variable regions; it's more about function.

Complement activation (option B) is part of the innate immune response, involving the complement system's proteins to target pathogens. It's not directly related to the variability in the B cell's heavy chain genes.

So in this experiment, they're seeing high variability in the variable heavy chain genes in the Peyer patches. That suggests that the B cells are undergoing a process that diversifies their variable regions. Somatic hypermutation is a key process that happens in germinal centers, where B cells are activated and undergo this mutation to increase the specificity and affinity of their antibodies.

Wait, but when is somatic hypermutation occurring? It's during the immune response, after the B cell is activated. In the Peyer patches, which are part of the GALT, the B cells would be activated by the antigen, then move to the germinal centers where they undergo this hypermutation.

So the observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain genes indicates that the B cells are undergoing somatic hypermutation. Because each B cell's variable region can mutate, leading to a diverse population.

So the process is A) somatic hypermutation.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. The fluorescence observations indicate that some proteins are destroyed by stomach acid or entangled in intestinal mucus, while others reach the Peyer patches, which are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). In the Peyer patches, the variable heavy chain genes of the proliferating cell population show high variability. This suggests a process that generates diversity in the B cell receptor (BCR) variable regions.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs in germinal centers after B cell activation, leading to mutations in the variable regions of the BCR to increase diversity and antibody specificity. This matches the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **B) Complement activation**: This is part of the innate immune response and does not directly relate to variability in B cell receptor genes.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This involves changing the class of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG) and affects the constant region of the heavy chain, not the variable region.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J gene segments are combined. However, this process is not relevant to the observed variability in the Peyer patches, as it happens earlier in B cell maturation.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes observed in the Peyer patches is consistent with somatic hypermutation, a process that diversifies BCRs during the immune response in germinal centers. 

Answer: A
