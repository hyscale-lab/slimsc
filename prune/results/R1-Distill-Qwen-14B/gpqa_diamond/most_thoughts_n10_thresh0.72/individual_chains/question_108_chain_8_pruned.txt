Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about paramagnetic coupling and the hydrogen atom's energy levels. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. It also mentions small values of m, which I think refers to the orbital magnetic quantum number. Oh right, m can be -1, 0, +1 for p orbitals, but wait, the problem says small m, so maybe m=0 or maybe m=±1? Well, maybe the specific value isn't too critical for the magnitude comparison.

The problem is to compare the paramagnetic coupling term, which I believe is the energy due to the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field. This is also known as the Zeeman effect, right? So the paramagnetic coupling term is part of the Hamiltonian for that interaction.

The transition energy ΔE is for the hydrogen atom with a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. Oh wait, 0.4861 micrometers is about 486.1 nm. That sounds familiar—wait, that's the wavelength for the Balmer series in hydrogen. The Balmer series is the transition from n=2 to n=1, but wait, no, wait. Let me think. The Balmer-alpha line is at about 656 nm, which is longer than 486 nm. Hmm, 486 nm is known as the Balmer-beta line, which corresponds to a transition from n=4 to n=2. Or wait, maybe n=3 to n=2? Let me think. The wavelengths for the Balmer series are around 400 nm (n=4→2) up to about 650 nm (n=2→1), but I'm not too sure. Maybe I should calculate the energy instead.

So, first, I need to find the paramagnetic coupling term, which is the Zeeman energy. The formula for the Zeeman effect is ΔE_zeeman = μ_B * B * m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m is the magnetic quantum number. Wait, but wait, when m is small, like m=0 or m=±1, the term is small, right?

But wait, no, the paramagnetic coupling term for the hydrogen atom's energy levels would be given by the Hamiltonian H = -μ·B. For an electron, the magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B m, where g is the Landé g-factor (about 2 for electrons), and μ_B is the Bohr magneton. But when you take the expectation value, it's proportional to m.

Alternatively, the energy shift is ΔE_zeeman = (μ_B * B * m) multiplied by some factor. Wait, let me get the exact expression. Oh right, the Zeeman term is H_Zeeman = (e/(2m_e)) * (L · B), but in the case of a uniform magnetic field, it's proportional to m times B. So the energy shift would be something like μ_B * B * m.
