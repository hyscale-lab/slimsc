Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it step by step. Let's read the question again.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. It says that constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but different structures. Stereoisomers have the same connectivity but differ in spatial arrangement. Then the question asks, among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which one doesn't show tautomerism (part A). Then, between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which one shows optical isomerism (part B).

So, I need to figure out part A and part B and choose the correct option from A to D.

Starting with part A: which compound doesn't show tautomerism.

Tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen atom and the shift of a bond (usually a double bond) between adjacent atoms, resulting in a different structure. It's common in compounds with acidic protons, especially in carbonyl-containing compounds. For example, keto-enol tautomerism.

Benzoquinone: I remember that benzoquinone is an aromatic compound with two ketone groups. Specifically, I think it's a cyclic structure with two oxygen atoms in the ring. Wait, benzoquinone could be 1,2-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone. Either way, it has two ketone groups. But wait, can it undergo tautomerism? Hmm, I'm not sure. Benzoquinone, being fully conjugated, might not have the necessary hydrogen and double bond arrangement for tautomerism. Alternatively, maybe it can't because the structure is too rigid or lacks the required protons?

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: This compound has three ketone groups in a cyclohexane ring. Each ketone is at positions 1,3,5. So the structure is a six-membered ring with three keto groups. Now, can this undergo tautomerism? Well, each keto group is a carbonyl. For tautomerism, you typically need an adjacent hydrogen that can shift. But in this case, each carbonyl is on the ring, but there are no adjacent hydrogens because each is at 1,3,5 positions. So maybe it canâ€™t undergo tautomerism because there's no hydrogen on the adjacent carbon. Alternatively, maybe it can, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: Tautomerism requires a hydrogen that's alpha to the carbonyl. In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is on the ring. Let's imagine the structure: each of the carbons at positions 1,3,5 has a carbonyl (C=O). The adjacent carbons (like position 2,4,6) would be CH2 groups. So each of those CH2 groups is next to a carbonyl. So those CH2 groups have hydrogens that are alpha to the carbonyl. So maybe tautomerism is possible.

But wait, if all three carbonyls are present, maybe it's too rigid. Or perhaps the molecule can
