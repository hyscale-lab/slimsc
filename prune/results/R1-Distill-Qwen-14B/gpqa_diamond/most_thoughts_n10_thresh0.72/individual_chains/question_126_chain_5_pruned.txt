Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the problem carefully.

The question involves two reactions performed by an organic chemist. Each reaction uses different starting materials and reagents, and then the products are combined and run on two different HPLC columns. The task is to determine how many peaks the chemist observes in each type of HPLC chromatogram.

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts. I'll first figure out what each reaction does, then determine the products, and finally analyze the HPLC results.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.

I remember that LAH (lithium aluminum hydride) is a strong reducing agent. It's typically used to reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the starting material is a ketone, hexan-3-one. The structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one would be a six-carbon chain with a ketone group on carbon 3, a methoxy group on carbon 5, and the configuration is S.

When LAH reduces a ketone, it converts the carbonyl group (C=O) into a CH-OH group. So, the product after LAH treatment would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but wait—after the reaction, there's an acidic workup. Oh right, LAH typically provides the alcohol, and then acidic workup (like H+ and H2O) protonates any remaining enolates or ensures the alcohol is fully formed.

Wait, but wait another thing. The starting material is (S)-configured. Since the ketone is at position 3, the reduction would add two hydrogens—so the configuration at C3 would change? Wait, no. The ketone is a planar sp² hybridized carbon. When you reduce it to an alcohol, the new OH group can be added from either face, but since the starting material is an (S) configuration, the stereochemistry might not carry over. Wait, wait, no—wait, perhaps the starting material is (S) at the chiral center. Let me think about the structure.

The molecule is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH(CH2OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-CO-(CH2)3. So, the structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH(CH2OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe it's:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6
Structure: CH2-CH2-CO-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. No, wait, 5-methoxy would be on the fifth carbon. So, hexan-3-one is:

1: CH3
