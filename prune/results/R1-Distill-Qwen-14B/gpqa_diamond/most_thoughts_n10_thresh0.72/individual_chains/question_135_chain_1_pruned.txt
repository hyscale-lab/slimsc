Okay, so I've got this question about particle physics and the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term: L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit confused about the notation here. So the Lagrangian is written as involving a bosonic field X interacting with fermions. The term looks like it's a Yukawa coupling, which is typical for fermion-boson interactions. The ψ_f would be the fermion fields, right?

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, I need to figure out which fermion-antifermion pairs X can decay into.

First, I should remember that for a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because in particle physics, the rest mass energy of the daughter particles must be less than or equal to the mass of the parent. So, if X is 6 GeV, each fermion in the decay products must have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV. Wait, because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV. So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV would be allowed.

Wait, but what are the masses of the various fermions? Let me think. I remember that the masses of the quarks vary, but the up, down, strange, and possibly others are lighter. The top quark is very heavy, like around 173 GeV, so much more than 3 GeV. The bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV, I think. Let me double-check that. Wait, no, I'm a bit rusty. The masses:

- Up quark: around 2 MeV (so negligible compared to 3 GeV)
- Down quark: similar, about 4-5 MeV
- Strange quark: around 95-100 MeV
- Charm quark: about 1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark: about 4.7 GeV
- Top quark: about 173 GeV
- For leptons:
    - Electron: 0.511 MeV
    - Muon: 105.7 MeV
    - Tau: about 1.78 GeV
    - Neutrinos are negligible, but they're not charged, so they don't form charged pairs that would be in the decay products of a charged boson. Wait, but in this case, the boson X's decay must produce charged fermions if the boson is neutral. Wait, the given Lagrangian term has ψ_f, which are spinor fields. So, if X is a neutral boson, then the decay products would have to be fermion-antifermion pairs of charged leptons or quarks.

Wait, but the initial Lagrangian term is given as -λ f f(y)(v + X) ψ_f. Hmm, perhaps λ is a coupling constant, and f is the fermion flavor or something. Wait, perhaps the interaction is that the boson X couples to fermions. So, the decay X → f f̄ would be allowed if the mass is sufficient.

So, the decay X → f f̄ is allowed if m_X ≥ 2 m_f.

Given m_X is 6 GeV, so 2 m_f ≤ 6 GeV → m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

Looking at the fermion masses:

- For quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top.

Charm quark is ~1.5 GeV, so 2*1.5 = 3 GeV → X can
