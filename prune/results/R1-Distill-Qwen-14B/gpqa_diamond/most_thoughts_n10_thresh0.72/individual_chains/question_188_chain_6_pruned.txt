Okay, so I've got this question about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, rhombohedral, right. I remember that a rhombohedral crystal has all its edges equal and all angles equal too. So, it's like a cube that's been deformed a bit, but all the angles are the same. The interatomic distance given is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. Wait, that's quite a sharp angle, like less than 60 degrees.

The question is asking about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I'm a bit rusty on crystallography, but I think the formula for interplanar distance d in a crystal is related to the reciprocal of the plane's Miller indices. Oh right, the formula is d = a / sqrt(l² + m² + n² - 2lm*cos α - 2ln*cos β - 2mn*cos γ), but wait, I'm not sure if that's exactly right. Or was it something else?

Wait, wait. Oh right, in a general crystal system, the interplanar distance formula for a plane (hkl) is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ ), but wait, no, I think I mixed up the signs. Let me think again. Oh, right, the formula for a rhombohedral system (which is a special case of a hexagonal system, but wait no, rhombohedral is a separate system, part of the cubic systems when angles are 90, but in this case, angles are 30 degrees). 

Wait, maybe I should recall the general formula. The general formula for interplanar spacing in any crystal system is given by:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α)/(a²)

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting the angles wrong. Because in the formula, the angles between the lattice vectors matter. In a rhombohedral system, all angles are equal, so α = β = γ = 30 degrees here.

The formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is a bit different because of the angles. For a general plane (hkl), the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +
