Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out the probability of getting specific outcomes after measuring two observables, P and Q, in sequence. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem step by step.

The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, right? Oh wait, maybe I should check that first. The given vector is (-1, 2, 1) as a column. Let's compute its norm. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6), which means the state vector isn't normalized. That's a bit confusing. Wait, maybe I should normalize it before proceeding? Because in quantum mechanics, state vectors are supposed to be unit vectors. So perhaps the actual state is this vector divided by sqrt(6). I'll keep that in mind as I proceed.

Next, the problem gives me the matrices for the operators P and Q. Let's write them out.

Operator P matrix:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Operator Q matrix:
First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1

So, Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. So when we measure Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, and -1. The eigenstates are the standard basis vectors in this case because Q is diagonal. For instance, the state |1> is (1,0,0), |0> is (0,1,0), and |-1> is (0,0,1).

The question asks for the probability of getting 0 when measuring P and -1 when measuring Q, but wait, the measurement order is important. It says measuring Q just after P. So the order is P first, then Q. Or is it the other way around? Wait, the question says "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P", so the sequence is P first, then Q.

Wait, when you measure a quantum observable, the system collapses into an eigenstate of the measured operator. So after measuring P, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P. Then, when measuring Q, it's based on this new state.

But wait, the problem is asking for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So let's break it down.

First, find the probability that measuring P gives 0. Then, for each possible eigenstate of P (after P is measured), find the probability of measuring -1 for Q. But wait, no. Because once P is measured, the state collapses to an eigenstate of P. Then, measuring Q on that state will give the corresponding eigenvalue for Q, assuming that the eigenstate of P is also an eigenstate
