Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with spectroscopy, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that an unknown compound was prepared and characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR shows a very broad peak at 3000 cm^-1. There are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. The 1H NMR has peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. The mass spec shows a fragment at m/z=45. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, the FTIR. A broad peak around 3000 usually indicates O-H stretching. So maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid or something with an -OH group. The broadness suggests it's not a very strong, sharp peak, which is typical for O-H in alcohols or maybe even an ester (but esters usually have less broad peaks, I think). Wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H peak because of their strong hydrogen bonding.

Then there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. 1700 is a common region for carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or maybe carboxylic acids. The 1650 is a bit lower, which might suggest something else. Oh, wait, like conjugated carbonyls. Maybe an ester or an acid, but also, perhaps an aromatic ring with ketone groups or something else.

So the IR suggests there are two carbonyl groups? Or maybe one and something else. Wait, two strong peaks, so maybe two different carbonyl groups. So maybe a compound with two carbonyl-containing functional groups.

But another thought: 1700 is more like a ketone or ester, while 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, like an aromatic C=C stretching. Oh wait, aromatic C=C is usually around 1450-1600. So 1650 could be conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, maybe a ketone next to a double bond.

Wait, but another thought: 1650 could also be an amide or something else. But looking at the options, they don't have nitrogen. So maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl means they're attached to a double bond. So the compound probably has a double bond. Maybe something like an ester with a double bond adjacent, or maybe a ring with substituents.

Then the mass spec has a fragment peak at m/z=45. So what could that be? 45 is a common fragment. Let's think about possible fragments. One possibility is CH
