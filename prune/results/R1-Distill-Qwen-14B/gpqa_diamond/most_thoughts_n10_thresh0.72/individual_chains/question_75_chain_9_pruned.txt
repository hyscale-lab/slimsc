Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the transgenic mice. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's think through it step by step.

The setup is that they're creating a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. They introduced a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of the protein. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when they checked, the protein wasn't expressed as expected.

Looking at the problem, they noticed that the plasmid's plus strand sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon, so that's good. The sequence continues with the coding regions. But why isn't the protein being expressed?

The options are A to D. Let's go through them.

Option A: The HA sequence has a missense mutation. So maybe the HA tag isn't correctly added. If the HA sequence is messed up, the antibody might not recognize it for affinity purification, but that wouldn't necessarily prevent expression. The construct would still be made, just not detectable with the HA antibody. But the question is about overexpression not happening, which is more about the protein not being made in the first place.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would mean a premature stop codon, so the protein is shorter. If there's a stop codon in the sequence, that could be an issue. Let me look at the sequence. The sequence starts with ATG and ends with TGA. Wait, no, waitâ€”the end is TGA at the very end? Let me check. The last few nucleotides: ...ATGTGA3'. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop codon. Wait, but that's at the end of the coding sequence. So that's normal, right? Because the coding sequence should end with a stop codon.

Wait, but the way the construct is designed, they added the HA tag at the N-terminus. So the start is HA sequence followed by GADD45G. The sequence provided includes the HA tag, the GADD45G coding, and ends with TGA. But wait, the HA tag is added to the N-terminus, so is the HA tag's sequence correctly fused?

Another thought: sometimes when you add a tag, you have to include a Kozak sequence or proper start codon context, especially in mammalian systems. The Kozak sequence is important in eukaryotes for initiating translation. It's typically around the start codon, with a consensus of 'CCRCCAUGG'. If the Kozak sequence is missing or disrupted, the ribosome might not initiate translation properly, leading to low or no expression.
