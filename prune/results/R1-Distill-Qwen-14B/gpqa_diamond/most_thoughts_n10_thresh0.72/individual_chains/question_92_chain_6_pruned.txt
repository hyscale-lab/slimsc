Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That's a mouthful. Let me try to count the carbons and bonds. Maybe drawing the structure would help, but I'll just visualize it.

The problem provides bond energies for various bonds. Oh wait, the question is about enthalpy of formation, which usually involves the bonds breaking and forming. I remember that the enthalpy of formation is calculated using the bond energies of the reactants and products.

Wait, but the question here gives me atomization energy for carbon, and bond energies for H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H. Oh, right, the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in an element to produce its atoms in the gas phase. So for carbon, it's 1000 kJ/mol.

Hmm, but how does that tie into the enthalpy of formation of the molecule? Oh wait, the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the bond energies. The formula I think is: 

ΔHf° = Σ (Bond energies of reactants) - Σ (Bond energies of products)

Wait no, wait. Actually, I think it's the reverse when considering the formation from elements. Let me think
