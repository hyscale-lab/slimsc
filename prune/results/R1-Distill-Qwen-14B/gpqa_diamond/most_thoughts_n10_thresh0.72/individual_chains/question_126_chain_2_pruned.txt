Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it again and break it down.

So, the question involves two reactions, Reaction I and Reaction II, each starting with different compounds. After performing both reactions and combining the products, the mixture is analyzed using two types of HPLC columns: normal-phase and a chiral stationary phase. I need to figure out how many peaks each HPLC will show.

Let's start by understanding each reaction and their products.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

LAH is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, hexan-3-one would become hexan-3-ol. But wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is CH2CH2(OCH3)COCH2CH2CH3? Wait, wait, let me imagine it. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3. But in this case, the 5th carbon (from the ketone) has a methoxy group. So the structure would be:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, no. Numbering from the ketone. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, maybe better to draw it out.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that the starting material has a ketone group at position 3 and a methoxy group at position 5. So upon treatment with LAH, the ketone (position 3) will be reduced to a secondary alcohol. So the product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but wait, does LAH affect the methoxy group? Methoxy is an electron-donating group; LAH
