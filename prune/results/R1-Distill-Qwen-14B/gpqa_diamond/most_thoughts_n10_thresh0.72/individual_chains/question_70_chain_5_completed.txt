Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, so I've got this reaction scenario, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, or C2v. 

First, let's break down the information given step by step.

The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Next, when C reacts with water, it reforms A and two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak. Lastly, gas D reacts with gas B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

I think I should start by identifying what each substance could be. Let's see. The red product C might be something like copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate, but wait, that's blue. Alternatively, maybe it's a different compound. Or perhaps C is a metal sulfide? Wait, no, that's usually black or yellow. Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction forms a sulfate or sulfide.

Wait, let's think about the second reaction where C reacts with D to form E. Also, D and B form H, which is a solvent. D and B in a 1:1 ratio—maybe something like HCl? Because HCl is a common solvent. So if H is HCl, then B and D reacting would produce HCl. So B plus D → HCl.

Hmm, what gases react to form HCl? That's typically from H and Cl, but maybe more accurately, perhaps B is H2 and D is Cl2? Because H2 and Cl2 can combine to form HCl, but under certain conditions, like in the presence of light, they react to form HCl (but that's more of a decomposition reaction). Wait, no, more accurately, H2 and Cl2 react to form HCl, but that's when they combine. Wait, no, actually, when H2 and Cl2 react, they produce HCl. So, if H is HCl, then B is H2 and D is Cl2? Or the other way around?

Wait, but wait, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H. So perhaps B is H2 and D is Cl2, so 1 mole each produces 2 moles of HCl? No, wait, H2 + Cl2 → 2 HCl. So that's a 1:1 ratio of H2 and Cl2, producing two HCl molecules. So that's correct. So H is HCl. So D is Cl2 and B is H2.

Wait, but in the first reaction, A reacts with 8 equivalents of B (H2) to form C. So A is perhaps a metal oxide or sulfide. Let's see.

So when C reacts with water, it gives back A plus two acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So maybe C is a sulfide, but when it reacts with water, it produces H2S (a weak acid) and maybe another strong acid like H2SO4.

Wait, but let's see. If C is a sulfide of a metal, like CuS, reacting with water might not form much. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide. Wait, but metal oxides (like Na2O) reacting with water would form the metal hydroxide and H2O, but that doesn't give two acids.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfate salt. For example, copper sulfate pentahydrate is blue, but the product C is bright red. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, maybe it's an oxide that forms two different acids.

Alternatively, considering the first reaction: A + 8 B → C. If B is H2, then 8 equivalents would be 8 moles for each mole of A. So the reaction could be something like A (a metal) reacting with H2 to form a hydride. Wait, perhaps not. Another angle: maybe A is a metal oxide, and B is hydrogen gas, and the reaction forms a metal hydride.

Wait, but when C reacts with water, it forms A plus two acids. So if C is a metal hydride, reacting with water would produce H+ ions. But that might form a strong acid like H2SO4 or HCl, but in that case, where does the second acid come from?

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide. If C is a sulfide, like CuS, and when it reacts with water, it might decompose. Wait, but sulfides don't usually react with water to form two acids. Unless it's a more complex situation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a nitride. For example, if A is a metal, and B is H2, and the reaction forms a metal hydride. Or maybe C is a metal nitride. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think about the reaction where C (bright red) could be a sulfide. For example, CdS is bright yellow, but maybe another compound. Wait, perhaps it's a different kind of sulfide.

Wait, another approach: since when C reacts with water, it produces two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). So F could be H2SO4 (strong acid) and G could be H2S (weak acid). So if C is a sulfide, like FeS, but then reacting with water might not yield H2SO4. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, let me think about the second reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of D (Cl2) to form E, which is extremely hazardous. Cl2 is a strong oxidizing agent. So perhaps C is a sulfide, and when it reacts with Cl2, it undergoes a reaction to form SO2 or SCl2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: since D is Cl2, and B is H2, and H is HCl, maybe C is a metal sulfide. So for example, suppose A is a metal, like Fe. Then, when A reacts with H2 (B) under certain conditions, perhaps it forms a metal hydride, but that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal oxide, and reacts with hydrogen to form a metal, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal oxide, and when it reacts with H2 (B), it forms the metal and water. But in that case, product C would be the metal, which might not explain the reaction with Cl2.

Alternatively, maybe A is a higher oxidation state metal, and B is hydrogen. For example, let's say A is a sulfate, like CuSO4. Then, reacting with H2 in large amounts might not fit. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal oxide, like Fe3O4, which reacts with H2 to form Fe and water. But then C would be Fe, which when reacted with Cl2 would form FeCl3, but I'm not sure if that matches the information.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product E. E is formed when C reacts with Cl2 (D). So if C is a metal, then E would be a chloride. But E is extremely hazardous. Hmm, perhaps E is phosgene or something like that, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the reaction where C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. Let's say F is H2SO4 (strong acid) and G is H2S (weak acid). So if C is a sulfide, like FeS, then when it reacts with water, it would produce Fe^2+ and HS^-. But that doesn't form H2SO4. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite. So when C (sulfite) reacts with water, it forms sulfurous acid (H2SO3), which is a weak acid, but that doesn't fit with F being strong. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfate, but when it reacts with water, it doesn't produce H2SO4.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about the possible structures of E, which is the product of C reacting with Cl2. If E is something like SO2Cl2 (thionyl chloride?), but I'm not sure. Or perhaps E is a chlorinated compound with a certain symmetry.

Wait, another thought: perhaps E is SO2, which is a gas, but it's not extremely hazardous in that form. Or maybe E is ClO2, which is a strong oxidizing agent and is toxic. Alternatively, perhaps E is a chlorinated organic compound, but that might be overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe E is phosgene (COCl2), which is a highly toxic gas. But then, what would C be? If C is CO (carbon monoxide), but then reacting CO with Cl2 might not form phosgene. Alternatively, maybe C is some chlorinated compound.

Alternatively, perhaps E is ClO2, which is a strong oxidizer and dangerous. Let's see: if C is ClO, then reacting with Cl2 might not fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps E is something like SF6, but that's more of a stable gas and not formed from Cl2 and C.

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to outline what I know:

- B and D react in a 1:1 ratio to form HCl.

So B is H2, D is Cl2. Because H2 + Cl2 → 2 HCl.

In the first reaction, A reacts with 8 equivalents of B (H2) to form C. So A + 8 H2 → C.

What could A be? Maybe a metal that forms a hydride, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal oxide. For example, if A is Fe3O4, 8 H2 would reduce it to Fe and water. But then C would be Fe, which when reacted with Cl2 would form FeCl3. But FeCl3 is a solid, but I'm not sure about the symmetry.

Wait, but FeCl3 has a structure that is orthorhombic, but I don't know the symmetry group. Alternatively, maybe E is another compound.

Wait, perhaps I should think about another angle. If C reacts with Cl2 to form E, which is dangerous, and C also reacts with water to form two acids (F and G), with F being strong.

The strong acid F could be H2SO4, which would suggest that C has sulfate ions. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide. Let's say C is FeS. Then, reacting FeS with Cl2 would form FeCl2 and SCl2? But FeCl2 is greenish, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe FeS + Cl2 → FeCl3 and S. But then E would be FeCl3 and S? Wait, but the reaction of FeS with Cl2 would require Fe to be in a higher oxidation state. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. Since when C is treated with water, it produces F and G as acids. F is strong (like H2SO4), and G is weak (like H2S). So perhaps C is a sulfide, say CuS. Then, when CuS reacts with water, it doesn't produce H2S, but maybe if it's in acidic conditions, it would. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate. Wait, but then what would F and G be?

Wait, maybe C is a sulfonamide? No, that seems too specific.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, NH4NO3 decomposes to form N2O and water, but that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction of C with water. If C is a sulfide, like FeS, and when it reacts with water, it produces H2S (weak acid) and the metal hydroxide, which might not be an acid. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide, but that doesn't fit with the acid production.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a metal hydride, like NaH. When NaH reacts with water, it produces NaOH (strong base) and H2 gas. But that doesn't fit because F and G are acids, not base.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck here. Let me think about the possible structure of E, which is the product of C and Cl2. If E is something like SO2Cl2 (thionyl chloride), which is a liquid but can be toxic. The structure of SO2Cl2 is a trigonal planar molecule with a central sulfur atom. Its symmetry group would be D∞h, which is option C.

Wait, but wait. SO2Cl2 has a structure where the central sulfur is bonded to two Cl atoms and two O atoms. The molecule is planar, with Cl and O alternating around the central S. So it has a D∞h symmetry, which is option C.

But wait, how would that fit with the rest of the reactions? Let me backtrack.

If E is SO2Cl2, then C must be SO2. Because SO2Cl2 is formed when SO2 reacts with Cl2 in the presence of a catalyst, perhaps. Then, when SO2 (C) reacts with water, it forms H2SO3 (which is a weak acid, G) and H2SO4 (strong acid, F)? No, wait, that doesn't make sense because H2SO3 is a weak acid, and H2SO4 is a strong acid. But does SO2 react with water to form both? Or does it form H2SO3, which is a weak acid, but I'm not sure about the strong acid part.

Alternatively, perhaps C is SO3? Then, C + Cl2 would form SO2Cl2. But when C (SO3) reacts with water, it would form H2SO4, which is a strong acid, but where does G come from? Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another possibility: If C is S (elemental sulfur), then reacting with Cl2 would form SCl2 or SC2. But SCl2 is a liquid, but I'm not sure about its symmetry. Alternatively, when C is S, and reacts with Cl2, perhaps forms ClS Cl, which is SCl2. SCl2 has a structure with two Cl atoms and a central S. The molecule is linear, so its symmetry group is D∞h, same as SO2Cl2.

Wait, but if C is S (elemental sulfur), then when it reacts with water, it might not produce two acids. S is a solid and doesn't react much with water, but perhaps under certain conditions, it can form H2S and something else. Alternatively, maybe S is reacted with water under acid conditions, but that's not clear.

Wait, but earlier I thought B is H2 and D is Cl2. So, the first reaction is A +8 H2 → C. So, if C is S, perhaps A is a compound that upon reaction with H2 produces S. Alternatively, perhaps A is FeS, which upon reaction with H2 would form Fe and H2S, but that doesn't fit either.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to summarize:

- B is H2, D is Cl2.

- H is HCl.

- C is a product of A + 8 H2.

- C reacts with Cl2 to form E.

- C also reacts with water to form A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid).

Wait a minute, when C reacts with water, it forms A again. So A is a product of C and water. So perhaps A is something that is regenerated when C is hydrolyzed.

Wait, if C is a sulfide, and when it reacts with water, you get A (the original metal), H2S (G, weak acid), and the corresponding metal hydroxide. But the metal hydroxide wouldn't be an acid. Hmm. Maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfate. For example, if A is copper, and C is CuSO4. Then, CuSO4 reacting with water would form Cu(OH)2 and H2SO4. But Cu(OH)2 is a base, which would be a problem because F and G are acids. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps C is a nitride. For example, NH4NO3 is a nitride that can decompose, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a metal carbide. For example, CaC2 reacts with water to form acetylene and calcium hydroxide. But that doesn't produce acids.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider what F and G are. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. The most common strong acids are H2SO4, HNO3, HCl, etc. The weak ones could be H2S, H3PO4, etc.

If F is H2SO4 and G is H2S, then perhaps C is a sulfide that also contains sulfate ions? That seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe C is a compound that upon hydrolysis gives both.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfite. For example, if C is Na2SO3, then reacting with water would produce 2 NaOH and H2SO3. But NaOH is a base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester? No, that's probably overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed salt. For example, if A is a metal that forms both sulfate and sulfide when C is hydrolyzed. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe I should think about the first reaction again. A reacts with 8 H2 to form C. That suggests a reduction reaction. So perhaps A is a higher oxidation state compound, and C is the reduced form.

For example, if A is Fe3O4, then reacting with H2 would form Fe and water. So C would be Fe. Then, Fe reacts with Cl2 to form FeCl3, which is E. Is FeCl3 extremely hazardous? Well, it's toxic, but I'm not sure if it's extremely hazardous. Also, when Fe (C) reacts with water, it would form Fe(OH)2 or Fe(OH)3, which are hydroxides, not acids. Hmm, that doesn't fit with F and G being acids.

Wait, maybe A is a metal oxide. For example, Al2O3 reacts with H2 to form Al and H2O. But then C is Al, which when reacted with Cl2 would form AlCl3. But AlCl3 is a Lewis acid, but when Al reacts with water, it forms Al(OH)3 and H2, which would be a base and a gas. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about E's structure. If E is SO2Cl2, which has a structure where a central sulfur is connected to two Cl atoms and two O atoms in a seesaw arrangement? Wait, no, SO2Cl2 has a trigonal planar structure with the central S, two Cl, and two O. So the molecule is planar with a mirror plane and a center of inversion. Its symmetry group is D∞h. So if E is SO2Cl2, then the symmetry group is D∞h, which is option C.

But to get SO2Cl2, C would have to be SO2. So when C (SO2) reacts with Cl2 (D), perhaps in the presence of a catalyst, it forms SO2Cl2. Then, when SO2 (C) reacts with water, it would form H2SO3 (a weak acid, which could be G) and maybe H2SO4 (F) if in certain conditions. But does SO2 reacting with water produce both? I'm not sure because SO2 + H2O → H2SO3 (which is a weak acid), but under certain conditions, H2SO3 can further react to form H2SO4, but that requires more H2O and perhaps heat. Hmm, but the problem states that C reacting with water gives A plus two acids F and G. So perhaps when SO2 (C) reacts with water, it produces H2SO3 (G) and something else. Alternatively, maybe it's more about the initial reaction of A.

Wait, maybe A is H2SO4. Then, A reacts with H2 (B) in the first reaction to form C. So 8 equivalents of H2 reacting with H2SO4. But H2SO4 reacting with H2 would require a catalyst, perhaps, and could produce water and sulfur. Wait, but that's more of a decomposition reaction. Alternatively, perhaps A is H2SO3, which reacts with H2 to form H2S and H2O. But that doesn't fit with the product being SO2 (C).

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think of E as SO2Cl2. So, the symmetry group would be D∞h. So the answer would be option C. But I'm not entirely certain about the rest of the reactions, but given the options, D∞h seems plausible for E.


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction of A with B (H₂):** Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of hydrogen gas (H₂) to form bright red product C. This suggests a reduction reaction where A is likely in a higher oxidation state.

2. **Reaction of C with D (Cl₂):** C reacts with 2 equivalents of chlorine gas (Cl₂) to form E, described as extremely hazardous. This indicates that E is likely a chlorinated compound with toxic properties.

3. **Reaction of C with water:** C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong acid) and G (weak acid). This implies that C contains functional groups that can hydrolyze into these acids.

4. **Reaction of B (H₂) and D (Cl₂):** B and D react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, identified as HCl. This confirms that B is H₂ and D is Cl₂.

From this information, E is hypothesized to be SO₂Cl₂ (thionyl chloride), a highly toxic and hazardous compound. SO₂Cl₂ has a planar trigonal structure with a central sulfur atom bonded to two chlorine atoms and two oxygen atoms. This structure exhibits a **D∞h molecular symmetry group**, which matches option C.

The reasoning aligns with the properties of SO₂Cl₂, its formation from SO₂ (C) and Cl₂ (D), and its symmetry. Thus, the molecular symmetry group of E is **D∞h**.

Answer: C
