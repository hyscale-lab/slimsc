Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about the uncertainty principle and estimating the minimum uncertainty in the energy of an electron. Hmm, let me think.

Alright, the problem says that an electron is moving along the x-direction with a speed v of 2e8 m/s. The uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE. The options are given in powers of ten, so I guess an approximate calculation is needed here.

Wait, I remember something about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It says that the product of the uncertainties in position and momentum must be at least on the order of Planck's constant divided by 4π. The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Or wait, sometimes it's written as Δx Δp ≈ ħ/2, but for minimum uncertainty, maybe I can use Δx * Δp = ħ/2. Yeah, since the question asks for the minimum uncertainty, I'll use that equality.

So, first, I need to find Δp. Because once I have that, I can relate it to the uncertainty in energy ΔE. But wait, how does ΔE come into play here? I remember that the uncertainty in energy is related to the uncertainty in momentum because E depends on p. Since the electron is moving, its kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron.

So, maybe the uncertainty in energy ΔE is approximately (Δp²)/(2m). That makes sense because if p is uncertain by Δp, then E will be uncertain by about that squared term. Let me write that down.

First, find Δp. Using the uncertainty principle:

Δx * Δp = ħ/2 → Δp = ħ/(2 Δx)

So I need the values for ħ and Δx. Oh wait, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. And Δx is 0.1 nm, which is 0.1e-9 meters.

Let me plug in the numbers:

Δp = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 0.1e-9 m)
Calculating the denominator: 2 * 0.1e-9 = 0.2e-9 = 2e-10.

So Δp = 1.0545718e-34 / 2e-10 ≈ (1.0545718 / 2) * 1e-24 ≈ 0.527e-24 → approximately 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, wait, let me compute that more accurately. 1e-34 divided by 2e-10 is (1e-34)/(2e-10) )= (1/(2)) * 1e-24. So 1/2 is 0.5, so 0.5e-24 is 5e-25. So Δp ≈ 5.27e-25 kg·m/s. Close enough for estimation.

Now, the mass of the electron is about 9.10938356e-31 kg. So the kinetic energy K is (p²)/(2m).

But since we're looking for the uncertainty in energy, ΔE, which would be approximately (Δp²)/(2m). Let me calculate that.

ΔE ≈ ( (5.27e-25)^2 ) / (2 * 9.109e-31 )

Calculating numerator: (5.27e-25)^2 = (approx) 27.77e-50 → 2.777e-49.

Denominator: 2 * 9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30.

So ΔE ≈ (2.777e-49) / (1.8218e-30) ≈ (2.777 / 1.8218) ) * 1e-19 → 1.524e-19 J.

Wait, 2.777 divided by 1.8218 is roughly 1.524. So 1.524e-19 J.

Looking at the options, option C is ~1e-19 J. So the closest is option C, which is 1e-19 J.

But wait, perhaps my estimation for Δp was a bit off. Let me double-check the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider relativistic effects because v is 2e8 m/s, which is a significant fraction of the speed of light (which is about 3e8 m/s). Wait, 2e8 m/s is about 0.666 times the speed of light. So the non-relativistic calculation might not be accurate. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, the problem gives v=2e8 m/s. That's about 67% the speed of light. So the kinetic energy can't be treated as non-relativistic. Oh, but wait, the uncertainty in momentum is small compared to the momentum itself, so perhaps the relativistic approach isn't necessary for the uncertainty.

Alternatively, let me think about it: the momentum p is m*v. So m=9.1e-31 kg, v=2e8 m/s.

p = 9.1e-31 * 2e8 = 1.82e-22 kg·m/s. Wait, but my Δp was 5.27e-25 kg·m/s. So the uncertainty is about 5.27e-25 / 1.82e-22 ≈ 0.029 or about 2.9% of the momentum. Hmm, that's a relatively small percentage. So maybe non-relativistic is okay.

But if the speed is a significant fraction of c, the kinetic energy is not just p²/(2m). The exact expression for relativistic KE is (gamma -1) mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But in terms of p, the kinetic energy can be written as sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 ) - mc².

But for small Δp compared to p, perhaps the uncertainty in energy can be approximated using the derivative. Because ΔE ≈ (dE/dp) * Δp.

E is the total energy, which is sqrt( p²c² + m²c^4 ). So dE/dp = (p c²) / sqrt( p²c² + m²c^4 ) ) = (p c²) / E.

Wait, but that might complicate things, perhaps the non-relativistic approach is still valid for the uncertainty. Alternatively, using the non-relativistic approximation for ΔE would suffice, given that Δp is small
