Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I remember from my studies that particles in such a well have quantized energy levels. The question is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

Okay, let's think. Each particle is a spin-1/2, so they can have spins up or down. But wait, in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the particles are subject to the Pauli exclusion principle because they are fermions. That means no two particles can have the same set of quantum numbers. So each particle has to occupy a unique quantum state, considering their spin.

The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite well are given by the formula E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²). Oh wait, the problem defines E as E = π²ħ²/(2mL²), so each E_n is just n² times E. So E_1 = 1²E = E, E_2 = 4E, E_3=9E, E_4=16E, and so on.

Now, since we have four particles, all spin-1/2, each can occupy the same spatial state but with opposite spins, up to two per spatial state. Because for each spatial level n, there's a spin-up and spin-down possibility, allowing two particles per n.

Wait, no, wait. Spin is a separate degree of freedom. So each spatial state can have two particles with opposite spins. So for each n, we can have two particles in that state.

But wait, each particle is a fermion, so their overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric. So for identical particles, when you swap two, the wavefunction changes sign. But since the particles are spin-1/2, which are fermions, the total wavefunction (spatial part × spin part) must be antisymmetric.

Hmm, but when considering the ground state and excited states, the spatial wavefunction will be symmetric or antisymmetric? Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should model the filling of the states.

Since each particle is spin-1/2, each can have two possible spin states for each spatial orbital. So in the ground state, what's the lowest possible energy arrangement?

The ground state would have the lowest
