Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it carefully. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst and figuring out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene.

Hmm, first, I think I should understand what racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is. Racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers, right? So the molecule has a chiral center, and the two enantiomers are present equally. Wait, in 3-methylpent-1-ene, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But wait, with a methyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait, pentene is five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2? Wait, maybe better to draw it.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So 3-methyl would have a methyl branching on the third carbon. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2? Wait, that doesn't add up. Let me count the carbons. 1, 2, 3,
